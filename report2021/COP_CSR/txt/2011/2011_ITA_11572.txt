In fact, the Financial Year ended without Letter of Introduction any dividends being distributed due to both internal and external factors. This derived, on the one hand, from trends on the deregulated energy market (production and sale), increased funds earmarked in view of careful appreciation in tax-related risks deriving from previous Financial Years and the considerable amount paid by Acea, like other “former municipal companies”, to recover State benefits linked to the socalled “tax moratory” and, on the other, from effects of the trend in the country’s economy. The year 2009 should however be considered in terms of the prospects for lasting growth of the Group and therefore undoubtedly positive: in fact, Acea celebrated one hundred years of activity in 2009, which represented an occasion to strengthen its innate values in the knowledge of the contribution made by the Company with its 100-year long history of industry, development and respect throughout the Roman territory and to highlight its involvement in community life. Over the year, we carried out actions in important areas of corporate life, analyzing and renewing the main operational processes in need of improvement in terms of performance and encouraging an increase in developments underway by way of recovering the company’s profitability. Corporate governance underwent extensive reorganization leading to approval of a new macro-level organization for the Parent Company according to industrial areas in order to reinforce its role as leader of the entire Group while improving its system of in-house regulations and preparing new and updated policies, for example with respect to Quality, where there is an increased need for integrated responsibility from economic, social and environmental viewpoints and with respect to Protection in order to safeguard both the material and immaterial assets of the Company. Investments considerably increased with respect to the previous Financial Year (+24%) and particularly concerned Energy Networks and Energy and the Environment (Waste-To-Energy facilities), which highlight the Company’s motivation concerning growth and development in business through an industrial project in line with the principles of sustainable development. Confident in the existence of positive specific implications between corporate social responsibility and safety management, particular attention was paid to the safety of workers through monitoring the reliability of the company’s system for safety in the workplace in both the Parent Company and the main operational companies and increasing specific training activities. Training for Human Resources essential to ensuring improved skills involved 483 training courses in 2009 (+34% with respect to the previous year). Considerable commitment from human resources and organizational efficiency from the Company in the Energy and Water sectors led to objective improvements in technical and commercial service performances, which were also positively received by customers, as demonstrated by specific Customer Satisfaction Surveys. Furthermore, a number of channels providing contact with customers were also developed to further improve corporate performance. 4 Commitment to limiting impact on the environment led to decreased direct and indirect energy consumption, a considerable increase, over the last three years, in the indicator concerning territorial protection (expressed in terms of the ratio between kilometres of high-voltage underground and overhead lines) and preservation of the limited levels of specific CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, also due to modern combined-cycle generation facilities. With regard to the above, Acea was reported as the best Utility Company in Europe in the latest report published by the Carbon Disclosure Project, an accredited international project responsible for assessing the economic and environmental performances of companies by comparing the specific CO2 emissions and corporate turnover. The Company’s responsibility towards the environment is also demonstrated through specific initiatives implemented to support biodiversity and the care taken in safeguarding sources and is further highlighted by the prospects for development of new businesses involving environmental topics. In 2009, energy produced by renewable sources already increased considerably (around +42%), especially from wind (+ 64% with respect to the previous year), and commitment in the area concerning waste revaluation also increased (environmental services, production of WDF and compost, Waste-To-Energy): throughout the year, around 97,000 tons of pulper and 77,600 tons of WDF were transformed from Waste-To-Energy and thereby benefitted the territory thanks to considerable reduction in waste sent to dumps (around 25% of the amount burned in facilities). More specifically, the Waste-To-Energy Facility in San Vittore in the Lazio region plays a leading role in solid urban waste treatment and will become a reference point for WasteTo-Energy transformation of dried mud deriving from purification of urban wastewater. In fact, in 2009 San Vittore del Lazio was given the PIMBY Award – Please In My Back Yard – for the expansion of the Waste to Energy Facility managed by Acea Group company “EALL”, thereby indicating Acea as a virtuous company in terms of providing accurate information and environmental communication and involving those that represent territorial interests. The systems for qualifying suppliers adopted by the Group are under constant development and help to ensure high quality in the services provided. The important economic effect that the Company has on the local economy is also important to note, with 92% of the overall amount of work contracted in 2009 going to companies from Central Italy. The Group’s specific commitment in terms of sustainability performance, demonstrated through this Twelfth Edition Report, is paid increasing attention outside the Company, which continues to receive excellent reviews from those responsible for analyzing Ethical Finance. Furthermore, in 2009 Acea was one of the four Italian companies to receive the “CEEP-CSR Label” for 2009-2010 for its commitment to social and environmental responsibility, an important award promoted by the European Commission. Finally, in 2009 Acea renewed its formal compliance with the principles of Global Compact, considering these fully in line with its corporate values. The Company is thereby continuing under the prospect of a revival, without overlooking the well-defined direction concerning integrated corporate responsibility. Chief Executive Officer Chairman Marco Staderini Giancarlo Cremonesi 5 Guidelines Communicating Sustainability: Procedure Acea’s Sustainability Report is published each year in order to provide Stakeholders a clear and complete overview of the Group’s economic, social and environmental performances1. This year’s report for Financial Year 2009 is the twelfth edition since Acea specifically undertook to ensure social responsibility, deciding to give proof of this undertaking through a specific report (the first socioenvironmental report was made for Financial Year 1998). Acea’s 2009 Report contains both consistent and new elements with respect to last year’s: as occurred for the 2008 Report, this Report has been drawn up according to the reporting principles and performance indicators established in the GRI-G3 Guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)2 and, for the first time, such indicators have been integrated by those set forth in the Electric Utilities Sector Supplement published by GRI in 2009. In line with past years, Acea has supplemented presentation of the economic performances with figures relating to Establishing and distributing Added Value among Stakeholders, according to the principles expressed by the Study Group for the Social Report (GBS)3, and has drawn up Environmental Accounts attached to this report on a CD, which provide a detailed account of the physical streams generated by the activities of the Group4, through analysis of the life cycle of its products (LCA Life Cycle Assessment). Since 2007, Acea has been involved in the Global Compact (GC) initiative, acknowledging full coherence between the ten principles supported by the United Nations through the “Global Pact” and the ethical guidelines established in its code of values. The Company has since confirmed its support, with commitment from the top management, and regularly published the required Communication on Progress (CoP). This year the Company has decided to directly include a Table of Association between GRI Indicators and the Global Compact Principles in addition to independent publication of the CoP and in view of the close cooperation between Global Compact and GRI. Report Content and Structure The contents of this Report aim to fulfil the expectations of stakeholders in terms of information in a clear and balanced way and are provided according to the indications provided in GRI-G3 Guidelines appropriately referred to the Company’s business situation and socio-economic context. In order to identify the aspects on which to provide greater information, the type of stakeholders, legal nature of the Company (Parent Company – Acea SpA – is listed on the Stock Exchange) and relations between the Holding Company and other companies in the Group, the corporate mission (Acea is a Utility), operational sectors of the Group (energy and water)5 and the country – Italy – in which most operations are carried out were all taken into account. The figures and information provided in the 2009 Sustainability Report made it possible to report on the standard elements and performance indicators established in the GRI-G3 Guidelines (core and additional) and the Sector Supplement at the highest level of application (A+) (see Chart 1 and Table 1). 1 As defined hereunder, see also Stakeholders section. 2 The Global Reporting Initiative was established in England in 1997 by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES). It became an independent official centre in 2002 in order to support the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and cooperates on the Global Compact Project (organized by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan). GRI-G3 Guidelines are also available in Italian at www.globalreporting.org; they illustrate the reporting principles to adopt when drawing up sustainability reports and the economic, social and environmental indicators to publish. The Electric Utilities Sector Supplement published by GRI in 2009 is available online. 3 The Study Group for the Social Report comprises experts and scholars from the sector. This Group has operated in Italy since 1998 and, in 2001, formally became a Non-profit Research Association. In May 2001, it published the Principles for writing a Social Report which became the first basic guidelines for social reports for many Italian companies. Although Acea subsequently decided to adopt international guidelines (i.e. GRI), it decided to continue to refer to GBS, especially in relation to creating and distributing added value among stakeholders (see specific section in Corporate Identity) and the accurate description of exchanges between the Company and various Stakeholders (see Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders). 4 The same method introduced to calculate environmental figures generated by companies operating in the energy sector in 2008 was used for 2009, which takes into account shareholdings of Acea SpA, as adopted for the Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 See Group Profile. 6 Table 1 – LEVEL OF GRI-G3 GUIDELINE APPLICATION APPLICATION C C+ B B+ A A+ LEVEL Report on: Report on all criteria Same as requirement listed for level C plus: for Level B 1.1 G3 PROFILE 2.1-2.10 1.2 output 3.1-3.8 3.9, 3.13 DISCLOSURES 3.10-3.12 4.5-4.13 4.1-4.4 4.16-4.17 4.14-4.15 REPORT EXTERNALLY ASSURED REPORT EXTERNALLY ASSURED REPORT EXTERNALLY ASSURED STANDARD DISCLOSURE Management Management Approach Disclosures Approach G3 for each Indicator Disclosures for each output MANAGEMENT Not Required Category Indicator Category APPROACH DISCLOSURES G3 Report on a Report on a minimum Report on each core PERFORMANCE minimum of 10 of 20 Performance G3 and Sector INDICATORS & Performance Indicators, at least Supplement Indicator Indicators, including one from each of: with due regard to output SECTOR at least one from Economic, the Materiality SUPPLEMENT each of: Economic, Environmental, Principle by either: PERFORMANCE Social and Human rights, Labor, a) reporting on the INDICATORS Environmental Society, Product indicator or b) Responsibility explaining the reason for its omission Chart 1 – LEVEL OF GRI-G3 GUIDELINE APPLICATION IN THE 2009 ACEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Descriptions and figures concerning Group activities have also been provided to thoroughly fulfil the expectations concerning information of stakeholders and to give a full description of the Company’s features. The same structure has been used for the 2009 Sustainability Report as for the previous edition: the volume combining the main parts of the report comprises three sections: Corporate Identity, Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders and Environmental Issues, integrated by the Environmental Accounts attached on a CD and again has a separate brochure providing Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas (see Chart 2). COMMUNICATING SUSTAINABILITY: PROCEDURE 7 Chart 2 – 2009 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT STRUCTURE Corporate Identity Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Environmental Issues Environmental Accounts attached on CD Rom Report Scopes “Report Scopes”, or the areas covered in this report, were established according to the Guidelines adopted, without omitting any significant information or figures and seeking to provide a clear overview of the elements in the Group (see section Group Profile). The wider scope considered – standard in relation to economic figures – comprises Acea SpA and all the other companies falling within the scope of consolidation, as established in the 2009 Consolidated Financial Statements6. Any time this scope changes, according to the effective availability of figures (in relation to progressive Central management of such), this is specified and appropriately indicated in the report7. The area reflecting the main economic, social and environmental performances of the Group – represented by the Holding Company and main spin-off companies operating in the water and energy sectors (including the Waste-To-Energy sector), was regularly subjected to reporting to ensure comparison with the sustainability performances published in the previous report. Nevertheless, year by year Acea seeks to extend its report scope to increasingly reflect the Group’s dimension. Box – Definitions and Scope “Acea Group”, “Acea”: these refer to all the companies that fall currently are AceaElectrabel, AceaElectrabel Produzione, within the scope of consolidation, including Acea SpA.

Data Retrieval System and Reliability The figures and information published in the Sustainability Report are provided by the Divisions in question and are, as far as possible, in line with official sources (such as Management Reports from individual 6 2009 Consolidated Financial Statements are available at www.acea.it (section Shareholders). 7 In several cases, the scope for the sections Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders and Environmental Issues, will not coincide with the consolidation area despite the fact it refers to the main companies in the Group, as not all figures (e.g. those referring to Human Resources or Suppliers) are aggregated and managed Centrally. Such changes to scope are always indicated in the report. 8 companies, Corporate Governance Report, Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, the reports sent to sector Authorities). These are subsequently integrated and assessed through discussions between the inhouse workgroup responsible for writing the Sustainability Report and the Divisions directly involved, before being definitively approved. If necessary, the figures are re-processed or re-classified according to the guidelines adopted. Prior to publication, the report is sent for appraisal by an Independent Auditing Company with which Acea has no joint interests or ties. This Auditing Firm is appointed to examine the contents and procedures used to write the report and to provide an overall opinion of its clarity, completeness and transparency. More specifically, in 2009 this audit concerned the main parts of the Sustainability Report: Corporate Identity, Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders, Environmental Issues and Environmental Accounts, attached on a CD, which illustrate the indicators established in GRI-G3 Guidelines and the Sector Supplement (see Report from Independent Auditor’s Report). In conclusion, the 2009 Sustainability Report was submitted for approval by Acea SpA’s Board of Directors. Measurement Systems Social and environmental quantitative data has been produced as follows: • where possible, through direct measurement of the parameters concerning the elements subject to reporting; • in other cases, through calculation or estimation of the values of the parameters according to the best information available. Each item of environmental data is commented on in the Explanatory Notes to the Environmental Accounts, specifying whether it derives from calculation, measurement or estimate.

He appealed to world economy leaders to support the 9 universal principles concerning human rights, work and the environment; in 2004 a tenth principle was added: the fight against corruption. The network of organizations and companies supporting this initiative has grown ever since; Acea signed the ten principles in 2007, renewing its commitment year after year. The companies involved are required to write a Communication on Progress Report concerning the progress made and initiatives undertaken or to illustrate compliance between the principles of Global Compact and GRI Indicators in their Sustainability Report in order to better illustrate their corporate citizenship. This year, Acea has decided to illustrate its compliance through a Table of Association.

This Law therefore establishes a “transit period” by which local This new law definitively establishes public tenders as the authorities are required to either hold a Tender or to part with a standard procedure for commissioning private companies and percentage shareholding in the management company, whether partnerships of public and private companies to manage such such are “in-house”, mixed or listed companies. An alternative services as long as the private partner in the latter type of solution is advance termination of the commissions underway. company holds no less than 40% of the share capital and is Municipalities and other shareholding local authorities are responsible for specific operational duties. Taking into account responsible for making the decisions by way of applying this this procedure, the possibility for in-house companies (100% reform. More specifically with regard to Acea, Rome City public share capital) to manage these services is only permitted Council – which holds 51% of the share capital – is required to as an exception due to outstanding circumstances and further to decide whether to progressively part with 11% by June 2013 a decision from the Authority for Competitiveness and the and a further 10% by 31 December 2015 or to allow the Market.

In September 2009, the Ministry issued a Decree to implement By means of Italian Law 13/2009 and further to this Sentence, that established by the Law. As far as the potential economic the Legislator introduced a definition whereby said portion of the effects of repayments that water companies in the Acea Group water treatment rate became part of the overall process to may be required to settle once the appropriate calculations, prepare the service in question, in other words covered “design procedures and deadlines have been established by the and installation or completion of treatment plants, as well as Authorities are concerned, the Company has estimated that the those linked to relative investments”. Company shall be required to pay a maximum of 38.1 million This provision therefore established the procedures and euro. GROUP PROFILE 29 General Economic Indicators Further to the economic slump at the national and international level last year, the situation in 2009 remained difficult and inevitably affected companies. This Company was faced with complicated circumstances of both internal and external origin. In relation to the former, Acea underwent extensive reorganization and had to overlook the difficult negotiations with partner Gas de France Suez further to change in the top management. External factors were represented by the limits deriving from the specific macro-level economic scenario in which Italy’s GDP fell by 4.9% compared with the year before, affecting all economic sectors and causing a decrease in demand for energy. In view of the above context, the characteristic governance of the Group – which was positively influenced by a number of extraordinary events in 2008 – was affected by the negative performance on the energy market (production and sales), although this was counterbalanced by the results achieved in other industrial areas. The end result was that gross operating margin reduced by around 10 percent with respect to 2008. In view of this financial statement result and including the extraordinary taxes and increased reserves, the latter of which also deriving from increased investments, the Group made gross losses of 52.5 million euro. In 2009, consolidated revenue amounted to 2,954.3 million euro, a decrease of 6% with respect to the 3,144 million in 2008. This negative variation was mainly due to energy generation and sales by AceaElectrabel, which were affected by reduction in the amount of electricity produced due to episodes of plant unavailability and a significant decline in demand throughout the year. The gross operational margin (EBITDA) amounted to 563.9 million euro, having decreased by 59.6 million with respect to the 623.5 million for the previous year (-9.6%). Excluding a number of positive non-recurring components, EBITDA decreased by 33.5 million euro. This deterioration confirms that illustrated in relation to revenue and is basically due to the performance of energy production and sales, which EBITDA reduced by 24.7 million euro (from 99.6 million in 2008 to 74.9 million euro). The ratio between the relative industrial area (energy market) and the overall Group’s EBITDA consequently decreased while the other operational areas were positive. This further decline in the operating margin is explained by the extraordinary payment made to encourage the top management to leave in 2009, amounting to 6.7 million euro.

With regard to the General Shareholders’ Meeting, a significant event occurred in 2009 whereby the mechanism for voting the list19 to elect members of Corporate Boards was extended to the public shareholder – which, in the case of Acea, is Rome City Council –, revoking its possibility of making a direct appointment20. To this regard, it must be noted that a specific Shareholders’ Meeting held prior to the Meeting in which the 2009 Financial Statement was approved introduced an amendment to the Articles of Association concerning election of Board Members, establishing a proportionate system for appointing Board Members according to the number of votes received by the minority lists. The skills and qualifications of Board candidates are made public through publication of their CVs in the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structures. By way of encouraging participation from employee shareholders, specific areas have been set aside for notifying and collecting proxies. There are no agreements of any kind among shareholders, nor are there any special vetoing powers or other extraordinary influence over decisions and, according to the Articles of Association, shareholders other than Rome City Council or its subsidiaries with shares exceeding 8% of the share capital may not exercise the right to vote pertaining to shares exceeding such limit21. Acea’s Internal Audit System involves a number of structured elements (boards, rules and procedures, tools) whose responsibility is to: prevent or limit any negative consequences that may derive from unexpected results from corporate operations, ensure that operational targets are achieved (efficiency and effectiveness, safeguarding corporate assets), warrant Company’s compliance with the Law and applicable standards and to oversee correct and transparent information both within and outside the company. 19 According to the Articles of Association, presenting lists of candidates is the right of shareholders holding – alone or jointly – at least 1% of share capital with voting rights. 20 By way of compliance with the coming into force of Italian Law 34/08 amending Article 2449 of the Italian Civil Code (Companies with Equity Held by the State or Public Enterprises), Article 15 of the Articles of Association has been modified, along with a transitory provision to be applied prior to renewal of the Board of Directors in 2010. 21 Acea SpA holds around 0.2% of its own shares, for which the right to vote is suspended to the effects and purposes of Article 2357-ter of the Italian Civil Code. 44 The system encompasses the entire business structure, involving the following parties for various purposes: Corporate Identity the Board of Directors, which establishes the guidelines for the Internal Audit System with the Internal Audit Committee in order to identify, measure, manage and monitor the main risks for Acea and Group companies. The Board of Directors also holds the power to appoint and withdraw the more important parties involved in the System: the CEO, as supervisor of the Internal Audit System, the Officer for Internal Audits and the Director responsible for drawing up corporate accounts. the Internal Audit Committee, whose rightful members include not only appointed Board Members, but also the Chairman, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors, is the most important element of the entire Internal Audit System, supporting the Board of Directors in outlining the system’s policies and ensuring satisfactory preliminary work is carried out to support the decisions to be made. Moreover, this Committee supports the Board of Directors in assessments concerning relations with the Independent Audit Company and defining the procedures for approving and implementing operations auctioned by Acea with relative parties. This Committee met seventeen times throughout 2009. the Committee for Remuneration, which presents proposals concerning the remuneration for Board Members with proxies and those with particular roles to the Board of Directors, assesses the criteria adopted for paying managers with strategic responsibilities and proposes satisfactory bonuses for these and top management.

This Board reports to the Chairman and is not responsible for operational activities. The director of the Audit Department has been made responsible for internal auditing and is therefore required to verify that the system is adequate through independent audits and to express an opinion on such adequacy, referring such opinions to the Internal Audit Committee, the Board of Statutory Auditors and the CEO.

This work involves regular reiteration of risk assessment, risk treatment and risk monitoring and ongoing interaction among the various parties involved through structured and continuous information. Operational companies are responsible for controlling impacts on the natural environment and identifying improvements, with coordination from the Holding Company. Readings and inspections for the water sector are carried out by LaboratoRI, whereas the main technological installations in the electricity sector are under the responsibility of Acea Distribuzione SpA. There is also a specific department responsible for technological innovation, which has the task of identifying new products of potential interest to the Group from the time of pre-competitive development. In view of the growing importance of Waste-To-Energy related activities in the Group and the attention paid by Acea in monitoring the relative operational processes, it is important to highlight the Audit Plan carried out in 2009 within Enercombustibili, EALL, Terni En.A. and SAO in relation to controlling incoming waste, WDF produced and emissions into the atmosphere.

STAKEHOLDERS AND SHARING ADDED VALUE 53 Establishing and Distributing Added Value Added value (Table 11) is basically the wealth generated by the Company over the year and is calculated as the difference between revenue and outside production costs. Revenue is mainly generated by services provided to “customers” and outside costs are those paid to suppliers, which are shown as a cost item for purchasing the commodities, works and services required for corporate operations. This figure is balanced in a breakdown of added value (Table 12), which indicates distribution of the wealth produced by Acea among its Stakeholders: employees, shareholders and financial backers, institutions, the Company and the community. On adopting this calculation procedure prepared by the Study Group for the Social Report, Acea wishes to highlight the economic effects that business management has on the main categories of stakeholders with whom relations focusing on sustainability and social responsibility exist. The added value created in 2009 decreased by 12.7% with respect to 1,014 million euro in 2008, reaching around 885 million euro. Distribution among stakeholders, considered in absolute value with respect to the year before, rewards institutions (+37.5% compared to 2008), the community (+20.1%) and employees (+15.7%), whereas the values for other stakeholders were negative (financial backers: -13.9% compared to 2008; company: 14.1%; shareholders: -96.2%).

GRI ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 63 CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY Reference Scope The economic figures (revenues) mentioned in this section were calculated according to the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore refer to consolidation; the figures concerning perceived quality, quality provided, customer care and communications refer to the operational companies mentioned case by case. The information concerning relations between Acea, customers and the community are provided together as the information concerning services provided refer to an area (Rome and relative province) in which the Stakeholders almost coincide27. The description of revenues from each segment in the energy and water supply chains – deriving from the Consolidated Financial Statement – and relating to customers for the electricity and water service refer to a wider catchment area. Chains and Revenues Energy Acea operates in each segment of the energy supply chain: production, distribution, efficiency and sales, some of which have been deregulated while others are regulated by the Authority for electricity and gas. With regard to generation, further to a few episodes of technical unavailability (faults or scheduled maintenance) and due to the trend in prices over the year, the amount produced by AceaElectrabel Produzione and Tirreno Power thermoelectric power stations reduced. Although generation considerably increased in hydroelectric stations and wind farms, this situation affected revenues for this segment, which amounted to 256.6 million euro in 2009 and meant a reduction of around 66 million euro with respect to 2008. Revenues from energy produced at Terni En.A. and EALL28 Waste-To-Energy Stations amounted to 32.2 million euro, a reduction of around 680 thousand euro with respect to the year before. With regard to electricity, considerable revenues came from marketing White Certificates29 (achieved through energy savings) and Green Certificates30 (energy produced from renewable sources), which amounted to 45.2 million euro – a considerable increase with respect to results of 25.4 million in 2008. 27 Most of the information refers to end users of the services in Rome and county. The Integrated Water Service is run by Acea Ato 2 in ATO 2 Central Lazio (comprising Rome and 111 other Municipalities). With regard to electricity, although deregulation ensures that customers are entitled to purchase energy from a different supplier, distribution (including almost all the quality elements of the service supplied) is the responsibility of Acea, which is also responsible for public lighting. Therefore, customers and the community are practically one and the same in this particular area. As far as the other areas in which Acea operates via subsidiary companies are concerned – especially for the Integrated Water Service reference should be made to the section Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas. 28 Terni En.A. and EALL belong to Acea Risorse e Impianti per l’Ambiente A.R.I.A.. In addition to Energy-To-Waste activities, this industrial group is responsible for solid urban waste treatment, recovery and disposal plants and dump management services. These additional activities for environmental protection – as well as the sewage treatment services provided by the Aquaser Group – were responsible for revenues of 26.2 million Euro in 2009, an increase of 1.2 million with respect to 2008. 29 White Certificates – more precisely Energy Efficiency Certificates (in Italian Titoli di Efficienza Energetica – TEE), certify fulfilment of energy saving targets gradually increasing over time pursuant to Ministerial Decrees dated 20 July 2004 for energy distributors. These certificates are issued by the Electricity Market Operator according to the certification of savings confirmed by the Electricity and Gas Authority and can be traded on the market (see Environmental Issues). 30 Green Certificates are a tool through which producers and importers of electricity using fossil sources comply with that established in Italian Legislative Decree No. 79/99 (Bersani Decree) and distribute an amount of energy deriving from renewable sources proportionate to the electricity produced (or imported) the year before. In fact, compliance with this obligation can also be ensured by “purchasing all or part of the equivalent share”, in other words “green certificates”. The Electricity Services Operator, further to application and having carried out the necessary checks, shall issue Green Certificates to energy producers and these can be traded on the market. 64 Distribution of electricity to users on the protected, eligible and safeguarded markets in the Municipalities Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders of Rome and Formello (see relative box) generated revenues of 294.4 million euro, an increase with respect to 276.8 million euro the year before. This amount is joined by the roughly 47 million euro of specific Company adjustment pursuant to sector regulations31. The public lighting operations for the Rome City Council generated revenues of 70.2 million euro, to which 7.3 million euro of revenue for cemetery lighting should be added. Sales of electricity to end users on the eligible and protected market32 reduced by around 140 million euro with respect to 2008, amounting to 1,134 million euro following the economic situation in 2009 which led to a fall in demand for electricity throughout the country. Gas sales slightly reduced (around 5.5 million less with respect to 2008), with revenues of around 234.9 million euro. Despite a reduction in gas sales by AceaElectrabel Elettricità companies (-31.6% with respect to 2008), sales by AceaElectrabel Trading increased considerably from 1,389 MSmc to 1,896 MSmc (+36.5%). Water Acea is nationwide leader in this sector, serving 14.5% of the Italian market. The results from management of the Integrated Water Service in 2009 were widely positive. All the companies operating in the areas served by Acea (Tuscany, Umbria, Lazio and Campania) improved with respect to 2008, bringing revenues for this sector to 667.2 million euro (with respect to 655 million euro the year before). The contribution from Nuove Acque (operating in ATO 4 – Alto Valdarno in Tuscany) should also be noted; this company was consolidated in the 2009 Financial Statement as of October. Finally, around 14 million euro in revenues generated by overseas companies should be added to waterrelated revenues from Group companies operating in Italy. In fact, Acea operates in Peru, Honduras, Colombia and the Dominican Republic through holdings in a number of water companies33. Acea Group Customers Electricity Service Customers As far as Italy is concerned, development in deregulation of the electricity market monitored by the Electricity and Gas Authority illustrated that 9.2% of households (4.7% as at 31/12/2008) and 20.8% of SMEs (15.2% in 2008)34 switched from the protected market to the liberalized market. According to figures released by the Electricity and Gas Authority for the end sales market for 200935, Acea is the third operator in Italy in terms of sales, with a market share of around 5% (it was fifth in 2008), the second operator for sales on the protected market (comprising mainly households and small enterprises), with a market share of 5.3%, and the sixth operator on the free market, with a share of 4.9%. Over the last three years, the trend concerning Acea customers on the protected market has progressively decreased (-3.8% with respect to 2008) and considerably increased on the deregulated market (+138.2%) (see Table 14). 31 This amount is recognized by the Electricity and Gas Authority as revenue integration to cover the costs paid by company in view of variables not pertaining to corporate governance. 32 AceaElectrabel Elettricità ended sales on the safeguarded market as of 1 May 2008 (2.9) 33 Revenue from overseas water management services count for around 2% of the overall water revenues. Overseas companies are mentioned in the Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas. 34 These statistics refer to points of withdrawal on the network, as represented in Electricity and Gas Authority figures available at www.autorità.energia.it. 35 Please see Annual Report on Service Status and Operations Carried Out, 2010 edition, available online at the Electricity and Gas Authority website CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 65 Box – “End users” of the Electricity Service Electricity service customers are divided into three categories, as 50 employees or connected to medium voltage supply) but described below: have not yet switched to the deregulated market.

Acea has been responsible for the Rome city water service for many years, progressively expanding its activities to become the leading operator also in other ATOs36 in the provinces of Rome and Frosinone (Lazio), the municipality of Pisa, Florence, Siena, Grosseto and, as of 2009, also in Arezzo (Tuscany) through subsidiary company Nuove Acque, the Sorrentina peninsular to Vesuvian towns in the provinces of Naples and Salerno (Campania) and around Perugia (Umbria). The Group also operates in a number of Latin American countries37. Perceived Quality Every year, Acea Group carries out Customer Satisfaction Surveys to monitor satisfaction in electricity, water38 and public lighting services provided by Acea, detect any problems and identify any improvements required with respect to both customers and the community. These surveys are coordinated by Acea SpA with support from operational companies which help this process from drawing up the relative questionnaires to presenting results and carried out with support from an expert outside company, selected further to public tender. 36 According to Law 36/1994, the so-called “Galli Law” reorganizing water services, national territory is divided into 92 ATOs, which take into account hydrochartic basins. With regard to ATOs in which Acea operates through subsidiary companies, please see the section dedicated to the main Group companies in Corporate Identity (pages 24-25). Details of water comapnies are published in the Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas. 37 More specifically, Acea operates in Peru, Honduras, Colombia and Dominican Republic through subsidiary companies. Please see Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas. 38 In relation to the water service and in addition to the surveys concerning Rome and other Municipalities in ATO 2 – Central Lazio, Acea SpA carried out surveys on service quality in other ATOs in which it operates through subsidiary companies, the results of which are illustrated in the specific fact sheets for such companies (please see Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas). 66 The 2009 surveys were conducted using a similar procedure39 to that adopted in previous years and Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders involved creation of specific indicators: • an overall opinion on the general quality of the service (expressed on a scale of 1 to 10); • general satisfaction indexes on the service as a whole and for individual service components (Customer Satisfaction Index – CSI, expressed on a scale of 1 to 100)40; • percentages for customer satisfaction concerning specific individual aspects – “quality factors” – within each service component.

The sample group comprised “domestic customers on the protected market” (living in Rome and Formello), “domestic customers on the deregulated market”, “customers with VAT registration numbers and business customers on the deregulated market”. The survey concerning “contact channels” involved customers selected through a “call back” procedure, in other words people who had called the free-phone numbers for sales or repairs a short time before the interview or had gone to the counter and authorized call-back. The overall opinion on the electricity service remained stable over the last three years. In 2009, 93% of those interviewed considered the service they received from sufficient to excellent (see Table 15).

CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 67 This survey covered 7 specific aspects of this service; a Customer Satisfaction Index was calculated (partial CSI, scale of 0-100) for each aspect, thereby leading to an overall Customer Satisfaction Index for the electricity service on a scale of 0-100). The results for the three-year period in question illustrate a positive trend in the overall opinion on the electricity service, considerable improvement in satisfaction with contact channels and basic stability in the other areas (see Chart 12).

These results demonstrate that the quality factors with a lower number of satisfied customers in 2009 involved billing and technical assistance, whereas those with the highest level of satisfaction particularly highlighted the courtesy of technicians sent to repair faults, the comprehensible nature of offers available at the website (www.aceaelectrabel.it) and continuous voltage supply. 41 The new factors assessed in 2009 are written in italics in table 16. 68 Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Table 16 – ELECTRICITY SERVICE: MAIN SATISFACTION INDICATORS FOR SPECIFIC ASPECTS (2009) % of customers who consider that service complies with or exceeds expectations below 75% 75% or over billing • speed in resolving billing problems 44% • bills clear and easy to understand 89.0% • billed amounts correct 89.0% • bills regularly sent 93.0% website • website easy to use 82.0% • range of online operations 87.0% • wide range of information available 88.0% • commercial offers easy to understand 93.0% technical service • repairs carried out promptly 65% • appointment times observed 87.0% • repairs carried out effectively 91.0% • technicians’ courtesy 99.0% counter • waiting times 82.0% • operators’ skill 87.0% • opening hours 89.0% • staff courtesy 89.0% commercial • problem-solving ability 81.0% free-phone number • waiting times 82.0% • time passing before line is free 83.0% • clear replies given 84.0% free-phone number • waiting times 82.0% for fault reports • clear replies given 87.0% • time passing before line is free 87.0% • staff courtesy 92.0% • free-phone number available 94.0% technical aspects • time required for resuming service 82.0% (supply) (scheduled interruption) • meters read regularly 87.0% • energy supply continuous 94.0% • energy voltage constant 94.0% • digital meters easy to use 95.0% NB:75% is the threshold above which an opinion is considered very good and below which is considered a problem. The items introduced in 2009 are shown in italics in the table. Water Service Assessment In order to survey the water service quality perceived by customers, 1,940 people living in Rome and Fiumicino were interviewed between June and July 2009. This survey involved households and apartment block administrators whereas the survey concerning “contact channels” involved customers selected through a “call-back” procedure, in other words people who had called the free-phone numbers or counters a short time before the interview and authorized call-back. The overall opinion on the water service was once again extremely positive in 2009: 98% of those interviewed expressed a vote ranging between sufficient and excellent (see Table 17). Table 17 – OVERALL OPINION ON WATER SUPPLY IN ROME (2007-2009) opinion marks (scale of 1-10) 2007 2008 2009 excellent 9 -10 44.7% 37.7% 39% good 8 32.8% 36.7% 38% sufficient 6-7 18.7% 20.8% 21% insufficient 1-5 3.8% 4.8% 2% overall average 8.35 8.16 8.3 CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 69 This survey covered 7 specific aspects of this service42; a Customer Satisfaction Index was calculated (partial CSI, scale of 0-100) (see Chart 13) for each component, thereby leading to an overall Customer Satisfaction Index for the water service on a scale of 0-100). The results illustrate more or less obvious improvement in each factor involved in the survey, with considerable appreciation for the technical aspects of this service (supply continuity), increased satisfaction with the commercial free-phone number and a marked improvement in satisfaction with the counter, which worsened in 2008 before returning to the level of satisfaction illustrated in 2007. Opinions concerning the website – assessed for the first time in 2009 – were also good. Table 18 illustrates the satisfaction indexes for specific aspects (quality factors) in each “component” in the water service, highlighting the percentage of customers who considered such aspects to “comply with” or “exceed expectations” (75% is the threshold between positive and negative opinions). The main problem related to times for both channels of contact and technical aspects in 2009 (time required for repairs, waiting times at counters and on the phone). Billing was the component that received the best opinions on the whole.

Public lighting Serice Assessment In 2009, the service quality for public lighting perceived by Romans was surveyed in June via 1,200 interviews; the sample group included people living in all districts in Rome, grouped into 2 larger areas – north and south Rome. The overall opinion slightly improved in the three-year period in question, with 81% of those interviewed providing votes ranging from sufficient to excellent (6 10) (see Table 19). The survey involved 3 specific aspects of the service, for each of which the partial Customer Satisfaction Index – CSI on a scale of 0 to 100 was calculated. These partial indexes were used to calculate an overall Customer Satisfaction Index (overall CSI for public lighting, on a scale of 0-100). The “technical aspects of the service” were classified according to aspects for which Acea’s work can be held responsible (service continuity, in other words no faults or blackouts in the area and in the city centre; Table 19 – OVERALL OPINION ON PUBLIC LIGHTING SERVICE IN ROME (2007-2009) opinion votes (scale of 1-10) 2007 2008 2009 excellent 9 -10 6.4% 5.9% 10% good 8 19.5% 20.1% 23% sufficient 6-7 53.9% 57.6% 48% insufficient 1-5 20.2% 16.4% 19% overall average 6.50 6.56 6.7 CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 71 lighting on and off times; incorporating poles with the surroundings; colour of lights) and aspects depending on other subjects (presence and extension of service; intensity of lighting in the street, on pavements, in parks and gardens; lighting for monuments and historical squares43) and illustrated separately on a chart. The results for 2009 illustrated with respect to 2008 a slight decline in the overall level of customer satisfaction, repairs and technical aspects that were not the responsibility of Acea, while the positive trend in relation to the telephone line for reporting faults and the technical aspects for which Acea was responsible with respect to the two previous years was confirmed (see Chart 14). The levels of satisfaction in the quality aspects of the service of each component illustrated in Table 20 and showing the percentage of customers that considered that these aspects “complied with or exceeded expectations” highlight the presence of problems in fault repairs and technical aspects for which Acea was not responsible, while demonstrating very positive opinions concerning the other aspects taken into account.

The intensity of lighting on streets, pavements and in gardens may be altered by outside factors, such as tree branches requiring pruning. 72 Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Quality Delivered A large number of factors contributed towards improving the quality of services, such as overseeing means of contact with customers, proficient staff training, as are technical operations to optimize infrastructures (networks and systems) and ongoing monitoring and control over products and processes. This commitment is renewed each year by the Company and partly assessed through parameters regulated by the reference Authority (such as the Electricity and Gas Authority and the Authority for ATOs) or established in service agreements and management contracts with local authorities: • quality standards concerning energy are established by the Electricity and Gas Authority and quality targets are also mentioned in the AceaElectrabel Elettricità Code of Commercial Conduct44; • with regard to public lighting, agreements between Acea and Public Administrations regulating the service also define quality parameters (Performance Standards); • as far as the water sector is concerned, the Service charter, User Regulations and other quality parameters established by Service Conventions regulating relations between company responsible for the service and Authorities for ATOs apply. The Company is obliged to comply with all quality parameters established by such Authorities for various aspects in the services provided and there are also bonuses for good performances and penalties in the event of failure to comply with relative standards. Customers may also be entitled to automatic rebates in the event of failure to comply with quality standards. By way of further guaranteeing the quality in planning, installing and carrying out maintenance on water and public lighting networks and systems, for some years now Acea SpA has implemented a Quality Management System according to UNI EN ISO 9001: 200045, which is overseen by a specific Division. The Acea SpA Quality Handbook46 describes the organizational and operational criteria to adopt in order to ensure that corporate conduct complies with the requirements established in UNI EN ISO 9001:2000 and the Quality Policy, which is an integral part of such Manual and shared with all employees through the intranet, highlights the importance in improving the quality of services and customer satisfaction. Quality in the Energy Sector The investments made to rationalize and improve the HV, MV and LV networks throughout Rome complies with the priorities established in Electricity Grid Roadmap and with the operating needs that came to light throughout the year. These works focussed on the efficiency and optimization of these infrastructures, more specifically by expanding cables (underground and overhead cables), modernizing and building new primary and secondary stations, including installation of safety and remote control equipment (see the main works carried out in Table 21 and box concerning “Sustainable Development” of the electricity grid in Environmental Issues, page 153). A specific Roadmap Project also focussed on improving the electricity service, particularly with respect to the technical aspects of power available and electricity supply continuity (reducing the length and frequency of blackouts) was implemented at the end of 2007 by an in-house Acea Distribuzione workgroup. The actions involved in the various stages of this Roadmap have already provided important results (see relative box). Furthermore, by way of ensuring quality, Acea Distribuzione implemented additional operational, technical and quality control systems, which above all involved establishment of a Worksite Inspection Workgroup to check the quality and safety in such workplaces (see box on Vendor Rating concerning these operations in Suppliers). The overall amount invested by Acea Distribuzione in 2009 was 112 million euro. 44 A full version of the Commercial Code of Conduct adopted by Acea Electrabel Elettricità, after consulting with Consumer and Customer Associations, can be seen online at www.aceaelecrabel.it 45 Acea is certified UNI EN ISO 9001:2000 for “designing, building, carrying out maintenance and restructuring Integrated Water Service management networks and systems”, and for “ designing, installing, carrying out maintenance and restructuring global and integrated public lighting system management networks and systems”, respectively managed by Acea Ato 2 and Acea Distribuzione. 46 The Acea SpA Quality Handbook is available on the corporate intranet and is regularly reviewed. The most recent version is dated January 2009. The Quality Policy, provided to all staff via the corporate intranet, was adopted in Acea in 1999 and is now an integral part of the Quality Handbook following review and updates. CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 73 Work to install digital meters for remote control continued: throughout the year, around 166,000 digital meters were installed, bringing the overall number to 1,334,000 operating meters as at 31/12/2009 (around 14% more with respect to 31/12/2008), in line with forecasts for 95% of customers with digital meters by the end of 2011.

On publishing the Consolidated Text Regulating the Quality in Electricity Distribution, Reading and Sales for Regulation Period 2008-2011 (Decision no. 333/07), the Electricity and Gas Authority commenced a new regulation period gradually introducing stricter and more extensive quality standards and establishing higher fines and penalties to encourage companies to continuously improve performances. The new elements gradually introduced shall be illustrated in this report in relation to the year in which they come into force. Two decisions made in 2008 (no. 164/08 and no. 201/08) integrated that already established through Decision no. 333/07 concerning the quality of sales and, more specifically, introduced amendments coming into force as of 1 July 2009 concerning the management of written complaints, establishing their type and introducing different procedures for calculations, thereby for the first time providing company’s the chance to autonomously bring to light sales performances, which is carried out by AceaElectrabel Elettricità (see Tables 25 and 27). In relation to distribution and reading – which in Acea is carried out by Acea Distribuzione – in 2009 a specific quality parameter concerning the punctuality range for all appointments with customers was introduced and the punctuality range was reduced from three to two hours for “personalized” appointments with customers; two specific quality levels regulating punctuality in communicating technical information between energy Distributor and Vendor were also introduced (see Table 24). With regard to the commercial quality of electricity service, the Authority established “specific” and “general”47 levels and payment of automatic rebates to customers in the event of failure to comply with “specific” standards. Every year, Acea forwards its results to the Authority for checking and, as established, to customers by attaching them to a bill. The tables below illustrate the commercial quality parameters (specific and general) established by the Authority and the performances of Acea Distribuzione, with regard to electricity distribution and reading, and of AceaElectrabel Elettricità, with regard to sales, providing a two-year comparison of results where possible. In 2009, in line with the last few years, all specific commercial quality levels indicated by the Authority in relation to distributing and measuring electricity were fulfilled on average, both in low voltage and medium voltage supplies. The average time required to provide services fell well within the established limits and the percentages for complying with deadlines approached 100% for 17 parameters out of 19 (see Table 22). The specific quality levels concerning technical information forwarded by Distributor to Vendor introduced this year were fulfilled by the deadline on average and at high percentage levels (see Table 24). With regard to general quality levels concerning electricity distribution and reading, the only standard for which the percentage of services to provide by the established deadline was not fulfilled was replying to written complaints/requests for information concerning readings (for both low and medium voltages), whereas all the other parameters were fully satisfied (see Table 26). The percentages for compliance with the general and specific commercial quality levels concerning sales (see Tables 25 and 27) were calculated according to the requests arriving in the second half of 2009 and fulfilled by 31 December, as established by relative standard. In relation to this, Acea Electrabel Elettricità would like to point out that the particularly high number of requests arriving in this period made it impossible for all to be fulfilled, thereby determining a situation that will affect performances for the 1st half of 2010. 47 “Specific Quality Standards” are the deadlines by which a specific service must be carried out by the subject responsible for such and determine payment of automatic compensation to customers in the event of non-compliance; “General Quality Standards” are the minimum percentage of services carried out by the relative deadline.

CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 79 The Authority also establishes “technical” quality parameters concerning supply continuity and a system of bonuses and penalties with the purpose of encouraging companies to improve services. Decision 333/07 and subsequent Decision 76/09 established stricter quality standards concerning electricity, introducing amendments that will gradually become effective. Current standards (length and number of blackouts for LV customers, lasting and extensive blackouts, individual blackouts for MV and HV customers) and the performances of Acea Distribuzione are illustrated in Tables 28-30). It must be pointed out that in view of the results achieved in terms of service continuity and in the event such are confirmed further to inspection by the Electricity and Gas Authority, Acea shall not be required to pay any penalties to the Authority in 2009, as already occurred in 2008. The indicators for 2008 and 2009 concerning the duration of blackouts to low voltage customers (divided according to concentration of inhabitants) can no longer be compared to the figures for 2007 following the changes to calculations introduced by the Authority: Table 28 therefore provides recalculated figures (in italics) in addition to the figures published by the Authority for 2007. The performances in 2009 highlight general improvement in all areas. Table 28 – ELECTRICITY CONTINUITY FOR LV CUSTOMERS: DURATION OF BLACKOUTS AND PERCENTAGE IMPROVEMENTS ((2007-2008: figures certified by Electricity and Gas Authority; 2009: provisional figures forwarded to Electricity and Gas Authority awaiting certification) comulative duration percentage improvement (long blackouts without notice due to company) per LV customer per year (recalculated figures) (minutes) 2007 2008 2009 2009 vs. 2007 2009 vs. 2008 high concentration 49.14 figures recalculated to the effects of Decision 333/07 48.16 49.36 43.26 -10.2% -12.4% medium concentration 88.67 figures recalculated to the effects of Decision 333/07 91.21 82.36 65.53 -28.2% -20.4% low concentration 143.35 figures recalculated to the effects of Decision 333/07 142.32 133.55 129.86 -8.8% -2.8% NB:the three areas have been established according to the level of concentration in resident population: over 50,000 inhabitants is “high concentration”; between 5,000 and 50,000 inhabitants is “medium concentration”, under 5,000 inhabitants is “low concentration”. The quality parameter for the average number of blackouts (number of blackouts per low voltage customer per year) takes into account both long blackouts (> 3 minutes) and short blackouts (< 3 minutes but over one second). Figures for 2007-2009 were calculated to the effects and purposes of Decision 333/07 and the trend shows progressive and continuous improvement. Table 29 – ELECTRICITY CONTINUITY INDICATORS FOR LV CUSTOMERS: AVERAGE NO.

The regulations for 2008-2009 established that the supplier pay a penalty (calculated according to customers left without power) to the Fund for Exceptional Events established with the Electricity Adjustment Fund and, as of 2010, automatic compensation to customers affected by the blackout. In 2009, the overall number of customers affected by lasting or extensive blackouts amounted to 7,596. Finally, high and medium voltage customers with certificates of compliance for their wiring48 are eligible for automatic compensation in the event of electricity blackouts exceeding the established standard. As of 1 January 2008, all customers are eligible despite the voltage they receive. With respect to the overall number of customers affected by blackouts exceeding the established standard (157 in 2009), the number of those eligible for automatic compensation as they have certified wiring is still very low (see Table 30); in other cases the supplier pays penalties to the Electricity Adjustment Fund rather than to customers. The Authority intended both to encourage suppliers to improve performances and to make customers more responsible with respect to their wiring.

Quality in Public Lighting Acea is responsible for functional and artistic-monumental public lighting in Rome, in accordance with a Service Agreement between the Company and the City Council renewed in 200749. The design, implementation and maintenance of this lighting is managed by Acea Distribuzione and falls within Acea SpA’s Quality Management System according to standard UNI EN ISO 9001:200050 to ensure the reliability and quality control of the relative procedures. Works and progress for both functional and artistic-monumental lighting are planned and carried out through cooperation between corporate managers and technicians through indications from Local Public Administration Departments and Agencies responsible for new town planning schemes and improvement projects for the territory and cultural heritage. 48 In order to be entitled to compensation, high and medium voltage customers must show that they have safety switches in their wiring systems to ensure that any faults caused by their wiring does not affect the network damaging other nearby customers. Furthermore, in order to be entitled to compensation customers must provide electricity supplier a declaration of compliance for their systems issued by a qualified technician. In the event customers are not entitled to compensation, the amount due shall be paid by the Supplier to the Electricity Adjustment Fund. 49 Rome City Council Decision no. 3 dated 4 January 2007. The Service Agreement was renewed for the period 2005-2015. 50 In 2009, the Company passed all annual inspections and no “non-compliances” were discovered. In January 2010 – on expiry of the threeyear Certificate – Acea SpA underwent a CSQ Audit for reissue of the Certificate of Compliance with Standard ISO 9001, new edition 2008.

The works involving functional public lighting carried out in 2009 (see Table 32) include the following: • installation of over 5,000 new lights; • new systems pursuant to the “Safety Pact” implemented last year with cooperation from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Prefect’s Office, Lazio Regional Council, Rome County Council and Rome City Council to improve a number of “critical” sites (near railway and underground stations, bus terminals and car parks) continued and was completed, paying particular attention to lighting and urban décor. In addition to the works carried out in 2008, around 600 new lights were installed and the City Council included other “delicate” areas into the Light Plan, the lighting in which will be completed over the first few months of 2010; • initiatives concerning energy efficiency involved installing 130 LED lights following the pilot project carried out between the end of 2008 and the first few months of 2009 (see detailed box and “Light Plan” for Rome in relation to future development of LED application) • reconstruction of the systems in around 3 km of tunnels with high traffic volumes in crucial areas in the city centre and large connecting roads involving a total of 1,915 lights. These systems all complied with the latest European standards concerning lighting efficiency and energy saving (ref. Standard UNI 11095-2007). At the same time, over 1,600 old and inefficient floodlights no longer complying with the new standard were removed; • the first operation to upgrade the “Parco Lineare delle Mura”, lighting a section of the Aurelian Walls (from Porta Metronia to Porta Latina). This operation – carried out with cooperation from Rome City Council’s Historical City Department was special as it involved the joint work of skilled in-house functional and artistic-monumental lighting resources: the roads used for vehicle traffic were lit with urban décor poles, special ground lights lit the section of ancient Roman wall and floor-lights lit the pavements. The overall lighting system (128 lights), differentiated according to their specific use, ensured that this particularly attractive area could be used by residents and visitors alike.

New suppliers were identified and a number of those Box – “Light Plan” for Rome Rome City Council and Acea top management decided to presented during a joint press conference by Acea and Rome promptly assess the roads or sections of roads without lighting in City Council towards the end of the year, aiming to install Rome. The Company therefore sent Rome City Council a study 30,000 LED lights by the end of 2015, thereby doubling Acea’s identifying 1,800 km of unlit road 3,800 streets and the current production capacity. The Plan will be implemented through most critical areas in December 2009 to thereby establish the investments of around 110 million euro and will require over guidelines for designing and planning future development 2,000 projects to light 850 km of roads, with forecast savings programmes. of 5,000 t of CO2. A considerable number of projects and new A project entitled “Light Plan” was therefore drawn up and installations have already been established for 2010. Further to completion of network digitalization (HV, MV and LV) in 2008 as part of the GIS Project (Geochartic Information System) based on official maps, ensuring immediate reconnaissance of the network sections requiring works, a similar project for public lighting was implemented in Rome. The public lighting system in Rome is very extensive and diversified, therefore requiring regular maintenance and repairs (see Table 33), as well as extraordinary operations. The Service Agreement between Acea and Rome City Council also establishes the public lighting service quality parameters concerning repair times, calculated from arrival of relative report51. Performance standards are expressed as the average repair time allowed (TMRA) by which repairs should be made and a deadline (TMAX) beyond which penalties shall be applied52. In 2009, the average repair times (TMR) for Acea to repair various types of faults were always below the Table 33 – REPAIRS AND SCHEDULED AND EXTRAORDINARY MAINTENANCE FOR PUBLIC LIGHTING (2009) type of work (no.) checking corrosion of lampposts 27,553 lampposts checked (+4.6% vs. 2008) replacing bulbs prior to decline 64,921 bulbs replaced re-installing corroded lampposts or those fallen for accidental reasons 1,337 lampposts re-installed (-7% vs. 2008) 51 It must be noted that reports of faults caused by other parties and those reported for the same network section subsequent to the first report are not taken into account to calculate performance levels. 52 Penalty calculations involve a very complex mechanism: each repair made after the relative deadline is subject to penalty. Repairs made by the TMAX but after the TMRA are only subject to penalties when TMR>TMRA. In 2009, the overall number of reports subject to penalties was 12,904, 209 of which (i.e. 1.6%) were repaired after TMAX; the overall amount for penalties for the year is illustrated in the box concerning claims, bonuses and fines in the section Institutions and the Company. CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 83 TMRA, thereby confirming the marked improvement in performances over the last five years (see Table 34 and Chart 15). The overall number of fault reports53 made by both in-house systems (remote control, monitoring teams) and citizens and Rome City Council through the various channels available (fax, email or letter, call center, online, etc.)54 in 2009 amounted to 20,589 (-6% with respect to 21,922 the year before). Acea acted in 97.3% of cases, with 21,029 “reports covered” as at 31.12.2009, while the remaining reports were completed in the first few months of 2010.

These distinctive skills are also available to “private subjects” on request (such as the Church, hotels and other parties in general). Table 35 provides a summary of the main works carried out in 2009. Table 35 – MAIN WORKS CONCERNING ARTISTIC AND MONUMENTAL LIGHTING (2009) system modernization Modernization mainly concerned parks and gardens, and a number of systems dedicated to churches, obelisks, fountains and monuments. The operations worth mentioning include the fountain in Piazzale degli Eroi and the archaeological site at Terme di Diocleziano. Works involved an overall number of 770 lights installation of new lights Emphasis lighting for Colonna Traiana and Basilica Ulpia in the Foro di Traiano archaeological area, using LED technology (85 lights + 16 metal Halides); 53 lights in the archaeological park in Villa Gordiani; 4 new lights for the Sant’Aurea Church in Ostia; 49 lights for the avenues leading to Divino amore, amounting to 207 new lights ordinary and scheduled Scheduled maintenance involved 5,790 lights: 1,661 lights on bridges and banks along the Tiber, maintenance 2,563 lights in Villas and parks, 1,460 lights on monumental fountains, 106 lights for cathedrals and churches extraordinary maintenance Extraordinary maintenance concerned a total of 331 lights, with work carried out on Isola Tiberina (73 lights), bridges and banks along the Tiber (176 lights) and Campidoglio buildings (82 lights). Box – Artistic Lighting in Archaeological Areas: Fori di Traiano and Villa Gordiani The project for new lighting along Fori di Traiano (Basilica Ulpia The lighting project for the Villa Gordiani archaeological park and Colonna Traiana), written by the City Council Authority, aimed to capitalize on the archaeological remains in this area – the was implemented by Acea Distribuzione and inaugurated in “Basilica”, the “Mausoleo”, the “aula Absidale”, the “aula April 2009. Ottagonale” and the “Cisterna” – between Via Prenestina and Viale This lighting system was the first operation specifically for an Venezia Giulia, and the “Cisterna grande” on the opposite side. archaeological area entirely in LED technology. Experiments In view of the nature of the materials in question, the equipment on LED installations in 2008 involved road lighting and the comprises high-pressure sodium bulbs. Floodlights in which architectural and monumental lighting for the Acquario Romano, specific refractors can be inserted were chosen to ensure the currently used as offices by the Association of Architects. This best possible distribution of light and reduce dispersion and technology not only ensures energy savings, but also control over light pollution. The main goal behind this project was to the system via computers that can be programmed both to switch highlight emergencies through basic lighting on which to build on equipment according to a preset “hierarchy” and to set the an emphasis lighting system to reconstruct the architecture intensity of lighting. through light.

Designing, building, carrying out maintenance and restructuring networks and systems for the water service – which undoubtedly affect service quality – are carried out by Acea Ato 2 and fall within Acea SpaA’s Quality Management System according to Standard UNI EN ISO 9001:200058 to warrant reliability and improvement. Finally, Acea Ato 2 constantly monitors the quality parameters concerning various aspects of the service and regularly forwards relative information to the ATO Technical Operational Office. Municipalities within ATO 2 are gradually subjected to management in agreement with the local authorities once the condition of networks and systems has been checked and the fact that the municipalities in question have carried out the work required to solve any non compliances is confirmed. As at 31 December 2009, this service was managed in 76 municipalities (including Formello taken over in July), amounting to around 3.7 million inhabitants, in other words 95% of the overall number; this figure is joined by 9 other municipalities in which the Integrated Water Service is managed partially and the aqueduct systems of the Consortia Simbrivio, former Cassa per il Mezzogiorno, Doganella, the Consortia Nemi-Genzano, C.E.P. (Consorzio Ecologico Prenestino) and Consorzio Acquedotto del Peschiera. The latter consortium covers 8 municipalities, 6 of which have already transferred management of the integrated water system to Acea Ato 2, and was taken over in 2009. Checks on the condition of networks and systems in 101 municipalities (including in municipalities already managed) were completed by 31 December 2009. The situation concerning the water infrastructures in a number of municipalities in the province of Rome recently acquired requires further actions to ensure a high quality service, for example by modernizing systems, completing pipes, building wells, etc. to warrant appropriate water supply and solve a number of problems. In 2009 for example, the Nuovo Simbrivio and Doganella aqueducts were connected to improve this structure, a new pipe was made operational in Velletri and extraordinary works were carried out on the Olgiata-Civitavecchia pipe. The operations carried out to solve the water emergencies in municipalities in south Rome that came to light in 2008 were also of primary importance. Acea Ato 2 therefore planned and carried out the works required according to that already performed the year before: this involved improving networks, searching for water and digging new wells and building new connection and supply pipes to ensure that the infrastructure and supply service became more reliable. Operations to solve leaks by analyzing the supply networks, which have gone on for a number of years, focussed more specifically on the municipalities in the province of Rome; this work involved reconstructing the layout of pipes, entering this information in an IT system (GIS Geographic Information System59), monitoring the capacity and pressure of water and identifying and repairing leaks (see also box in Environmental Issues). Rome60 now has a near perfect quality in terms of service and the works, in addition to maintenance and fault repairs carried out, focus on general efficiency and adapting the water system for new housing by building new supply pipes and tanks and extending the sewerage system. 57 The Acea Ato 2 Integrated Water Service Charter, which came into effect in 2003, applies in the municipality of Rome and gradually in the other municipalities acquired in ATO 2 – Central Lazio. The full version of this Service Charter is available online at www.aceaato2.it. 58 In 2009, the company passed annual inspection and no “non compliances” were discovered. In January 2010 – on expiry of the three-year Certificate – Acea SpA underwent a CSQ Audit for reissue of the Certificate of Compliance according to Standard ISO 9001, new edition 2008. 59 GIS is an IT system used to acquire, register, analyze, view and return information from geographic data, relating various information, according to a common geographic reference. 60 Acea was appointed to manage the aqueduct system in Rome in 1937 and the purification system in 1985. 86 Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Box – A System for Overseeing Water Availability A system to monitor the quantity and quality of water balancing and set graphs to provide a regular overview of the resources was implemented in 2009 comprising a network of condition of available water resources. A number of weather 15 weather stations, a network of “scout wells” and remote and climate (1951 –2009) and water (2002 – 2009) measurement of a number of variables concerning supply databases have already been developed and the relative systems. The information discovered and measurements taken are parameters and indexes required to provide the system “a past entered into a server which uses calculation algorithms, memory” have been calculated. The number and type of ordinary and extraordinary maintenance operations carried out on networks, systems and equipment in all municipalities in ATO 2 under management to warrant regular water supply and the analyses carried out on drinking and wastewater in 2009 are illustrated in Table 36. Table 36 – MAIN WORKS CONCERNING AQUEDUCTS, TREATMENT PLANTS AND NETWORKS AND WATER ANALYSES CARRIED OUT IN ATO 2 – CENTRAL LAZIO (2009) type of work (no.) hydraulic/electromechanical maintenance 874 operations (repairs and maintenance, 364 of which hydraulic/electromechanical maintenance on supply and source solving leaks) network ordinary maintenance on water network (operations with digs 21,520 operations (8,821 of which on the Rome network) on pipes, off-takes, carriers, etc.) “user” maintenance (operations without digging for users, e.g. 40,981 operations (16,448 of which for users in Rome) meters, outlets, etc.) maintenance (improvements, ordinary, preventive, etc.) 5,260 operations (+ 15% with respect to 2008) on treatment plants maintenance (ordinary and extraordinary) on sewerage network 8,886 operations (5,268 on the Rome network) controlling drinking water quality 8,626 samples taken and 348,255 analyses carried out on drinking water controlling wastewater quality 87,056 analyses carried out on wastewater Continuity in water supply is an important service quality parameter. This parameter is calculated according to the number and length of interruptions: in 2009, 655 stoppages were required (33% less than in 2008), 541 of which were urgent (for faults in pipes) and 114 were scheduled; 23 stoppages lasted over 24 hours. Table 37 illustrates net improvement in the figures over the last three years, especially in relation to a decrease in the number of stoppages. The INTER parameter61 required by the ATO Authority is used as the index for interruptions to water supply representing the company’s performance in terms of service continuity, the best possible value of which is Table 37 – NUMBER, TYPE AND DURATION OF STOPPAGES TO WATER SUPPLY (2007-2009) 2007 2008 2009 urgent stoppages (no.) 915 734 541 scheduled stoppages (no.) 259 245 114 total stoppages (no.) 1,174 979 655 stoppages lasting > 24h (no.) 73 118 23 61 The INTER parameter for interruptions concerns water supply continuity and is calculated according to the number of interruptions to the water service, the number of customers affected, the overall number of customers in relative ATO and duration of each interruption. CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 87 almost one unit: the Acea INTER parameter for ATO 2 in 2009 was 0.99, as occurred in the three previous years. Corporate subsidiary LaboratoRI supports Acea Ato 2 in carefully monitoring and checking the quality of water both used for drinking and to return to the natural environment. Analyses on supplied drinking water are carried out on samples taken from various places: springs and wells, supply systems, reservoirs and distribution networks. The frequency of analyses and withdrawal points are established taking into account a number of variables in each municipality (volume of water supplied, condition of networks and infrastructures, special features in local sources, etc.) and exceed the number established in current Laws (Italian Legislative Decree 31/2001). Over 8,600 samples were taken in ATO 2 – Central Lazio and 348,255 analyses were carried out by both LaboratoRI and Acea Ato 2 (in relation to water quality, see also Environmental Issues page 167 and Environmental Accounts page 11). In view of the volcanic nature of this area, the sources in a number of municipalities in the province of Rome – for example the Castelli area – have specific parameters (e.g. for fluorine, arsenic and vanadium) with concentrations exceeding those established in Italian Legislative Decree 31/2001. In such cases, Acea implements plans to install special treatment systems or by mixing this water with water from other sources, according to that established in provisions for exceptions (to the effects and purposes of Italian Legislative Decree 31/01). The source water used to supply Acea’s “historical network” in Rome and Fiumicino is already of excellent quality. In addition to the extraordinary presence of 423 artistic and monumental fountains, for which Acea carries out extraordinary and ordinary maintenance, a special feature of the city of Rome is its roughly 2,500 drinking fountains in cast iron (“spouts”) and travertine marble (“she-wolf drinking fountains”) located throughout the city to provide drinking water to Romans and visitors alike. Box – “Parco della Fontana dell’Acqua Acetosa” In December 2009, the “Parco della Fontana dell’Acqua Towards the end of the Fifties, following centuries of incessant Acetosa” was presented at Canottieri Aniene, thereby returning supply of drinking water, this fountain was affected by significant the historical fountain from which drinking water will once again pollution in water table providing its water, causing its closure. flow thanks to restoration and improvements to the city of Rome. Careful work by Acea to restore the water system and lighting This fountain was classified as a monument to be restored by the around the fountain and surrounding area ensured that this water Italian Environmental Fund and is located in the Parioli – with its excellent organoleptic features – will once again run neighbourhood, right in the spot where the Tiber forms a bight freely. before heading north. With regard to tap water consumption, Acea asked its customers in its 2009 Customer Satisfaction Survey (for Rome and province) if they drink the water supplied to their homes and if not why not. The trend of the last three years was once again confirmed: around 55% of the people interviewed living in the city said that they regularly drink tap water while 22% never do and, of the latter, 24% do not like the taste and 15% do not trust its hygienic quality. The percentage of people living in the province who regularly drink tap water was 38% (improving on 24% last year) and 44% said they never drink tap water; 32% do not trust its hygienic quality and 21% do not like the taste. For this reason and as Acea considers it important to improve the faith of people in the quality of its water, 88 it continues to communicate with customers and the general public: an initiative to circulate a “water ID Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders card” was re-launched in 2009, providing a list of the parameters certifying the quality of drinking water, and a “treasure map” was distributed, providing a map of the centre of Rome showing the location of “spouts”, the traditional drinking fountains (see also Communication, Events and Solidarity). Box –Altroconsumo Survey on Water Quality In October 2009, Altroconsumo – one of the leading consumer affect health) and metals, deliberately acting stricter than associations in Italy – provided the results of a survey on water established by the Law and negatively assessing values that quality and launched an information campaign entitled Drink Tap exceeded half the limit, even though they were far from the set Water for “the wary, the misinformed and demanding palates”. limits. The overall opinion on water quality formed by the «Low in mineral content, with the right amount of calcium and weighted average of partial opinions concerning quality, nitrates, suitable for low-sodium diets (…), a description that (almost metals and pollutants expressed on a scale of 5 levels – always) fits tap water. That is what emerged from our survey», excellent, good, acceptable, mediocre, terrible – for Rome was states the Association’s website. excellent. Altroconsumo took 35 samples of water from public drinking fountains in the centres of 35 chief cities in Italian regions and The results of this survey are published online in an article entitled analyzed the quality and type of waters (hardness, salinity, “Blue gold. Gushes from your taps” in Altroconsumo, October sodium, chlorites), pollutants (especially contaminants that may 2009, www.altroconsumo.it ) The Company is also responsible for additional water services in the city (fire hydrants and sprinkler network); the sprinkler network is mainly located in the city centre and the “Trieste” and “Prati” neighbourhoods and supplies the most important and representative artistic and monumental fountains in Rome. The integrated water system concerns the entire water cycle up to its return into the natural environment. The sewage system (systems and networks) and the treatment service managed by Acea Ato 2 comprised – as at 31.12.2009 – 466 sewage removal systems (158 in Rome), 176 treatment plants (35 of which in Rome) and 5,979 km of network (around 4,030 km of which for Rome). These operations gradually expanded in line with town planning development and progress in management of the Integrated Water Systems in ATO 2 – Central Lazio municipalities: maintenance, improvements and repairs to the sewage network and main sewages throughout 2009 in Rome and province amounted to 8,886, with an average of around 740 operations per month. Wastewater undergoes careful analysis before being returned to the environment (on entering and leaving treatment plants) in order to check the quality: LaboratoRI carried out around 87,000 analyses on behalf of Acea Ato 2 in 2009. The monitoring network for systems connected to treatment plants improved considerably over the last three years due to a project implemented by Acea Ato 2 with cooperation from University Research Institutes. Acea Ato 2’s Environmental Ops Room is currently able to continuously monitor the entire wastewater disposal system and produce daily reports concerning pluviometry, hydrometrical levels, the condition of the sewage network and the quality of water in the rivers receiving water, in other words the Rivers Tiber and Aniene. This Ops Room uses a sewage network remote control system to receive figures from 32 measuring tools and, further to an agreement with the Rome Hydrographic and Marigraphic Office effective for some years now, receives and processes hydrometric figures, figures from 48 pluviometric stations and those from 4 water quality monitoring stations installed along these two rivers. CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 89 Rates Electricity Rates The electricity market became fully deregulated in July 2007. This means that any domestic consumer can freely choose their electricity supplier in Italy, according to that established by the European Union. Entering the so-called “deregulated market” – in other words changing current supplier and implementing a contract with a different business – is the free choice of every consumer. In this case, the service costs excluding infrastructures (network services, system costs and taxes) are subject to market trends and free negotiations among the parties involved. The conditions for the “protected market” regulated by the Electricity and Gas Authority remain effective for customers that decide not to switch to the deregulated market and stay with their usual supplier; the most important of these conditions for customers is undoubtedly the rates62. According to the economic conditions established for standard households on the protected market (2,700 kWh per year at 3 kW)63, the prices in 2009 reduced by 3.6% with respect to the year before, amounting to an average cost of 453 euro (with respect to round 470 euro per year in 2008). The final cost was affected by a reduction from 11.18 to 10.65 c€/kWh (average value for the four quarters in 2008 and 2009) of the item relative to procurement and marketing, which has always had the biggest effect on final cost, the reduction from 1.44 to 1.29 c€/kWh for general system costs and, finally, the reduction in taxes from 2.41 to 2.36 c€/kWh.

These are calculated according to the area of the service in question (aqueducts, sewages and treatment), the customer and type of use. In accordance with current laws, rates are established to cover management costs, investments made and returns on the invested capital, in compliance with the principle of economic and financial self-sufficiency in the water sector. With regard to the cost item received by water companies and paid by users connected to the sewage system but not served by treatment plants, further to the decision made by the Council in 2008 and by way of compliance with Italian Law 13/09 (see relative box in Corporate Identity for more details), the Ministry for the Environment identified the criteria and parameters for repayment, establishing the following points: a five-year deadline for customers to be entitled to repayment; deduction of the costs related to design or installation for works carried out in order to start-up a treatment plant, as this is to be paid back; presentation of an official application for repayment by customers; the specific obligations of service providers to notify customers on progress in works to build treatment plants. The real average rates applied by Acea Group companies within the consolidation scope in 2009 are illustrated in Table 38.

Customers can contact Acea and operational companies via an exchange which puts them through to corporate offices and sites, commercial free-phone numbers, free-phone numbers for reporting faults (see box), counters (physical and online), via letter, email, fax or corporate websites (www.acea.it, www.aceaelectrabel.it e www.aceaato2.it). “Key customers” (e.g. companies and institutions) have specific departments within operational companies to deal with their procedures. At the end of 2009, a telephone number was established for Public Administrations as “key customers” of Acea Electrabel Elettricità. 64 Although monitoring of performances in managing contact centers carried out by the Customer Care Team includes almost all water companies in the Group, by way of complying with the accounting boundary in this chapter, information and performances of Acea Ato 2 are provided here and the Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas should be consulted for information concerning other companies.

This number is now exclusively used for Perpetual Lighting Management (in Italian Gestione Illuminazione Perpetua Gip) and the Crisis Plan for Electricity System Safety (in Italian Piano di emergenza per la sicurezza del sistema elettrico Pesse), whereas the Acea Ato 2 commercial service adopted free-phone number 800.130.331 and the protected electricity market was given free-phone number 800.199.900. NB: Acea warrants respect for privacy in managing personal information in all relations with customers (in accordance with Italian Legislative Decree 196/2003). Acea8cento began to gradually take over Customer Care activities for all companies in the Group in 2008. The decision not to partially entrust management of customer care to an outsourcer by establishing a specific company within Acea Group proved to be a good choice and provided the expected results (see Chart 19). In fact, Acea8cento also took over management of the telephone lines (exchange and commercial free-phone number) and remote channels (fax, email, web-forms, written letters, etc.) on behalf of Acea Ato 5 in 2009. In addition to overseeing Group company contact centers, Acea8cento analyzes and identifies areas for improvement in “remote” management of customers and, in 2009, established joint workgroups to improve the structure of the free-phone number of Acea Ato 2 customers, thereby creating two separate free-phone numbers – commercial and fault reports – and the logic and technical infrastructure for the Acea Ato5 exchange. By way of ensuring ongoing improvement in contact center performances, in 2009 Acea extended monitoring of quality provided by free-phone numbers through mystery calls to all the commercial services managed by Acea8cento and the Acea Distribuzione and Acea Ato 2 fault report centers managed by these companies, the results of which are shared with corporate directors. Furthermore, Acea SpA’s CEO with support from the Customer Care Team established a workgroup to map the problems most frequently reported by customers in December, to identify the actions required and thereby respond more effectively to customers’ expectations, commencing with how complaints are managed. The overall number of calls received by Acea free-phone numbers in 2009 amounted to 2.1 million. This was slightly fewer than in 2008, while the distribution among the various services remained substantially unaltered: the electricity commercial free-phone numbers were responsible for around 64% of the calls received, with an increase in the traffic received by the free-phone number for the free market due to growth in this type of customer. The service level improved, with operators replying to 88% of all calls received (see Chart 18). Electricity and Gas vendor call centers are assessed twice a year by the Electricity and Gas Authority, which 92 Chart 18 – OVERALL TELEPHONE TRAFFIC FOR ACEA FREE-PHONE NUMBERS (2008-2009) Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders no. calls received 3,000,000 2,794,176 replies/received no. calls replied 2008: 74.3% 2,500,000 2,418,303 2009: 88.0% 2,074,715 2,128,067 2,000,000 1,500,000 1,000,000 500,000 0 2008 2009 Chart 19 – PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION OF TELEPHONE TRAFFIC RECEIVED BY ACEA FREE-PHONE NUMBERS 2009) commercial electricity – safeguarded market (AceaElectrabel Elettricità) 11.2% commercial electricity – deregulated market (AceaElectrabel Elettricità) 58.2% electricity faults (Acea Distribuzione) 9.4% public lighting Rome (Acea Distribuzione) 1.9% cemetery lighting (Acea Distribuzione) 3.8% commercial water service (Acea Ato 2) 10.0% water faults (Acea Ato 2) 5.6% prepares a comparison of the services offered by each operator and publishes a classification65 based on the overall number of points66 (IQT) assigned. The Authority’s classification for the second half of 2008 and the same period in 2009 in relation to the AceaElectrabel Elettricità call center showed a slight drop from 20th place in 2008 to 22nd place in 2009, although it must be pointed out that it reached 15th place in the survey concerning the first half of 2009. Despite this position in the classification, performances have progressively improved: in fact, if we compare the points received on the whole, the overall score (IQT) increased from 41.6 to 60.4 and then to 60.9 in the three half-year periods in question. This improvement is mainly due to growth in the quality indicator (PQ), which reached 38 points in the second half of the year (35 in the first half) and the score for Customer Satisfaction Survey (PSC), which reached 92.3 (from 85.3 in the first survey), however also the slight improvement in the accessibility indicator (PA), which rose from 46 to 48. More specifically, improvement that the AceaElectrabel Elettricità contact center progressively made in Customer Satisfaction Surveys carried out by the Authority involved all the elements under review, for example the amount of time passing before customers found the line free (from 74.7 in 2008 to 89.7 in 2009), the waiting time to speak to an operator (from 71.9 in 2008 to 89 in 2009). 65 The classification for the quality of electricity and gas vendor call centers took into account figures from the second half of 2009 and can be viewed at the Electricity and Gas Authority website (www.autorità.energia.it). 66 The overall score comprises three separate scores, two of which refer to quality delivered – access to service (PA) and service quality (PQ) – and the third concerning the results for quality perceived by customers – level of customer satisfaction in those calling the call center (PSC) –, carried out by the Authority. CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 93 It is also important to point out that the elements most affecting the overall index of customer satisfaction (ICS)67, of a purely qualitative nature, such as the ability to solve problems (with a score of 87.2) and the clear nature of responses (with a score of 93) – are the strength of this company’s call center with respect to the others. The main performance indicators for other Acea free-phone numbers – electricity, public lighting and cemetery fault reports, water service faults and marketing – are provided in Table 39. The service level improved in all call centers.

More specifically, the performances of commercial free-phone numbers benefitted from the full operability of Acea8cento and the electric and IP service performances improved in relation to fault report free-phone. Over the last quarter of the year, Acea Distribuzione introduced a new operational system (Geocall) to ensure more effective management of reports and repairs and commenced training for the staff involved. These services are refined in close cooperation with operational rooms and are particularly important in providing prompt indications on the status of faults and time to repair. Remote contact between customers and the company has been redesigned and improved over the last two years: more specifically, graphics and contents on the Acea website (www.acea.it) have been renewed and the websites of operational companies (www.aceaelectrabelelettricità.it e www.aceaato2.it) have been equipped with online counters, which can be used for matters concerning contracts and marketing, requesting information and checking billing and payments. The Acea Ato 2 online counter became fully operational during the year and, as at 31.12.2009, received around 16,400 registrations. The AltaFedeltà Competition (loyalty programme) for water service customers in Rome also ended with virtuous customers receiving their awards (see relative box). Acea has “physical” counters for electricity and water service customers at the main office in Piazzale Ostiense 2 and in the Ostia Lido branch. There are 25 more counters for the water service in other branches in Rome68 and in the municipalities in which management was taken over. 67 Information on the relationship between ICS and PSC and, more generally, how the overall IQT score is calculated can be found in Decision by the Electricity and Gas Authority no. 164/2008. 68 At 1665 Via Casilina (VIII district). 94 The majority of customers visits to Acea counters relate to the electricity service (see Table 40), although Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders the number decreased over the year on the whole. This is due to improvement in the performances of telephone contact centers (see Table 39) and, with regard to the water service, customers using other channels: fax and web. Organization streamlining and a drop in the number of customers visiting counters in 2009 led to a considerable reduction in waiting times and service levels (expressed as a ratio between the number of tickets issued and customers served) of 98%.

The parameters concerning “replies to written complaints” for the electricity service are indicated as “specific” in relation to sales and “general” commercial quality in relation to supply and reading (low and 96 medium voltage supplies) by the Electricity and Gas Authority (see Quality Delivered, Tables 25 and 26). Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders In order to fulfil new standards for managing complaints introduced by the Authority and which came into effect on July 1st 2009, AceaElectrabel Elettricità placed two post boxes at the disposal of customers – one for the protected market and one for the free market; it also implemented a system for tracking and reports on complaints for “various use” customers on the free market via a Customer Relationship Management (CRM)69 platform. Written complaints for the public lighting service are managed by Acea Distribuzione: the overall number of complaints received in 2009 amounted to 1,421 (+12.7% with respect to the year before) and 1,359 replies were given (95.8% of the overall amount), 93.45% of which within 30 days. Acea Ato 2 received 2,529 complaints/requests for the water service in various municipalities in ATO 2 (Rome and province) (32% less than in 2008), 1,627 of which were carried out and 1,603 satisfied (98.5% of the overall number). A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system was implemented in December 2009 to manage and monitor phone, counter or written requests from customers which, once fully operational in 2010, will considerably improve performance monitoring pursuant to the Service Charter, especially in relation to the procedure for replying to written complaints. Another “means of contact” with customers is a bill, which provides information on a supply contract, consumption, terms of payment and – in a specific area – methods of payment, procedures for paying bills in instalments, providing readings, opening times and location of counters, web address, benefits for those using electric medical appliances, etc. Company websites also provide information to help customers read their own meters. Finally, Acea implemented a tool for out of court settlement of disputes between customers and the company in 2009: this mutual settlement procedure, with Acea Ato 2 and Acea Ato 5 with regard to the water service and with AceaElectrabel Elettricità for the electricity service (see relative box in Institutions and the Company). Box – Disputes with Customers Legal disputes implemented by customers with respect to Acea in terms of number and in terms of the average amount involved Group generally concern complaints subsequently becoming (which approached 1,000 euro in 2008, for an overall amount summons in relation to supply (rates and refunds). of around 1.5 million euro). With respect to the year before, in 2009 these fell by 10% both Communication, Events and Solidarity Communication In addition to overseeing all the customer contact centers mentioned above (customer care), Acea also deals with other forms of communication via a Public Relations and Communication Team at the Parent Company, which focuses on different stakeholders and the social context concerning corporate activities. The Company ensures attendance at important public events through sponsorships, is committed to supporting initiatives concerning solidarity or the environment, proposes publicity and awareness campaigns for the general public, manages relations with various press and media agencies through a Press Office and oversees online communication through the corporate website. 69 Household customers shall also be “transferred” to this system in January 2010. CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 97 More specifically, Acea celebrated one hundred years of business in 2009 and, by way of celebrating this “Centenary”, implemented numerous initiatives, including creation of a specific website (www.centenario.acea.it) (see box). Box – 100 Years of Acea The Company celebrated 100 years of business in 2009 – a century in which Acea played a fundamental role in the development and well-being of the community by providing such essential public services as water, electricity and public available outside the company: a special edition entitled lighting. Rome’s water and lights – Stories and memories of 100 The Company decided to highlight this event and involve the years of Acea’s activities and the Festival of water and community in which it has operated for the longest in a series of energy, created by Valerio Festi and held in Piazza del initiatives: Rome. Acea for Rome was the name of a research Popolo, in the heart of the city centre, which was attended by project for which Istituto CeSAR was appointed to analyze both over 100,000 people. the past history of the company and its prospects for Finally, black and white photographs taken by Luciano Viti in development and led to a publication sent to the main emblematic parts of the Capital were used in the publicity institutional stakeholders. campaign carried out by Publicis: these images focussed on Acea also revamped the logo used throughout the year in all people and their vitality, their passion, their strength. This is institutional communications, including 2009 and reference to the world with which Acea has made a strong bond – a one 100 years of business and created a special website for the hundred year-long bond -, a concept which is emphasized by Centenary (www.centenario.acea.it), filled with unpublished use of the logo’s brackets around the people, by the photographic material to recount the history, leading players headlines and by the pay off: “Acea. Your world is at the and activities that have characterized the Company throughout centre of ours”. At the end of the year, by way of celebrating this century; the site also presented a project for a historical Christmas, the last event held was devised by Studio Livia archive and celebration dates. Cannella and involved projecting Christmas trees on the The first edition of a new corporate magazine – facade of Piramide Cestia, near Acea’s Head Office: A tree Aceamagazine – was also dedicated to this event and made a day for 10 days to celebrate 100 years of Acea. The Acea website70 – www.acea.it – is above all the tool used to steer institutional and financial communications online: the “Regulations and Values” behind the Company’s actions, online share progress, publication of Reports and price-sensitive communications, trying as far as possible to align financial contents with Consob recommendations for listed companies. With regard to this, it is worth pointing out that two new sites were launched in 2009, both of which can be accessed via the institutional website, to provide online and interactive versions of the Group Consolidated Financial Statement and Sustainability Report (referring to financial year 2008) in Italian and English. Nonetheless, the contents found on Acea’s website aim to fulfil the expectations of an increasing number of users, including customers, suppliers, the general public and anyone interested in contacting the Company. A new version of the Acea website was prepared and went live in July: the overall number of visitors amounted to around 590,000, with a monthly average of 49,068 visits, around 69% of which were “new visitors”. If you look at the trend over the last three years (see Chart 21), you can see a constant increase in the monthly average for pages visited and a slight decrease in the other access indicators. The overall decrease in visitors to the institutional site is related to the fact that the water company websites of Acea Ato 2 (www.aceaato2.it) and Acea Ato 5 (www.aceaato5.it) became fully operational in 2009 and respectively received around 175,300 and around 44,300 visits. Electricity vendor AceaElectrabel Elettricità’s website (www.aceaelectrabel.it) has also been online for several years and received around 500,000 visits in 2009. 70 See box concerning institutional site in Communicating sustainability: procedure. 98 Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Chart 21 – THE MAIN ACCESS INDICATORS FOR THE ACEA WEBSITE (monthly averages 2007-2009) 2007 no. pages visited per month 207,463 228,610 2008 248,944 2009 overall no. visits per month 48,048 54,822 49,068 36,668 no. “single visitors” per month 39,978 34,055 29,051 no. “new visitors” per month 33,792 33,845 0 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 Acea deals with the press and media through a specific Office and provides a press release every day, which is accessible to colleagues on the corporate intranet. A selection of the press releases – including from local papers – and audio and video mentions have been made available through a specific section on the corporate website from 2009. Acea thereby wished to offer outside visitors the chance to see what the main newspapers said about the Company. The centenary year ensured that the Press Office was particularly busy organizing celebrations – also involving Italian and international press – as well as its everyday work of promptly responding to numerous reports concerning the services managed by Acea Group, which is carried out with cooperation from the relative operational companies and with constant interaction from daily newspaper offices, television and radio stations. A large number of reports still reach the Acea Press Office via email, fax and telephone calls and receive prompt replies. The initiatives to make customers and the general public aware of the quality of water and the value of Acea’s services undertaken by the company and supported by the Press Office included the “Water ID Card”, which was repeated in 2009 following the first prototype launched in 2007 and included new interviews and events and presentation of “The Treasure Map”, in other words a brochure in Italian and English providing information on the roughly 2,500 cast iron drinking fountains – “spouts” – found throughout the City of Rome that provide free drinking water, and a map of the city centre showing the location of over 200 “spouts” (also available online on the corporate website). The “Map of public lighting” was also issued in the form of an ID card illustrating the main features of Rome’s public lighting system, which is managed according to Quality Standard UNI EN ISO 9001, and showing the extent of this network and the overall number of lights and lamps lighting the city, its streets and its monumental heritage. Particular attention was paid to highlighting the initiatives undertaken by subsidiary Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici concerning renewable energy, especially in relation to photovoltaic energy. The Company also operates and updates an environmental portal for schools: www.ambientandoci.it, which is a direct link for schools. Every year the willingness and competence of staff allow the Group to open plants to visitors, receiving a wide range of people – schoolchildren, technicians and other companies operating in this sector: 418 visitors from both Italy and overseas were received in 2009. On presenting the initiatives mentioned, the Press Office continued to raise people’s awareness on how to correctly use water and energy. To this regard, it also organized press conferences with cooperation from numerous Rome City Council Departments mainly for schools – to encourage knowledge of the history of Roman Aqueducts, the water cycle and new energy sources. Finally, the Press Office issued releases that helped inform people of the numerous sponsorships of cultural, social and sport events which aim to consolidate Acea’s bond with the territory. CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 99 Events and Solidarity Acea contributes towards the well-being of local communities and highlights its active presence in the area in which it operates by sponsoring events – cultural, sport, environmental or social – and making donations to solidarity and humanitarian initiatives (see the boxes further ahead listing a number of the events supported by the Company during the year). Chart 22 – PERCENTAGE OF ADDED VALUE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY (2009) community 0.4% The added value distributed throughout the community in 2009 amounts to around 3.6 million euro71, an increase of 20% with respect to the roughly 3 million euro in 2008 (see Corporate Identity, Table 12 concerning added value). The amounts earmarked to support fairs and conventions increased by 69% with respect to 2008 and the amount contributed towards events for the community increased by 15%. The value of sponsorships increased by 27%, while the amount made in donations decreased to 370,000 euro in 2009 from around 500,000 euro the year before). “Technical” sponsorships that Acea carries out by offering its services free of charge, such as switching off public lighting or providing energy and water for events, amounted to 87,100 euro in 2009 (over twice the amount of 40,000 euro the year before). This kind of operation is carried out for events involving the community, such as the traditional city marathons or film festivals and concerts taking place as part of the “estate romana” (Roman Summer) initiative held in summer to the benefit of visitors and the residents alike. In addition to the events celebrating the Company’s Centenary mentioned earlier, cultural events sponsored or supported by Acea in 2009 were particularly important, including art shows, conferences, artistic and literature awards and music and film exhibitions. With regard to sport, Acea confirmed joint sponsorship of the basketball team Basket Virtus Roma and sponsored international sporting events, such as preparations for the World Volleyball Championships or the WBC World Boxing Championship for lightheavyweights, as well as the previously mentioned Rome marathons, and contributed towards organizing sporting events for young people and solidarity (such as the Golf Trophy A game for life, organized by the Romail Association against leukaemia, lymphomas and myeloma). In relation to the environment, Acea sponsored two important initiatives in 2009: the International Conference on Energy: changes to the environment and safety” held in Paris in October and the “National Geochartic Earth day – Mission Rome 2009”. The Company also distinguished itself for the numerous humanitarian and solidarity initiatives supported, especially for children. Like every year before, the hall in Rome Head Office was made available to associations to sell ornamental plants or Easter Eggs for the purposes of fundraising. 71 This item does not include funds raised for Committee for Africa initiatives (around 138,000 Euro) and “technical” sponsorships (amounting to 86,100 Euro in 2009). See also Table 12 for details on Sharing out Added Value in Corporate Identity. 100 Acea also continued with the aid for African populations through the Committee for Africa72 which led to Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders twelve projects proposed by employees with cooperation from humanitarian organizations (see relative box). This Committee assesses projects and selects a number to implement, always monitoring their progress. At the end of the year, the Committee presents the projects underway and those planned in the future during a meeting open to all employees and attended by the top management. Box – Acea’s Commitment to Children and Health Acea is particularly receptive to those promoting charity initiatives an orphanage in Camerun with Anlaids Lazio are also part of for health, especially non-profit organizations and associations this commitment. focusing on the psychological and physical well-being of With regard to health, Acea also helped various associations children. This year, Acea repeatedly contributed towards providing information and support to people with serious initiatives in support of hospitals, such as Bambin Gesù degenerating diseases through events combining sport, solidarity Children’s Hospital and the children’s ward at Policlinico and voluntary action. A number of the initiatives supported Umberto I, which specialize in helping children.

King concert at the Umbria Jazz Festival 2009 – while the amounts generally earmarked to support events in municipalities in the province of Rome were used in operations to support the families affected by the terrible earthquake in Abruzzo (see box in Institutions and the Company). CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY 103 SUPPLIERS Consolidated External Costs Acea Group consolidated external costs in 2009 amounted to 2,106 billion euro, 7.2% lower than the 2,268 billion in 2008. This difference is mainly due to a reduction in energy, gas and fuel costs (-174.7 million euro with respect to last year) – linked to volumes and price trends – which affect the overall amount for external costs the most (77.4% in 2009). The item “energy, gas and fuel” illustrates the trend in energy procurement costs on the protected and free market (amounting to 1.186 billion euro) both decreased with respect to the year before (see Table 41), whereas the cost for buying gas for resale increased by 5.8%, amounting to 259.7 million euro (with respect to 245.5 million in 2008). The decrease in energy procurement costs on the protected and deregulated markets should also be viewed taking into account the particular economic situation in Italy and consequent fall in demand for energy; in fact, the amount of energy sold and overall margin from selling electricity decreased, although remaining in line with the trend commencing upon deregulation of the electricity market, confirming a slight decline in the number of customers on the protected market and a considerable rise in the number of customers on the deregulated market (see Customers and the Community). Table 41 – ACEA ENERGY PROCUREMENT COSTS ON THE ELECTRICITY MARKET (2007-2009) (in millions of euro) 2007 2008 2009 protected market 325.9 324.5 281.7 deregulated and safeguarded market 844.1 981.2 905.2 Procurement Policy According to the new Group organization approved in 2009, a specific department (Procurement, Logistics and Facility Management) in the Human Resources and Services Division established in Acea SpA is responsible for procurement of commodities, services and works. More specifically, a Procurement Department deals with relations with suppliers and is therefore responsible for managing Tenders for the entire Group by outlining strategies in compliance with current Laws and standards73, as well as directly managing procurement in close cooperation with the Industrial Areas involved. Reference principles for procurement policies are: • calling bids as the main procedure for identifying suppliers; • adopting transparency and non discrimination when contracting such bids; • establishing formal meetings with the business world; • escalating aspects relating to quality, the environment and safety when qualifying companies. The Code of Ethics for Tenders was adopted by Acea in 2003 and outlines all the values on which 73 Italian Legislative Decree 163 dated 12 April 2006 – Code for Public Agreements regarding works, services and supplies in compliance with European Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC – which became effective as of July 1st 2006. 104 Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Box – Procurement Department: Tasks and Responsibilities Provisions issued by Acea SpA outline the tasks and Industrial Areas and Companies in order to streamline responsibilities for Operational Teams. The responsibilities timescales/costs/quality and govern procurement; established for the Procurement department, redefined in 2009, • warranting coordination of procurement by checking Purchase include the following: Applications from various corporate departments and • outlining and implementing purchasing and procurement managing Purchase Orders; policies in line with the category of commodities, demand and • ensuring constant development in Systems to qualify suppliers market in question; according to business needs and the Law and warranting • ensuring Central management of Tenders for all Companies in management of the stages for accepting, checking, notifying the Group; and storing applications, also by overseeing specific • coordinating the needs for commodities, services and works Regulations. throughout the Group, integrating the needs from Divisions, contracting agency and contractors are expected to base their conduct; the Code of Ethics for the Group was adopted in 2004 and Article 14 focuses on Relations with Suppliers, stating the principles of transparency and integrity, safeguarding ethics in suppliers, the criteria for overseeing selection of suppliers and the obligations and rules of conduct for human resources responsible for procurement. Companies wishing to become part of the Acea Qualification System or take part in Tenders for works, supplies and services are explicitly requested to accept the aforementioned codes74. The Procurement Department optimized IT systems to support its operations, streamlined operational processes and administration in 2009 in order to improve the “Procurement Center” service carried out for all companies/divisions and consequently amplify its contribution to achieving economic and efficiencyrelated targets of the Group. For this purpose, once the operational procedure was outlined, specific operations were implemented on the SAP system to create specific functions that could provide all important information in real time to thereby analyze and monitor the procurement process for supplies, services and works and simplify and streamline communication between the “Procurement Center” and companies/Divisions requesting such. A procurement portal to manage collective agreements was implemented for this purpose (travel and transfers, stationery, printers, toner and other consumables), which helped speed up procedures and streamline costs, ensuring a considerable reduction in such (see box in section Commodities and Services). A project to further computerize procurement processes kicked off in December 2009: the IT platform currently used solely for Tenders called according to the Qualification Systems is expected to be extended to all Tender procedures implemented by Procurement Department. This will lead to considerable streamlining for this process – both with respect to supplier and customer – providing obvious benefits in terms of transparency and reduction of consumption in paper while complying with laws concerning storage, which is warranted by the Acea partner Portal. A number of projects that commenced last year also continued, including Acea for Innovation and Vendor Rating applied in the energy works area. More specifically, Acea for Innovation was launched in September 2008 to create a specific channel to collect “innovative ideas” for processes or products and from anyone and was presented at the “Matching 2009” Workshop in Milan in a meeting with the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) and Consorzio Roma Ricerche (Roman Research Consortium CRR) from the Polo Tecnologico Romano (Roman Technological Area). The website established for this project – www.aceainnovazione.com – received 47 “ideas” concerning water, services, electricity, renewable energy and ICT. The project ended 74 Both the Code of Ethics for Tenders and the Acea Group Code of Ethics are available online on corporate website (Suppliers section and Regulations and Values section). SUPPLIERS 105 in September 2009: 5 of the ideas received were considered appropriate and innovative for the Group and are currently undergoing testing and on-site implementation. Vendor Rating was applied in the system for qualifying energy-related works and aims to improve quality of works and their related safety through assessment of the performances of companies working on sites. This system commenced in 2008 as part of a wider Safety Project implemented by Acea Distribuzione and became part of the Company Qualification System Regulations in July 2009 (energy works). Progressive application between 2008 and 2009 has already had positive effects along the entire supply chain (see relative box in Supplier Assessment). The Acea SpA Procurement Department accepted a proposal from the French Embassy in 2009 as part of a project entitled Mission Economiques, which led to two meetings with a number of companies from France and from other countries operating in Acea business-related areas that wished to discover the company’s procurement needs in view of possible commercial relations. Further to these meetings, bilateral meetings were organized between producers and a number of Acea Group companies. Procurement of Commodities, Services and Works Reference Scope The information illustrated here concerns the following Group companies: Acea SpA, Acea Distribuzione, Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici, Ecogena, Acea Ato 2, LaboratoRI, Acea Ato 5, Acea Ato 5 Servizi, Acea Gori Servizi, Acea Ricerca Perdite, Sarnese Vesuviano, Acea8cento, Marco Polo (Acea branch), Acea Risorse e Impianti per l’Ambiente – ARIA (formerly TAD Energia Ambiente), Eall, SAO, Terni En.A, Enercombustibili, Ergo Ena, Apice, Ecoenergie and some of the procurement concerning companies involved in the joint venture with Electrabel AceaElectrabel, AceaElectrabel Produzione, AceaElectrabel Trading, AceaElectrabel Elettricità. NB: the companies whose tenders were managed for the first time in 2009 are shown in bold. The number of Group companies for which the Acea SpA Procurement Department Centrally manages tenders for product supplies, services and works (see box Reference Scope) grows year by year. Despite this fact, the overall economic value of contracts won, amounting to 510.5 million euro75, decreased this year too with respect to the roughly 568 million in 2008, following the trend of the last three years. With respect to last year, the amount used to procure commodities increased, especially in relation to supplies for Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici, whereas the costs for contracting works and requests for services decreased, although the latter counts for around 50% the overall amounts involved (see Chart 23). The percentages concerning tenders for the specific areas of energy (networks and market), water, the environment and energy (Waste-To-Energy), and corporate are illustrated in Chart 24: the share for the water sector increased with respect to last year, due to the higher number of companies involved in procurement service (see notes to Chart), and the share for the energy networks, especially in relation to photovoltaic energy. Acea implements procedures in compliance with that established in part 3 of the Code for Tenders (Italian Legislative Decree 163/2006) and in-house Regulations for tenders under the European Community limit in compliance with the principles established by the EC Treaty to safeguard competition (see sub-sections Commodities and Services; Works) when procuring works, commodities and services for the special areas of water and energy. Acea announces procedures in public evidence for tenders not involving these special areas in compliance with applicable laws and standards for the sector in question. A Requirements Plan (for commodities and services) and a Contract Plan (for works) are drawn up every year to help organize tenders. 75 This amount refers to tenders won throughout the year and do not distinguish between operations and investment, yearly and several-year agreements. “Commodities” and a large section of services and general costs of companies in JV with Electrabel are excluded, as these are directly managed by company/departments in question. 106 Chart 23 – VALUE OF TENDERS AND INCIDENCE OF VARIOUS TYPES ON OVERALL AMOUNT (2007-2009) Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders 19% 18% 28% 43% 30% 22% 38% 52% 50% (millions euro) 2007 2008 2009 commodities 109 101 144 services 223 295 253 works 253 172 113 total 585 568 510 Chart 24 – PROCUREMENT COST SHARES ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC AREA (COMMODITIES, SERVICES, WORKS) (2007-2009) corporate energy corporate energy corporate energy environment environment environment and energy and energy and energy water water water 2007 2008 2009 % % % energy (*) 37 37 40.6 energy networks 25 24 34.1 energy market 12 13 6.5 water (**) 40 31 37.5 environment and energy (Waste-To-Energy) (***) 9 14 4.7 corporate (Group services) (****) 28 14 18 (*) Energy networks in the energy area comprises operational companies responsible for distribution, public lighting and added value energy services: Acea Distribuzione SpA, Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici SpA, Ecogena, Luce Napoli (the latter commenced winding up at the end of 2008 and only receives procurement of “services”) The energy market includes companies in the joint-venture with AceaElectrabel that produce, trade and sell energy to the free and the protected market, procurement for which is partly managed by the Acea SpA Procurement Department.

Online Tenders are published in the Suppliers Section on the corporate Website (www.acea.it); this site provides information and contacts, tender regulations, forms and Qualification Systems. The relative IT portal currently under improvement can be used to ensure integrated management of Qualification Systems and tenders called among companies registered with the systems. This portal reproduces the operational procedures for traditional tenders online, whereby the documentation sent by companies is examined to ensure they fulfil requirements and then asked to make their economic bids, after which the classification is immediately viewed. SUPPLIERS 107 Commodities and Services The amount used to purchase commodities and services in 2009 came to 397 million euro (around 396 million in 2008), accounting for 77.8% of the overall amount spent on procurement. Although the costs for commodities and services increased by just 0.2% in absolute terms with respect to the year before, the incidence on overall procurement costs increased by over 7 percent. The most active Group companies in these areas were Acea Ato 2 (over 92 million euro) and Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici (over 77 million euro). The energy sector (networks and market) is responsible for around 45% of the value of contracted commodities and services, followed by water with 27%, corporate (Group services) with 22%, and the environment and energy (Waste-To-Energy), which is responsible for 6% of costs. Acea applies In-house Regulations76 for supplies of commodities and services below the European limit (of 412,000 euro), which were adopted in 2008 and involve two tender procedures: Ordinary Procedure: online tenders for companies registered with Qualification Systems; Extraordinary Procedure: tenders called with single announcement. Tenders and relative documentation are published online and companies can directly access these at no cost. In 2009, 345 tenders were called77 through publication on the corporate website and 15 tenders through European competition. The top 10 suppliers of the Group received 26.6% of the overall amount spent on commodities and services. Box – Purchase Portal for Collective Agreements The Procurement Department implemented a platform to A project to integrate the portal with corporate accounting manage collective agreements in 2009: travel and transfers, systems also commenced to show situations concerning receipt stationery, printers, toner and other consumables. This purchase of materials, cost summaries and authorization to invoice in portal was used by 82 users and over 600 orders were made real time. for 19 Group companies. Collective management led to Suppliers can access this information, obviously a great benefit considerable streamlining in costs and consumption of around to operational relations. 26% in travel and transfer expenses, 24% in stationery, 4% in toner and inkjet, 34% in printers and other consumables.

Contracting works below the European Community limit (5.150 million euro) has been carried out according to two procedures established in the In-house Regulations78 adopted by Acea since 2006: Ordinary Procedure: online tenders for companies registered with Qualification Systems; Extraordinary Procedure: this is used for works not covered by Qualification Systems. Tenders are called with a single announcement and a mechanism for assessing out of the ordinary bids is drawn79. Tenders called according the ordinary procedure are published online in Suppliers section of the Acea website. Tender announcements are also published in the Official Journal and daily newspapers. The procedures for contracting works80 in 2009 amounted to 59, involving 116 batches. The overall percentage of works contracted through tenders was 91.5%: there were 54 tenders in all, 9 of which followed an informal procedure, 41 of which were online tenders and 4 of which were announced (1 European and 3 through an Extraordinary Procedure). Chart 25 illustrates the geographic distribution of companies awarded batches and relative amounts for the last three years. As you can see, with respect to more diversified division in the previous two-year period, companies in Central Italy – in which Acea is more operational – were responsible for over 92% of the overall amount of contracted works in 2009, while just over 7% went to companies in the south and 0.3% companies in the north. Furthermore, with regard to Central Italy (from Emilia Romagna to Abruzzo), companies from Rome and the province of Rome were contracted for around 97 million euro (with respect to 63 million in 2008 and 137 million in 2007), which is almost 86% of the overall amount for works for 2009, thereby confirming considerable effects on local related industries.

There are four possibilities, which are described in the Tender regulations. This prevents entrepreneurs from establishing “cartels”, which can affect averages and “rigging” the tender results to thereby safeguard the principle of fair competition. 80 Excluding tenders carried out by companies in the Joint Venture (AceaElectrabel); the only one of these to contract works in 2009 was AceaElectrabel Produzione, amounting to 0.1% of the overall value of tenders. This contract was decided via a tender. SUPPLIERS 109 Supplier Assessment For some years now, Acea has implemented and regularly updated a number of Qualification Systems81 for suppliers of works, commodities and services: companies wishing to be included are required to comply with general requirements established by niche legislation (so-called “moral requirements”) and the special requirements (technical and quality-related) established for each system and described in the respective Qualification Regulations. The requirements of a moral nature established by Law include compliance with legal obligations concerning the payment of duties, taxes and social security contributions for employees (confirmed by a DURC – Documento Unico di Regolarità Contributiva – Tax Compliance Certificate) and compliance with laws on safety and any other obligations concerning employer-employee relations. The special requirements include possession of an apposite Corporate Quality System Certificate, in compliance with UNI EN standards, also when not compulsory to the effects and purposes of current laws. All Qualification Systems established in Acea are extremely high-powered as companies can subscribed to the Register at any time by forwarding an application and relative documentation and companies can be suspended from the Register in the event of failure to comply with any of the established requirements. The requirements concerning Companies already included in Acea Qualification Systems are automatically updated and checked. The Qualification Systems established by Acea are as follows: 1. a Qualification System for companies carrying out works – energy sector (networks, rooms and public and artistic lighting, district heating)82 2. a Qualification System for companies carrying out works – water sector, 2009 edition (water and sewage networks; aqueduct pipes and main sewages; drinking water supply wells) 3. a Qualification System for works – electromechanical water sector (mechanical system, electricity systems, telecommunications and automation systems) 4. a Qualification System for motor pump supplies 5. a Qualification System for electric cable supplies 6. a Qualification System for transformer supplies. The new regulations for the Qualification System for Works – Water Sector was published in July 2009, following which applications for renewal from qualified companies and a large number of new applications for registration arrived, leading to 106 companies registered with the System by 31 December 2009 (88 the year before). The Qualification System for Works in the Electromechanical Water Sector established in 2008 also received new applications, increasing from 11 companies to 28 as at 31/12/2009. In relation to the Qualification System Works – Energy Sector (42 companies registered as at 31/12/2009), the validity of which has been extended to the beginning of 2010 due to review of the relative Regulations, performance assessments for contractors in relation to quality and safety continued through Vendor rating (see box). Furthermore, in December 2009, Acea Distribuzione drew up and adopted a Policy for Health and Safety in the Workplace as a further step forward towards implementing a System to manage health and safety 81 The Regulations for all Acea Qualification System are available online at www.acea.it, Suppliers section. 82 The System was updated in 2010 and involves signing the Policy for Health and Safety in the Workplace as a condition for acceptance. 110 in the workplace according to recommendations in Standard OHSAS:2007 (Occupational Health & Safety Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Assessment Series), which is due for completion by the end of 2010. In line with the commitment made by the company to ensure that every employee of the Company or Contractors can carry out their jobs safely, with a suitable level of training/information and specific roles and responsibilities, the Policy for Health and Safety in the Workplace was widely distributed and published on the corporate website, Suppliers section. Finally, companies have only registered with two of the three Qualification Systems for commodities established in 2008 – for supplies of electric cables, transformers and motor pumps. There were 7 companies on the Register for electric cable supplies and 3 companies for transformer supplies as at 31 December 2009. Box – Policy for Health and Safety in the Workplace on the Acea Website: Suppliers Section Dear Company, ACEA DISTRIBUZIONE S.P.A. would hereby like to inform you that it has adopted a Safety Management System designed and developed according to International Standard OHSAS 18001:2007 (Occupational Health & Safety Assessment Series). For this purpose, ACEA DISTRUZIONE S.P.A. Top Management has draw up “Health and Safety in the Workplace Policy” and has decided to diffuse such among employees, suppliers and visitors of ACEA DISTRIBUZIONE S.P.A. Please read this Policy carefully and ensure it is diffused throughout your Company. Box – Vendor Rating: Improved “Indicator of Reputation” for Companies in Terms of Quality and Safety The Vendor rating system implemented the year before was quality standards. The Acea Distribuzione “Site Inspection” further extended in 2009.

Chart 26 – PERCENTAGE OF ADDED VALUE DISTRIBUTED AMONG EMPLOYEES (2009) employees 33.4% Management of corporate processes concerning human resources – selection, training, capitalizing on human resources also through bonuses – is of fundamental strategic importance and, if governed correctly, can ensure high performances from human capital and consequently positively affect the quality of corporate services. Acea states in the Quality Handbook that «human resources are the fundamental active element in this organization through which it operates and regenerates, which is essential to ensuring effectiveness and efficiency in situations such as the current one». The percentage of added value distributed among employees in 2009 of 33.4% amounts to around 296 million euro (with respect to 256 million euro the year before), thereby increasing by 15.7% with respect to 2008. Human Resources in Acea The Human Resources and Services Division in Acea SpA establishes Group policies in terms of human resources, organization and industrial relations and ensures they are correctly applied, in accordance with corporate strategic policies. This Division also ensures staff management in terms of productivity, labour costs, training, development of occupational skills and – centrally – security and safety. This Division therefore interacts with the industrial areas and operational human resource teams in the various Group companies. The number of employees in Group companies84 once again increased in 2009 from 6,588 to 6,720 staff members, an increase of 2% (see Table 43). The highest increase in employees derives from the water sector (+3%), mainly due to consolidation of Nuove Acque – operating in ATO 4-Alto Valdarno in Tuscany – and merging resources from the organizations that formerly worked in the municipalities in which management was taken over. The number of human resources in the holding and Acea8cento also increased (+2%), while the number of employees in the energy sector basically remained stable. 83 See Table 5 on the consolidation scope in Corporate Identity. 84 This is the number of employees per percentage of consolidation. 112 Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Table 43 – EVOLUTION IN GROUP EMPLOYEES BY SECTOR (2007-2009) (numbers for period end per percentage of consolidation) business area 2007 2008 2009 (no. employees) (no. employees) (no. employees) water 3,497 3,807 3,921 Lazio-Campania 2,159 2,283 2,294 Tuscany-Umbria 537 669 720 overseas and laboratories 801 855 907 energy 2,056 2,096 2,099 networks 1,672 1,613 1,596 market 219 310 324 environment and energy 165 173 179 structure (Acea SpA+Acea8cento) 495 685 700 total 6,048 6,588 6,720 Chart 27 – EVOLUTION IN GROUP EMPLOYEES BY SECTOR (2007-2009) (numbers for period end per percentage of consolidation) water 4,000 energy structure 3,000 2,000 1,000 2007 2008 2009 The added value produced per head85 in 2009 amounted to 132.6 thousand euro, decreasing by 16.5% with respect to the previous year (158.7 thousand euro). With regard to geographic location of employees, figures demonstrate Acea’s presence throughout the country and settlement in areas beyond the traditional scope of interest of the Group, in other words Lazio. In fact, the number of employees operating in central-north Italy (Tuscany-Umbria and Lombardia) increased by 7.3% with respect to 2008, reaching 886 units, whereas the overall workforce of the Group operating in central-south Italy (Lazio, Campania, Puglia) increased by around 1.5%, passing from 5,046 resources to 5,121. Employees in overseas subsidiaries decreased by 3% (from 716 in 2008 to 695 in 2009).

Table 45 highlights the changes in numbers of employees occurring in 2009, for each occupational category. During the three-year period 2007-2009, despite the increase in absolute terms in the numbers of employees in categories executives, middle management and white-collar workers, the percentage import of the three categories on the overall workforce remained more or less stable, amounting to 2.5%, 6.6% e 60.6% respectively in 2009. The blue-collar workers category slightly but constantly decreased in the threeyear period taken into account, both in absolute terms and as percentages. The number of women on the workforce in 2009 increased, covering 21.4% of the overall workforce (see Table 53).

Qualified human resources join the company (see Table 46) through recruitment on the outside labour market (177 resources in 2009), merging resources from companies acquired due to expansion in the water sector (23 resources in 2009) and due to redundancy within the Group, whereby employees are relocated to other Group companies (10 resources in 2009). Demand for human resources is also satisfied by stabilizing resources already employed in-house with “temporary” contracts. The companies most involved in hiring in 2009 were Acea Ato2 (57 resources), the companies in the Joint Venture (49 resources in all), Acea SpA (38 resources), Acea Distribuzione (22 resources) and Acea8cento (17 resources) . Young people on their first approach to employment are encouraged to join the company through professional training contracts, 6 resources in 2009, and vocational apprenticeships, 39 units in 2009, and project-related contracts, 47 resources in 2009. By way of optimizing the size of the workforce and ensuring it fulfils management and organizational needs, the Company also encourages changeover of staff through bonuses for voluntary redundancy and mobility. These systems both continued through 2009, with 19 employees taking voluntary redundancy and 40 employees undergoing mobility (see Table 46), nonetheless the number of employees leaving the company reduced by around 16% with respect to 2008. Furthermore, the first voluntary and bonus-linked redundancy procedure was introduced in Acea Ato 2 in November for resources approaching retirement and commenced in January 2010 (see Industrial Relations). 114 Table 46– ACEA’S HUMAN RESOURCES: NEW RECRUITS AND LEAVERS (2007-2009) Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders 2007 2008 2009 NEW RECRUITS(*) men women total men women total men women total permanent positions 160 55 215 127 86 213 94 36 130 temporary positions 13 4 17 13 6 19 19 16 35 professional training contracts 47 10 57 5 6 11 4 2 6 vocational training contracts 71 76 147 21 18 39 total 220 69 289 211 173 390 138 72 210 (of which) staff acquired from Public Authorities 9 3 12 21 8 29 23 0 23 LEAVERS (**) men women total men women total men women total mobility 15 2 17 46 9 55 32 8 40 redundancies 33 1 34 22 3 25 17 2 19 retirement 11 2 13 9 0 9 8 0 8 dismissals 4 0 4 9 1 10 2 2 4 other 34 7 41 55 15 70 53 18 71 total 97 12 109 141 28 169 112 30 142 average workforce 3,624 825 4,449 3,718 911 4,629 3,784 1,015 4,799 (*) This item includes resources hired on the outside market, from company mergers and Public Authorities, as well as resources moved from Group companies both included and excluded from report scope.

In relation to Group companies operating in the energy sector, 71% of staff due to leave throughout the year (76 employees) had done maximum service time of 30 years and 28% service time of between 30 and 40 years, thereby demonstrating the level of stability in employment in Acea. The number of new recruits hired with permanent contracts and vocational training contracts decreased in 2009, while those hired with temporary contracts increased. It must however be pointed out that most employees have safeguarded and guaranteed employment terms and conditions (see Table 48); in fact, the following have increased: • staff with permanent contracts: this type of contract maintained its incidence at around 95% over the three years in question; • staff with vocational training contracts: this type of contract lasts between 24 and 42 months depending on the education and occupation involved and guarantees resources ongoing on-site training and prospects for stable employment; • staff with temporary contracts: of all non-stable contracts available, this type of contract offers the same benefits and guarantees as permanent contracts in proportion to the length of service provided (holidays, Christmas bonus, bonus extra wage and all other benefits provided).

The average age of employees and service length remained substantially stable over the three years in question (see Tables 50 and 51). The number of employees with degrees or diplomas increased in 2009 (see Table 52). In line with the trend for the previous two-year period, the incidence of graduates on the overall workforce increased by around one percent (from 14.6% in 2008 to 15.4% in 2009), that of employees with diplomas basically remained stable at around 49% while those with other qualifications – generally lower – constantly but slightly decreased. The incidence of women graduates with respect to all graduates (38.2%) and to the overall number of women employees (27.5%) remained stable with respect to the year before.

Group (formerly TAD Energia Ambiente): Terni En.A., EALL, SAO and Enercombustibili. The Consolidated Agreement for the Electricity Sector and the Consolidated Agreement for the Gas-Water Sector (Collective National Labour Agreements CCNL) and the existing Contract with the Company Acea8cento are the types of Agreement applied in Acea: 100% of the Company’s human resources are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The percentage of employees that were members of Trade Unions in 2009 reached 71.4% (69.6% in 2008) and 381 resources were executives or representatives of Trade Unions, 7 of which in the role of Safety Representatives. Negotiations to renew the Collective National Labour Agreement for the Electricity Sector86 which expired at the end of June commenced in the second half of 2009. Industrial Relations87 carried out by the company throughout 2009 led to an important agreement concerning agreements: in fact, harmonization of economic and legislative conditions was established for staff from Public Authorities hired by Acea Ato 2 further to mergers and some of whom already operating, for which the Consolidated Agreement for the Gas-Water Sector was applied. Negotiations for production bonuses were held as part of second-level negotiations pursuant to the Collective National Labour Agreement according to the commitments made on signing the Acea8cento Corporate Agreement. This agreement is effective 2009-2012 and established implementation of a service to replace the canteen through “lunch vouchers” and subscription of employees with corporate agreements at the Acea Group Corporate Recreation Club as of 2010. With regard to labour organization, the following agreements were signed: further to application of the Consolidated Agreement for the Electricity Sector, a number of working hours and shifts and semi-shifts were reviewed for staff in the Environment and Energy industrial sector, thereby improving compliance with processes. with regard to Acea Distribuzione, discussions concerning redefinition of the territorial responsibility for acting and assigning emergency repair staff were completed and discussions concerning changes to organization and supervision of processes relating to Measurement and Fault Identification Team were completed to improve service levels, establishing new shift working hours. Further discussions concerning outsourcing of installation and implementation of electronic meters were also planned; with regard to Acea8cento and AceaElectrabel Produzione, agreements concerning working hours and shifts were reached. 86 Negotiations to renew agreements concluded successfully in 2010. 87 Also carried out for companies in A.R.I.A. Group in 2009: EALL, SAO, Terni En.A. and Enercombustibili. HUMAN RESOURCES 117 Numerous trade union procedures to the effects and purposes of Article 2112 of the Italian Civil Code were held throughout the year to verify the extent of protection for employees further to transferral of companies: they all involved Acea Ato 2 hiring staff from the organizations acquired during corporate expansion to complete the ATO Plan. Redundancy procedures concerning Acea Distribuzione and Acea Ato 2 were also completed: in relation to the former, by way of proceeding with actions already implemented in previous years, to the latter in an innovative manner, as this was the first time this procedure was implemented. Employees were encouraged to leave by offering extra bonuses and, in compliance with the principle of non-traumatic management of overstaffing adopted by the Group, by identifying the workers in the overstaffed areas and positions that were entitled to retire by the end of the third year after being placed in redundancy. As far as notice to employees concerning changes to organization or corporate re-engineering affecting employer-employee relations is concerned, it must be pointed out that the company acts according to the following different situations: 1. changes to organization: in the event that new Divisions are established or mission is amended, the Acea SpA Human Resources and Services Division shall issue an Organizational Provision and publish such on the notice-board and corporate Intranet. The Trade Union discussions indicated below are usually implemented for changes affecting workers; in the event that such affect an individual worker (e.g. change to workplace, working hours, etc.), such is sent specific notification; 2. corporate re-engineering: in the event of re-engineering further to substantial changes in organization or production that affect working conditions and employment, procedures for notifying employees are subject to the Collective National Labour Agreements applied by the Group and Industrial Relations Protocols; 3. corporate transformations (such as transfers, mergers or acquisitions or company branches): in the event of corporate transformations, notifications for employees are subject to current laws88 whereby company is obliged to inform representatives and the institutions responsible from a territorial viewpoint to ensure they can check that procedures are carried out correctly and the effects on employer-employee relations. Box – Controversy with Employees and Trade Unions Controversies implemented by employees against Acea generally (currently Almaviva Contact) and from B2WIN concerning involve dismissal, recognition of superior levels, review of levels presumed illegal replacement of labourers are ongoing. and other matters of little consequence due to their scarcity (e.g. With regard to Industrial Relations, two proceedings against specific allowances, recalculation of due wages and opposition Acea Group companies concerning anti-trade union conduct to roles and workplaces). were implemented by Trade Unions in relation to the agreement In 2009 there was a controversy concerning dismissal – solved signed on 18.12.2008 (mainly involving establishment of fourthrough negotiation –, a limited number (under ten cases) of year bonuses, increases to lunch vouchers and payment of procedures for promotion and very few cases of role review from reduced supply costs for employees). Both these proceedings previous years. were held at the Rome Court of Law and ended in favour of the Proceedings concerning employees from the former COS Company. 88 Article 2112 of the Italian Civil Code and Article 47, Italian Law 428/90 and subsequent amendments further to Italian Legislative Decree 276/2003. 118 Diversity and Equal Opportunities Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Reference Scope The information and figures provided in Diversity and Equal Opportunities concern: Acea SpA, Acea Distribuzione, Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici, Acea Ato 2, Acea Ato 5, LaboratoRI, the 4 companies in the JV with Electrabel and Acea8cento. Diversity Acea hires and integrates staff from protected categories (differently-abled, orphans, etc), who are guaranteed support, assistance and technical tools (such as modified telephones) to help them carry out their duties, also through support from the Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi Civili (ANMIC – National Association for Disabled and Invalid Civilians). Staff in protected categories amounted to 234 human resources (143 men and 91 women) as at 31/12/2009, in compliance with that established by current laws (Italian Law 68/99). Equal Opportunities An Equal Opportunities Commission (CPO) was established in Acea in 1991 to advocate tangible policies and action to support equal opportunities for the sexes and full integration of professional categories and oppose any form of discrimination. This Commission has 12 members, 9 of which are appointed by the Trade Union and 3 of which by the Company (10 white-collar workers, 1 middle-manager and 1 executive), plus a secretary. The CPO works to raise awareness and spread a culture for equal opportunities both throughout the company, via a specific section on the corporate intranet accessible to all employees, and outside the company, via initiatives to develop cooperation with similar organizations, such as the CPO network established by Rome Provincial Council Office for Equal Opportunities. Acea’s policy for protecting equal opportunities involves both Regulations for safeguarding the dignity of men and women and an Advisor (operating since 2006). This is an outside expert whose job is to gather and solve any reports of discrimination, sexual harassment and mobbing. As far as 2008-2009 are concerned, Acea, in compliance with law, wrote a two-year report on sexes to illustrate the situation concerning male and female employees (numbers, occupational level, etc.). This document is written by Acea SpA Human Resources and Services Department and is forwarded to the Equal Opportunities Commission and Trade Unions, which subsequently present specific projects. This Commission underwent considerable change in 2009 further to the resignation of a number of members, which reduced its operational capacity. Acea is well aware of the value that this Commission has created both for the company and its human resources over the years and is therefore reorganizing the CPO in order to breathe new life into current projects and develop new ones. Women in Acea Table 53 – WOMEN IN ACEA (2007-2009) 2007 2008 2009 percentage women vs. overall workforce 18.6% 20.8% 21.4% percentage women vs. overall corporate governance board members (*) 10.8% 9.4% 11.6% percentage women vs. overall executives 18.0% 17.8% 17.4% percentage women vs. overall middle management 24.9% 25.9% 25.2% percentage women graduates vs. overall graduates 36.0% 38.0% 38.2% (*) Board of Directors, Board of Statutory Auditors and Supervisory Boards of companies within the report scope. HUMAN RESOURCES 119 The incidence of women with respect to the overall workforce constantly increased over the three-year period 2007-2009 to reach 21.4% in 2009. Table 53 illustrates that the number of women in executive and middle management positions remained stable and the number of women in corporate governance boards increased by around two percent in 2009 following a slight decrease in 2008. The Investor Relations Division, Customer Care Department and Risk Control Department were all headed by women in 2009. Working Hours and Absence Reference Scope The information and figures presented in Working Hours and Absence concern: Acea SpA, Acea Distribuzione, Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici, Acea Ato 2, Acea Ato 5, LaboratoRI, the 4 companies in the JV with Electrabel and Acea8cento. The overall number of hours worked increased in 2009, mainly due to an increase in “standard working hours” of both men and women. The percentage of standard working hours for both men and women with respect to the respective hours worked (standard and overtime) increased slightly (by 0.6% for men and by 0.2% for women). The overall figure for overtime and relative percentage incidence on overall number of hours worked decreased from 6.8% in 2008 to 6.1% in 2009 (see Table 54). In relative terms, the incidence of overtime by men and women with respect to their respective overall hours worked decreased more for men (from 7.6% in 2008 to 7% in 2009) than for women (from 2.5% in 2008 to 2.3% in 2009) and, in absolute terms, women’s overtime slightly increased. The overall days of absence increased by 0.7% in 2009 with respect to 2008. The number of absences for maternity leave, leave of absence and various types of authorized absence increased between 2008 and 2009 while sick leave and leave for strike action decreased, the latter illustrating the more relaxed climate in negotiations between the company and trade unions.

Group: EALL, Terni En.A, SAO, Enercombustibili. All Group companies manage safety in compliance with current laws, independently and taking full and direct responsibility. The Holding Company also has a Safety and Protection Department with the job of providing companies guidelines and technical and expert support in improving safety in the workplace management, thereby helping further consolidate this aspect throughout the company. In 2009, the number of companies monitoring health and safety in the workplace and accidents to check the reliability of safety system increased. For this purpose, questionnaires were used to assess “safety management” with respect to legislation, the type of activities carried out, risk assessment, information and training, accident monitoring systems, etc. On-site inspections and meetings with Prevention and Protection Service officers were organized to complete this survey. Analysis of the results illustrated that the companies in question adopt reliable safety systems ensuring that they manage this aspect in full compliance with current laws and standards. Group companies keep risks for workers under control and monitor accidents. Furthermore, in 2009 Acea SpA Safety and Protection Department wrote an accident report on 35 Group companies subject to high risk levels and types due to the work they carry out. The procedure used to analyze accidents complies with the Guidelines for Classifying Accidents, written by FederUtility and in compliance with Standard UNI 7249/95, in relation to INAIL parameters and indications from ESAW (European Statistics of Accidents at Work). Acea Ato 2 began assessment of risks from work-related stress in 2009 which led to plans for specific training to begin in 2010. Safety is an essential element in corporate organization; increased awareness of the importance of safety can only come about through knowledge. For this purpose, a training course was developed and provided to all employees and the section of the corporate intranet dedicated to safety was further enhanced with new contents, documents and updates. Acea regularly consults the safety representatives of workers (Rls) to present strategic projects for improving health and safety in the workplace, Risk Assessment Documents and any other related aspects. Safety is also overseen via constant communication with the best experts from the political, institutional and professional worlds (see box in Institutions and the Company on the roundtable with Institutions organized at Acea Congress Center). On the whole in 2009, 357 accidents were reported, 69 of which in itinere (in other words while travelling to/from work/home) (see Chart 28), which led to 18,436 days of sick leave, to which 2,243 days of sick leave due to accidents occurring the year before should be added, therefore reaching a total of 20,679 days of absence due to accident. This increase in the number of accidents with respect to the two-year period before derives from the inclusion of other Group companies in the report scope for this section as of 2009. Furthermore, the severity index also considerably increased due to classification of the death of an Acea Ato 2 employee due to natural causes during working hours as a fatal accident89. 89 We would like to point out that 7,500 days of absence are registered for the calendar year in question in the event of fatal accidents; excluding this in 2009, the severity index would have been 1.02 and the frequency index would have been 27.66. HUMAN RESOURCES 121 The separation of accidents by company aggregated according to industrial area are illustrated in Chart 28. Most accidents involved operational companies Acea Distribuzione and Acea Ato 2 (which respectively reported 106 and 70 accidents). In 2009, regular meetings were held with the Safety Representatives of workers, in compliance with that established in Article 35, Italian Legislative Decree 81/08.

Group companies: EALL, Terni En.A. SAO and Enercombustibili. Health Monitoring is the responsibility of an in-house department operating in compliance with current laws (Article 41, Italian Legislative Decree 81/08) and cooperating with outside experts. Staff health is monitored with support from formally appointed qualified doctors, who carry out medical check-ups at various times in an employee’s working life – on recruitment (pre-employment check-up), following changes to specific duties (preventive check-up), for the purposes of risk assessment (regular check-up), on request from employee (special check-up), in the cases established by the law (check-up on termination of employment or on retirement) –, to provide an opinion concerning an employee’s suitability to a specific job. Special medical check-ups are also guaranteed for workers exposed to specific risks. By way of safeguarding the psychological and physical health of workers, qualified doctors cooperate with employers and Protection and Prevention Service Officers to assess the risks to which employees are subjected and draw up the relative health monitoring plan. During 2009, 2,016 check-ups were carried out; the relative costs90 amounted to around 171 thousand euro. There is also a First Aid Station to guarantee corporate employees and visitors first aid in the event of ailments not requiring hospital treatment. Capitalizing on Human Resources and Communication Reference Scope The information and figures presented in Capitalizing on Human Resources and Communication concern: Acea SpA, Acea Distribuzione, Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici, Acea Ato 2, Acea Ato 5, LaboratoRI, the 4 companies in the JV with Electrabel and Acea8cento. Plans for developing and capitalizing on corporate human resources are drawn up according to a system of objectives that comply with corporate policies. This system involves assessing organizational positions, identifying the competencies and responsibilities of workers, monitoring performances and recognizing and managing the needs of employees in terms of professional development and wages. In order to effectively fill positions and roles, the company initially analyzes in-house resources before assessing the opportunity of transferring resources from within the group or selecting recruits from the outside market; the latter is only adopted when specific skills not already available or that cannot be developed rapidly in-house are required. 90 The costs relating to regular and pre-recruitment check-ups refer to the report scope for this section. HUMAN RESOURCES 123 Salaries Employees’ salaries (excluding executives and top management) are established according to relative National Collective Labour Agreements. Average gross salaries paid in the main Group companies91 confirm constant adjustment to amounts which increased at all levels (see Table 56): with respect to 2008, middle-management received the largest increase (+7.4%), followed by white-collar workers (+2.5%), while blue-collar workers received a slight increase (0.3%). Table 56 – AVERAGE GROSS SALARY ACCORDING TO ROLE (2007-2009) (in thousands of euro) middle-management % adjustment white-collar workers % adjustment blue-collar workers % adjustment 2007 59.1 1.7% 36.5 1.1% 34.0 2.1% 2008 60.5 2.4% 38.9 6.8% 35.4 4.1% 2009 65 7.4% 39.9 2.5% 35.5 0.3% Taking into account average gross salaries per head solely for the minimum wage levels in Acea for the above categories, the amounts (in thousands of euro) were as follows: middle management, 59.8; whitecollar workers, 15.9; blue-collar workers, 15.9. Including also executives – subject to a specific national agreement – the overall average gross salaries increased by 2.9% with respect to 2008 (see Table 57). The overall salaries established by the Salary Committee for key managers according to market wage levels amounted to around 2 million euro, including bonuses, plus 80 thousand euro due to benefits, which decreased with respect to 2008 (around 2.7 million euro – salaries and bonuses – plus 105 thousand euro in benefits). An exceptional event in 2009 involved the Company paying 6.7 million euro further to resignation of a number of former Directors and top management. The year 2009 was also the last period for capitalizing on the long-term monetary incentives for top management involving payment of an amount calculated as a percentage of gross annual earnings on achieving specific targets. These amounts and details concerning each member of the Acea SpA Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors are published in the Acea Group Consolidated Financial Statement each year, which is available on the corporate website. Table 57 – OVERALL AVERAGE GROSS SALARIES (2007-2009) totals (in thousands of euro) % adjustment 2007 39.0 2.4% 2008 41.1 5.5% 2009 42.3 2.9% Bonus Systems The Bonus System adopted in Acea pays employees (whiteand blue-collar workers) an amount according to the commitment made in achieving corporate quality performances. The tools used in this system are linked to reviews of the set and variable elements in salaries and involve various bonus mechanisms: raises, promotions to higher occupational levels, payment of ad personam bonuses such as one-off bonuses. 91 In this case, the economic figure does not refer to the consolidation scope but to the report scope for this section comprising Acea SpA, Acea Distribuzione, Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici, Acea Ato 2, Acea Ato 5, LaboratoRi, the companies in the Joint Venture with AceaElectrabel and Acea8cento. 124 The bonus system for staff employed with permanent contracts (both full and part time) is based on “results” Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders and is paid annually according to the occupational level and hours worked throughout the year. This payment is based on indicators concerning profitability, productivity and efficiency, safety and quality delivered and perceived (in fact, an indicator regarding the level of customer satisfaction is also taken into account). Trade Union Agreements reached in 2009 (see Industrial Relations) in Acea8cento led to introduction of an annual bonus involving a special aspect: 40% of the overall bonus is calculated using two individual productivity indicators – service level and average time to reply – which are strictly related to the service levels established in agreements between Acea Group companies and Acea8cento. Meritand salarybased policies implemented by Acea Ato 2 in 2009 mainly involved realignment of salaries for staff on lower pay-grades to match the duties they effectively carry out. The bonus system adopted for executive and middle-management, as well as top management, involves: • MBO (Management By Objectives): this bonus is calculated in proportion to the extent to which individual, corporate (company or sector) and Group targets set at the beginning of the year are reached, including assessment of organizational conduct; • a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP): this is a monetary bonus for Top Management paid once the economic and financial targets set for 2007-2009 were achieved, also in addition to DPO bonuses. A number of benefits are also provided, such as additional monthly wages, lunch vouchers, reduced rates (for staff hired before 2000), benefits received via the Corporate Recreation Club, integrative health insurance UNIPOL, a complementary pension fund for this sector (“Pegaso Fund” for employees and “Previndai Fund” for executives) and an agreement with the Monte dei Paschi di Siena Bank. There are also additional benefits for executives (e.g., company car and fuel expenses). The overall amount earmarked for staff leaving indemnities and other defined-benefit plans to pay employees on termination of employment contract decreased from 127 million euro in 2008 to 123 million euro in 2009. Pension Funds with Set Contributions Acea employees belong to two complementary pension funds: Previndai for executives, whose employment is regulated by the relative National Collective Labour Agreement signed by Confservizi, and Pegaso for the other categories of workers in the public utilities sector. The latter is jointly managed by Federutility (an organization representing local public businesses in the water and electricity sectors) and Trade Unions FILCEM-CGIL, FEMCA, FLAEI-CISL and UILCEM-UIL. The overall number of workers that subscribed to the Pegaso Fund in 2009 was 30,335, an increase of 0.7% with respect to 2008, of which around 3,076 are Acea Group employees92. In view of the economic slump underway, the most important figure is the 33% growth in fund resources, which reached an overall value of 332 million euro. All sections (guaranteed, conservative, balanced and dynamic) had good returns both in absolute terms and with respect to Severance Pay, as illustrated in Table 58.

Group companies. HUMAN RESOURCES 125 Systems for Assessing Human Resources The structured system for assessing the performances of human resources became consolidated in 2009, extending to cover organizational conduct. This system works in harmony with the bonus system, as results are channelled into both staff development programmes and variable bonus programmes. The projects concerning staff development implemented in 2009 included the following: the Leader Plan: focusing on developing the managerial abilities of operational leaders in Acea Distribuzione, especially in terms of Productivity, Quality and Safety; Skills Inventory: implemented in Acea Ato 2 and focusing on establishing ideal occupational profiles and relative training needs, making an inventory of existing skills and rationalizing development plans. Training The Company’s “Human Capital” is a prosperous and varied asset expressing intellectual and professional skills, abilities in relationships, which requires appropriate sustenance including through training. A Training Cycle was therefore established for Acea, involving: analysis of training needs, creation of a training plan, provision of training courses and intermediate and final assessments of the results both in terms of alignment with set targets and in terms of satisfaction with training received. Corporate training aims to teach vocational know-how, technical skills and develop abilities in relating to people, self-organization and change. Acea SpA Human Resources and Services ensures Group companies – with the exception of those deriving from the Joint Venture between Acea and Electrabel – managerial training for both top and middle management and induction training to provide new recruits an overview of the Group’s organization (mission, procedures, codes of values, Italian Legislative Decree 231/01), and provides solely Acea SpA employees technical-specialist training, including on compliance with current legislation (such as safeguarding privacy and safety in the workplace). Operational companies directly train their staff in relation to technical-specialist skills and compliance with laws and standards. Joint venture companies are personally responsible for training policies for their staff and therefore establish a specific training plan further to analysis of training needs, which involved 3 separate areas in 2009: transversal training (management and administration, IT, etc.), technical and managerial.

Acea SpA Development and Training Department therefore produced guidelines for operational companies to outline a mutual model to manage training for this specific type of contract. Two types of experimental training courses were given for the first time in 2009 to develop relational skills in accordance with the compulsory training plan for apprentice contracts. The amount of understanding Acea8cento apprentices achieved was also assessed, thereby ensuring that action could be taken to improve training courses underway. The main training measures carried out by Group companies in 2009 included: • developing a training plan specifically for apprentices with detailed modules covering basic, sectorrelated and technical skills; • a “Safety Training Project”: a specific training course on compulsory training Health and Safety in the Workplace to the effects and purposes of updates to legislation (Italian Legislative Decree 81/08 and subsequent amendments), comprising two modules: a transversal module for all Acea SpA employees and a specific module for executives and Holding Company safety officers; • the corporate Masters Road Map programme (see box in Customers and the Community) organized by Acea Distribuzione for 23 corporate resources with technical university education, which dealt with the internal electricity market, regulating service continuity and the features and operations of electricity networks; • training carried out at Joint Venture companies as part of Fondo For.te – Fondo Paritetico Interprofessionale Nazionale per la Formazione Continua del Terziario (National Interprofessional Fund for Ongoing Training in the Service Sector) covering three areas: IT, languages and developing professional skills; • training for Acea8cento telephone operators, paying particular attention to the 80 resources with occupational apprenticeship contract, to ensure that resources could operate in all the services managed; • an e-learning course concerning Italian Legislative Decree 231/01 on anti-corruption measures for executives, middle management and white-collar workers with responsibilities; • training linked to introduction of the SAP ERP system in Joint Venture companies to manage all resources and production systems through new communication technologies. Throughout 2009, 483 training courses were provided in 854 editions and attended by 7,691 participations (see Table 59). New recruits and apprentices were particularly involved, also in on the job training with qualified staff. Extensive training was provided on technical and safety matters, which are two key areas for an industrial Group carrying out activities with a high technical profile and operational risk for which skills must be regularly updated and specific knowledge acquired to ensure safety in the workplace. At the end of 2009, AceaElectrabel Produzione presented a second campaign providing information on safety to its employees in order to raise awareness in a direct manner, making them an active part of the corporate prevention system. In addition to specific training, this initiative presented a Vademecum entitled “Working under Safe Conditions is our First Job” and provided general information concerning health and safety in the workplace. Resources are made aware of the main ethics adopted by the company through the Code of Ethics available on the corporate intranet, during induction training for new recruits when they are illustrated the contents of the corporate codes of values and through a specific training course on corporate social responsibility. HUMAN RESOURCES 127 Overall training costs excluding planning and setting up the areas in which courses were held amounted to over 440,000 euro (see Table 59). The number of training hours per head93 in 2009 reached 14.7 (15.5 the year before). The number of training hours for women resources amounted to 17,165, the 24.4% of the overall amount.

The Fixo Programme (Training and Innovation for Employment) that Acea supported in 2008 to improve cooperation between businesses and universities ended at the beginning of 2009. The results deriving from joint assessment by university, political and production representatives concerning the programme’s effectiveness and real job prospects offered to new graduates were presented at the final meeting. Acea attended the event and shared experiences concerning new recruits in the Holding Company: in fact, the Company held 12 internships leading to recruitment of 7 young graduates in corporate divisions thanks to this programme. 93 This indicator is the ratio between the number of hours attended (70,390 in 2009) and the average workforce (4,799 in 2009). 128 Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders In 2009, Acea supported a number of training projects, including the Fondaca Masters in Corporate Citizenship – integrated social responsibility strategies – offering two student grants to cover registration fees for the children of Group employees, the Tor Vergata University in Rome Masters in Procurement Management – Procurement and Tenders – offering a student grant to cover registration fees to a commendable student who had carried out an internship with Acea SpA, the Safe Masters – Sostenibilità Ambientale Fonti Energetiche (Environmental Sustainability in Energy Sources) – and, as part of the HR Academy of Consel – Consorzio Elis, the [E=mc2 (new Energies = Motivation x human Capital)2] Project (see box).

Employer Branding Plan to convey to young people a corporate Acea also attended national events that provided the chance to meet the university and high school universes through direct contact with young students, including individual interviews. The main events involved in 2009 were: the “19th Edition of the Job Meeting & Trovolavoro.it” where graduates and seniors received information on the profiles required by Acea and relative recruitment procedures and selection processes, “Masters in Antitrust and Market Regulation” where students were introduced to Acea businesses and the affects of regulation on their relative sectors, “Global Village”, an open day for orientation, training and employment for 600 of the best under-29 graduates selected by Italian Universities, “Employment Day where candidates could check out the job opportunities offered by over 100 companies, including Acea, the Job Forum organized by Tor Vergata University in Rome and Career Day organized by the International Free University of Social Studies. Acea hired 30 young graduates throughout 2009, 9 of which had already undergone training experience with Group companies. The Company also commenced 34 training courses and 33 occupational internships for university students or graduates. Finally, cooperation that Acea Ato 2 commenced in 2008 with a number of professional and technicalindustrial schools in Rome as part of the school-work alternation project continued in 2009: the company hosted 27 interns who furthered their school education with practical experience in the company and visits to stations. In-house Communication The corporate Intranet and the House Organ are the two main channels through which Acea communicated with employees. The House Organ was temporarily suspended in 2009 in order to renew its contents and graphics and was re-launched at the end of the year under the name AceaMagazine. Number zero of this magazine was issued in December and was a special issue dedicated to the Company’s Centenary, covering and developing its story and memories. The Intranet is a corporate portal solely for employees and is updated on a daily basis to provide important information concerning the company and Group employees, official documents (Financial Statements, codes of values, policies, regulations, etc.), corporate procedures, organizational provisions and memos HUMAN RESOURCES 129 and daily press and parliamentary reviews, as well as other content. Detailed sections have been developed over the year, providing extensive information on various topics: Administrative Responsibility, Regulations and Values, Safeguarding Savings, Quality, Training, Italian Law 262/2005, Safety and Equal Opportunities. In line with the increasing process to raise awareness of employees with regard to safety, this section was expanded and provided more content in 2009. This section currently comprises three areas: legislation comprising updates on legislation and a press review concerning safety, safety in Acea in which corporate safety policies are illustrated, organizing safety illustrating the organizational chart and appointed officers, the Safety in the Workplace Management System Handbook and work procedures-instructions. Social Activities Reference Scope The information and figures presented in Social Activities concern: Acea SpA, Acea Distribuzione, Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici, Acea Ato 2, Acea Ato 5, LaboratoRI, the 4 companies in the JV with Electrabel and Acea8cento. The Corporate Recreation Club (CRA), the Gold Medal Association (see relative box) and the National Association for Disabled and Invalid Civilians (ANMIC) are just some of the important organizations that provide social activities for employees. The registered members of the CRA increased in 2009, reaching 4,468 members including executives (4,451 in 2008), and applications to use the numerous services offered also grew due to their quality and low costs. As in past years, this Club ran the corporate crèche available to the children of both employees and residents of the 1st Municipality, which currently looks after the maximum number of children permitted by Law, in other words 49. The CRA managed relations with the insurance company responsible for ensuring additional healthcare for company employees and their dependents and distributed grants to the children of employees in high schools or universities who achieved distinguished results. The CRA also continued offering services through an agreement with a bank providing personal loans (under special conditions), free legal advisory services and recreational, sporting and cultural activities at affordable costs (see Table 60).

ANMIC was acknowledged by the Government in 1956 and the Company in 1957, safeguarding its members and providing them various services. It has signed a number of agreements, including with Unipol SpA and the CRA concerning refunds for health and heathcare costs. HUMAN RESOURCES 131 SHAREHOLDERS AND FINANCIAL BACKERS Chart 31 – PERCENTAGE OF ADDED VALUE DISTRIBUTED AMONG SHAREHOLDERS AND FINANCIAL BACKERS (2009) shareholders 0.6% financial backers 12% Article 16 of the Acea Code of Ethics concerns relations with shareholders and focuses company conduct on the highest level of correctness and transparency. Furthermore, this Code comprises a number of operational regulations concerning the running of Shareholders’ Meetings, Internal Dealing94, preparation of corporate documentation, relations with related parties etc., to ensure constant and correct information reaches current and potential partners and financial backers – on equal standing with shareholders – and thorough and prompt communication of important information to the market and Supervisory Authorities. The Holding Company’s Investor Relations Division – directly under the CEO – is responsible for ensuring the best possible relations with the financial community. Payments to Shareholders and Financial Backers In consequence of the losses registered in Financial Year 2009 (see General Economic Indicators in Corporate Identity), the Shareholders’ Meeting of the Holding Company approved the motion to cover losses using corporate reserves further to recommendation by the Board of Directors: no dividends were therefore paid.

Ratings by Agencies International agency Fitch reduced the “long-term” rating of Acea from A+ to A in November 2009, with a negative outlook. This rating was reviewed in view of the forecasts for growth in debt due to both plans for considerable investments and to lower contributions from unregulated electricity business, which was affected by a drop in demand for energy. Standard & Poor’s confirmed A rating on long-term debt and A-1 rating on short-term debt, with a negative outlook. These ratings are linked to the forecasts whereby Acea may have difficulty «obtaining a big enough improvement in credit parameters to stay in line with A rating». S&P also mentioned that the factors which «further increased Group debt » included the 122 million euro paid to cover taxes and the bonus package for removing the previous management. Despite this, the Agency goes on to say that Acea has «considerably improved liquid assets by issuing long-term shares not payable in advance».

The annual Top100 Webranking Italia97 assessed online corporate and financial communications from the top 100 companies listed on the Italian Stock Exchange by analyzing the contents and features of corporate websites in English and Acea was downgraded, losing 34 positions with respect to the year before. It must be pointed out that this survey was carried out in the short time in which Acea was uploading the new, completely redesigned version of the corporate website and neither information nor the English version were therefore available.

The corporate website section dedicated to “Shareholders” was also renewed in 2009, continuing to provide access to economic and financial documents, presentations, summaries, press release and a wide range of other information. There are also live updates on Acea stocks and a “Highlights” page, which is an interactive way of viewing charts of economic figures from the last few years and comparing them with each other and those of leading Italian competitors. Ethical Finance Development in Ethical Finance Although 2009 was an extremely difficult year for the financial market, the number of Socially Responsible Investment Funds (SRI) allocated to the common market in Europe increased by 27% – in other words 146 more funds –with respect to 2008, thereby undergoing the largest percentage growth recorded over the last nine years. This is what came to light in the Green, social and ethical funds in Europe98 written by Vigeo Italia, which also indicates an increase in the amount managed which reached 53 billion euro in 2009 (+9% with respect to the previous year), demonstrating the increased faith of investors in responsible investment (see Charts 33-35). Taking a closer look shows that the situation differs from country to county: the market is dominated by France, Belgium, UK and Switzerland, which alone count for around 67% of SRI Funds and over 70% of the overall assets managed. In 2009, the number of SRI Funds in most of the countries examined increased – with the exception of Italy and Spain, which remained stable with respect to the previous year – with France, Belgium and Germany particularly lively; while the value of assets managed generally decreased or remained stable, it only increased in France, Germany, Austria and Belgium. 95 These were individual meetings between company and potential investors to gather information. 96 These were events held to present the company on various financial markets. 97 This survey is carried out every year by Hallvarsson & Halvarsson (H&H), a leading financial communication firm from Sweden which looks at the results from assessment of around 140 parameters set by a panel of experts, assigns a score for each company examined and publishes a classification. 98 This report is published every year and has reached its ninth edition. It is used as a reference with regard to analyzing trends in Socially Responsible Retail Funds (SRI) in Europe. The scope of this analysis includes: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Holland, UK, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and takes into account green, social and ethical retail funds effective as at 30 June 2009. 134 According to Vigeo analysts, the trend in SRI funds and the value of assets in Europe is particularly Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders remarkable for such a difficult moment on the market, indicating that although this is a niche market, it is vital and appealing.

SHAREHOLDERS AND FINANCIAL BACKERS 135 Ethical Analysts Assess Acea Ethical Finance Analysts assess Acea’s conduct according to parameters for economic, social and environmental sustainability and a summary of their opinions in 2009 is provided hereunder as assessment scales or descriptions. Axia confirmed Acea’s rating as A+++ (scale A/A+++) within its ethical indexes Axia Ethical Italia and Axia CSR Italia. These indexes also comprise the leading companies listed on the Milan Stock Exchange that received pass status in terms of criteria for exclusion and positive criteria for encouraging sustainability. ECPI includes Acea stock in the ECPI Ethical Index EMU with a rating of EE (scale E– /EEE). This index comprises 150 high capitalization companies in EMU (Economic and Monetary Union) that passed both positive (assessment of merit in 100 criteria) and negative (excluding companies operating in controversial sectors) sustainability screening. Kempen/SNS has been examining Acea since 2005 and discovered constant improvements in performances and commitment to reporting by the company, thereby issuing “pass status” for the Kempen SNS Socially Responsible Investing Universe. More specifically, adoption of a Code of Ethics by the Group and establishment of an Ethics Committee, the Environmental Policies, widespread use of the ISO14000 Environmental Management System and an extensive and detailed environmental report were assessed positively. Eiris – European leader in research in the field of corporate social responsibility – once again confirmed extremely positive opinions concerning Acea for the year in question. Special appreciation was shown for all aspects concerning environmental management (commitment, policies, results and reports), corporate governance tools, including the Group Code of Ethics and anti-corruption policy and policies and systems concerning topics of general interest to stakeholders (e.g. health and safety, equal opportunities, etc.). The global approach to human rights is mentioned as an aspect requiring improvement, however the analyst also noted that Acea is only marginally involved in countries “at risk”. 136 INSTITUTIONS AND THE COMPANY Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Chart 36 – PERCENTAGE OF ADDED VALUE DISTRIBUTED AMONG INSTITUTIONS AND THE COMPANY (2009) company 36.8% institutions 16.8% Acea Group focussed corporate strategy on governance that can oversee and improve the economic sustainability of its businesses while interacting with the other players in operational areas in a constructive manner. To this regard, the commitment made in building forms of cooperation with institutional stakeholders according to reciprocal roles in order to reduce possible contrasts and identify mutual benefits while taking into account the needs of the community and relative territory is particularly important. Relations with Institutions Relations between Acea and Institutions develop within a complex system for which management is not only carried out in compliance with current Laws, but also according to the principles and regulations established in the Groups Codes of Values, merging both the economic and social nature of such relations (paying duties and taxes, relations with local institutions, with niche Authorities, conversing with Consumer Associations and other representatives of the general public, professional and institutional cooperation, etc.). In 2009, the added value distributed among institutions amounted to around 149 million euro (+37.5% with respect to the year before). This amount includes that paid to public administrations by way of duties and taxes, excluding the contributions received for various reasons from Acea, and that paid to organizations by way of membership contributions (Acea is a member of Federutility and the Union of Industrialists and Companies in Rome). With regard to income tax, there was a reduction in both current taxes – of around 20% (124 million euro in 2008 and 99.5 million in 2009), due to the lower income for the Financial Year in question – and the amount of 78.9 million euro recorded in the Financial Statement to recover taxes not paid by public service companies as exemption from taxes and classified as State benefits to the effects and purposes of Italian Law 185/2008 and subsequent implementation law. Deferred taxation made a positive effect on accounts to the amount of around 30.6 million euro. The Group Code of Ethics pays particular attention to relations with political institutions and trade unions, with Article 19 establishing that: «The Company in no way contributes towards funding political and trade union parties, movements, committees and organizations or their representatives or candidates. The Company refrains from conduct aimed at exerting direct or indirect pressure on political representatives and makes no contributions to organizations with which there may be a conflict in interest. INSTITUTIONS AND THE COMPANY 137 Acea also cooperates financially on specific projects with non-political associations according to the following criteria: • the purpose complies with corporate mission; • the destination of resources is clear and can be proven; • there is express authorization from the departments responsible for managing such relations within Acea». Relations with institutional stakeholders are regulated by an intricate corporate organizational model. This establishes that solely the Managing Director of Acea SpA is responsible for political representation and defining institutional strategies, that the Institutional Relations Department is responsible for monitoring legislation with respect to corporate businesses, that the Regulation, Market and Study Department is responsible managing relations with reference Authorities and that the Legal and Corporate Affairs Division is responsible for communicating with Authorities responsible for movables companies and market (Stock Exchange and Consob). Operational companies in the Group that manage specific services – water, electricity, public lighting – together with Local Administrations are responsible for directly managing the “technical and skilled” nature of services, through discussions and meetings with the organizations responsible for regulation and legislation, such as the ATO Authorities and the Electricity and Gas Authority. Acea monitors the work carried out by the National Observatory for Safety (ONS) appointed by the Prime Minister’s Office to coordinate preparations of the national legislation to implement European Council Directive 2008/114/EC concerning identification and designation of critical European infrastructures and assessing the need to improve protection for such through the Asset Protection Department in the Safety and Protection Division. Cooperation between Acea and the Department of Civil Defence following the devastating earthquake that hit Abruzzo and especially L’Aquila was particularly important. Acea took action by contributing towards sending containers with water services and tankers and installing electricity systems for those affected by the earthquake (see box). The other partnerships that Acea has developed with various institutions over the years include the important Protocol of Intent to reorganize the electricity network signed in 2007 and involving Rome City Box – Earthquake Emergency in Abruzzo: Volunteers from Acea Distribuzione and Acea Ato 2 alongside the Department for Civil Protection Further to the devastating earthquake that hit the area of L’Aquila Rome and daily transferral of the teams involved comprising in Abruzzo on 6 April 2009 causing over 300 victims and Acea Distribuzione technicians and other resources from Cebat terrible damage to buildings in the numerous municipalities in the Srl, further supported by a number of elements from the 11th area of the epicentre, Acea Distribuzione and Acea Ato 2 Batallion of Pioneers from the Engineer Corps present on site, for received a request from the Operational Command and Control a total of 20 men.

The inevitable difficulties in logistics – roads Distribuzione and Acea Ato 2 was particularly appreciated and, interrupted, high locations of sites, constant bad weather and in March 2010, received a “Friendship Award” from Rome City repeated tremors of a lower entity – were overcome by Council, which every year awards initiatives to help the operating without a solution for continuity, with a base in community. 138 Council, Lazio Regional Council, Terna SpA, the Regional Veio Park Society, Romanatura and Acea Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Distribuzione SpA: the numerous authorization procedures to implement projects in 11 protected natural areas are at an advanced stage and works should commence in 2010 (see details in box in Environmental Issues). Cooperation with the Province of Perugia to transfer knowledge and skills continued: Acea provided advisory services to this local authority concerning legal matters relating to tenders by providing explanations to specific queries and assistance in bidding procedures. Acea’s relations with Rome City Council include cooperating with the Ombudsman: this is an independent body appointed by the City Council to act as mediator between public administration and the community, defending the latter in the event of delays, faults and irregularity in services provided by companies in the Rome City Council Group. The Institutional Relations Department is responsible for this aspect in the Company, dealing with communication between the community and the company and replying to all requests. There were 110 reports forwarded to Acea in 2009 (140 in 2008), 21% of which concerning public lighting, 14% electricity distribution, 38% electricity sales and 27% the water service. Every one of these reports received a reply. Acea always ventures to operate in compliance with the social context involved, paying attention to legitimate complaints from the community, including with respect to impacts from production infrastructures. More specifically, San Vittore del Lazio received, this year, the PIMBY Award – Please In My Back Yard – for expanding the Waste-To-Energy Plant managed by Acea Group company EALL. This award is given to local administrations that encourage sustainability and promotes virtuous experiences in the field of correct information, environmental communication and involvement of local stakeholders. The reason stated for awarding San Vittore council was, «The San Vittore Waste-To-Energy Plant derives from a precise and linear preliminary process (…). San Vittore, Frosinone Province and Acea Group company EALL took part in its creation in complete harmony. And real cooperation from the local community, the University of Cassino and companies operating in this area have ensured that the largest and most important Waste-To-Energy plant in the Region of Lazio is located in San Vittore. This demonstrates that waste disposal carried out with respect for the environment and agreement from all the parties involved can become a source of well-being for the entire community». Another important award received by Acea in 2009 as public utility service that distinguished itself for its good practices and social responsibility on behalf of stakeholders was the CEEP-CSR Label supported by the European Commission as part of the Discerno Tre project (see relative box). Box – The CEEP-CSR Label Awarded to Acea Acea received the “CEEP-CSR Label” in October 2009 for its examination of a number of parameters for individual activities. commitment to social and environmental responsibility The elements that were particularly appreciated included 2009-2010. adoption of a Code of Ethics and commitment to the Code for This important acknowledgement supported by the European Self-discipline for listed companies advocated by the Italian Stock Commission is awarded by CEEP (European Centre for Public Exchange to implement a governance model based on the Utilities Companies) to companies that distinguish themselves in principles of transparency and balance between management applying European standards for corporate social responsibility and control; the effective initiatives advocated by Acea Reti e and voluntarily apply social and environmental standards in their Servizi Energetici in relation to saving energy and renewable work. sources and establishment of Acea8cento, which oversees Acea Fifteen European companies received this award (out of 400 call centers and remote contact centers. With regard to participants), 4 of which were Italian. The CEEP Scientific Acea8cento, in addition to results concerning the quality and Committee, which includes representatives from UNO, the EU quantity of customer services, the integration and constant Commission and OECD awarded Acea this prestigious label training of staff previously employed by outsourcers was following detailed analysis based on 63 criteria and assessed positively. INSTITUTIONS AND THE COMPANY 139 Acea has cooperated for various reasons with Universities and Research Organizations for many years: these relations involve carrying out numerous technical studies and projects to develop innovation by creating internship opportunities for graduates (participating at job meetings) and offering the professional skills of Acea employees through teaching courses, Masters courses, seminars and, finally, the company supporting a number of academic activities, such as study grants or funding research particularly pertinent to corporate businesses (see also Human Resources and Research in Environmental Issues). The Company is also associated with important Research Centres, Legislation Agencies and other Associations involved in sectors of corporate interest (see relative box). Box – Commitment to Research Centres and Legislation Agencies in 2009 The following commitments were renewed or undertaken in Comitato Elettrotecnico Italiano (CEI) 2009: Istituto Unificazione Italiano (UNI) Associazione Amici dell’Accademia dei Lincei Associazione Italiana di Illuminazione (AIDI) Istituto di Economia delle Fonti di Energia, IEFE – Bocconi Associazione Amici della Luiss CSR Manager Network Italia (Altis e ISVI) Fondazione Einaudi Global Compact (ONU) Italian Association for Trenchless Technology (IATT) Istituto di Ricerche per l’Economia e la Finanza (REF) World Energy Council (WEC) Associazione Elettrotecnica ed Elettronica Italiana (AEI) Federazione Italiana per l’uso Razionale dell’Energia (FIRE). The company actively takes part in debates developing year after year on current affairs of national and international importance, assuring presence and contribution at meetings between the business world, scientific community, institutions and the community, as well as paying careful attention to important events (e.g. the Public Administration Forum, Ecopolis, Earth Day, Zeroemission or seminars on reform to local public services, the green economy and alternative energy, remote network control, health and safety in the workplace, corporate responsibility, etc.). In 2009, Acea organized a roundtable involving representatives from the political and institutional world and other subjects interested in the important topic of safety in the workplace (see box). Box – 2009 Roundtable on “Safety in the Workplace” at the La Fornace Congress Center Acea organized a roundtable with Institutions and Stakeholders which considerably changed Legislative Decree 81/08. interested in safety in the workplace for various reasons. This This roundtable involved detailed technical examination of safety event was attended by Acea Chairman Giancarlo Cremonesi and its ties with corporate responsibility and economic efficiency; and other important representatives from the world of politics, a training seminar for RSPP and ASPP for the purposes of business and employment and was an important opportunity for compulsory occupational refresher courses direct debate with institutions following the extensive amendments introduced through new Italian Legislative Decree 106/09, Great care is taken in managing relations with Federations, Business Associations, Trade Unions and Consumer Associations and consequent assessment of their complaints. More specifically, specific aspects in relations with Consumer Associations are controlled by operational companies in the Group and coordinated by the Holding Company Institutional Relations Department. For some time now, the Company has a permanent table with Consumer Associations to ensure informal talks on projects and topics of mutual interest. Further to complex talks and by way of preventing potential controversy between the company and consumers, a Mutual Settlement Procedure was implemented in 2009, which also applies to household users of the water and electricity services in Lazio (see relative box). 140 Chamber of Commerce Settlement was implemented in 2006 at the Rome Chamber of Commerce to settle Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders controversy between customers and AceaElectrabel Elettricità concerning supplies: 15 applications for settlement were made in 2009 and 4 were upheld. Box – Mutual Settlement in Acea: an Extra Tool for Consumers A protocol for mutual settlement and implementation These subjects actively participate in applying settlement, thereby Regulations were signed with the leading Consumer qualifying this procedure as it is the parties involved that act to Associations in Lazio registered with the National Board of find mutually satisfying agreements on equal footing.

This initiative involves Acea Ato 2 and Acea Ato 5 for the water This experience of defining the Protocol was presented at the sector and AceaElectrabel Elettricità for the electricity sector and Ethics and Company Award. their respective customers in Lazio, represented and supported by the selected Consumer Association. Other relations the Company has with businesses, associations, agencies, profit-making and non profitmaking organizations involve sponsoring cultural, recreational, sporting, social and environmental events or making donations to support specific projects (see Customers and the Community and Human Resources). The Company as Stakeholder Acea also behaves responsibly towards itself, safeguarding its assets and promoting business development: it strategically fulfils the needs involved in operational management and growth through careful in-house funding and implementation of investment plans. The added value destined to the Company in 2009 was 325.6 million euro (see Chart 36), a decrease with respect to 378.9 million in 2008: this amount includes corporate self-funding items (non-distributed profits, reserves, amortizations, etc.), in other words any resources that do not derive from outside sources. As a consequence to the negative results from this Financial Year, non-distributed profits amounted to losses of 52.5 million euro (profits of 140.5 million euro the year before). Reserves amounted to 230.5 million euro and increased by 21.6 million euro in one year due not only to the fact that investment plans from previous Financial Years matured, but also to the considerable rise in those made in 2009. Credit depreciation increased by around 16 million euro, with AceaElectrabel Elettricità responsible for 5.7 million and Acea Ato 2 for 6.5 million euro, also in view of the general economic trend. However, it is amortizations that underwent the most considerable change, increasing by 102.1 million euro with respect to 2008 (6.56 million euro). Around 76 million were written off to the new risk estimate deriving from unforeseeable events that occurred in previous Financial Years, including: tax controversies underway with the Inland Revenue Office further to corporate reorganization carried out by Acea in 2004 and the potential effects on Acea Ato 5 of matters concerning the legitimacy of rates currently underway. Investments in 2009 amounted to 518 million euro (+100.7 million compared to the previous year). More specifically, in comparison with 2008, investments considerably increased in energy sectors: 43.3 million euro more in networks, mainly due to investments in photovoltaic technology, 6.1 million in market in INSTITUTIONS AND THE COMPANY 141 relation to Tirreno Power and 71.9 million euro in environment and energy in order to expand the San Vittore del Lazio Waste-To-Energy Plant. Corporate protection was improved in 2009 through establishment of the Asset Protection Team within the Acea SpA Safety and Protection Department, which is directly under the CEO. This led to adoption of a Policy for Corporate Protection in December 2009 (see box).

In order to guarantee a link between the Asset Protection Team and Group companies, a Protection Management System Officer (RSGP) has been identified in each. Particular attention was paid to IT Security throughout the year, leading to joint issue by the Acea SpA ICT Team and the Asset Protection Team of guidelines for IT security and a procedure for new checks on access to corporate sites, both of which refer to all Group companies. Technological innovation is considered an essential element in corporate success and there are various Divisions and Departments responsible for this aspect both in the Holding Company and in other operational Group companies. For this purpose, projects, research, experiments etc. are therefore developed year after year in relation to management of the integrated water system in the various ATOs for which the Group is responsible (e.g. identifying leaks, remote control, etc.), operations concerning “the environment and energy” (Waste-ToEnergy and related businesses, such as waste conversion and its use) and operations concerning energy (from “new energies” to operations on production plants) described in the section of this report illustrating Environmental Issues. Corporate best practices in technological innovation – especially concerning the water sector – were shared and capitalized on both in terms of procedures and equipment designed. This led to implementation of the Freedom Project to share innovative processes and products among Acea Group partners according to the Open Source model, in other words setting up a specific website and forum for experts from the various Group companies. This project should become fully operational by the end of 2010. 142 Socio-economic Relations with Stakeholders Box – Protection Policy The Protection Policy approved by the CEO in December 2009 • train, inform, raise the awareness and improve the responsible and provided to employees through the corporate intranet states: nature of all employees (…); «Acea Group considers affirming, supporting and maintaining • pursue continuous improvement in protecting tangible and principles and specific conduct to protect tangible and intangible intangible assets, adopting and promoting use of Management assets (Corporate Protection) of primary importance (…) For this Systems for Protection (…) that comply with the best national reason, Acea guarantees the availability of enough human, and international standards; instrumental and economic resources to draw up appropriate • commence and maintain active dialogue with all employees measures for this sector and is issuing this document by way of and their representatives, local Authorities, Trade Associations, undertaking to: Authorities and any other party involved, warranting a • plan, implement and keep efficient production processes and contribution towards the community in terms of protection, operations with criteria focusing on preventing strange, illegal cooperating with the authorities responsible for such matters». or damaging events (…); Box – Actions by Authorities and Agencies with Respect to Acea: Proceedings, Awards and Fines The Electricity and Gas Authority (AEEG) encourages customers possibility of switching to another supplier.

Operational companies therefore carry out their work fully aware of the importance of respecting eco-systems and paying attention to plant and animal species in the area. Acea Group took up the challenge to combine the needs of the water and energy businesses with environmental protection, in terms of both the impact they have and harmonizing sites, infrastructures and production plants with the surrounding area. In order to contribute to sustainable and lasting development and limit the effects of industrial activities on the natural environment as much as possible, Acea operates under the perspective of “ongoing improvement”, typical to Management Systems. Stations and plants place the environment at the heart of a policy involving voluntary adoption of standards recognized at the international level (such as EMAS or international UNI EN ISO 14001 standards), trying out innovative technologies and applying the best technologies currently available. With regard to 2010, which has also been declared International Year of Biodiversity by the General Assembly of the United Nations, Acea now ready to play a positive and proactive role – is preparing a publication on this topic. Box – Encouraging Sustainable Energy Consumption Efficient management of energy demand by an electricity CO2 emissions) – by offering advisory services such as industry does not exclusively mean increasing the number of monitoring and analyzing plants and relative consumption, stations it has, expanding production or improving the efficiency checking the parameters of corporate electricity networks and of its production processes. ensuring that customers can better manage their energy supplies In order to achieve and maintain a balance between demand through latest-generation equipment such as digital meters. from the market and offers from electricity companies, it is also At the national level, the Road Map project implemented at the important to encourage sustainable consumption in consumers. end of 2007 and currently under further progress, is particularly For this purpose, Acea has implemented numerous initiatives to important; this project aims to improve electricity continuity direct customers towards sustainable consumption, also by way performances around Rome and thereby raise the service level of complying with specific provisions from niche institutions. offered to the community to achieve the targets set by the The Company therefore focussed on educating people to save Electricity and Gas Authority through Regulatory Cycle 2008energy and the environment – the fact that new ways of using 2011.

THE GROUP’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 149 With regard to the energy sector, in which Acea is one of the leading national providers, the Company undertakes to provide customers the support they need to streamline their consumption, including by using energy from renewable sources (see box on encouraging sustainable energy consumption and Saving energy, “Smart Grids” and Renewable Sources). Over the last three years, the Group has become more committed to transforming urban waste into energy, a topic of extreme importance to Italy’s sustainability, aiming to achieve the minimum levels of impact on the environment permitted by modern and reliable technologies. The environmental risks of incinerators can be considered under control, whereas little use of Waste-To-Energy technologies and continuing to manage the now overflowing dumps is harmful in terms of sustainability. Acea also intends to proceed in its commitment to reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere in order to counter global climate change, although the causes of such change have not yet been scientifically cleared up. For this purpose, the Group is expanding its capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources (especially wind and photovoltaic), extending district heating (where possible), operating on the “emission trading” market, making its production plants more efficient (via Energy managers) and recovering efficiency in the end use of electricity by users. Box – Carbon Disclosure Project: Acea Performances under Observation For the last ten years, a group of institutional investors has carried EVA Economic Value Added produced in a year, which is out annual research into the leading international Utilities in order decreased to take into account external effects caused by CO2 to assess their ability to manage risks and the potential emissions, in other words the hidden costs paid by the opportunities deriving from climate changes and thereby community due to negative effects on the environment (climate channel investments to the most proactive companies. change). This project is known as “Carbon Disclosure Project” (CDP)102 The responsible conduct of the Group has ensured that results and Acea has taken part for many years, providing all the have always been very positive and, according to the latest information required. report available103 published in 2009, Acea was the best The companies involved in the CDP Project undergo assessment Utility in Europe, especially in terms of specific CO2 emissions (t of environmental economic performances, according to the CO2/turnover in euro). With regard to the water sector, in which Acea is leading Italian operator, the Group is committed to strictly safeguarding the areas surrounding water sources used and to keep the quality of drinking water high, also through constant analyses carried out by LaboratoRI. For some time, efforts have been made to fulfil the objective of ensuring less waste of water resources both in infrastructures, for example by monitoring the networks in order to identify and repair leaks or by using water in other production cycles, and by encouraging customers to use water properly through communication and information to highlight its value. Another important and considerably controlled aspect involves returning clean water into the environment while protecting the catchment areas. For this purpose, the Group continuously monitors not only the quality of wastewater but also the condition of catchment areas and carries out research to adopt innovative technology in treatment plants in cooperation with specialized centres. Finally, by way of ensuring more extensive visibility of interaction between Acea and the natural environment and in addition to that described and illustrated in this section of the report, figures are provided in the Environmental Accounts attached in the CD. 102 See official site: http://www.cdproject.net. 103 The report was published by CDP in 2009 and refers to 2007. 150 Environmental Management Systems Environmental Issues The Group’s key production plants have all decided to implement an Environmental Management System and therefore undertaken to monitor relative impacts and ensure ongoing improvement, in accordance with its principles for respecting and safeguarding the environment. In 2009, further to analyses by the Agencies involved, Acea Thermoelectric and Hydroelectric Plants, Waste-To-Energy Stations and a number of Water Companies once again received Environmental Certificates. With regard to AceaElectrabel Produzione Plants: • Certification in compliance with Standard UNI EN ISO 14001:2004 was received for the Leinì Thermoelectric Station (Leinì, province of Turin); • Certification in compliance with Standard UNI EN ISO 14001:2004 was received for the G. Marconi Hydroelectric Station (Narni, province of Terni); • Certification in compliance with Standard UNI EN ISO 14001:2004 was confirmed for the Tor di Valle and Montemartini Thermoelectric Stations (Rome) and the Salisano Hydroelectric Plant (Salisano, province of Rieti); • Certification in compliance with Standard UNI EN ISO 14001:2004 was also confirmed for the Voghera Station (Pavia), while the new EMAS audit is expected to be carried out in 2010. With regard to Tirreno Power Plants: • all thermoelectric stations have had an Environmental Management System for some time now. More specifically, the Vado Ligure and Torrevaldaliga Sud Plants have both ISO 14001:2004 Certification and EMAS registration; the procedure to receive both the aforementioned certifications continued in relation to the Naples Levante Station in 2009. With regard to A.R.I.A. Group (Acea Risorse e Impianti per l’Ambiente): • EMAS registration was confirmed for the EALL Waste-To-Energy Plant in San Vittore del Lazio (province of Frosinone) and the Terni En.A. Waste-To-Energy Plant in Terni. New audits are planned for 2010. With regard to the water sector, the following operational companies in Tuscany are highlighted: • Acque SpA and subsidiaries confirmed integrated Best4 Certification (Business Excellence Sustainable Task). More specifically, the quality management system and social responsibility system were updated to the 2008 editions of Standards UNI EN ISO 9001 and SA8000, which was positively assessed by the Agency responsible for Certification. • Publiacqua SpA retained Certification according to Standard UNI EN ISO 14001:2004 for large purification plants at Anconella and Mantignano and for the Treatment Plant in the Florence area (San Colombano). Box – Green Procurement (GP) in Acea Acea’s policy concerning green procurement for the Group contracting supplies and services was also proposed. commenced mid-2007, when a preliminary survey to support All the Tenders concerning transportation and disposal of ash introduction of Green Procurement processes and tools was and waste announced by Terni Ena and EALL (the companies carried out by identifying the more “sensitive” commodities responsible for the two Waste-To-Energy Plants) in 2009 categories and analyzing the “green offer” available on the established the obligation for bidders to have UNI EN ISO market. 14001: 2004 Environmental Certification. At the end of 2008, new Hardware was purchased to manage The Group is expected to include requirements concerning the main corporate applications with innovative energy efficiency lower impacts on the environment as well as the standard elements that can reduce electricity consumption in the processor economic and technical requirements for procurement procedures by 50% and limit the heat generated by servers. Gradual in 2010. introduction of environmental sustainability criteria when THE GROUP’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 151 Biodiversity As illustrated above, Group companies operate according to environmental policies and principles, implementing procedures in line with Management Systems that take into account the protection of natural environments and the flora and fauna therein, paying particular attention to biodiversity. This is true with regard to the examples provided below involving operations at thermoelectric plants, electricity distribution and water distribution. The areas comprising large water stations and those comprising drinking water sources (see Table 79) are subject to monitoring of the quality and quantity parameters by Acea and the healthy condition in these areas has ensured that wetlands with biodiversity comprising a wide range of species are created. The same attention is paid to safeguarding the areas surrounding hydroelectric and thermoelectric stations and, more specifically, AceaElectrabel Produzione has proceeded with a number of operations that commenced last year in accordance with the objectives of management systems in stations to restock fish in the Rivers Sangro, Aventino and Nera nearby the Sant’Angelo and G. Marconi hydroelectric Plants. Tirreno Power has undertaken specific commitments to safeguard biodiversity, co-funding the P.A.R.C. Plan of Action (Petromyzon and river continuity) “Sea lamprey and river continuity”, approved by the European Commission as part of the Life Plus Nature Programme. The P.A.R.C. Project is very popular with the scientific community and involved the Authority for the Interregional Catchment Area of River Magra, Montemarcello-Magra Park, Liguria Regional Council, the University of Genoa DIP.TER.IS, Spezia Provincial Council and the Legambiente Association. Another example of the awareness raised in relation to these topics is the cooperation between Acea and Ornis Italia Researchers – ongoing for some time now – to study the species that can nest in boxes placed on electricity pylons or water tanks. In view of the considerable success of this initiative – grabbing attention at the international level -, Acea shall intensify this kind of initiative (see box on peregrine falcons). Acea also demonstrates an aptitude for caring for the environment by limiting the impact from infrastructures used to distribute electricity (networks, supports) and Acea Distribuzione is an active element in an important project to reorganize the electricity network, deriving from an agreement with Rome City Council, Lazio Regional Council and other interested agencies in an area comprising 11 protected natural areas (see box on sustainable development of the electricity network). Finally, there are no reports of habitats with biodiversity compromised by Group activities and therefore no compensation of habitats was required. Despite this fact and as mentioned earlier, the Group is particularly sensitive to this topic and probably the first to deal with one of the next great environmental challenges for the European Union, from which strong efforts to safeguard natural resources and repair damage to the environment are expected following the commitment made to limit climate changes. With regard to this, the Pavan Sukhdev104 plan entitled “The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) should be seen. This is funded by, among others, the European Commission and UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and focuses on the potential economic benefits from protecting biodiversity and the costs deriving from losing species, decline in ecosystems and reparation costs. 104 Pavan Sukhdev is also an advisor to UNEP, more specifically to the UNEP Green Economy Initiative. Other information on the TEEB study is available at http://www.teebweb.org 152 Environmental Issues Box – Appio and Vergine: a Pair of Peregrine Falcons under the Watchful Eye of a Birdcam Installation of nesting boxes on Acea electricity lines commenced Birdcams have also been installed commencing in 2004 to around ten years ago through cooperation with a UK institute observe the nests of kestrels, storks, herring gulls and – and italian researchers.

THE GROUP’S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 153 “Environmental Expenditures” “Environmental Expenditures”, in the strict sense in which they are defined in European Commission Decision 2001/453/CE 106 , are accounted by the main production companies in the Group and amounted to 33 million euro in 2009. AceaElectrabel Produzione and Tirreno Power also included current costs in the report, amounting to 11.9 million euro and 1.3 million euro respectively; solely environmental investments were recorded for Acea Ato 2. Table 66 – 2009 ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES group companies investments current costs (in millions of euro) (in millions of euro) Acea Ato 2 SpA 19.86 nd AceaElectrabel Produzione SpA 4.31 7.63 Tirreno Power 0.47 0.79 total 24.64 8.42 Taking into account solely environmental investments around 24.6 million euro and comparing these with the overall investments made by the three companies amounting to 300.5 million euro107 illustrates an incidence of environmental costs of around 8%. Other water companies in the Group do not yet have a system for accounting environmental cexpenditures108, systematically, as established by Recommendation 2001/453/EC. 106 By “environmental expenditures”, EC Recommendation means the cost of «actions taken to prevent, reduce or repair damage to the environment deriving from operational activities (...) including waste disposal, training, protecting the ground and surface and underground water, protecting the air and the climate from pollution, reducing sound pollution to safeguard biodiversity and the landscape». Costs that may positively affect the environment but that are made to satisfy other needs, such as better profitability, health and safety in the workplace, product safety or efficient production are not included. 107 Deriving from the overall amount of investments made by the 3 companies in 2009: Acea Ato 2 (108 million Euro), Tirreno Power (153 million Euro) and AceaElectrabel Produzione (39.5 million Euro). 108 Nonetheless, Acquedotto del Fiora described its environmental costs and separated investments from operational costs in 2009. See the relative fact sheet in Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas for further details. 154 ENERGY SECTOR Environmental Issues The main activities carried out by Acea in relation to energy involve: the supply producing, distributing and selling electricity and heat from traditional sources, including hydroelectric; building new combined-cycle thermoelectric stations fuelled by natural gas; managing and building Wind Farms and Photovoltaic Stations; Waste-To-Energy; selling gas; designing, building and managing public and artistic lighting systems; promoting, publicizing and implementing actions to improve end use of electricity. The shortand long-term availability and reliability of electricity is ensured by paying attention and carefully planning procurement and production (through the companies in the JV with Electrabel) –improving stations and diversifying production sources, preparing implementation of a number of Stations in emergency situations (to immediately oversee the nerve centres in Rome), making special investments to improve distribution infrastructures – to guarantee continuity in electricity supplies (see box on Acea Distribuzione Road Map in Customers and the Community). With regard to producing and selling electricity, the Group is now one of the main players in this sector (third most important company in Italy in terms of volumes sold) through shareholdings in the companies involved in the JV with Belgian company Electrabel and in Tirreno Power and continue to develop new energies, both from renewable sources and through Waste-To-Energy, the latter of which commenced in 2006 through acquisition of 100% of the TAD Energia Ambiente Group, now called A.R.I.A. (Acea Risorse e Impianti per l’Ambiente). Electricity distribution is carried out by Acea Distribuzione and the Group is the second most important company in Italy in terms of customers served and has excellent skills in public, functional and artistic lighting. Figures concerning energy – production, primary sources used, emissions, etc. – reported for 2009 were calculated according to Acea SpA’s shares in operational companies, in accordance with the procedure introduced in 2008 (see Reference scope, page 145). All the 2007 figures were recalculated to permit three-year comparison of energy figures (see also Environmental Issues) ENERGY SECTOR 155 Energy Production and Distribution Overall electricity production in 2009 according to the consolidation share – fell to around 3,230 GWh with respect to the 3,580 GWh in 2008 (see Table 67 and Environmental Issues, page 4). With respect to the overall amount, thermoelectric energy confirmed its predominance, accounting for around 2,872 GWh (2,370 GWh of which from natural gas, around 490 GWh from coal and the rest from fuel oil and diesel), although the overall volumes decreased with respect to the year before. Production by Waste-To-Energy operations complied with the figures for 2008, whereas energy from hydroelectric sources for which Acea was responsible – around 182 GWh increased by 30% with respect to 140 GWh in 2008 and the amount from renewable sources (wind and photovoltaic) almost doubled reaching 21 GWh with respect to 11 GWh in 2008 (see specific section). The thermoelectric plants in Tor di Valle and Leinì produced electricity not only via a combined highefficiency gas and vapour cycle, but also thermal energy of around 36 GWh109, which was used to supply hot water and district heating to around 25,000 inhabitants in south Rome and in Settimo Torinese for around 8,000 inhabitants.

Electricity distribution in Rome and Formello is the responsibility of Acea Distribuzione112, thanks to which Acea is the second most important electricity distributor in Italy serving over 3 million inhabitants via a network of cables and overhead lines covering over 29,000 km and around 12,000 GWh per year of electricity. Table 76 provides 2009 figures concerning overhead and underground high-, mediumand lowvoltage electricity distribution lines.

Finally, losses in transmission and distribution expressed as a percentage of the overall energy demand for the network amounted to 6.2% (see attached CD comprising Environmental Accounts for further details). Waste-To-Energy The importance of having a wide range of waste disposal plants in an area is increasingly highlighted by the critical situations that Italy has had to face. Modern waste incineration plants used to recover energy– more commonly known as Waste-To-Energy Plants – not only help to restrict the problem of disposal113, by considerably reducing its volume, but can also recover the heat developed during combustion and use this to produce vapour, which in turn is used to produce electricity. 112 See Customers and the Community, the attached Environmental Accounts and CompanyFact Sheets Italy-Overseas for information concerning the activities carried out by Acea Distribuzione 113 While annual per head production of urban waste in Italy (550 kg/year) is in line with that in other high-income European countries such as France (577 kg/year) and Germany (566 kg/year), dumps are still highly used for disposal: around half of urban waste goes to dumps. (Source: Hi-Tech Ambiente monthly magazine issue 3 April 2010). 160 The two Waste-To-Energy Plants of the Group114, located in Terni and San Vittore del Lazio (Frosinone), Environmental Issues produced around 78,000 MWh and 79,900 MWh and provided electricity amounting to around 70,100 MWh and 70,650 MWh respectively in 2009. These stations both implemented an environmental management system in compliance with EMAS (761/01) and International Standard UNI EN ISO 14001:2004 and therefore receive current benefits (CIP6). The Terni Plant uses pulper as fuel and the San Vittore del Lazio Plant burns WDF (waste-derived fuel), the features of which are established by Ministerial Decree dated 5 February 1988 and subsequent Legislative Decree 152/2006. These stations both qualified as “renewable source stations” in December 2009. The Waste-to-Heat Plant in San Vittore in the region of Lazio plays a primary role in urban waste treatment (see also relative box) and intends to become the benchmark for treating dried sewage deriving from urban wastewater treatment. Works to improve line 1 involving implementation of 2 more waste-to-energy lines are underway. Box – The “2009 PIMBY Award” for San Vittore for the EALL SpA Waste-To-Energy Plant The PIMBY Association (Please In My Back Yard) was established Once this work is completed, the plant will cover 30-40% of in 2007 and awards local Administrations that encourage overall waste disposal capacity for the Lazio region. sustainability.

Energy Savings, “Smart Grids” and Renewable Sources Energy Manager and Energy Savings In compliance with Law 10/91 establishing the Regulations for Implementing the National Energy Plan Concerning Rational Use of Renewable Energy Sources, Acea Group has Energy Manager in each of its leading subsidiaries to carefully oversee the processes with the highest levels of energy consumption in order to achieve the best possible results in terms of reducing consumption. A workgroup comprising all water company Energy Manager supported by technical staff from the Holding Company industrial sector was established by the Group. This workgroup continues to support companies in order to ensure ongoing energy sufficiency in water systems and networks. The main activities involved include the following: 114 Further information is available in the Fact Sheet concerning Terni En.A. and EALL (see Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas). ENERGY SECTOR 161 1. monitoring electricity consumption (overall and specific) and energy efficiency indexes115 for all companies, especially in relation to the plants consuming the most energy, such as water treatment plants. The overall number of Acea Ato 2 plants monitored specifically amounts to 164; 2. analyzing the network to identify methods for improving efficiency (for example, it may be better to take samples from certain plants rather than others or at night rather than in daytime); 3. analyzing and searching for leaks; 4. producing a monthly report on energy consumption trend to control and plan actions. The monthly and annual efficiency trends are examined to highlight any problems and rapidly verify the cause of inefficiency (maintenance underway, the need to renew tools or equipment, etc.). The aforementioned monitoring system led to savings of around 20 GWh in drinking water retrieval systems in 2009 with respect to the year before. Smart Grids and Energy Saving Certificates The Group began incorporating the electricity network with the IT network in 2009 to develop “smart grids”, in other words networks that are required to incorporate actions by energy producers, users/consumers and distributors. The Group develops and exploits new technologies through two companies: Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici (100% owned by Acea SpA) and Ecogena (51% owned by Acea SpA). The former company is responsible for identifying and implementing actions to achieve energy savings in compliance with current laws concerning energy suppliers and is also involved in the solar-energy sector. The latter develops civil and industrial co-generation and tri-generation systems116, and will play an important role in interconnecting networks and establishing “smart grids”. “Smart grids” are also related to forecast development of electric or hybrid cars, in other words cars with both traditional engines and a smaller battery-powered engine. Twoway communication between a grid (smart) and such vehicles, for example via a power cable or wireless technology, is needed before electric cars can become popular on the market, not only to ensure they can be charged, but also to return energy to the grid. These are ambitious objectives, but they comply with the European intention to innovate the electricity network throughout Europe. One of the essential tasks of Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici is to achieve energy savings to thereby obtain Energy Efficiency Certificates (TEE in Italian ) or “White Certificates” by implementing the various initiatives aimed at just this. TEEs differ according tot he energy source saved (type I, II or III certificates for savings in electricity, gas or other energy source) and are awarded by the Electricity and Gas Authority in view of various initiatives. The results achieved by Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici over the last few years have been very satisfactory and ensured fulfilment of the targets concerning energy saving established for Acea Distribuzione. The operations carried out for this purpose included both distributing CFL bulbs and water kits to families and replacing the traditional votive light bulbs with LED lights and improving lighting in Rome underground stations. As the initiatives already underway have led to more certificates than expected for Acea Distribuzione, new projects were implemented in 2009. Over 500,000 excess certificates were accumulated in 2009 (see Table 77)117 and 358,467 certificates were transferred to other companies in 2006-2009. 115 In the case of a pump, this index could be represented by the ratio between energy consumed and amount of water pumped. 116 Co-generation, in other words combined production of electricity and thermal energy, provides high efficiency: between 80 and 90%. Tri-generation is a particular application allowing use of all or part of thermal energy recovered to produce refrigerating energy in the form of refrigerated water for air conditioning or industrial processes. 117 Around 28,000 type III TEEs should be added to the number illustrated in Table 77. 162 Table 77 – ACEA DISTRIBUZIONE TARGETS CONCERNING SAVINGS AND OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED (2006 – 2009) Environmental Issues year target target achieved by Acea excess certificates accumulated (Tep/year) (Tep/year) (Tep/year) 2006 7,850 58,988 69,974 2007 15,596 127,148 181,526 2008 49,131 223,074 355,469 2009 73,335 226,859 508,993 Ecogena also receives energy efficiency certificates through co-generation and tri-generation stations (see relative box) and will build stations for overall output of 4.3 MWe between 2009 and 2010 (see Table 78): Table 78 – PROJECTS FOR CO-GENERATION/TRI-GENERATION STATIONS (2009-2010) station electricity output thermal output refrigerating output (MWe) (MWt) (MWf) Saxa Rubra district 0.9 1.9 1.2 (start-up Jan. 2009) Canottieri Aniene sport centre 0.25 0.42 (start-up Sept. 2009) Bufalotta district 1 8.4 4.5 (start-up Sept. 2009) Torrino Nord district 0.25 1.6 1.5 (start-up Dec. 2009) Park Hotel ai Cappuccini in Gubbio 0.09 0.17 (start-up Dec. 2009) Fin di Ostia federal centre 0.09 0.17 (start-up forecast March 2010) Fin di Pietralata federal centre 0.09 0.17 (start-up forecast March 2010) Villa Flaminia sport centre 0.09 0.17 (start-up forecast March 2010) Sigma Tau in Pomezia 2.4 2.0 (start-up forecast March 2010) Fin di Marconi federal centre 0.09 0.17 (start-up forecast April 2010) Box – Ecogena: Energy Savings and Co-generation Ecogena carries out projects to save energy via co-generation other benefits of an environmental nature, i.e. avoiding emission and tri-generation, implementing works using natural gas or of large amounts of CO2 and using less primary energy. renewable energy sources. Ecogena can intervene in any energy An example of a station that has been built and became sector and propose both improvements to existing stations and operational in September 2009 is the tri-generation station in “La new stations. Bufalotta” district of Rome comprising around 1,300 homes. One of the essential elements in these buildings is recovering In addition to lower CO2 emissions, this station will ensure heat, in other words thermal energy that would otherwise be lost, economic savings (around 13% a year) once it becomes fully and this ability ensures more efficient use of primary energy with operational. More specifically, with respect to a traditional respect to traditional stations. system producing separate thermal and refrigerating energy, this In addition to better performances, white certificates system is expected to save around 450 g of CO2 per KWhe demonstrating results in energy savings can be obtained and produced, in other words 1,000 tons per year. ENERGY SECTOR 163 Renewable Energy from the Wind and the Sun In addition to energy produced using water, pulper and WDF from Waste-To-Energy procedures as a source (the latter only partly renewable) as described above, Acea’s commitment to increasing production from renewable sources is demonstrated through installation of new Wind Farms and development of photovoltaic systems. AceaElectrabel Produzione is continuing to expand production capacity through wind: the Wind Farm in Monte della Difesa, in the province of Salerno with output of 28.9 MW and which in 2009 produced over 41 GWh joined the two Wind Farms operating in Molis118. The gross amount of electricity produced by Wind Farms amounted to 76 GWh, around 18 GWh of which by Acea, according to shareholding (see Tables 67, 68, 71 and attached CD comprising Environmental Accounts). Design of the “Cresta del Gallo” Wind Farm (province of Avellino) was also completed and will provide output of around 15 MW, while installation of the “Piano del Cornale” Wind Farm (province of Salerno) continued and will provide output of around 20 MW. With regard to solar energy, further to the projects completed in 2008 providing overall output of around 3 MWp – including the system installed on the Monte Mario water station for about 1 MWp, inaugurated by the Mayor of Rome in 2009 – other systems were installed throughout 2009. The most important of these include that in Fiumicino Airport area, one of the largest in Italy with output of around 2 MWp and totally integrated119, and the ground system with output exceeding 2 MWp in Terracina. Systems providing around 17 MWp were operational by the end of 2009. The overall amount of energy produced through solar systems in 2009 was 3,485,000 kWh Box – Photovoltaic System Supervision In view of the importance of checking productivity in photovoltaic systems are various sizes, have different features and are systems, a monitoring and supervision platform was implemented located in several areas and regions (Lazio, Campania, in 2009, which was considered essential for general, taking into Puglia and Umbria, including those under installation). account that: a large number of photovoltaic systems have been installed: This supervision platform ensures availability of a wide range of 40 were already connected to the electricity grid as at information in real time, e.g. output, energy produced daily, 31.12.2009 (not all of which yet monitored, but planned for monthly and all together, tons of CO2 saved, etc. inclusion in the project); 118 Output amounts to 10.2 MWand 9.4 MW respectively and the two systems belong to Longano Eolica (15% owned by Acea SpA). 119 Photovoltaic systems are completely integrated when, for example, they replace standard roof coverings and building facades and therefore have the same inclination and architectural task or when they are the used to cover cantilevers and canopies. 164 WATER SECTOR Environmental Issues The Governor of Rome appointed Acea to build and operate aqueducts and water distribution networks for the city of Rome previously directly managed by the City Council on 2 September 1937. The Company also took over management of the sewage system in 2002, thereby becoming responsible for the entire Integrated Water Service in Rome. Since then, Acea has carried out uncountable operations, including the design and building of numerous main sewage systems – such as the grand aqueduct in Peschiera designed by Engineer Gaetano Roselli Lorenzini in 1910. The Company’s experience therefore commenced with distributing drinking water in the the capital of Italy and now covers four regions: Lazio (ATO 2-Central Lazio and ATO 5-Southern Lazio), Campania (ATO 3Sarnese Vesuviano) and in other ATOs in Umbria and Tuscany, where it operates through five companies: Acque, Publiacqua and Acquedotto del Fiora, Umbra Acque and – as of 2009 Nuove Acque120. The overall user group served by the Group amounts to around 8 million people, while the drinking water placed on the network in 2009 amounted to 1,248.5 million cubic metres (see Chart 38). This section will go on to illustrate Acea’s operations on the “historical” networks in Lazio through Acea Ato 2, while further details concerning other companies can be seen on the attached CD comprising Environmental Accounts and the Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas. Chart 38 – DRINKING WATER VOLUMES PLACED ON THE NETWORK GLOBAL AND ACCORDING TO COMPANY (2009) Acea Ato 2 599.1 Acea Ato 5 86.4 Gori 209.1 Acque 82.0 Publiacqua 153.3 AdF 59.7 Umbra Acque 58.9 total 1.248.5 millions of cubic metres 0 300 600 900 1200 1500 The Integrated Water Service in ATO 2–Central Lazio Acea Ato 2 provides the Integrated Water Service in ATO 2-Central Lazio (including not only the city or Rome, but also 111 other towns): from collecting water from sources to distributing drinking water to homes and collecting and treating wastewater. Drinking water comes from sources subject to long-standing agreements. 120 Nuove Acque entered the Group consolidation scope in October 2009, therefore 2009 water figures are not included in the sustainability report. WATER SECTOR 165 A number of springs (Peschiera, Capore, Acqua Marcia, Acquoria, Salone, Vallepietra; Ceraso), wells (Pantano Borghese, Finocchio, Torre Angela, Torre Spaccata; Doganella; Ceraso; former Casmez) and Bracciano Lake are the main sources of water supplies for over 3 million inhabitants through eight aqueduct systems both gravity and pressure operated. Three additional supply sources – the Traianee and Salone streams and the River Tiber provide nondrinking water used for the sprinkler system following suitable treatment. The volume of water placed on the network for the entire ATO 2 area in 2009 amounted to around 600 million cubic metres, around 474 million cubic metres of which on the “historical network” of Rome and Fiumicino. Acea takes great care when collecting water from its sources to ensure it has no effect on the ecosystems and surrounding protected areas (safeguarded sources are listed in Table 79).

In order to ensure that such quality is maintained throughout the supply chain, intensive inspections and monitoring of the main chemical-physical and microbiological parameters are carried out (see Tables 80-82). Two types of examinations are carried out on Acea Ato 2 drinking water: first-level checks carried out by ongoing gauging units placed along aqueducts and second-level checks carried out by LaboratoRI SpA, a Group company accredited by ACCREDIA (formerly SINAL) involving chemical-physical, chemical-organic and microbiological analyses on samples taken from various spots along the entire aqueduct system every day (see Table 80). 121 Under ordinary conditions, Pertuso springs are used by Enel to produce electricity, while the springs in Vallepietra and in Ceraso supply the aqueduct network in Simbrivio. In the event of seasonal lack of water Pertuso is also used, thereby interrupting electricity production. This procedure is regulated by a specific provision issued by the Simbrivio Commissioner for Water Crises. 166 Table 80 – ANALYSES ON DRINKING WATER – HISTORIC NETWORK IN ROME (2007-2009) Environmental Issues 2007 2008 2009 2007 2008 2009 withdrawal points (no.) total samples (no.) total analyses (no.) collection 45 951 818 682 50,306 44,885 31,139 aqueducts and pipelines 33 541 640 500 22,626 22,585 19,499 reservoirs/water centres 17 1,493 623 214 11,228 12,252 11,432 supply networks 320 3,860 3,860 3,933 131,908 124,716 125,604 total 415 7,043 5,941 5,329 216,068 204,438 187,674 NB: the same withdrawal points were used all three years.

The Sewage Service and Treatment System The treatment system comprises sewage systems, collection systems connected to the sewage system and main sewage system and treatment plants, the potential of some of which exceeds 10 m3/s. The Group sewage service managed by all water companies coves over 23,600 km, comprising around 870 operational treatment plants that dealt with around 851 million cubic metres of wastewater in 2009 (see Charts 39-41, attached Environmental Accounts and – for more details concerning individual companies Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas). 168 Environmental Issues Chart 39 – OVERALL SEWAGE SYSTEM IN KMs AND BY COMPANY (2009) Acea Ato 2 5,979 Acea Ato 5 1,720 Gori 2,440 Acque 3,000 Publiacqua 4,197 AdF 3,100 Umbra Acque 3,180 total 23,616 km 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 Chart 40 – OVERALL NUMBER OF TREATMENT PLANTS AND BY COMPANY (2009) Acea Ato 2 176 Acea Ato 5 130 Gori 15 Acque 142 Publiacqua 130 AdF 126 Umbra Acque 155 total 874 no. plants 0 200 400 600 800 Chart 41 – OVERALL AMOUNT OF WASTE WATER TREATED AND BY COMPANY (2009) Acea Ato 2 595,8 Acea Ato 5 28,5 Gori 7,4 Acque 46,8 Publiacqua 84,4 AdF 25,8 Umbra Acque 62,0 total 850,7 cubic metres in millions 0 200 400 600 800 WATER SECTOR 169 The key treatment plants managed by Acea Ato 2 in the “historical” area of Rome and Fiumicino treated 527 million cubic metres of water in 2009, an increase of around 7% with respect to 494 m3 in 2008. Taking into account smaller treatment plans and those taken over in towns in ATO 2, this amount increases to an overall volume of around 596 million cubic metres. As at 31.12.2009, this company managed 466 sewage collection systems, 158 of which in Rome, and 176 treatment plants, 35 of which in Rome123. “Treatment efficiency”, in other words the efficiency with which the main pollutants in wastewater are removed, was once again satisfactory in 2009, and outward levels of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and TSS (Total Suspended Solids) within the limits established by current laws (Legislative Decree 152/06). COD and TSS volumes removed have increased over the last few years in absolute terms (see Charts 42 and 43124. The sewage systems managed in the ATO 2 area cover around 5,979 km (1,953 km of which serving towns outside of Rome).

Acea Group strategy to this regard is Environmental Issues to develop an integrated system to use the sludge produced through recovering it and establishing a controlled chain comprising the producer to subject responsible for recovery or end user. Acea Group company Aquaser operates in this sector and is specialized in recovering and disposing of sludge, which is subsequently used as a replacement for fertilizers in agriculture and producing compost for farms or recovering energy. Aquaser disposed of 175,896 tons of waste (sludge, sand and sediment) on behalf of Group companies Acea Ato 2, Acea Ato 5 and Acquedotto del Fiora and 6,308 tons of sludge on behalf of an outside company Asa SpA (responsible for IWS in ATO 5Tuscany Coast) – in 2009. Last year, Aquaser took over two companies Solemme and Kyklos -, each of which has a composting plant and is authorized to treat sludge. The Kyklos plant with potential of 60,000 tons of composting waste was inaugurated in July 200. The technology used and treatment potential makes this the leading company in Lazio in terms of recovering organic waste125. A campaign to raise awareness and increase involvement in farmers’ associations was conducted to ensure the availability of land for agronomic recovery of sludge and Aquaser received two permits for recovering sludge in 2009, around 250 hectares in the Rome municipality and around 150 hectares in Pitigliano (Grosseto). Agronomic recovery of sludge commenced in the former company in summer 2009 (around 2,000 tons). Finally, particular attention was paid to ensure reliability in this chain, whereby the transport companies used underwent inspections and a remote control system was implemented to ensure constant tracking and monitoring of transporters. 125 Sludge disposal was carried out through agreements with other companies as well as by Solemme SpA and Kyklos Srl in 2009 and sludge was reused for farming purposes: either as it was or following composting. WATER SECTOR 171 RATIONAL USE OF RESOURCES Direct and Indirect Energy Consumption As already mentioned in Energy Saving, “smart grids” and renewable sources, Acea monitors direct and indirect consumption to keep them under control and, where possible, limit them to ensure the lowest possible impact on the environment. Tables 83 and 84 illustrate direct energy consumption by the Group, including consumption of energy from primary sources (above all natural gas) used to generate electricity/heating and the energy consumed by corporate fleet, both of which decreased in 2009. Indirect consumption (Table 85) refers to, for example, electricity losses occurring during distribution and transmission (due to losses during transformation and transportation, fraud and incorrect readings) and heat losses in the district heating network.

(*) Consumption for distributing and treating water includes all water companies in the report scope as of 2008. Water Consumption Group water consumption, mostly due to water used to cool AceaElectrabel Produzione and Tirreno Power thermoelectric stations decreased on the whole in 2009 (see Table 86). One of the most important projects to limit impact on the environment that has been ongoing for some years now involves the connection channel between the Tor di Valle Electricity station requiring cooling and wastewater leaving the neighbouring Roma Sud treatment plant: the vicinity of these two industrial plants ensured both the best possible use of the product generated by one of these (treated water) as the fluid required in the other and that no other water was required from the surrounding environment. Water for “civil/sanitary” use – around 2 m3 in 2009 – undergoes the same treatment as wastewater produced by Rome’s population and is subsequently discharged into the River Tiber. The relative impact on the environment – in line with the biological features supporting the vitality of this River – is relatively low due to the low concentrations of pollutants transported (see Table 87). With regard to the type of water sources used, the Group mainly uses water from aqueducts, while the water used to cool the Tor Di Valle station comes from the south Rome Treatment Plant and Tirreno Power also uses seawater for its operations (16% of the overall amount used), thereby helping safeguard natural water resources. A matter of particular importance with regard to managing integrated water systems is leaks on the distribution network, to which Acea pays careful attention. The Group uses human and economic resources every year in order to improve performances by identifying and repairing leaks (see Research and Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas for details on individual water companies).

This value derives from subtracting the water sold (A10) and any other failed delivery to end users from the overall amount of water entering the network: consumption for emergencies (A11), washing (A12), faults (A13), fraud (A14), mistaken readings (A16). 174 EMISSIONS AND WASTE Environmental Issues Emissions into the Atmosphere Acea monitors emissions from its thermoelectric plants – continuously if possible – through specific analyzers subject to regular controls by both in-house staff and external qualified laboratories. The main AceaElectrabel Produzione and Tirreno Power production plants have environmental Certification and are committed to reducing micro-pollutants (CO, NOx and SO2) and limiting carbon dioxide emissions (CO2). In 2009, AceaElectrabel Produzione achieved specific CO2 emission of 388 g/kWh and low nitrogen oxide emissions due to the dry-low-NOx devices in the burners of the latest combine cycle generation plants, which managed to keep such emissions as low as is currently possible. Although Tirreno Power Plants use modern technologies, they also use a combination of fuels (including coal and fuel oil) which cause more emissions than natural gas. Tirreno Power specific CO2 emissions in 2009 therefore amounted to 527 g/kWh. The company is however committed to progressively limiting emissions into the atmosphere; a current programme to manage fume treatment systems in the coal section at Vado Ligure thermoelectric plant (Savona) has not only confirmed compliance with the established emission limits, but also ensured improvement in environmental performances and, more precisely, a reduction in concentrations of smoke-stack emissions with respect to legal limits of 2.5% for SO2, 2.5% for NOx and 30% for dust127.

The CO2 emissions assigned to the National Allocation Plan (NAP) for the Group for 2008-2009 and those effectively emitted are illustrated in Table 89. These values refer to overall volumes to attribute to each Station, while the emissions for Acea – recalculated according to shareholdings – are provided in Environmental Accounts in the attached CD. 127 The limits established by the MICA Decree in 1993 and Legislative Decree 152/06 (Annex 2, part 5), are 400 mg/Nm3 for SO2, 200 mg/Nm3 for NOx and 50 mg/Nm3 for dust, while the programmes to improve environmental performance in Tirreno Power have led to concentrations in the Vado Ligure Station of 390 mg/Nm3 for SO2, 195 mg/Nm3 for NOx and 35 mg/Nm3 for dust.

Acea Group Waste Group waste production is described separately for the energy and water sectors, as indicated in the Environmental Accounts (pages 16-18). This distinction is considered essential as these two areas represent extremely different businesses both in terms of management and regulations and consequently with respect to waste production. The overall amount of waste produced in the energy area128 includes the amounts deriving from distributing electricity and producing energy (by AceaElectrabel Produzione and, as of 2008, Tirreno Power), amounting to 8,602 tons (around 937 t of which was “hazardous waste”, around 11% of the overall waste) and waste deriving from Waste-To-Energy operations (substantially ash and waste), amounting to 42,815 tons (12,271 t of which “hazardous waste”, around 29% of overall waste) (see Chart 45). 128 The overall amount of waste in the energy sector includes 50% of waste produced by the Holding Company (around 29 tons, 5 of which are classified as “hazardous waste”). 176 Environmental Issues Chart 45 – WASTE PRODUCED BY THE GROUP BY ENERGY AREA (2007-2009) hazardous and nontons hazardous waste Waste-To-Energy waste 50,000 42,332.7 42,815.4 40,000 37,384.7 30,000 20,000 8,602.6 10,000 2,285.7 3,760.0 0 2007 2008 2009 NB:“hazardous and non-hazardous waste” includes the amounts for which Acea is responsible according to shareholding (100% Distribuzione, 100% A.R.I.A.

The waste from treatment of wastewater should be taken into consideration separately, which amounted to around 253,789 tons of sludge in 2009 (56% by Acea Ato 2 alone) and 16,766 tons of sand and sediment (58% by Acea Ato 2).

EMISSIONS AND WASTE 177 Acea uses specialized and authorized outsourcers for the purposes of waste disposal. A number of companies achieve: high percentages of recovered waste Acea Distribuzione recovers 43% of overall waste (526 t out of around 1,222 t), Acea Ato 2 recovers 23% (664 t out of 2,913 t), Acea Electrabel Produzione sends around 16% of waste for recovery (538 t out of 3,281 t ) and – above all 88% of hazardous waste (474 t out of 539 t). The Tirreno Power Vado Ligure Station sends 100% of ash (light and heavy) and plaster produced to cement works. Tirreno Power manages to send around 83% (24.484 t out of 29,647 t)130 of all other waste for recovery. Furthermore, separate waste collection has also been carried out on the premises of the Head Office in Rome since 2008, also due to daily cooperation and commitment from all the employees working there. Around 36,160 kg of paper, cardboard and plastic was collected by the authorized companies and sent for recycling in 2009. 130 See also relative fact sheet in Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas. 178 AIR QUALITY IN ROME Environmental Issues Checks on Heating Systems and Mobility Acea helps keep the level of emissions into city air under control both by checking civilian heating systems on behalf Municipality of Rome and through an efficient fleet of vehicles. “Sanacaldaia” and “Caldaie sicure” Programmes Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici SpA checks and inspects civilian heating systems on behalf Municipality of Rome to ensure they comply with legislation on limiting energy consumption. According to current laws131, towns with over forty thousand inhabitants are obliged to check the effective maintenance and working conditions of heating systems in their territory. These programmes are called Sanacaldaia (Healthy Boiler) and Caldaie Sicure (Safe Boilers): the former concerns Centralized heating systems exceeding 35 kW for heating uses and the latter concerns individual heating systems below 35 kW (so-called “independent” systems). There are around 26,200 Centralized heating systems amounting to 8,566 MW, whereas “independent” heating systems in Rome amounted to around 632.000 with estimated power of around 6,000 MW. In view of the current trend not to install Centralized heating systems in new buildings, the number and figures concerning these have remained basically stable over the last few years whereas, although the number of independent systems is increasing, they however have little affect on the overall number of systems installed as they involve such small power levels. An analysis of the fuels used in these systems illustrates that: natural gas is used in 86% of systems exceeding 35 kW and in almost all independent systems (below 35 kW); diesel counts for around 13% of fuel used in Centralized systems; other fuels (mainly biodiesel, LPG, pellets) count for just 1% of the fuel used in Centralized systems. More specifically, LPG is more popular on the outskirts which is not served by the gas mains.

Over the last few years, the fleet has remained stable at around 2,450 vehicles, however latest generation vehicles have increased (euro 4) to replace “older” vehicles and, for the same reason, other vehicles still running in 2009 are due to be replaced in 2010. No important changes in nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) emission were therefore recorded in 2009 with respect to the year before, while CO2 emissions fell slightly due to a slight decrease in fuel consumption (diesel and petrol, see Table 83). 132 See also Emissions and waste, as well as that illustrated in Emissions from Vehicles and Air Conditioning in the attached Environmental Accounts, page 19. 180 RESEARCH Environmental Issues Acea supports leading Research Centres and Legislation Agencies for the sectors in which it operates (see relative box in Institutions and the Company) and has continued to develop numerous studies, experiments and applications for new technology or innovative products and processes through operational companies such as LaboratoRI, Acea Ato 2, Acque, A.R.I.A. Group, Acea Distribuzione, Acea Reti e Servizi Energetici and others133, often with cooperation with universities. Research in the energy sector above all involves innovation concerning renewable energies or lighting technology. Projects for the water sector mostly deal with safeguarding resources, streamlining their use, treating wastewater and economic and financial aspects in relative management. Particular attention is paid to recovering water losses every year due to the affects it has on management. This aspect has been dealt with for a number of years by both Acea Ato 2 with cooperation from LaboratoRI and other Group water companies via “district metering” (see relative box).

Tables 90-93 provide a summary of the main actions taken over the last few years and continued in 2009 with respect to the environmental water area, divided into 4 smaller areas: springs and drinking water, treatment plants, catchment areas and sewage systems. In addition to the research activities illustrated hereunder, LaboratoRI also supports other Group companies, for example designing and supporting management of the treatment plant for water used to squeeze pulper for Terni EnA in 2009. 133 See also Company Fact Sheets Italy-Overseas.

The following operations were carried out in 2009: digitalization and mapping of the main sewage system profiles; schematization of hydraulic structures found in 2008; inclusion of updated information concerning the census for an estimate of wastewater; reconstruction of draining basin features (urban and otherwise); monitoring of the quality and quantity of water entering the south Rome treatment plant; processing of data concerning rain for the events recorded.
