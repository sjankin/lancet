It’s almost impossible to imagine a world without energy. It’s even more difficult to imagine the future of this energy if it’s not rationally used. This is the challenge of sustainability. A collective test, in which each of us has to rethink the way we act to promote the welfare. Since it was founded, when sustainability wasn’t even spoken of, Cemig has assumed this commitment. More than generating, transmitting and distributing energy, Cemig orients its actions along a long-term horizon, without forgetting its core values. All this is part of a circle. The more we develop, the more energy we need. And the more energy we generate, the greater our potential for growth. A virtuous circle, which began with the founding of Cemig and permeates our values and guides our actions, each and every day. 1 Parajuru wind farm Highlights of 2010 • Installed capacity: 6,896 MW. 2.8 • Transmission lines: 8,768 km. • Distribution Lines: 474,559 km. •M arket share – Brazilian Electric Sector: Distribution: 12%.
