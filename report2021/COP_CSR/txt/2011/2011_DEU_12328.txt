BSH BOSCH UND SIEMENS HAUSGERÄTE GMBH The Board's introduction to the progress report to the UN Global Compact BSH joined the Global Compact in 2004. During the World Economic Forum in Davos in 1999, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed the setting-up of a Global Compact. Annan invited economic leaders from all over the world to join this compact to intensify the UN's interactions with businesses and help to achieve its Millennium Development Goals. This initiative is an appeal to businesses to ensure that all people will benefit from globalization. BSH played a leading role in drawing up a code of conduct based on the Global Compact for the European Committee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers (CECED) in 2005. We then drafted our own Business Conduct Guidelines on this basis and implemented them throughout the Group in 2006. Our code of conduct for suppliers, which has been included in supply contracts since 2007, is also based on the UN Global Compact. BSH's yearly Environmental and Corporate Responsibility Report presents the progress made at BSH on realizing the Global Compact principles. Our manufacturer’s understanding of sustainability centers on a very comprehensive notion of product responsibility and the tireless pursuit of better ways to use BSH’s products, sales opportunities and expertise to achieve the objectives of sustainable development worldwide. Our innovative and super-efficient home appliances will in particular enable us to make a crucial contribution to addressing the future issues of climate protection, energy efficiency and resource conservation.
