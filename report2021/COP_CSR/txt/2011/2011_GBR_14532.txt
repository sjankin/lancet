Helping children affected by climate change Since signing up to UNICEF’s Climate Positive initiative in May 2011, we’ve partnered with UNICEF on projects to help communities around the world become more resilient to the effects of climate change. Our aim is to improve water supply in communities where prolonged droughts and short rainy seasons mean that only a third of primary schools have access to water and sanitation facilities. As part of the partnership, we funded rainwater harvesting systems in Mozambique schools to collect potable water, benefitting approximately 18,000 students. This will help to keep more children in school by tackling barriers such as poor health, access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities within schools. ‘It is fantastic to see Freshfields showing leadership with their climate change commitments. It is indisputable that climate change is already having a devastating effect on children’s lives around the world.’ Lucy Stone, climate change specialist, UNICEF Freshfields corporate responsibility report 2011 28 Introduction Supporting our Valuing our people Protecting our Business and ethics Performance communities natural resources Responsible resource use In our approach to environmental issues, we apply the precautionary principle – if the consequences of an action are uncertain and potentially harmful, we err on the side of caution.
