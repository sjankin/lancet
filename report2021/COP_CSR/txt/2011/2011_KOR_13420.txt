Stakeholders of Lotte Shopping Lotte Shopping (hereinafter called “LOTTE”) Sustainability Report 2011 (hereinafter “The Report”) was structured and prepared by the management of LOTTE, who retains responsibility for the contents and data presented in The Report. SolAbility (hereinafter “The Auditor”) was assigned by the management of LOTTE to conduct an independent third-party review of the full Report. The objective of this review is to externally assure that statements and data presented in The Report are free of material misstatements and based on thorough data collection systems. Assurance Methodology The Auditor’s assurance work has been planned and performed in accordance with internal guidelines that go beyond leading international assurance standards. The Report and Report contents have been evaluated against the following criteria: • Responsiveness • Materiality • Reliability In addition, The Report has also been assessed against the reporting criteria as outlined in the Global Reporting Initiative’s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (GRI G3). Scope of this assurance engagement The Auditor’s assurance engagement covers and reviewed and examined the following: • Review of whether financial data has been derived adequately and correct from the financial statement audited by an external third-party auditor • Provision of assurance on whether policies and management systems in The Report are reflected adequately • Provision of assurance on whether non-financial data in The Report is presented in full, and free of material misstatement Assurance process and works undertaken In order to provide assurance to the stakeholders, The Auditor undertook the following steps during the assurance engagement: •Reviewed a selection of external media reports • Review of the current sustainability issues that could affect LOTTE’s business and are of interest to LOTTE’s stakeholders • Reviewed LOTTE’s processes for determining material issues to be included in The Report • Performed a peer review of global sustainability reports to benchmark disclosure levels • Reviewed selected group-level documents relating to safety, social, ethical and environmental aspects of LOTTE’s performance, to test the coverage of topics within The Report against stakeholder information needs. • Conducted interviews with senior managers of LOTTE • Reviewed relevant policies, guidelines and management systems at store and corporate level • Reviewed LOTTE approach to data collection and data management at corporate and site level • Reviewed internal performance documentation of non-financial data presented in The Report • Conducted LOTTE headquarter visits, interviewing high level management and operational managers for relevant business units • Reviewed environmental, health and safety related processes at site and corporate level • Reviewed store data collection and management systems at site level and verified sample data to test whether non-financial data have been collected, consolidated and reported appropriately at corporate level and the locations visited. Limitations of this assurance engagement The scope of this assurance engagement was limited to LOTTE headquarter and a sample store visited in Korea. The Auditor did not conduct any visits to overseas facilities or projects in which LOTTE holds interests. Our review of data processes included the following data sets: environmental data, health & safety data, as well as social data. Verification of non-financial data was conducted based on samples on corporate and store level; however, not all data at all stores have been verified. Our review of these data processes at operations level was limited to the LOTTEoperated businesses visited. Findings We reviewed and provided feedback on drafts of The Report and the data presented, and where necessary changes were made. On the basis of the work undertaken, nothing came to our attention to suggest that The Report does not properly describe LOTTE’s non-financial performance. 110 LOTTE Shopping Sustainability Report 2011 Our conclusions On the basis of our review and in accordance with the terms of reference for our work we provide the following conclusions on The Report. Our conclusions should be read in conjunction with the above section on “Assurance process and works undertaken” and “Limitations of this assurance engagement” Completeness Has LOTTE provided significant information to its stakeholders in an appropriate manner? Has LOTTE reflected its business operation and external impacts in The Report? • We consider that the scope of The Report and information contained in The Report reflects stakeholders’ interests appropriately and covers the material issues. • We don’t consider that there are material issues that are not contained in The Report concerning stakeholders’ interests. Materiality Has LOTTE provided a balanced representation of material issues concerning LOTTE’s sustainability performance in its operations and business interests? • We consider that the information contained in The Report covers the most relevant aspects of LOTTE's sustainability management and performance according to LOTTE’s business and operations. •Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that LOTTE's management has not applied its processes for determining material issues to be included in The Report, as described in “Assurance Methodology” Reliability Are the contents and the data presented in The Report complete and free of material misstatements? • We have reviewed internal policies, processes and management systems. Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that The Report contents are not free of material misstatements. • We have reviewed data collection systems and verified samples of the presented non-financial data. Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that health, safety or environmental data presented in The Report has not been properly collected and consolidated from information reported at operations level. Responsiveness How does The Report respond to stakeholder concerns and information needs? Does The Report fully reflect LOTTE’s operations and external impacts? • We have reviewed internal and external stakeholder-related information and consider that the information presented in The Report responds to most stakeholder information needs and requests. Observations and issues for further consideration by the management of LOTTE • LOTTE has made steady progress in improving management systems and policies related to sustainability issues over the past years • We welcome the inclusion of product sustainability in the new report format, a first step to extend sustainability from operational impacts to the external impacts • While LOTTE has made progress in terms of sustainability, most activities happen isolated in the absence of a corporate-wide integrating sustainability framework • The Auditor therefore recommends that -LOTTE keeps refining and developing its sustainability management systems and structure across all operations, and extends relevant policies and management to overseas expansion projects. -Defines long-term sustainability key performance indicators and targets on corporate level and implements regular internal reporting and monitoring of these indicator on the top management level -Capitalises on synergy potential by streamlining sustainability management policies and processes across the different business units Our independence The Auditor was not involved in the preparation of any part of The Report, and has no other affiliation with LOTTE that might compromise our independence or autonomy or place The Auditor under LOTTE's influence, therefore ruling out any possible conflicts of interest.
