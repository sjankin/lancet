Overview 1 Message From Our CEO Ten Years of Sustainability Reporting Our first Sustainability Report was published 10 years ago. However, with over 100 years of operating experience, the seed of sustainability was planted much earlier at Teck. Today, sustainability is deeply rooted in our company, and we continue to push ourselves to further embed sustainability into our culture. With 10 years of sustainability reporting behind us, 2010 marks a natural point in time to reflect on the progress we have made and where we can improve on our sustainability performance. At Teck, sustainability is about considering people, communities and the environment, now and in the future, in every decision we make. In our first report, the message was simple: sustainability matters. And while much has changed in the world and across our company since that time, this simple truth has not. Sustainability matters – to our employees, our shareholders and the communities where we live and operate. The 2001 Sustainability Report was the result of our commitment to the then newly adopted Charter of Corporate Responsibility. The same Charter still guides us today. Also guiding our approach is our participation in sustainability-focused associations, including the International Council on Mining and Metals and its 10 Sustainable Development Principles, and the Mining Association of Canada’s Towards Sustainable Mining initiative, which we have applied across all our operations. Since 2001, Teck has experienced tremendous growth – through investment and the employment of thousands of people – which brings both new challenges and new opportunities to our sustainability efforts. To examine these challenges, in 2010 we established a Sustainability Working Group, composed of employees from across the company, to gain a better understanding of our long-term sustainability challenges and opportunities. This group evaluated the most significant challenges and opportunities facing our company and identified six key areas on which we would focus our sustainability strategy: Community, Water, Ecosystems and Biodiversity, Energy and Climate Change, Materials Stewardship, and Our People. Community Our efforts to develop open, honest and respectful relationships with communities continue to be the foundation for our sustainability initiatives. Aiding us in this respect is our Social Management and Responsibility toolkit, which is helping us manage social risks and monitor social performance. We have also had many experiences working collaboratively with communities. For instance, we provided the use of site infrastructure as part of a pilot solar energy project at the former Sullivan Mine in Kimberley, BC, which is allowing us to further support the transformation of Kimberley many years after the operation’s closure. Water We recognize that water is a precious resource and that mining processes require significant amounts of water, which can affect other water users. The success of a pipeline construction and water intake project and a water monitoring program in the Elqui region of Chile illustrate that community engagement and water stewardship can overcome these challenges. Ecosystems and Biodiversity Our exploration and mining activities have the potential to affect ecosystems and biodiversity. We are committed to integrating biodiversity considerations into all stages of our business and minimizing the effects of our activities on ecosystems and biodiversity. For example, we have transformed a mined pit into a thriving trout habitat at our Cardinal River Operations and quickly completed the reclamation of our Lennard Shelf Pillara Mine in Australia. Energy and Climate Change Mining is an energy-intensive business, making energy and climate change a natural focus for sustainability at Teck. In 2010, the introduction of new technologies at our operations supported our goal of continuously increasing our energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For example, at Highland Valley Copper we replaced our copper concentrate dryer with a new system that uses pressure filtration technology, allowing us to switch energy sources from natural gas to hydroelectricity. We also partnered with Suncor Energy to develop the Wintering Hills wind power project in Alberta, providing us with the opportunity to develop our understanding of wind power generation and supporting our commitment to contribute to the sustainable production and use of energy. 2 Teck 2010 Sustainability Report Materials Stewardship Responsibly producing products is an integral part of our materials stewardship practices. More than 13,000 tonnes of e-waste and cathode ray tube (CRT) glass – or over 1,300 truckloads of material – were processed at our Trail Operations in 2010. Trail Operations recycles post-consumer e-waste and CRT glass found in old television sets. This urban ore is received from recycling depots in BC and suppliers across Western Canada. Our People As always, the safety of our people is a top priority. In 2010, we continued training new employees and contractors in Courageous Safety Leadership (CSL), a safety philosophy based on “Everyone Going Home Safe and Healthy Every Day”. These individuals join the more than 12,000 Teck employees and contractors already trained in CSL. We also launched the visible, felt leadership program, among other initiatives, to actively engage all employees to adopt safety – their own and that of others – as a core value. We believe we can operate without fatalities or serious injury. Despite this belief and our best efforts, I am saddened to report that we did have one fatality at our Carmen de Andacollo operation during 2010. This is an unhappy reminder that we must renew our safety commitments every day. Commitment to Sustainability In 2011, we were invited to be members of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) LEAD, a sustainability leadership platform with some 50 participant companies from around the world committed to achieving higher levels of sustainability performance, impact and collective action. We are committed to improving our sustainability performance and increasing collaboration. Actions we will take as a member of Global Compact LEAD will include participating in regular symposiums and reporting on our progress towards implementing the UNGC Blueprint, a model for corporate sustainability leadership. As one of the world’s largest producers of zinc, we recognize the role we can play in finding solutions to the global issue of zinc deficiency in humans and in soils. Throughout 2010, we worked with the international community to develop zinc treatment and zinc nutritional programs that help save and sustain the lives of children in developing countries. Organizations we are working with include the International Zinc Association, UNICEF, the Micronutrient Initiative, the Government of Canada and others. We were honoured to provide the gold, silver and copper used to produce the medals awarded at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. By incorporating recycled metal into the medals, we sent a message to a global audience that the life of our products extends far beyond their original use. We will continue our efforts to create awareness of the importance of metals and recycling with our commitment to supply metals for the medals awarded in amateur sport in Canada’s Summer and Winter Games. Outlook Our overall performance in sustainability was highlighted in 2010 with our appointment to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, indicating that our sustainability practices rank in the top 10% of companies in the resource industry worldwide. This appointment helps to confirm that we are doing the right things. However, we will not rest on our laurels. We will continually strive to do better. With over a century of operating experience behind us, we have learned many valuable lessons – some of them learned the hard way – and we will continue to apply these lessons and our own core values to the decisions we make as we move forward, keeping in mind the generations still to come. This 2010 Sustainability Report highlights our vision and goals for sustainability – but it is only the beginning. We rely on people to deliver our commitments to sustainability and I would like to thank the many people at Teck who work each day to ensure we move closer to our sustainability goals. We are committed to engaging our communities of interest in our journey toward a future where we leave every community touched by our operations better than we found it. Donald R.

Our Approach 9 Envisioning the Future After identifying these key focus areas, the SWG envisioned The SWG evaluated the most significant challenges and opportunities the role that we can play in society’s transition to a sustainable facing our company and identified six key areas to focus our future by building a vision for each focus area. We engaged in sustainability strategy. They are: robust discussions about what sustainability means to us, why it is important, and how we define success. Envisioning the desired •• Community future for each focus area added clarity to where we want to •• Water be as a company and has enabled us to plan the path forward. •• Ecosystems and Biodiversity •• Energy and Climate Change •• Materials Stewardship •• Our People The key focus areas identified by the SWG aligned with the materiality analysis conducted by our Sustainability and External Affairs (SEA) department for our full Sustainability Report. A materiality analysis helps identify key issues that we want to communicate with our communities of interest, recognizing information that has the potential to influence the perception of communities of interest who make decisions and assessments about our commitment to sustainability. The SEA department’s materiality analysis guides our sustainability reporting and represents issues that are part of our day-to-day management; more details about the SEA department’s materiality analysis can be found in the material issues section on pages 29-30. The key focus areas identified by the SWG represent areas of strategic importance, upon which we focus our long-term sustainability strategy. The overlap between the SEA department’s materiality analysis and the key focus areas identified by the SWG validate the importance of the issues identified by the SWG.

For example, energy is essential to improving the standard of living for communities and Creating Goals that Bring Us Closer to Our Vision there are significant social impacts for communities without access With our vision for each sustainability focus area in mind, we to energy. Another example is our stewardship of water, which has a identified long-term and short-term goals that will bring us closer to direct impact on ecosystems and biodiversity. The fair allocation of our envisioned future. water also impacts communities. Each focus area is so interconnected that there will have to be trade-offs. For example, reducing our fresh water intake may require more energy-intensive technologies.

Our Approach 25 Part of managing social risk includes conducting a social impact Economic Development and Livelihoods assessment, which is a process used to analyze the socio-economic Projects can have direct and indirect effects on economic or human environment around a proposed project, mine or development and livelihoods. Opportunities that a project brings associated infrastructure. to the community include employment and income creation, local sourcing of goods and services, and tax and royalty contributions. Community of interest engagement and participation is fundamental At the same time, projects also have the potential to create boom to understanding the community impacts of mining and to ensuring and bust cycles, and to foster increased dependency among local that studies, findings and programs are based on accurate data and populations. Assessing the economic impacts of a project can also result in meaningful, realistic outcomes. The identification of issues be complex. For example, wage injections may improve purchasing and opportunities begins in exploration and continues to project power, trade in consumer goods and entrepreneurial opportunities, closure, assessing changes in effects as the project progresses. while simultaneously raising inflation and increasing income inequality. The types of social issues and impacts that can be associated with Communities that are poor or land-based are particularly sensitive to a mining project are now well documented in literature. With the impacts that an operation may have on local production systems and development of social baseline studies and assessments, we are now traditional livelihoods. better placed as a sector and as a company to understand, predict and most effectively address some of these impacts. Education, Skills and Training Throughout the life of an operation, large-scale long-term While not specific to any of our projects or operations, provided employment opportunities have the potential to increase access below are some examples of potential issues and associated impacts to education, skills and training. In communities with low levels that are often related to the development of a mining project, and of literacy or relevant skills, there are opportunities for mining that guide our analysis of project impacts. companies to enable the community to access these opportunities. Human Rights Health The scope of human rights considerations for extractive companies The development of infrastructure around a mine or operation often often focus on aspects such as security and labour rights. While improves access to health care for local communities. At the same both of these issues are important, human rights covers many time, an influx of people to the local community can introduce health issues relevant to a mining company, including health and safety, risks or overstress community health services. discrimination, poverty alleviation and access to natural resources.

Water Quantity In 2010, our total water withdrawal from ground, surface and other sources was approximately 125 million cubic metres (m3), as compared to approximately 119 million m3 in 2009. This increase in water withdrawal was largely driven by the changes in production processes at our Carmen de Andacollo (CdA) operations in Chile. To minimize the amount of freshwater intake, water is recycled throughout all of our industrial processes. In 2010, the total quantity of recycled or reused water within our operations was approximately 113 million m3, compared to 118 million m3 in 2009. The majority of this water is recovered from tailings facilities for reuse in the mill. We continue to work towards better understanding and management of our water consumption, reuse and discharge. Please see the Performance Overview table on pages 72-73 to find a more detailed breakdown of water withdrawal and usage information. 46 Teck 2010 Sustainability Report Case Study: Managing Selenium to Case Study: Engagement Builds Relationships Protect Water and Aquatic Life in Chilean Communities Selenium is a naturally occurring element essential to When we acquired Carmen de Andacollo mine (CdA) in 2007, there was humans and animals.

Our Biodiversity Guidance Manual (BGM) provides practical tools in which we operate. to identify and address key biodiversity concerns at each stage Ecosystems are communities of living organisms, their habitats and in the mining life cycle. By following the guidelines in the BGM, their interactions, while biodiversity is the variety of living organisms operating facilities evaluate environmental practices that can impact and ecosystems. Biodiversity conservation is the practice of biodiversity (such as land disturbances, air/dust emissions and water protecting the abundance and variety of species of organisms utilization), develop a biodiversity baseline, and implement siteon the planet. specific plans to conserve biodiversity and protect ecosystems. Our BGM includes guidelines for identifying protected areas and engaging Growing human populations, coupled with the continued desire for communities around biodiversity. a higher standard of living, result in rising demand for the earth’s resources, in turn increasing the pressures on ecosystems and We see mining as an interim and transitional land use that results in biodiversity. We explore and operate in many regions representing changes to the landscapes and natural systems. We assess these a variety of natural habitats, including tropical and arctic areas, systems carefully prior to disturbance and incorporate measures to boreal forests, and deserts. We recognize that our activities affect reduce our impacts through our planning, development, operations ecosystems and biodiversity. and reclamation. Measures used include avoiding key habitats, habitat creation and enhancement, creating offset mechanisms, Our business can directly affect ecosystems through land disturbance and minimizing our air, land and water disturbance footprint. and can influence the adjacent environments through air and noise These approaches enable us to minimize our net impact on emissions, water utilization and other factors. As such, we establish biodiversity and ecosystems, and can lead to positive contributions. environmental performance measures applicable at each of our For example, at our Highland Valley Copper operations, two decades operations, ensuring we conduct our planning, development, of monitoring of bird species abundance and diversity has shown that operations and reclamation activities in a manner that demonstrates the number of species in reclaimed areas has increased by 20%, to responsible environmental stewardship. 192 different species. We are committed to the use of responsible and effective biodiversity In support of biodiversity conservation, we will also pursue conservation practices in all phases of the mining life cycle. At each of additional actions in regions where we operate, moving us toward our operations, we strive to minimize environmental impacts and to a net positive contribution in the long term. For example, if a new maintain, or re-establish, safe and self-sustaining landscapes that can mine development involves an unavoidable impact on habitat that support healthy, stable and robust ecosystems for present and future is impossible to re-establish over a reasonable time frame, we generations.

In addition, we establish habitat value. environmental performance measures for each of our operations. We have been recognized by our industry peers, communities and regulators for exemplary reclamation. For example, in 2007 we were awarded the Major Reclamation Award by the Alberta Chamber of Resources for successfully reclaiming one of our mined pits at Cardinal River Operations into Sphinx Lake, which is now part of a watershed that provides a thriving habitat for rainbow and bull trout. 48 Teck 2010 Sustainability Report Management of Known Biodiversity Impacts Trail Operations Trail Operations is a mature lead smelter, zinc refinery and fertilizer plant Our operations work with local community groups and government in Trail, BC.

Emissions from the Trail Smelter are dominated by the Indirect Direct use of coal in the furnaces and natural gas to produce steam for heating process solutions. At Red Dog Operations, the diesel used to produce electricity and as fuel for mobile equipment is the key source of GHG emissions. The primary source at Highland Valley Copper, which receives electricity from the grid, is the use of diesel for mobile equipment. As such, the options for reducing emissions vary significantly across our different operations. Further details pertaining to our initiatives to reduce energy use and GHG emissions are provided on page 58. Historical data have been restated to account for improved methods for estimating emissions from coal consumption. Historically, such emissions had been estimated using an emission 5 factor. In 2010, we began sampling our coal and analyzing to develop a more accurate accounting of our emissions. Restatements reflect this improvement in accuracy. 6 Fugitive emissions from our coal operations (i.e., estimated methane release) are captured as direct emissions.

We have developed a suite of tools to manage our regulatory risks and their financial implications: Incorporating a Carbon Price in Decision Making We currently incorporate a carbon price into our capital and risk decision processes. Carbon pricing is being integrated at multiple levels of decision making, ranging from annual operating budgets developed at the site level to corporate decision making for large capital investments. We also calculate and consider our carbon exposure in terms of absolute costs incurred on an annual basis and projected out to at least 2020. Where uncertainty exists, we conduct sensitivity analyses to better understand our exposure and risk under different carbon pricing and regulatory scenarios.

This removal of moisture – or dewatering – is required represents more than 1.5 times the annual power consumption of for most of our products, including copper concentrate. The historical our Cardinal River Operations and, as a source of clean energy, the dewatering process required a large amount of heat. An operation project will receive carbon credits to offset emissions from Cardinal like HVC, which produced 99,000 thousand tonnes of copper in River. We expect our total investment in connection with the project concentrate in 2010, requires a lot of energy. to be approximately $66 million. Historically, HVC has used natural gas to provide heat for its dryer. Our partner, Suncor, has experience in wind power, and WH Natural gas is one of the cleanest burning fossil fuels, but it still represents its fifth and largest wind project to date. “The Wintering produces GHG emissions, and we wanted to find a better way.

(2) S afety statistics include both employees and contractors. Frequencies are based upon 200,000 hours worked. Severity is calculated as the number of days missed due to lost-time injuries per 200,000 hours worked. This year, we restated historical data to reflect our new calculation methodology, which weights safety statistics according to Teck’s ownership of each operation. New information or a reclassification of injuries may cause the reported data to change from the data originally recorded. The 2010 safety data was deemed accurate when reported externally in August 2011, but subsequent information has resulted in the increase of Total recordable injury frequency to 1.80; Lost-time injury frequency to 0.56; and Severity to 83 at the date of this report. (3) F ugitive emissions are incorporated in the “direct emissions” category. Direct (Scope 1) Emissions from 2006-2009 have been restated in this year’s report. Historically, emissions from the combustion of coal were calculated using a province-specific emission factor provided by Environment Canada’s National Inventory Report. In 2010, as part of the province of British Columbia and the Western Climate Initiative’s GHG reporting requirements, combusted coal was sampled and physically analyzed for Carbon Content. These Carbon Content analyses resulted in a higher emission factor, and we have therefore restated historical data to reflect this increase. (4) The spills events reported on a volume basis are independent of the spill events reported on a mass basis. (5) T he 2007 total is composed mainly (approximately 95%) of one very large volume spill of tailings slurry at the Hemlo mine. This spill, and the substantial improvements made in response, is described in our 2007 Sustainability Report under the heading “Significant Environmental Incidents.” (6) The large increase in weight of spills for 2009 and 2010 was due to incidents in which tanker trucks hauling sulphuric acid overturned on the access road to Quebrada Blanca. (7) R eclamation data in the 2006 Sustainability Report included operating sites and sites in active closure (Sullivan, Quintette, Bullmoose). Reclamation data in the 2007 Sustainability Report were based on the same three sites in active closure and all operating sites, including the six operating coal mines of Elk Valley Coal Corporation. As such, the 2006 and 2005 numbers in the 2007 report were restated to include data for these sites. Reclamation data for the period 2006 to 2010 reported in the 2008, 2009 and this current report have been restated to include data for operating mines only, per the scope defined by GRI and as used by our industry peers, i.e., reclamation data for sites in active closure are no longer included. (8) Discrepancies were noted in 2010 waste reporting at a number of sites. We will work towards standardizing the categories and restate data where needed in the 2011 report. (9) A significant portion of the surface water withdrawn (approximately 85%) is cooling water used by Trail Operations. This water does not come into contact with chemicals or reagents. The only change it undergoes is a slight increase in temperature. (10) T  his percentage calculation is based on the total volume of water recycled/reused divided by the total volume of water withdrawal. The GRI formula for calculation of Total Percentage of Water Recycled/Reused is inconsistently applied within the industry. We continue to work toward standardizing the methodology. Additional flow monitoring equipment will be installed at some operations in 2011 in a continuing effort to ensure more accurate flow measurements. Performance Overview 73 Our Path Forward 2010 marks our tenth year of sustainability reporting, but the seed of sustainability was planted at Teck many decades ago. It has grown over five generations of operating experience and, today, is deeply rooted in our company. During this time, each generation has worked to build a better company. They saw what the future could be and set out to achieve it. We felt it was important to reflect on the journey we have taken. Our 2010 Sustainability Review, available for download online, lays out our vision for each sustainability focus area, representing what a sustainable future could be in areas that represent the most significant challenges and opportunities we face. We have set out the longand short-term goals and actions that will allow us to achieve these visions. We have faced challenges along the way and know that achieving our visions for a sustainable future will not be easy. However, we have learned a lot over 100 years and we continue to apply these lessons. By engaging our people, the next generation of leaders in our company are embracing and taking ownership of our visions for a sustainable future. By pushing ourselves to innovate, we will build a stronger, more sustainable company that will continue to grow and prosper into the future. 74 Teck 2010 Sustainability Report Independent Assurance Report To the management of Teck Resources Limited: Reporting criteria Teck has described its approach to reporting material sustainability issues, performance measures, statements and claims related to the What we looked at: Scope subject matter in the “About our Report” section of the Sustainability Deloitte was engaged by Teck Resources Limited (Teck) to provide Report.
