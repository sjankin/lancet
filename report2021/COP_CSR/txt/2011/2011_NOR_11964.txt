For the CEO the aim is clear: Profitable growth and the most efficient operations possible. Two of his most important instruments to achieve this are continuous improvement and health promotion leadership. The term continuous improvement encompasses a number of measures to ensure that Norway Post remains a robust and competitive company. It's about continuously wondering how we can do things better and more efficiently being ahead of the game and laying the foundation for customers to view Norway Post as their preferred choice in the future. Improvements strengthen profitability, which again allows us the opportunity to realise our strategic goals, says Mejdell. He emphasises that continuous improvement is about minor and major improvements that together make a difference. 10 11 01 CEO CEO 01 Unqualified success.

The HS&E director and Environment senior management have the overall responsibility for the ongoing work with the climate accounts, and for creating system boundaries, reporting platforms and consolidating figures in accordance with current standards. We have carried out an overall review of the methods used and procedures for gathering figures, the use of factors, sources and core rules, and have based our statement on these. The climate accounts have been prepared in accordance with the principles of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, and consist of Scopes 1, 2 and 3. The calculations take into account the most important greenhouse gases, in addition to other significant emissions to the air. The accounts include figures for the Norway Post group in total, figures for the individual divisions, business areas and companies, as well as other environmental statistics such as waste, and a list of the vehicle fleet.
