The company is committed to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact concerning human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption and is dedicated to implementing them in all business processes. We uphold a reliable and sustainable corporate policy. Our CEO, Dr. Markus Conrad, emphasises this approach in his foreword to our 2010 Sustainability Report. Since its foundation in the year 2000, the UN Global Compact has been an international leadership network for business, government, labour and civil society with a common goal: to make sure the ten UN Global Compact principles are implemented in day-to-day business and to enforce broader UN goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. The UN Global Compact principles are based on: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption This Communication on Progress (CoP) gives detailed insight into how Tchibo implements the UN Global Compact principles in its policies and management systems and what goals we are pursuing.
