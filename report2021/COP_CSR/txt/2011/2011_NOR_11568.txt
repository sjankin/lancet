This means, among other things, that we have selected areas on which to focus over a longer period of time. In so doing, we have more continuity in our work and we achieve better results. Another goal is that within our areas of focus, we will discuss what we have done at length, including our results. This report marks a start, and in the 2011 report, we aspire to present a clearer picture of the results we achieve. 18 Kongsberg 2010 Corporate social responsibility Introduction 2-7 This is Kongsberg 8-13 Our governing bodies and guidelines 14-17 Activities, objectives and areas of focus 18-24 Corporate social responsibility 25-35 Environment 36-39 Appendices 40-44 Corporate Social Responsibility Activities 2010 The Group maintained its growth trend and high level of activities once again in 2010.

Over the past two years, we have built up a Corporate Compliance function, which has the main responsibility for verifying our compliance with anticorruption regulations. Our procedures and systems for compliance and follow up were updated in 2009. The main focus in 2010 was on operationalising compliance efforts throughout the Group, and not least on checking the integrity of our agents and market representatives.

This responsibility normally encompasses suppliers' positions on ethics, human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption. more collaboration The international trend is to take more responsibility for ensuring that the entire value chain honours an enterprise's standards. However, there are often practical and financial constraints on how far down the value chain it is possible for an individual enterprise to QA its suppliers. Many companies solve this challenge by setting standards for the first link in the supplier chain, at the same time as they require opportunities this link to set comparable standards for Collaboration with suppliers can also open for risk assessments and procedures for their front-line suppliers, etc. up business opportunities.

Within half an hour after a satellite has passed over a particular area of the ocean, an oil spill can be detected and notified. Satellite monitoring also helps ensure safer, 'greener' shipping in Arctic areas. Shipping in Arctic ocean territories More activity in the High North, whether this refers to commercial or scientific activities, can constitute a potential threat to the environment. Activities in Arctic areas also entail a great risk to people, vessels and equipment. Sailing between icebergs and drift ice in harsh weather and with sketchy knowledge of prevailing conditions makes navigation in these waters highly challenging. With steadily increasing activity levels in the Arctic, there is also a need for better, more accurate knowledge and information about conditions. KSAT's satellite services help ensure safer operations and protect the environment. Through satellite monitoring, KSAT can transmit radar images of conditions in the area in which a vessel is located. Every day, the crew of the Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) offers satellite-based service for environmental vessel receives images that map the area, services related to the monitoring of ocean monitoring.

The accounts cover all units in Norway, all production units and some offices abroad. Energy In connection with production and office activities, KONGSBERG consumes Total energy consumption at KONGSBERG has increased by 4 per cent since energy in the form of electricity, district heating, gas and fuel oil. Kongsberg 2009. The main explanations for this are a higher level of activity in the Group, Teknologipark AS (KTP) generates district heating for enterprises located in the that Kongsberg Maritime has moved into a new building in the technology park technology parks. District heating is produced using electricity, fuel oil, gas and and that, as from 2010, Kongsberg Teknologipark AS is also reporting energy heat recovery. In 2010, about 52 per cent of the district heating was delivered to consumption from property management. units in Kongsberg, while the remainder was delivered to other enterprises in the Relative energy consumption dropped slightly from 7.2 to 6.7 MWh per MNOK technology park. (Figure 1), while the share of oil and gas remained unchanged from 2009 at In 2010, a new central heating plant was built at KTP to recycle residual heat in roughly 2 per cent of total energy consumption. the cooling water from the technology parks and wastewater from Kongsberg's municipal purification plant.
