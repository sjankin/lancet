Global Compact Communication on Progress 2010 Statement In 2004, we signed the United Nations Global Compact and thus demonstrated our commitment to the promotion of its ten principles. We want to support sustainable development – through our approximately 285,000 associates, at our more than 300 locations around the world, and in their local environments. That is why our approach to business is values-based and environmentally friendly. This also reflects the principles of our company founder Robert Bosch, who pioneered corporate responsibility in Germany. For us, practicing sustainable and responsible corporate management means adhering to values and principles just as much as ensuring strict legal compliance. We believe the time for change has come, particularly in the mobility and energy sectors. By investing in renewable energies and electromobility, we have already started to prepare for this change. As climate change continues, we need new solutions for energy generation and mobility that will lead to a clear reduction in CO2 emissions while at the same time making sound economic sense. Through our products, we aim to support the impending transition to a climate-friendly economy and lifestyle on an international basis and thereby also safeguard our company’s long-term success. Collaborations and development partnerships are highlighting the way to go.
