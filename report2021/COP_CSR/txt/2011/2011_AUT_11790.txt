United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2010 Our vision: Building value. For a sustainable future. As a signatory of the UN Global Compact, Wienerberger is committed to incorporating the “ten principles” in the areas of human rights, labour rights, the environment and the fight against bribery and corruption into its business policies. This commitment is also expressed by the Wienerberger Mission Statement: “Wienerberger regards the economy as an integral part of society which is designed to serve people and generate benefits for all. Our goal is to create sustainable values with natural products: a residential environment of highest quality and safety for our customers, a sound investment for our shareholders and attractive jobs for our employees. We take our role as a responsible member of society seriously and act in accordance with economic, ecological and social principles – in order to remain successful in the future.” I feel personally committed to monitor Wienerberger’s efforts to implement the “ten principles” in its daily business. In 2010, we have taken several important steps to achieve this goal ranging from the improvement of energy efficiency in production and energyefficient product design to occupational safety. In our 2010 Sustainability Report, we report extensively on our challenges and successes in these areas – environmental protection in production, sustainable products, employees and corporate social responsibility. Heimo Scheuch, CEO United Nations Global Compact Wienerberger joined the UN Global Compact in 2003. This initiative was introduced by the United Nations in 1999 to promote good corporate citizenship and now encompasses ten guiding principles from the areas of human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and measures to combat corruption. Companies that join the program agree to voluntarily comply with the principles that are published on the UN Global Compact website. The following table provides an overview of some of the actions taken by Wienerberger during 2010 to implement the ten Global Compact (“GC”) Principles. Reference is made to the Wienerberger Sustainability Report 2010 which contains a detailed description of Wienerberger’s activities and policies to implement the GC principles. The table also refers to the corresponding Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators which provide a framework for measuring progress on the GC principles.
