Nothing in the universe exists alone. Everything is interdependent. We believe that valuing relationships is the foundation of an enormous human revolution in the search for peace, solidarity, and life in all of its manifestations. Continuously striving for improvement develops individuals, organizations, and society. Commitment to the truth is the route to perfecting the quality of relationships. The greater the diversity, the greater the wealth and vitality of the whole system. The search for beauty, which is the genuine aspiration of every human being, must be free from preconceived ideas and manipulation. The company, a living organism, is a dynamic set of relationships. Its value and longevity are connected to its ability to contribute to the evolution of society and its sustainable development. 3 2. moment Our 4 //naturareport2010_Our moment We are connected to the people and the challenges of our time.

We are a Brazilian cosmetics, fragrances and personal care company with a strong presence in Latin America. Since our founding in 1969, we have built a culture that values relationships. Our corporate behavior is focused on promoting sustainable development by improving awareness about responsible and innovative use of biodiversity assets. We strive to create value through solutions and new opportunities that we identify in partnership with our stakeholders — always with an eye to finding a balance between the social, environmental, and economic impacts of our business. We have adopted a direct sales business model because we believe in our ability to generate and distribute income, offer development alternatives and inspire more than 1.2 million sales consultants to disseminate our value proposition to our consumers. Natura directly employs more than 7,000 professionals. Our head office is in Cajamar, state of São Paulo, and we have five commercial offices in Brazil: Salvador (Bahia), Campinas and Alphaville (São Paulo), Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro), and Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul). Our plants and Research and Technology centers are located in Cajamar (São Paulo) and Benevides (Pará), and in 2006, we opened an Advanced Technology Center in Paris, France. In Brazil, our products are delivered to our consultants and consumers from distribution centers in Cajamar and Jundiaí (São Paulo), Canoas (Rio Grande do Sul), Matias Barbosa and Uberlândia (Minas Gerais), Simões Filho (Bahia), Jaboatão dos Guararapes (Pernambuco), and Castanhal (Pará). We have company-owned operations in France, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. In addition, we use local distributors to sell our products in Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In 2010, we began manufacturing in Argentina through local partnerships. We also have Natura Houses, which are centers where our consultants can work and train and where consumers can get to know our products. We have seven of these in Brazil, all in the state of São Paulo, 14 elsewhere in Latin America, and one in France. We have been a publicly traded company since 2004, with about 40% of our shares listed on the New Market of the São Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&FBovespa). For five consecutive years, we have been included in Bovespa´s Corporate Sustainability Index (CSI) (learn more on page 54, Shareholders). 10 //NATURAREPORT2010_OUR MOMENT France Colombia Brazil Peru Chile COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS PLANTS COMMERCIAL OFFICES Argentina DISTRIBUTION CENTERS NATURA HOUSES RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY CENTERS 11 OUR MARKET Once again, the cosmetics, fragrances, and personal hygiene sector continued growing at a record pace last year, this time, however, amid a scenario of strong expansion of Brazilian economy, estimated at 7.5% of GDP in 2010. With less strength, but with the same consistency, the rest of Latin America — notably Chile and Mexico — also reported increases in economic activity. The growth of the Latin American cosmetics market was double that of Europe and the United States over the past decade. The region now represents nearly 15% of the global cosmetics market, revealing the scale of opportunities in Latin America. According to data published by the Brazilian Association of the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Industries (Sipatesp/Abihpec), Brazil’s target market registered a nominal growth of 13.5% in 2010. Our value proposition once again boosted our leadership by more than 1.1 percentage points and reached a 24% share of our target market. Year after year, the direct-sales industry continues to attract people. According to the Brazilian Association of Direct Seles Companies (ABEVD), there are 2.7 million direct-sales representatives in Brazil. This represents a 12.2% increase over 2009. In 2010, the Natura Chronos line started to differentiate its products according to the intensity of the signs of aging, which depends on each woman’s life story. 12 //NATURAREPORT2010_OUR MOMENT MAIN HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR ECONOMIC Our net revenues totaled R$5.1 billion, a growth of 21.1%. We recorded EBITDA of R$1.2 billion, up 24.6% from the previous year, and an EBITDA margin of 24.5%, compared with 23.8% in 2009. We achieved net income of R$744.1 million, 8.8% above the previous year. We distributed more wealth to our stakeholders. The wealth generated to our employees increased 20%, for our consultants 19% and for our shareholders 17%. International manufacturing began through partnerships in Argentina. In 2011, we will begin operations in Mexico and Colombia. SOCIAL Natura had 1.2 million consultants at the end of 2010. This represents a growth of 17% in Brazil and of more than 20% in our international operations. The Natura Crer para Ver (Believing Is Seeing) program, which invests in education, received a record R$10 million in funding, 168% more than in 2009. Funding is based on sales of specific items in our portfolio. Revenues from sales of these items outside of Brazil totaled R$1.3 million. Although progress has been made, the quality of the service we provide to consultants has not yet reached the level we desire. We continue working to reduce our nonservice rate (NSR), which keeps track of products that are ordered by consultants but are unavailable. The survey on working climate generated a 73% overall favorable response rate from our employees, one percentage point below 2009. Declines in ratings in our international operations and among operational staff in Brazil contributed to this decrease. The loyalty of our consultants in Brazil rose from 17% to 21%, but declined among Natura Consultant Advisers, from 37% to 32%. ENVIRONMENTAL We extended the period for achieving a 33% reduction in our relative greenhouse gas emissions to 2013. The original target date was 2011. By 2011, our reduction was 21% We launched the first refill packaging made of polyethylene from sugar cane, a renewable source of energy. In addition to being 100% recyclable, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming by 58% compared with common plastic. We reduced relative water consumption by 10%, thanks to improvements that are intended to guarantee efficient use of resources. We created a methodology that measures the socioenvironmental impacts of our supply chain, in an effort to improve the selection of our suppliers. We were charged by the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) for failing to secure prior authorization to conduct research using inputs from Brazilian biodiversity. Natura does not agree with the procedure and has formally contested these charges. 13 2.4 OUR COMMITMENTS OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE CONSULTANTS AND NCAs 2 D E M O N S T R AT E D A C O M M I T M E N T TO QUALITY OF RELATIONSHIPS STRENGTHENING OUR PERFORMANCE 4. 2011 COMMITMENT: Achieve an 18% loyalty rate with consultants.

Concerning our employees, in addition to the loyalty index, we also conduct the climate survey, which assesses more specific issues related to the work environment, careers and job satisfaction. 2. The above indicators for quality of relations have an error margin corresponding to a 95% confidence interval. 3. Except for the favorable responses in the Climate Survey, the commitments for quality of relationships refer to the Brazilian operations. 15 2.5 GOVERNANCE NATURA CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IS PERMANENTLY ENHANCED. W E H AV E B E E N S I G N I F I C A N T LY FOCUSED ON THIS OBJECTIVE SINCE 2 0 0 4 , W H E N N AT U R A W E N T PUBLIC AND LISTED ITS SHARES ON THE SÃO PAULO STOCK EXCHANGE. Our Board of Directors comprises six members, including two founding partners, Antonio Luiz da Cunha Seabra and Pedro Luiz Barreiros Passos. The third founding partner, Guilherme Peirão Leal, resigned in 2010 to run as the Green Party vice presidential candidate. Of the other four members of the Board, three are independent. Board members are selected for their qualifications, knowledge on sustainability, experience in executive positions, and the absence of conflicts of interest. Board members’ compensation includes a fixed monthly component and a variable annual component linked to Natura’s economic, financial, social, and environmental results. We continually improve and reinforce internal controls and processes, which has enabled Natura to achieve SOX certification for accounting controls and financial reporting. SOX certification is based on criteria in the 2002 U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act and is required of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Natura is among the first Brazilian companies to obtain SOX certification, though this is not a Brazilian legal requirement. We believe that an efficient control environment produces transparency in the performance of our operations, ensures that our financial statements accurately present our business processes, and provides security for our stakeholders. In an effort to acquaint Board members with the customs of the various regions where we operate, the Board has scheduled meetings outside the company’s head office. Of the six regular meetings held last year, one took place in Rio de Janeiro in April, and another was held in Mexico in September. We will maintain this practice in 2011, holding one meeting annually in a Brazilian regional office and another meeting each year in one of the countries in which we do business. The Board of Directors is supported by four committees: Strategy; Corporate Governance; People and Organizational Development; and Audit, Risk Management, and Finance. The latter was reorganized in December 2010, and now only external and independent members may serve on this committee. This reorganization was intended to improve internal controls. The Audit, Risk Management, and Finance Committee is responsible for evaluating accounting, taxes, corporate affairs, and new investments. New members who took office in February 2011 receive technical support from a group of external specialists and Natura executives. In 2010, we sought to expand the participation of individual shareholders at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. We gathered 200 investors at our Cajamar unit, and they were able to follow — in real time — the shareholders’ meeting taking place at Natura’s head office in Itapecerica da Serra. Through this event, investors were able to come into closer contact with our company, its controlling shareholders, and executives (learn more on page 54 – Shareholders). Since 2007, Natura has been a member of the Company Circle of Latin American Corporate Governance, which consists of a group of Latin American corporations selected by the International Financial Corporation of the World Bank based on the quality of their governance practices. 16 //NATURAREPORT2010_OUR MOMENT EXECUTIVE GOVERNANCE Natura’s main executive body, the Executive Committee (Comex), is made up of Natura’s Chief Executive Officer, Alessandro Carlucci, and five deputy chairmen. Comex’s priorities are management of the business and assessment of economic, social, and environmental results. Comex also monitors strategic planning and our strategic projects. The structure of Comex was consolidated in 2010 to enable a global outlook on business. Comex is supported by eight committees that discuss thematic topics and represent the executive body. The original Read more about six committees supported Comex on issues related to brand, sustainability, ethics, commercial innovation, Governance at: products, and processes. Two new committees, the Customer Committee and the Ideas and Concepts www.natura.net/relatorio Committee, were established in early 2011. BOARD OF DIRECTORS NATURA EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE PEDRO LUIZ BARREIROS PASSOS ALESSANDRO CARLUCCI Co-chairman of the Board Chief Executive Officer of Directors in office JOÃO PAULO FERREIRA ANTONIO LUIZ DA CUNHA SEABRA Senior Vice President of Supply Chain Co-chairman of the Board of Directors JOSÉ VICENTE MARINO EDSON VAZ MUSA Senior Vice President Member of Sales and Marketing JOSÉ GUIMARÃES MONFORTE MARCELO CARDOSO Member; President of the Audit, Senior Vice President, Organizational Risk Management, and Finance Committee Development and Sustainability JULIO MOURA NETO ROBERTO PEDOTE Member; President of the Strategy Committee Senior Vice President of Finance, Legal Affairs, and Information Technology LUIZ ERNESTO GEMIGNANI Member; President of the People TELMA SINICIO and Organizational Development Committee Senior Vice President of Innovation The Natura Erva Doce line, created in 1984, was reformulated last year, to offer more plant-based products. 17 RISK MANAGEMENT Natura’s risk management strategy involves analysis of two primary risks to our business: strategic risks, which are external threats to the continuity of our business; and operational risks. Responsible managers and their teams evaluate internal processes to identify potential operational risks. In both cases, the analysis considers potential economic, social, and environmental outcomes. Natura’s risk management strategy identifies processes and control mechanisms to address Natura’s primary strategic and operational risks. These include physical risks, but not risks related to climate change. Our actions do, however, evaluate regulatory risks and identify opportunities to offer new technologies and products that address the challenges posed by climate change. An important development in 2010 was the consolidation of Natura’s strategic risks map, which was incorporated into our strategic planning. This map is now monitored by all committees that support the corporate governance and executive structures. As part of a more comprehensive contingency plan, we have established a crisis prevention system based on the most relevant scenarios experienced by the company. This initiative has been developed by Natura since 2009. INTERNAL AUDIT Made up of 16 professionals, Natura’s internal audit team reports to the Audit, Risk Management, and Finance Committee. This structure guarantees the independence of auditors, who are free from interference from other areas of the company. In 2010, the team performed 33 audits of Natura’s technical capabilities, management and operational processes, and international operations. This number far exceeded the 13 audits conducted in 2009. Internal audits include a series of tests and procedures to evaluate the control environment and evaluate the potential for fraud and corruption. Of the 33 audits performed in 2010, 11 cases required investigation. Five of these cases ultimately were found to involve irregularities, and those involving misconduct resulted in the dismissal of six employees. Each of these cases led Natura to strengthen its control mechanisms. SENIOR MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION Natura’s executive compensation package intends to stimulate entrepreneurship and promote executive engagement, and is, in part, linked to the company’s growth and capital appreciation. Our profit-sharing system for executives is based on multiples of base salary, in accordance with their duties. When this model was reviewed in 2009, the variable pay component was expanded, thus enabling the company to be more competitive. Learn more about Natura’s Executive The remuneration received by the chief executive officer, vice presidents, officers and senior managers is Compensation at consistently linked to the commitment to our long-term project by means of the Stock Option or Share www.natura.net/relatorio Subscription Plan. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS The decision of one of the co-chairmen of our Board of Directors, Guilherme Leal, to participate in the 2010 presidential elections was one of Natura’s key governance challenges for the year. Guilherme Leal resigned from Natura shortly after the Green Party announced him as its candidate for vice president. Throughout this process, we emphasized transparency, clearly separating Natura’s business operations from an individual’s decision to run for public office. Natura’s governance structure ensured that the company took all steps required to insulate corporate governance from political influence. Our campaign donation policy, in force since 2006, forbids donations to candidates or political parties — a policy that gained greater significance last year. We also set up a special committee to monitor media exposure of Natura and its founding partner during the elections. 18 //NATURAREPORT2010_OUR MOMENT 2.6 NATURA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM The development of the Amo perfume line drew on network OUR ACTIONS ARE INTENDED TO creation. Almost 100 people, namely E N G AG E A N D I N S P I R E O U R consumers, partners and opinion formers, participated in the process. EMPLOYEES, SUPPORTING THEM IN CLEARLY DEFINED PROCESSES, ENABLING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY’S STRATEGY AND PLANS, AND GUARANTEEING THE EXPANSION OF OUR DIFFERENTIATED BUSINESS MODEL. In order to organize the information flow across all Natura’s processes and guarantee the alignment of decisions with our principles, the Natura Management System has been under development since 2008, when the model incorporated our Regional Units (in all Brazilian regions and international operations) and Business Units (by product segment). The System is designed to reproduce our method of operating wherever we are by means of well-defined processes and routines, enhancing a non-centralized and integrated management model that allows greater independence for managers and greater proximity to consultants and consumers. The expansion of our international actions allows greater importance on the new model. In the coming years, our challenge will be to have this integrated management system become understood and adopted by all Natura employees, becoming an instrinsic way of how Natura routinely does business. To assist with this challenge, we have identified 12 interrelated priority components that are critical to the success of the Natura Management System: leadership, strategic planning, relationships, sustainability, learning, individuals, processes, brand, culture, customers, innovation, and triple bottom-line results. The component of this new management system that is in the most advanced stage of completion is the Management by Process model, which was established with the creation of our Business Units and Regional Units. In 2010, we fully integrated 22 key processes in Natura. To guarantee proper implementation, we stage assessments and process certification. We have created indicators for each process and have designed six new processes to be certified in 2011. This has created a more effective structure for monitoring of Natura’s 18 strategic projects. They are all directly attached to our growth proposal for the coming years and they have been approved by the Board of Directors. They are also regularly monitored by senior management. 19 3. we aim for What 20 //naturareport2010_What we aim for We believe in the transformative power o f p e o p l e , c o m pa n i e s , networks, and communities, a n d w e wa n t to p l ay a leading role in the Vanessa Pacheco, evolution of Natura customer. our society. On the right, with her husband, Ronaldo Pacheco, and with her friend and NCA Luciene dos Santos 21 3.1 OUTLOOK AND STRATEGY OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, WE HAVE COMBINED SIGNIFICANT B U S I N E S S G R OW T H W I T H CHANGES IN OUR MANAGEMENT AND INFR ASTRUCTURE MODEL AND IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS W ITH STA K E H O LD E R S . As a result of these intense structural developments, Natura is poised to take advantage of opportunities in the cosmetics, fragrances and personal care market in Brazil and Latin America. We are strengthening our competitive advantage at a time when our region enjoys a positive outlook.The expansion of manufacturing, the participation of women in the job market, falling unemployment, and rising family incomes have led to prolonged periods of economic growth in several Latin American countries. We understand that the attractiveness of our market results in increased competition. We believe, however, that the Brazilian market still offers many growth opportunities through the regionalization of our operations and by filling the space where our brand is not yet present. Our international operations are becoming stronger year after year. We now have the infrastructure, market knowledge, leadership, products, sales channels, and relationship networks needed to increase our share in these markets. We are entering a cycle in which innovation is increasingly relevant in all aspects of our business — not only in product development, but also in our sales model, in building relationships, and in finding solutions to social and environmental challenges. Inspired in our culture, we intend to deepen the search for solutions related to the performance of our role as change agents in society. STRUCTURAL CHANGES In 2010, we initiated international production through partnerships. The shift from an exportation model to a local production model will benefit society and reduce environmental impacts, in a combination that enables the construction of a sustainable development model. Operations in Argentina started in the second half of 2010 with perfume-bottling activities. In 2011, we will initiate operations in Mexico and Colombia. Within three years, we intend for 50% of revenues from our international operations in Latin America to come from products manufactured outside Brazil. When fully deployed by 2013, this new manufacturing structure will eliminate 70% of greenhouse gas emissions that result from supply logistics in these countries. We restructured some executive positions to monitor operations more closely, giving us the agility required for superior management. We merged our Business and Internationalization vice presidencies and created two general executive offices, one for Brazil and another for international operations. These initiatives provided our leaders with greater autonomy and our Executive Committee with a more global and strategic vision. In January 2010, our office in Buenos Aires, Argentina, began to manage our international operations. We expect this new production-and-logistics model to drive expansion in our domestic and international business. Additional innovations in the planning stage will improve the assistance we provide to our sales consultants and consumers. We have made significant investments in information technology, which will support our growth cycle in the coming years. This initiative will provide greater scalability, integration, and connectivity to our systems platform. Approximately 85% of orders from our sales consultants are received via the Internet. 22 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHAT WE AIM FOR To prepare for the changes taking place at Natura, we will transfer our administrative unit and the distribution center in Itapecerica da Serra this year to a new facility in the city of São Paulo. We understand that these changes, which aim to provide employees with better working conditions, will also impact the local community, especially with respect to tax collection. To mitigate these impacts, we are engaging in a dialogue with the municipal administration about the pending relocation and our plans to continue to invest in the community (learn more on page 52, Surrounding Communities). Some administrative functions now based in Cajamar, as well as the picking center (preparation of boxes with products for sending to consultants) will also be transferred to São Paulo. OUR PLANNING In 2010, we set up a new Strategic Planning cycle for the period from 2011 to 2015. We defined targets and identified critical success factors, indicators, and milestones required to achieve our objectives. We know that the success of this initiative rests in part on our ability to develop leaders whose actions align with our Essence so that they can become real agents of social transformation. We also intend to create an internal environment with constant learning opportunities, supported by a strong organizational culture enhanced by the many countries in which we operate. We place a high priority on taking advantage of opportunities that derive from connectivity so that we can foster sustainable development. These elements will guide our strategic planning for the next five years, allowing us to maintain our leadership position in Brazil and to expand our direct sales model in Latin America. They will also help us generate more value for Natura’s stakeholders. As a result, we will continue to delight and be delighted by our customers, fostering our well-being well concept in an innovative manner, strengthening our brand, and maintaining the quality of relationships with our stakeholders. Learn more about Thinking about the future is the first step toward innovation. In 2010, one outgrowth of our strategic planning Natura’s 2030 Vision at : process was the development of our 2030 Vision. With the support of senior management, we stretched our www.natura.net/relatorio vision beyond the five-year planning cycle to focus on long-term scenarios and potential challenges. SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT The way we do business is guided by our search for a sustainable development plan. We are aware that the joint management of economic, social and environmental aspects of all processes is a major challenge. However, we have managed to effectively incorporate this integrated vision into our routine operations. Sustainability is one of the cornerstones of our processes and a part of Natura’s Strategic Planning, which is approved by the Board of Directors and closely monitored by senior management. Our main socioenvironmental indicators serve to integrate the company’s strategic plan, and these indicators are communicated to all business units to guide their processes. The Executive Sustainability Office is responsible for this process, educating and disseminating practices throughout the company. In both Brazil and in our international operations, we rely on a network of sustainability leaders who convey global practices to each unit and assure that these practices are integrated into decision making. Our Biodiversity Management Group systematically monitors our sustainable use of biodiversity so that through technology development, stewardship, ethical trade actions, and benefit sharing, we preserve natural resources and have a positive impact in our local communities. We also seek to make continual progress in the construction of our materiality matrix. This involves a process of determining which aspects of our company’s sustainability efforts are viewed as most relevant by our stakeholders. This process is carried out every two years. The results of the actions related to our six priority topics in 2010 (Amazon, Biodiversity, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Education, Product Impact and Quality of Relationships) are reported to Natura’s senior management by the Sustainability Committee. In 2010, for the Learn more about our first time, we invited our international operations to take part in this process. The new materiality matrix will management at: be included in the next reporting cycle and incorporated into 2011 strategic planning (learn more on page www.natura.net/relatorio 109, About this Report). 23 3.2 HIGH PRIORITY SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS AMAZON W E S E E T H E A M A ZO N R E G I O N A S A S T R AT E G I C D R I V E R F O R B R A Z I L ’ S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. FINDING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUSTAINABLE USE OF THE AMA ZON ’ S R ESOURCES IS PARAMOUNT TO GUARANTEEING QUALITY OF LIFE FOR FUTURE GENER ATIONS. Twelve years ago, we decided to incorporate biodiversity assets into our products in a sustainable manner, respecting the ways of traditional communities and the livelihoods of local families. Based on this experience, we developed the Amazon Program, which seeks to stimulate the creation of sustainable supply chains and new businesses based on science, innovation, and entrepreneurship, in addition to the natural and cultural resources offered by the region. Through the Amazon Program, we can contribute to sustainable development proposals that offer opportunities to local inhabitants while keeping the forest standing. In preparing this strategy, we reflected on the lessons of our previous actions and from workshops on the Amazon with Natura’s senior management. The knowledge gained from these actions gave rise to the program, which is based on the expansion of our activities in science, technology and innovation; sustainable production chains; and the region’s institutional strengthening. We convened a panel of key opinion leaders, experts, and representatives of civil society, government, and nongovernmental organizations to discuss a sustainable model for palm cultivation in the region. What we learned from this process gave rise to the Amazon Program, which allows us to build guidelines that will help us to develop a balanced production plan. Because of improper agricultural practices that have damaged ecosystems in Asian countries, the production of palm oil has negatively affected the biodiversity in tropical forests. However, we believe that the sustainable production and use of palm oil is possible, driving income generation and regional development. Learn more about our actions to promote the sustainable use of palm at: www.natura.net/relatorio 24 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHAT WE AIM FOR BIODIVERSITY W E R E COG N I ZE T H AT CO M PA N I E S , SOCIETY, AND GOVERNMENT SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSERVATION OF BIOMES AND FOR PURSUING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES. Our experience shows that production processes with lower environmental impact and innovative solutions may generate positive results for both society and business. Our production model involves some 2,300 families in Brazil and is based on the creation of fair trade and compensation for the use of genetic heritage and traditional knowledge, proper handling of raw materials, and promotion of local development (learn more on page 50, Supplier Communities). Our operations are guided by the Policy for the Sustainable Use of Biodiversity and Cultural Heritage, created in 2008 based on the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which establishes guidelines for the use of raw materials and for the sharing of their benefits. Reaffirming our leadership role in the area of biodiversity, we headed the Brazilian Business Movement for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity . More than 80 par ticipating companies and civil organizations signed a letter declaring their commitment to the conservation of Brazilian biodiversity. This document encourages the government to define a regulatory framework that fosters research and scientific advances that integrate production, use, and conservation. The Movement sent the letter to the federal government and presented it at the 10th Conference of the Par ties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 10), in Nagoya, Japan. As a result of this imperfect legislation, in 2010 we received infraction notices from the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) for alleged irregular access to biodiversity (learn more on page 62, Creation of Environmental Value). “ SUSTAINABILITY SHOULD BE SEEN AS AN INTEGRAL, INSEPARABLE PART OF THE BUSINESS. “ Christian Moura, Supplier. 25 EDUCATION EDUCATION IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE THROUGHOUT L ATIN AMERIC A . THE GEOGR APHICAL OUTREACH OF OUR BUSINESS OFFERS THE SCOPE AND CONDITIONS FOR LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES, POSITIVELY INFLUENCING A MOVEMENT FOR THE NEED FOR QUALIT Y EDUCATION. In 2010, we created the Natura Institute, a non-profit organization that is responsible for all our private social investment. Through the Crer para Ver (Believing Is Seeing) program, we invest the proceeds from the sale of a special line of products into initiatives that can affect the quality of education in Brazil and Latin America. In addition, we offer educational technologies to society that can have a positive influence on public education policies to improve literacy skills for preschoolaged children. This would be similar to what we achieved in Brazil with the Trilhas (Trails) Project, and we will share this with the Ministry of Education. In 2010, the Crer para Ver program obtained the highest funding in its history, R$10 million, 168% higher than the previous year. Revenues from international operations contributed R$1.3 million to this program in 2010 (learn more on page 67, Creation of Social Value). Our concern with education extends to our employees, suppliers, and consultants. At a time when Brazil faces the challenge of finding a qualified workforce to drive its development, there is a clear shortfall in secondary, technical, and higher education. Accordingly, we seek to offer our employees education and professional development for all positions. In 2010, we created a program for the operational staff that links career development to education. We also significantly increased the number of young apprentices and launched a program that prepares these young workers for the professional market (learn more on page 39, Employees). In 2011, we will offer preparatory courses for job openings at Natura in the community of Cajamar to increase the number of qualified candidates at Natura and other companies (learn more on page 53, Surrounding Communities). We also invest in the training of our consultants. In 2010, more than 500,000 consultants participated in training; most had less than 3 years of experience working for Natura (learn more on page 44, Consultants and NCAs). 26 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHAT WE AIM FOR GREEN HOUSE GASES WE KNOW THAT ONLY SIGNIFICANT C UT S I N T H E VO LU M E S O F C A R B O N LAUNCHED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE WILL EFFEC TIVELY CONTAIN THE FORCES THAT C RE ATE C LIMATE C HANG E . TO HELP TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE CREATED THE CARBON-NEUTRAL PROGRAM IN 2007. Besides offsetting our emissions through support to socioenvironmental projects, we committed to reducing our relative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 33% between 2007 and 2011. By the end of 2010, we had reached a total reduction of 21%, even with an increase in production. Given what we have learned over these past five years, we have deferred our achievement of this goal to 2013. Due to the reduction obtained in the last four years, even with the increase in our production, we have learned important lessons. Today, the carbon issue is an integral part of Natura’s strategy and influences the company’s decision making. We have adopted innovative initiatives and conducted an in-depth analysis of the impact of our processes so that our managers understand the contribution of each process to GHG emissions. We carried out a broad diagnosis of our operations in 2010 to identify new opportunities for reducing and mobilizing the entire company so that these targets are met. The new study includes the expected gains from various ongoing structural projects, from the revision of product mass and use of biopolymers in packaging to the distribution process with the new logistic model and the start of international manufacturing. The complexity of these actions, involving a deep transformation of how we run our business, partially explains the revision of our goals. An important point to highlight is that our commitment to reduction is not limited to our own operations, but also the extraction of raw materials by all our suppliers, which makes our reduction efforts all the more complex and our achievements all the more significant. (Learn more on page 62, Creation of Environmental Value). We also face the additional challenge of reducing 2012 absolute emissions in the Brazilian operation by 10% from 2008 levels. These are emissions that result from our internal production processes. We maintained our target despite delays in the implementation of internal programs that could help us achieve this goal, and despite the change in the Brazilian electricity matrix.The latter increased the use of thermal plants, thereby raising the rate of carbon emissions to produce electricity. “ IT IS NOT EASY TO CHANGE THE POLITICS OF A COUNTRY. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO EDUCATE AND CREATE A CRITICAL MASS THAT WILL MAKE SUSTAINABLE DECISIONS. “ Claudia Rodríguez, civil society organization representative 27 PRODUCT IMPACT ONE OF OUR PRIMARY CHALLENGES IS TO R E D U C E T H E I M PAC T C AU S E D B Y THE MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION, AND USE OF OUR PRODUCTS. THIS HAS LED US TO INVEST IN PRACTICES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT AIM TO MINIMIZE THESE IMPACTS, ESPECIALLY IN TWO A S P E C T S : M A N AG E M E N T O F S O L I D WASTE AND WATER CONSUMPTION. The management of solid waste was a priority in our discussion panels with stakeholders. In 2010, we developed a more extensive program, enlisting the help of 40 people, among packaging manufacturers, garbage collectors, industry professionals, academics, specialists, and consumers in defining issues and guidelines for improvement. Our first action, to be implemented in 2011, will be to work with our suppliers and outsourced production partners to search for efficiencies and innovative waste solutions — from the time raw materials are extracted all the way through postconsumption. It is worth mentioning that new concepts were acknowledged in the recently instituted National Policy for Solid Waste, such as the priority assigned to reduction prior to recycling and the responsibility of the consumer, who is a part of the chain. The business community now faces the additional challenge of searching for alternative treatments for its waste, including in the postconsumption phase. Management of water consumption is another priority. This year, we decided to broaden the analysis of our impact on this natural resource. Previously, we had focused on our internal processes and our main suppliers. More recently, however, we started to use the water footprint concept, which gives us a more comprehensive vision of the impact of water usage throughout the life cycle of a product or process. The water footprint includes not only consumption, but also the potential for pollution. In 2009, we became a partner of the Water Footprint Network (WFN) group, the purpose of which is to promote sustainable, equitable, and efficient use of water. In 2010, we used the methodology described in the Water Footprint Manual in two of our products to learn how this applies to our business. Natura is the first cosmetics company in the world to use this methodology in the manufacture of cosmetic products (learn more on page 64, Creation of Environmental Value). “ THE FOCUS IS ON HOW TO FACE THE PROBLEM. LITTLE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED ABOUT HOW NOT TO GENERATE IT. “ Lucio Di Domenico, civil society organization representative 28 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHAT WE AIM FOR QUALITY OF RELATIONSHIPS W E B E L I E V E T H AT SOLUTIONS TO T H E C U R R E N T C H A L L E N G E S FAC E D BY HUMANITY ENTAIL A COLLECTIVE PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE WITH A FOCUS ON RAISING AW A R E N E S S A N D D I A L O G U E . T H E R E F O R E , N AT U R A B E L I E V E S I N THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING THE QUALITY OF ITS RELATIONSHIPS. We invest in the development of efficient channels for dialogue, in sharing experiences, in transparency, in ethical behavior, and in the creation of oppor tunities to find shared solutions. We rely on formal channels of interaction, such as the Natura Service Channel and Natura Consumer Service Channel, specifically created for our consultants and consumers. Through our Ombudsman’s Office, our employees, suppliers, and Natura Consultant Advisers can also obtain information or file complaints. Our objective is to listen to our stakeholders, who we believe can help us improve the way we plan and manage our operations. Last year, we demonstrated this by hosting discussion panels that ultimately led to the establishment of a series of new initiatives at Natura. These initiatives included a waste management program (learn more on the previous page, High-priority Topics/ Product Impact) and our position on the sustainable use of palm (learn more on page 24, Highpriority Topics/Amazon). The results of these dialogues influenced our decision-making and the development of our strategic planning, and also helped us develop our processes and behaviors, which contributed to raising the standard of our relationships. We also started to include our international operations in the process of defining the materiality matrix (learn more on page 109, About the Report), by holding discussion panels in Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Argentina in 2010, and in Chile in March 2011 (learn more on page 36, Quality of Relationships). 29 3.3 INNOVATING INNOVATION INNOVATION IS AT THE CENTER OF NATURA’S VALUE CREATION AND INVOLVES ALL THE COMPANY’S STRATEGIC PILLARS. IT IS EXPRESSED THROUGH THE INNOVATION OF OUR PRODUCTS, SALES MODELS, T H E M A N AG E M E N T S Y S T E M A N D T H E WAY IN WHICH WE TRANSFORM SOCIAL A N D E N V I R O N M E N TA L C H A L L E N G E S I N TO O P P O RT U N I T I E S F O R L E A R N I N G A N D S U P P O R T I N G S U S TA I N A B L E DEVELOPMENT. FOR US, INNOVATION MEANS CREATING A FLOW OF WELLB E I N G W E L L T H AT S U R PA S S E S T H E EXPECTATIONS OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS. 1. INVESTMENT IN Two important developments took place in 2010: the construction of our Vision 2030 (learn more on page INNOVATION (R$ MILLIONS) 23) and Natura’s Vision of Innovation. These independent projects give us a long-term perspective, outlining 139.7 future opportunities and defining the paths we want to follow. 111.8 We have identified the need to develop new competencies, beyond the classical sciences, developing a more 103.0 comprehensive approach. These strategies include increasing our knowledge of sciences that govern sustainability, social biodiversity, and sensorial experience, while pursuing innovation in other fields of knowledge associated with the perceptions, behaviors, and rituals of groups of people. Through these new strategic fronts, we are fine-tuning our direction in science and technology. This vision has also reinforced our commitment to searching for alternatives to reduce our environmental impact and to embracing the principles of ecodesign (the development of products, processes, and services 2008 2009 2010 that take environmental impact into account). As part of this commitment, for example, Natura established a carbon-emissions limit for the approval of new products in the company (learn more on page 63, Creation of Environmental Value). Among other innovative initiatives in sustainability management, we prepared a methodology for evaluating the social and economic impacts of our suppliers (learn more on page 49, Suppliers) and developed a pilot 2. NUMBER OF PRODUCTS experiment to calculate the water footprint of two products in our portfolio – including, in addition to our LAUNCHED (UN) own operations, the consumption from extracting the raw material. (learn more on page 63, Creation of 168 Environmental Value). To support these changes, we expanded our investments in research, science, and technology, and in the 118 creation of knowledge networks.The investment of our net revenues in innovation-related activities increased 103 to 2.8% (R$139.7 million). This amount was invested exclusively in science and technology, innovation management and partnerships, product development and marketing, regulatory affairs management, and product safety (graphs 1 and 2). Strategic portfolio management dictates that the ideal level of innovation, as measured by the Innovation Index (see formula below), should range between 55% and 65%. In 2010, we recorded 61% that guaranteed 2008 2009 2010 to Natura a differentiated market presence and the appropriate strenght to the channel. 30 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHAT WE AIM FOR INNOVATION INDICATORS (%) 2008 2009 2010 Percentage of net sales invested in innovation 2.8 2.6 2.8 Innovation Index 1 67.5 67.6 61.4 1. Gross revenues for the past 12 months from products launched in the past 24 months, divided by total gross revenues for the past 12 months. Natura’s innovation is sustained by its search for excellence in: Scientific research to identify ingredients from Brazilian sociobiodiversity and to enable the use of these new ingredients in the manufacturing of products that offer special benefits; Scientific fundamentals on hair and skin, and in-depth knowledge of consumer needs; New models and methods to ensure product safety and global strategies on regulatory matters; Cosmetic Vigilance System, which monitors possible adverse impacts of products, supports the consumer, and drives the innovation process; Focus on scientific understanding of controversial ingredients and replacement strategy; Systemic understanding of well-being and its relations in the physical, emotional, cultural, and social dimensions; Concept creation and development of new products that provide a continuous flow of product launches in both the short and long term; New packaging, and other innovative and different ways of providing benefits to the consumer, with the lowest possible environmental impact; Transformation of socio-environmental challenges into business opportunities and products, including the sustainable use of natural resources, social biodiversity, ecodesign, and environmental indicators. We launched products with concepts that are deeply connected to our beliefs, leading the consumer toward new ideals and experiences. One example is Natura Chronos, a line of anti-aging cream, which we relaunched last year. Knowing that signs of aging can differ among women in the same age group, we developed an innovative product designed for people with different skin types rather than one based on a consumer’s age. OPEN INNOVATION The broadening of the scope of innovation in 2010 is part of our open innovation strategy, first developed in 2005. This strategy is the foundation for the development of our products, processes, and tools, through partnerships with science and research centers in Brazil and abroad. In 2010, we teamed up with leading technological centers, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Boston, United States of America, and we streamlined relationships with our other international partners. We also qualified 27 employees in innovation management through the international certification program offered by the Hult Business School in partnership with the IXL Center. This qualification is accredited by the Global Innovation Management Institute. We improved employee training to include the development of innovation competencies, including: how to best generate new ideas and concepts; how to leverage technological convergence and our knowledge of sustainability; and other themes related to our Essence. Staff in our business units and Brand and Sustainability departments received more than 8,000 hours of innovation training in 2010. Additionally, we offered technical and functional training in the more traditional areas of science and technology. We believe that a scientific foundation, together with the systematic acquisition of knowledge using the open-innovation model, will enable the creation of innovative concepts and ideas, enabling more rapid development of new products and processes at a reduced cost to Natura. NATURA CAMPUS Created in 2007, the Natura Campus Technological Innovation Program is part of our open innovation program. It has the support of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, the São Paulo State Research Support Foundation, and the Research and Financing Projects of the Brazilian Innovation Agency to develop partnerships with the academic community. These institutions contribute to the joint financing of projects and provide participants with equipment, scientific scholarships, and research materials. 31 The Natura Campus Portal (www.natura.net/campus) registered 6,000 visits in 2010. It contains a database of voluntary researchers and has 280 research groups linked to 108 science and technology institutions. The website, which was updated last year, is an important tool for our relationship with the academic community. Through this portal, we received 13 new proposals from nine institutions. Two of these proposals have already been approved. COMMERCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP INNOVATION Commercial innovation was in the spotlight last year after the creation of a committee dedicated to this area. We also increased the use of digital tools in our contact and relationships with our sales consultants and consumers. This year, our sales consultants placed 85% of their orders through the Internet. We continued to improve our relationship with consultants through use of the “Consultancy” blog (www.blogconsultoria.natura.net) and Twitter; we use these media to give our consultants information about our actions, products, and sustainability measures (learn more on page 45, Consultants and NCAs). Internet access to the Natura digital magazine (www.natura.net) increased more than 100% in the period. In February 2011, we launched a version of this publication for the iPad. This application allows for more interactive contact and gives users a 360-degree view of the products. Additionally, on the make-up pages, users can change the color of the products used by the model and gain access to make-up hints. Our pages on Facebook and Twitter and our blogs have also become strategic relationship tools that allow us to offer flexible assistance to our consumers (learn more on page 47, Consumers). Learn more about We also redesigned, in February 2011, the Natura Conecta portal (www.naturaconecta.com.br). This allowed us Innovation at to continue improving the company’s use of virtual instruments in its relationship with stakeholders (learn more www.natura.net/relatorio on page 37, Quality of Relationships). The new sachets for the Natura Tododia moisturizer refills cut the use of plastic by 83% and the generation of waste by 97%. 32 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHAT WE AIM FOR 3.4 COLLECTIVE CONSTRUCTION W E SEEK TO I N CLU D E D I F FER EN T PERSPECTIVES AND TO STRENGTHEN T R A N S PA R E N C Y R E G A R D I N G THE DISCLOSURE OF OUR RESULTS BY MEANS OF INNOVATIVE AND COLLABOR ATIVE TOOLS. THIS STRATEGY IS PART OF OUR GOAL TO CONTINUOUSLY INCREASE THE SPACE GIVEN TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS T O E X P R E S S T H E M S E LV E S . As part of the preparation of this annual report, we relied once again on the Wiki Report, a virtual community of the Natura Conecta platform (www.naturaconecta.com.br) open to the participation of anyone who is interested in our activities. This is an innovative and collaborative experience that enables continuous improvement by capturing the opinions and suggestions of different stakeholders. The discussions held in the virtual forums gave rise to “The Natura we share” letter, published in our 2009 annual report. In 2010, we did not make the progress we had hoped for because of the reframing of Natura Conecta, which was relaunched in February 2011 (learn more on page 3, Quality of Relationships). We hope to increase the use of this tool and transform the Wiki Report into an active forum for discussion. We used Wiki to build Natura’s new corporate materiality matrix. The main issues identified in dialogues online in Brazil and in our international operations were put to a vote by the online community. More than 150 participants chose the most relevant issues. The results are being analyzed and the new materiality matrix will be disclosed in 2011. Another initiative to promote dialogue with our stakeholders was the panel to discuss the “Future of the Report.” The meeting, held in December 2010, engaged experts in communication and sustainability, as well as employees and suppliers involved in our reporting process, in a discussion about choices for the next 20 years. Many promising ideas arose from this event. Some of the subjects that participants discussed are in line with our goals; these include the need to create more collaborative platforms for reporting and to establish multidisciplinary teams to run the process of disclosing our financial results. The discussions have continued on the virtual platform. As a result of this meeting, we expanded our most recent annual disclosure. In addition to the traditional videoconference for investors and analysts, we organized an open conference to present our results. This event, held on February 25, 2011, was chaired by Natura’s CEO and the Senior Vice President of Financial, Legal, and Information Technology Affairs. The executives presented the key economic, social, and environmental highlights of 2010, and answered questions from participants. Our goal is to continue to expand these collaborative opportunities.

THIS SPIRIT IS REFLECTED IN THE INPERSON DIALOGUE PANELS WE HOLD WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS, AS WELL AS IN EVENTS THAT INTENDED TO I M PROV E TH E I R S E LF DEVELOPMENT AND AWARENESS. In 2010, we heard from 824 people through meetings with employees, consultants, shareholders, suppliers, supplier communities, consumers, the media, and people from the surrounding communities. We also included others in this process — experts on specific issues, key opinion leaders, and representatives of government and civil society. In all, we held 22 dialogue panels, more than twice as many as in 2009, when nine meetings were held. They included dialogue panels held in our operations in Latin America (Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Argentina), which together contributed to the construction of our materiality matrix. The purpose was to develop a corporate matrix that reflects the interests of stakeholders from all operations. In February 2011, this cycle will be concluded with the organization of a meeting in Chile. Key issues identified in this process become part of our strategic planning (learn more on page 109, About This Report).

Through the contributions of a process of “co-construction,” participants discussed priority issues, such as the mapping of external factors our stakeholders in the linked to our production chain, in partnership with suppliers (learn more on page 49, Suppliers), and the dialogue panels at: initiatives related to the sustainable use of palm oil and solid waste management (learn more on page 24 and www.naturaconecta.com.br 28, High-priority Topics/Amazon and Impact of Products). 36 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHO WE WORK WITH In 2011, we relaunched the Natura Conecta virtual network (www.naturaconecta.com.br), which now has its own platform and is integrated with other Natura virtual communities. Because of this relaunch, the use of virtual resources to build relationships with stakeholders did not reach the extent we envisioned; however, these activities have resumed, and everyone who is interested in our business is invited to participate (learn more on page 33, Collective Construction). With the goal of building transparent and straightforward relationships, we organized a series of actions for different stakeholders. One such activity was the Reflection Cycle on Cultural Biology, with biologist Humberto Maturana and professor Ximena Dávila. This event was designed to foster awareness and generate positive change in relationships. We also continue to develop the Você tem fome de quê? (What Do You Crave?) program by including stakeholders beyond our employees. This program involves lunch-hour talks at the Cajamar unit. In 2010, presenters included top international thinkers, such as quantum physicist Amit Goswami, American entrepreneur Charles Watson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology innovation specialist Otto Scharmer, and spiritual teacher Diane Hamilton. Learn more about the selfFor the first time ever, we held a meeting with former employees. The event in Cajamar brought together development activities at : more than 200 people. We thanked each of them for their contributions to the company, seeking to build www.natura.net/relatorio relationships of friendship and trust with this group. OMBUDSMAN’S OFFICE Natura’s Ombudsman’s Office is a formal dialogue channel between the company and its employees, in-house outsourced workers, and suppliers (Brazil). This important function helps us to monitor compliance with our Relationship Principles commitments and whether our own actions are derived from our Essence.This resource is also available to former employees. These contacts are recorded and analyzed by the Ombudsman team and submitted to the responsible manager. The Ombudsman’s Office investigates complaints and allegations of misconduct, welcomes suggestions and compliments, and receives general inquiries. Natura’s historical records do not include any cases of discrimination. All contacts that may be considered misconduct are reported to the ethics committee, of which the company’s CEO is also a member. When necessary, the office enlists the support of internal auditors (learn more on page 18, Governance).

BRAZILIAN OPERATIONS’ INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS 1. SATISFACTION WITH THE OMBUDSMAN CHANNEL (%)1 In 2010, we recorded 1,120 inquiries from internal stakeholders in Brazil. The percentage of issues handled, 98 83% in 2009, decreased to 52% last year. This decrease resulted from our decision to change the criteria 97 96 for use of the Ombudsman’s Office in an effort to promote greater dialogue between employees and their managers. Our goal is to create a culture that encourages collaborative problem solving, reserving the Ombudsman’s Office for cases where solutions are elusive. As a result, technical inquiries regarding processes, policies, procedures, and infrastructure were rerouted to appropriate managers. Other changes in channel behavior were also observed. Anonymous reports decreased, thus strengthening the consolidation of the channel as an additional tool of dialogue and relationship for employees and in-house outsourced workers in Brazil. 2008 2009 2010 Some 53% of the inquiries handled by the Ombudsman’s Office related to “people management”, primarily 1.

MAINTAINING THE QUALITY OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EMPLOYEES IS ONE OF OUR PILLARS FOR PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE DE VELOPMENT AND VALUE GENER ATION. Because of this, Natura has made a conscious effort to improve its “people management” over the last several years. In this regard, education — a driver of sustainability — received a good deal of attention in 2010. We established education-and-development programs for employees at different levels of the company, strengthened our organizational culture, created more efficient retention processes, and completed the training of our international staff.

With Natura’s business expansion across Latin America, our staff increased by 12.4% in 2010. The commencement of international activities created challenges, making our structure more complex and more culturally diverse. We intend to extend our best practices to employees working in other countries in which we operate. 38 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHO WE WORK WITH OTHER EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 1 2008 2009 2010 Apprentices 12 10 152 Trainees 66 47 68 Temporary staff 2 445 340 128 In-house outsourced workers 3 1,787 1,310 2,065 1.

Suppliers that provide services to Natura and that work in or have access to company premises for a period exceeding six months are deemed to be in-house outsourced workers. This includes Cajamar, Itapecerica da Serra, Barueri, São Paulo and our international operations. The scope of the indicator was changed in 2010, but it was not possible to review the historical basis due to the change in the classification and definition of the concept of outsourced workers. Our organizational climate survey indicated a drop of one percentage point in the overall satisfaction with the workplace environment, with a 73% rate of favorable responses from our employees. This indicator was below our target of 76% (due to a calculation error, a 77% target was included in last year’s report). In Brazil, this figure remained at 72%. We achieved a significant improvement among administrative staff and maintained a high rate among the sales force. Notwithstanding our efforts, there was a decrease in favorable responses from our operational staff. This suggests that actions such as the Renovação (Renewal) Program and its career and development initiative, Meu Caminho (My Way) (learn more on the next page, Education), are falling short of their goals.This program was implemented in the second half of 2010, and we believe that it will begin to show greater benefits in 2011. Satisfaction with the overall quality of the workplace also declined in our international operations. This was the result of specific factors in countries such as Argentina, Chile, and Peru and because of events related to the implementation of our international business strategy. These events generated restructuring actions in some countries. We aim to improve the execution of strategies that we believe will strengthen the quality of our relationships with international employees.

This indicator tracks general satisfaction, www.natura.net/relatorio intention to continue a relationship with Natura, and whether they would recommend our brand. EDUCATION Education was an important theme in our relationships with employees during 2010. Despite falling short of our goal to provide 100 training hours per employee in Brazil, we reached 90 hours and consider this result very significant. In 2011, we plan to monitor educational efforts in our international operations.

In addition to receiving the legally www.natura.net/relatorio required technical training, apprentices study subjects related to living our values and career development. ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE By developing our organizational culture, we lay the groundwork for our Vision of the Future and reinforce our Essence among our employees. These efforts align behavior, strategies, programs, processes, and relationship expectations. In 2010, we developed seven Culture Drivers (learn more on page 3), inspired by our Essence. These drivers provide clear guidance for our choices and attitudes and illustrate the behaviors and values expected by the company. These drivers were the result of a collaborative process that involved the company’s founders, the Executive Board, and the leadership team. We also considered suggestions made in 2009 by nearly 150 employees in the administrative, operational, and sales areas. The drivers will be rolled out to all Natura employees in 2011, when we will also review our main practices, symbols and organization systems, and set forth the procedures to guarantee the ongoing promotion and reassertion of our culture. LEADERSHIP A leadership team that is committed to our Essence is fundamental to our growth. Natura has invested in the training and development of almost 600 leaders in Brazil and abroad. In 2010, we filled 62% of our open leadership positions with internal staff. In 2011, we will establish a leadership-specific educational program that will support our desired organizational competencies. We believe this will strengthen our organizational culture. The project will include onsite classes and distance learning; study groups consisting of people with similar interests; workshops; and activities that promote the exchange of knowledge and ideas. Learn more about leadership at The intent of this program is to qualify leaders and to strengthen our succession plans.We map our critical positions www.natura.net/relatorio and, at the end of 2010, had defined a succession plan for 40% of our short-, medium-, and long-term positions. ATTRACTION AND ENGAGEMENT Natura relies on recruitment-and-selection processes that attract candidates who are not only technically qualified but who also identify with our Essence and values. The new attraction model implemented in 2010 moves in this direction and goes beyond the traditional selection model. We view the application process as an opportunity for individual personal and career development. We also seek feedback from applicants at all stages of the selection. We aim to stimulate a reflection about the process. This initiative will formally begin in 2011. Though we have established a strong track record for filling leadership positions with internal staff, we did not reach the target we established for ourselves in 2010. Compared with 2009, the internal fill rate dropped by 25 percentage points, in part because of Natura’s growth and because of steps taken to incorporate strategic market competencies. To reverse this trend, we redesigned our job opportunities program, which encourages employees to seek professional growth. The job opportunities program also addresses the responsibilities of all involved in the process, including candidates, the hiring manager, and Human Resources. In 2011, this program will be extended to our international operations. We also made eligibility-for-advancement criteria more flexible and strengthened efforts to promote job openings. 40 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHO WE WORK WITH Outside Brazil, we offer “global opportunity allowances” that enable employees to move to other countries. This initiative will help us form a multicultural team and allow staff to share knowledge and experiences. Our international operations strategy depends on the formation of mixed teams of employees who are responsive to our value proposition and people who are knowledgeable about these markets. Currently, most of the staff within our international operations consist of local professionals. We registered a small increase in employee turnover in Brazil in 2010 (see table). This increase is primarily due to Natura’s decision to dismiss employees with low performance or commitment. In our international operations, Mexico registered a significant drop in turnover rates. This was the result of better-defined employment profiles, as well as improved recruitment, selection, and monitoring of new employees. Increased turnover in Peru resulted principally from the restructuring of the Sales Department and the resulting change in job requirements. In Chile, the increase in turnover was driven primarily by temporary outsourcing after a February 2010 earthquake.

Although we monitor data by age group and gender, we do not consider this relevant data to our business. DIVERSITY Building a more equitable and sustainable society depends on respect for diversity. In Brazil, the main challenge is social inclusion, and the insertion of classifications such as age group and gender is not, by itself, a guarantee of diversity. Education provides the best path to social inclusion. Companies’ efforts to improve the quality of education beyond their own doors can have a substantial impact on inclusion and promote the personal and professional maturity of the employees (learn more on pages 26 and 67 High-High-priority Topics/Education and Generation of Social Value). Our vision of diversity also consists of engaging professionals in regions where we operate. Their experience with other societies, cultures, and value systems provides us with a means for improving our relationships with our stakeholders. In our units, 23% of leaders have had professional experience in other countries. Learn more about diversity at : Although our vision on the theme has evolved, we know that we still have to improve our positioning www.natura.net/relatorio regarding diversity and deploy more effective actions. COMPENSATION Our compensation practices follow the corporate policy effective in all countries. However, if inecessary, we may adjust amounts and potential earnings in accordance with each market. Salaries are established according to reference surveys, the salary structures of Brazilian or multinational companies, publicly held companies, and companies whose compensation practices are similar to ours. The comparability is based on the scope and complexity of functions. We maintain a salary average that is in line with market practices. We also offer a variable compensation model adjusted to the characteristics of each stakeholder, with speLearn more about our cific forms of payment, targets, and amounts. Income distributions to nonexecutive stakeholders are limited compensation practices at: to 3% of the operating income. In 2010, our operational employees received, on average, the equivalent of www.natura.net/relatorio three additional months’ salary in variable pay. 41 4.3 CONSULTANTS OUR SALES CONSULTANTS ARE A AND NCAs FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL. THEY NOT ONLY SELL OUR PRODUCTS BUT ALSO DISSEMINATE OUR ESSENCE A N D O U R VA LU E PRO POSI T IO N . 1. NUMBER OF NCAs IN BRAZIL 1 In 2010, we reached an important milestone: Our sales force exceeded 1 million consultants in Brazil and 200,000 in our international operations. The number of sales consultants grew by 18% in Brazil, and by 11,276 more than 20% internationally. 9,083 Favorable economic conditions aside, this development is due primarily to the consolidation of our Natura 5,844 Consultant Adviser (NCA) model. Natura completed its first operating cycle in all regions of Brazil in 2010 using the new NCA model. NCAs are a significant part of our commercial strategy and enable a closer relationship with our consultants. Within this structure, relationship managers work more closely with NCAs, each of whom, in turn, offers support to up to 150 consultants by providing guidance and assistance to their development, in addition to working as consultants themselves. 20082 20093 2010 In 2010, we had more than 11,000 NCAs, 24% more than in 2009.

Operations in Venezuela were discontinued in 2009. In 2008 there was 2,800 consultants. Our international operations are not based on the NCA model. In 2010, however, we implemented a project in Mexico inspired by the success of this initiative in Brazil. We created the Natura Consultant Entrepreneur (NCE), whose primary function is to attract new consultants and promote entrepreneurship. This strategy is based on the characteristics of local markets and was designed to boost Natura’s direct sales in Mexico by attracting new consultants to our business and value generation model. The quality of our consultant relationships is a key driver of our success. We held six dialogue panels in 2010 to detect improvement opportunities and build collaborative solutions that may assist in the development of our activities. Some of these meetings were attended by consultants and NCAs who had been working with the company for less than a year and a half, as well as by former consultants and NCAs who worked with the company less than 18 months. The purpose was to gain a better understanding of the challenges consultants faced in the early stages of their work with Natura. The level of satisfaction is permanently monitored, and our relationship-quality rates have remained stable over time. The loyalty of our consultants increased from 17% to 21% in 2010. The loyalty index of our NCAs has fallen. Because of the novelty of the NCA model, we still face challenges, such as our response time in meeting NCA needs. We continue to seek ways to improve this relationship.

INCOME AND PRODUCTIVITY Average annual income distributed to consultants increased, from R$4,000 in 2009 to R$4,100 last year. These data are positive in light of significant increase in the numbers of new consultants joining us in recent years, and they are now quicker to reach the productivity levels of those who have been active for longer. However, there was a slight decrease in NCA per-capita income due to the business model’s rapid growth.

NCAs are commissioned based on performance in terms of number of consultants submitting orders and volume of orders. 2.We consider the catalogue price (full price) and the consultant’s 30% profit. 43 TRAINING AND CAPACITY BUILDING The success of our business strategy also depends on the level of training and engagement of our consultants, so we have been investing increasing amounts of resources in training. In 2010, in Brazil 517,400 consultant trainings took place, exceeding our target of 500,000. We emphasize training opportunities for consultants with less than three years’ experience through distance learning and in-person courses; 78% of these consultants have taken advantage of this. We have also developed a specific training model for our international operations, to be applied in 2011, with a revised approach drawing on our experience in Brazil and the content adapted to local needs. These activities are comprehensive and cover product knowledge, sales techniques, and socioenvironmental awareness. Natura Houses are used for training and for Natura meetings at the beginning of each cycle, when we present new products and developments to our consultants. In 2010, we opened two new Natura Houses in Brazil, one in the Itaquera neighborhood of São Paulo and the other in Santo André, a city inside the metropolitan region of São Paulo. The latter caters to a smaller number of consultants, enabling a closer Learn more about relationship with them to achieve even greater engagement. We also opened three new units for our inconsultants training at: ternational operations: one in Lima, Peru, and one each in Buenos Aires and Cordoba, Argentina. In all, we www.natura.net/relatorio have seven Natura Houses in Brazil and 15 abroad.

As a signatory to the Brazilian Direct Selling Association code of conduct for business-to-business and direct sellers, Natura develops programs to train consultants for the business and to uphold the company’s ethical standards. In 2010, as in previous years, no legal or administrative cases were filed against Natura involving any violation of privacy or consultants’ personal data. Nor was there any record of legal cases on issues such as child, hazardous, or slave labor involving consultants. We seek to strengthen relationships with our consultants by holding events in which we acknowledge and thank them. In Brazil in 2010, more than 73,000 consultants were thanked for their length of service, and more than 9,000 were recognized for outstanding performance in both sales volume and sales of refills and products from Learn more about Natura’s Crer para Ver (Believing Is Seeing) line. Consultants who have been active for 15 years are invited to consultants recognition at: visit the Natura plant in Cajamar (São Paulo), where they are welcomed at an event and honored by our direcwww.natura.net/relatorio tors and vice presidents. QUALITY OF SERVICES In 2010, we reduced our non-service rate (NSR), reversing the upward trend of 2009. This indicator measures the nonavailability of products ordered by consultants. Despite this improvement, we are still far from offering the level of service we hope to provide to our sales channel. When a nonservice cannot be avoided, we try to minimize the inconvenience caused to our consultants by offering substitute products and running promotions. We have aligned business areas for service response, logistics control and marketing planning to ensure effective communication with relationship managers, consultants, and NCAs in dealing with cases of nonservice. The changes being made to the logistics model are having a benefit on the sales channel. In 2010, we expanded capacity and opened new distribution centers, thus raising the quality of service provided to our consultants and cutting delivery times (Learn more on page 22, Structural Changes). The increased numbers of distribution centers will improve inventory management and help us avoid product loss. In 2010, as part of our effort to reduce the NSR, we built up the inventories, though this results in a higher level of product loss because of label expirations or, in some cases, discontinuation of sales. In 2011, we will improve inventory management to reduce loss rates. 44 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHO WE WORK WITH Complaints from consultants about the services we provide have been reduced nearly 40%. Like the NSR, this indicator measures their complaints in relation to problems during the order cycle, from requests for products to their delivery to consultants. In 2010, we also improved the service through better management of commemorative dates. We surveyed consultants to anticipate demand at particular times, thus influencing planning to cater to extra demand. COMMUNICATION CHANNELS We have several structured communication channels to support sales activities. The share of consultant 1. NUMBER OF ORDERS PLACED orders placed over the Internet rose to 85% in Brazil in 2010. In 2009, the percentage was 70%. The rate THROUGH THE CONSULTANT SITE IN BRAZIL (IN THOUSANDS) 1 for our international operations is 69%. In 2009, consultants only in Chile and France were able to place orders over the Internet; in 2010, Internet ordering was extended to Argentina, Peru, and Colombia. In 2011, it will be extended to Mexico (graph 1). 12,900.5 In addition to making the order-taking process more efficient, electronic tools also enabled us to enhance and expand our interaction with consultants. To facilitate access, all Natura offices have computers with internet 8,941.1 access for use by consultants, who may be assisted by NCAs to become familiarized with this channel. Visits to our redesigned Consultancy blog (www.blogconsultoria.natura.net) doubled during 2010, from an 4,277.6 average of 40,000 to 80,000 per month. Visits to our Natura digital magazine (www.natura.net) increased 100%. In February 2011, we also launched a revised digital reader version for the iPad (Learn more on page 32, in Innovating Innovation). 2008 2009 2010 The Natura Service Center (NSC) is also available to our consultants. The NSC offers a toll-free hotline for receiving product orders; answering queries about products and services; and handling compliments, com1. Orders taken by a consultant over the Internet, as billed for indicated years. plaints and suggestions. We continuously strive to improve this resource, and in 2010 we launched a new project to settle more queries on the first call. Critical issues are forwarded to the Ombudsman’s Office. In 2010, the NSC received 23,700 calls a day, down from 28,000 in 2009. This reduction is a direct result of greater Internet use for placing orders; only 14% of orders were made through the NSC, compared with 29% in 2009. NATURA MOVEMENT The Natura Movement is intends to raise awareness of our values among our consultants and influence positive behavioral changes in their families, customers, and surrounding communities. The Natura Movement involves our own projects as well as external initiatives that are focused on two main pillars: reducing environmental impacts (with a focus on Natura products) and social transformation (through social inclusion and human-development projects). Across Brazil, we have worked with 12 projects. Last year, 113,000 consultants were involved in these activities — more than twice the number in 2009 and exceeded our goal of engaging 100,000 consultants. To achieve this goal, we invest our efforts in raising awareness and mobilization initiatives. In 2010, we set up our Acolher (Welcome) Program, which provides technical and financial support for environmental projects developed by consultants across Brazil. The first projects to receive support from the program will be announced in April 2011. The program also seeks to promote an exchange of knowledge and to engage consultants in socially responsible actions. This program’s portal, www.movimentonatura.com.br/acolher, offers a way for consultants to connect and to share experiences and provides information about other initiatives and social entrepreneurship. Almost 3,000 consultants have registered on the portal, which received more than 100,000 visits between September and December 2010. Learn more about projects supported by The Natura Movement also supports Natura’s Crer para Ver (Believing Is Seeing) program by encouraging Natura Movement at: consultants to make online sales of products. In 2010, some 65,000 consultants participated in each sales www.natura.net/relatorio cycle (learn more on page 67, Creation of Social Value). 45 4.4 CONSUMERS OUR CONSUMER-RELATIONS INITIATIVES ARE DRIVEN BY OUR DESIRE TO LEARN ABOUT THE HABITS AND NEEDS OF THE MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS WHO U S E O U R P R O D U C T S . W E WA N T TO OFFER THEM AN EXPERIENCE THAT STIRS THEIR SENSES AND PROMOTES WELL-BEING WELL. Over the past two years, we have significantly expanded our efforts to survey, listen to, and engage in dialogue with consumers to understand them better and to offer products that exceed their expectations. The information we get in return influences our strategic planning and provides input for the innovation process. In 2010, Natura’s investment in market research grew 58% from the previous year. It is wor th noting that we had already taken a major step forward in 2009, setting up our Consumer Insight area to improve our knowledge of the market and to identify trends. We expanded this initiative to our international operations in 2010. In this context, we want to go beyond product-development surveys to examine and understand our consumers’ attitudes and behaviors. We want to be present in all the market segments, from the very first moments of a child’s life through old age. Therefore, we are studying specific consumer segments, such as men, seniors, and preteens. We are also extending consumer behavior research to areas we consider relevant, such as beauty and conscious consumption. In 2010, we held our first dialogue panel exclusively for consumers. Twenty-two members of the public from several regions of Brazil and different age groups participated. At the meeting, we discussed their ideas for improving our products, services, and activities. 46 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHO WE WORK WITH This commitment to strengthening ties with our customers has ensured Natura’s continuing high levels of ac1.

In addition, 49% of cosmetics consumers selected Natura as their brand of choice. (BRAZIL) (%)¹ ² Our consumer loyalty rate, which demonstrates consumer satisfaction and their willingness to recommend and 80 81 81 continue to buy our products, is 53% — a significant increase over the previous year’s rate of 46%.

We maintain other channels for engaging consumers, such as our growing Internet presence through social networks and our own online communities for building relationships with customers. Examples of this practice include portals called I Love Make-Up (www.adoromaquiagem.com.br), Skin Care (www.cuidedapele. 2. PENETRATION IN BRAZILIAN com.br), and Love in Motion (www.amoremmovimento.com.br). These sites encourage visitors to exchange HOMES (%) ¹ ² experiences. We also launched the Natura Musical portal (www.naturamusical.com.br), a community that offers information about the project and invites our customers to interact with sponsored artists. In 2010, 54.8 these communities registered 3.3 million accesses and were visited by more than 2.7 million people. 52.4 CUSTOMER SERVICE 46.3 The main channel for consumers to contact us is the Natura Customer Service (NCS). The NCS received more than 1 million calls in Brazil in 2010, 31% fewer than the previous year. This decrease is associated with efforts to reduce false reporting of product defects. We began to analyze products returned by consumers before replacing them and improved our controls as a result. Complaints 2008 2009 2010 fell by 62%, a decrease we believe is associated with the reduction of false reports, and we have become 1.

HEALTH AND SAFETY In 2010, we restructured our consumer safety area. We brought all of our processes related to the safety and effectiveness of ingredients together under a single management system. This includes finished products, regulatory issues, the cosmetic vigilance system, and clinical research. With our international expansion in 2010, we worked with our teams in Latin America to improve our understanding of regulatory issues outside of Brazil. In 2010, we completed product reformulations to eliminate phthalates from our production and, by June Learn more about 2011, we expect to eliminate parabens from our formulas. Our target was to have both completely eliour relationship with minated in 2010, but we revised our goal because of technical challenges. Although these ingredients do consumers at : not pose proven risks to consumers, we decided to remove them from our formulas because there is no www.natura.net/relatorio scientific consensus about proper precautions. 47 4.5 SUPPLIERS OUR PURSUIT OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS PL AYS A KEY ROLE IN MAINTAINING OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY. The number of supplier-par tners we work with totaled just over 4,900. Of these, about 5% work with finished goods and production inputs (biodiversity ingredients, raw materials, packaging materials). The remainder provides services or delivers ingredients and materials indirectly required for our business processes. Despite the growth of our international activities, these par tners are located mainly in Brazil. We aim to continually evolve our processes in order to boost our business par tners’ levels of satisfaction. In 2010, the supplier-satisfaction index remained stable at 81%, compared with 82% in 2009. This fell shor t of our target of increasing satisfaction to 85%. Some operational issues, such as logistical bottlenecks, contributed to this. We will introduce new processes for planning and handling materials in the first quar ter of 2011. We also did not move forward as fast as we would have liked with improving the flow of contracts and payments, an issue raised by suppliers during the dialogue panels. Through our services center, we have improved monitoring of payments and have optimized the process of drafting contracts and related suppor t systems. We believe these advances, made in the second half of 2010, will be reflected in better service during 2011. 48 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHO WE WORK WITH One positive aspect is that our suppliers’ loyalty rate rose from 25% in 2009 to 28% in 2010. This indicator, 1. OVERALL SATISFACTION which we are reporting for the first time, has been monitored by Natura since 2008, and it combines oveBY SUPPLIER (%)¹ 2 rall satisfaction, intention to continue a relationship with Natura, and whether a supplier would recommend 82 Natura to other suppliers. For 2011, we hope to mantain a 28% supplier-loyalty rate, which will now be the 81 main indicator for assessing our relationships with suppliers (graph 1). Since 2009, we have been active on five fronts identified for improving our supplier relationships: employee awareness of critical issues affecting the supplier relationship; closer relations with strategic 74 suppliers; improving the product innovation funnel process to include suppliers; improving the payment process; and extension of our corporate supplier development program to other categories of supplies and services. To raise the awareness of new employees as to the impor tance of supplier relations, we reinforced the 2008 2009 2010 theme in the integration program. This is an impor tant point that should be intensified in 2011 to align 1 Percentage of suppliers satisfied or fully satisfied Top 2 Box. new employees with the precepts that guide our quality in relations with suppliers. 2 The indicators have a margin of error We held four dialogue panels with suppliers to discuss the following issues: solid waste, the relationship corresponding to a 95% confidence interval. between suppliers and supplier communities, and sustainable supply chains. We continued to hold meetings to monitor the performance of the Qlicar (Quality, Logistics, Innovation, Competitiveness, Service, and Relationship) program, with a focus on continuous improvement, as well as the effectiveness of procedures that define our relationships with strategic partners. These periodic meetings — which include “Breakfast Meetings with Suppliers” and “Alliance Conferences” enable us to maintain and improve these relationships. QLICAR PROGRAM In 2010, we extended the reach of Qlicar, which covered 97 partners — mainly suppliers of inputs and some of our service providers. Qlicar was extended to vendors that provide such services as marketing and communication campaigns and sub-brand publicity. We also reactivated BioQlicar for our supplier communities (learn more on page 51, Supplier Communities). We emphasize continuous performance improvement in our programs involving suppliers of finished goods and among our transportation companies, call centers, and logistics vendors. In 2011, we will extend this approach to in-depth awareness of environmental issues. We also reinforced the educational pillar, staging workshops on how to prepare sustainability reports and use them as a tool for evaluating and monitoring a company’s management. We also organized a training course on the production of greenhouse gas emissions inventories. SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAINS We took on a great challenge in 2010: to develop a methodology to quantify the environmental impacts that our partners’ activities may cause for society (known as socio-environmental externalities) and convert the data into monetary values. The new methodology will be incorporated into the process of selecting suppliers and is aligned with our ambition of developing sustainable supply chains. The study links the primary impacts of the supply chain with Natura’s priority sustainability issues. We applied it on a pilot basis for the selection of two suppliers in 2010: one from the services segment and the other from products. In both cases, we decided to select partners who, in addition to meeting traditional technical criteria, demonstrated advantages in social and environmental indicators, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in education. Our goal is to apply this methodology to 16 groups of materials and services (accounting for 60% of the value of our purchases) by the end of the first quarter of 2011, and to reach 100% of our portfolio within the next two years. This pioneer process is a result of collective construction. We held two dialogue panels gathering 70 people from 14 supplier categories, which helped us identify all the externalities to which each one is exposed. Learn more about supplier The methodology was developed in partnership with the consulting firm A.T. Kearney, known for its work development activities at: in supply chain management, and with the support of representatives from The Economics of Ecosystems www.natura.net/relatorio and Biodiversity (TEEB), of the United Nations. 49 4.6 W H EN N AT U R A CO M M I T T ED TO A SUPPLIER TEC H NOLOGY PL ATFOR M THAT INCORPOR ATES INPUTS EX TR ACTED COMMUNITIES FROM BR A ZILIAN BIODIVERSIT Y IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY, WE INITIATED R E L AT I O N S H I P S W I T H S U P P L I E R COMMUNITIES THAT PROVIDE NOT ONLY R AW MATER IAL S BUT AL SO ACCESS TO TR ADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE . 1. NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES This business model produces value for Natura and helps to create wealth for communities and small WITH WHICH NATURA DOES farmers while driving local development. In 2010, our network of relationships involved 25 supplier comBUSINESS ¹ munities comprising 2,301 families in the North, Northeast, Southeast, and South of Brazil and in Ecuador. 25 25 Eleven supplier communities provide materials for our plant that makes oils and soaps in Benevides (Pará) (learn more on page 53, Surrounding Communities). The number of families involved was 14% higher than 22 the previous year. Examples of progress in this relationship include a 57% increase in resources allocated to communities and the effective implementation of our Rural Supplier Development program, called BioQlicar (Quality, Logistics, Innovation, Competitiveness, Service and Relationship). This program is growing into a robust platform for dialogue and for the development of small farmers and partner communities involved in our supply chains of biodiversity inputs (graphs 1 and 2). Our relationship with supplier communities is based on the Natura Policy for the Sustainable Use of Biodiversity and Associated Traditional Knowledge, and is aligned with the International Convention on Bio2008 2009 2010 logical Diversity. This policy, which was formulated in 2008 and disseminated to our stakeholders in 2009, 1. In 2010, we revised the criteria for quantification of supplier communities, which regulates our processes and helps us improve the planning of demand for inputs purchased from these now consider only traditional communities communities. It also sets parameters for negotiating the equitable distribution of benefits obtained from and family farmers. We revised the numbers for 2008 and 2009 accordingly. the use of these ingredients. 50 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHO WE WORK WITH In 2010, we began to assess the loyalty of supplier communities to Natura, based on a survey similar to that 2. BENEFITED FAMILIES 1 which is conducted with our other suppliers. These methodologies will be consolidated in 2011. The initial assessment revealed the need for improvement in some aspects of these relationships, such as communi2,301 cation, the procurement process, and joint development opportunities in the supply chains. 2,012 1,823 We also improved dialogue with supplier communities by inviting them to a three-day conference. This meeting, involving 60 people, also included representatives of processing companies (suppliers that take ingredients such as almonds, seeds, or fruit from our supplier communities and conver t them into oils or other substances that are incorporated into our products). Through dialogue, we have promoted better integration between these two impor tant groups in our supply chain. At the conference, we showed how the issues discussed in 2009 had evolved and we conducted an assessment of BioQlicar. We also discussed scenarios for the coming years, the future of our relationships, and each 2008 2009 2010 side’s role in fostering sustainability. 1. In 2010, we revised the criteria for quantification of supplier communities, which now consider only traditional communities and family farmers. We revised the RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITIES numbers for 2008 and 2009 accordingly. In 2010, our transfer of resources to supplier communities rose 57% over 2009 levels, to R$8.7 million. This amount refers to payments for the supply of inputs; contracts for sharing benefits; for access to genetic heritage or associated traditional knowledge; for use of images; and for direct investments in local sustainable development.

Data for 2008 and 2009 have been revised due to the reallocation and reclassification of project expenses in supplier communities and the exclusion of amounts associated with one community that is no longer part of this group. 2. Sharing of benefits with the communities enabling access to Genetic Heritage and/or Associated Traditional Knowledge. 3.

Amounts invested in certification and stewardship plans in cultivation areas within supplier communities. 7. Includes reports and consulting services provided by specialists and NGOs contracted by Natura to work with supplier communities. Growth in the amount of resources resulted from higher demand driven by new product launches but also by more benefit-sharing payment contracts coming due in 2010 than in previous years. For 2011, we expect total distribution to grow 25%, a lower percentage than last year. BIOQLICAR PROGRAM Our supplier communities take par t in the BioQlicar Program, an initiative similar to the development program applied to the other suppliers. BioQlicar helps communities organize in different ways, stimulating their development and guiding their relations with the market as a whole. It also guides our procedures and relationship strategies to make supply chains more sustainable. This model considers two indicator categories: bio (economic, physical, environmental, social, and human resources) and Qlicar (monitoring the production performance of rural suppliers). In 2011, we will assess the program together with the communities, and our goal is to reach a score of 3.7 on a scale of 0 to 5. We also conducted, for the first time, a complete survey of data from the communities for the program. Learn more about initiatives This involved meetings in 23 of the 25 supplier communities and with 7 processing companies. The reinvolving supplier communities at sults were discussed with these two groups, enabling us to prepare joint action plans and improve the www.natura.net/relatorio supply chains. 51 4.7 SURROUNDING WE KNOW THAT OUR OPERATIONS BRING ABOUT CHANGE IN THE COMMUNITIES LOCATIONS WHERE WE OPER ATE, SO WE HAVE INVESTED IN CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITIES AROUND OUR UNITS IN CAJAMAR (SÃO PAULO), ITAPECERICA DA SERRA (SÃO PAULO), AND BENEVIDES (PARÁ). However, we recognize that we must develop new strategies for ensuring smooth transitions in other communities as our operations grow in Brazil and abroad. For example, our relationship strategy should include places where we have distribution centers: Jundiaí (São Paulo), Matias Barbosa (Minas Gerais), Jaboatão dos Guararapes (Pernambuco), Canoas (Rio Grande do Sul), Simões Filho (Bahia), Uberlândia (Minas Gerais), and Castanhal (Pará). The same should apply to our international operations. Outsourced manufacturing in Argentina started at the end of 2010 and will be extended to Mexico and Colombia. Our aim is to contribute to the development of these regions through partnerships with the community, authorities and representatives of civil society. In an effort to understand the needs of the communities surrounding our operations at Cajamar and Itapecerica da Serra, we held five dialogue panels involving representatives of civil society, government, associations, and nongovernmental organizations in 2010. At these events, we sought to learn the issues and challenges these communities face, understand how these groups interact with one another in the community, exchange experiences, and find joint solutions. Investments in projects at Cajamar and Itapecerica da Serra totaled R$438,700 in 2010, of which R$408,700 were corporate-funded and R$30,000 were revenues from the Natura Crer para Ver program. Natura also allocates 1% of its income tax to Municipal Councils for the Rights of Children and Adolescents, and we intend to build relationships with these bodies to monitor the use of these funds more closely (learn more on page 68, Creation of Social Value). 52 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHO WE WORK WITH INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT (R$ THOUSANDS) 1 2008 2009 2010 Investment in communities around Natura units – Natura funds 342.8 407.9 408.7 Investment in communities around Natura units – Crer para Ver program² 249.2 2.5 30.0 Total 592.0 410.4 438.7 1. Investments in the municipalities of Itapecerica da Serra and Cajamar. 2. This amount does not include funds intended for the Trilhas (Trails) project at Cajamar or the Encontros de Leitura (Reading) project at Itapecerica, both related to the Crer para Ver program. In 2010, the number of employees living in Cajamar rose from 565 to 659.This increase was slightly below the rate of growth of Natura’s staff as a whole. We have noted in past years that many people from our surrounding communities have sought employment with us but do not have the qualifications we require.This reflects shortcomings in educational and training facilities, which is a challenge not only in these locations but also in Brazil as a whole. In general, youngsters who applied to join Natura through our Young Apprentice program also demonstrated this lack of qualification. We believe there is an opportunity for us to take action in this respect, and in 2011 we will develop training programs for these groups to increase their own marketability, whether for positions at Natura or other companies in the community (learn more on page 26, High-priority Topics/Education). CAJAMAR One of the highlights of Natura’s performance at Cajamar in 2010 was the revision of the Municipal Education Plan. In 2003, we supported the local government’s first plan, and once again we are part of this initiative. In 2003, community involvement was low, whereas now 300 representatives of civil society are involved — evidence that this group is more cohesive and participatory. Last year, in conjunction with Cajamar’s municipal government, we engaged a higher-education institution (Fundação Escola de Sociologia e Política de São Paulo) to help us revise the plan. We covered 70% of the cost of the contract, and the municipal government paid the remainder. The project was planned jointly with the community through meetings held in all districts.The new plan covers education for municipal schools for the next 10 years — setting targets, strategies, and action plans. We also used funds from the Natura Crer para Ver (Believing is Seeing) program to produce a booklet to be distributed to the community, providing details on how the plan will work. ITAPECERICA DA SERRA Our main activity in Itapecerica da Serra revolves around expanding the selective garbage collection program. Therefore, we support the Municipal Environment Department (Green Division) and the local recycling cooperative. The medium-term goal is for selective collection to cover the entire municipality through a mixed system involving motorized transport, collectors, and voluntary points of delivery. In 2011 we will transfer our operations in Itapecerica da Serra to the city of São Paulo. We have outgrown our current facilities in Itapecerica da Serra, which no longer offer ideal working conditions (learn more on page 22, Structural Changes). We are aware that this decision will affect the community, and we are carrying out a transition process to minimize these impacts. We have maintained social investment in 2011 and are preparing the cooperative and the municipal government to independently manage the selective collection service. This has been the objective of this project since its outset; throughout the partnership, we have supported the reorganization of the cooperative, the structuring of its processes, the professionalization of the cooperative members, and the increase in the volume collected. BENEVIDES The Benevides plant has been in operation since 2006. It has the responsibility for training, negotiating, and maintaining relationships with farmers that supply some of the biodiversity ingredients it uses. These agroextractivist producers and communities (mostly grouped into cooperatives) are called “community enterprises” and are also part of our supplier communities (learn more on page 50, Supplier Communities). They are located in various towns and cities in the state of Pará, well beyond the municipality of Benevides. Learn more about In 2010, we worked with 11 associations and cooperatives comprising 1,100 families — 80% more than the 610 our relationship with the families in 2009. There was also growth in the amount of raw materials purchased, from 394 tons in 2009 to 500 surrounding communities at: tons in 2010. Our operations in Benevides will be expanded in 2011 with the construction of a new soap plant, www.natura.net/relatorio which is expected to increase the production capacity of our local operations. 53 4.8 SINCE NATURA WENT PUBLIC IN 2004, WE HAVE SOUGHT TO BUILD SHAREHOLDERS A TRANSPARENT AND HIGHQUALITY RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR SHAREHOLDERS, INVESTORS, AND CAPITAL MARKET ANALYSTS BY KEEPING THEM WELL INFORMED. We follow the recommendations of Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission and the rules of the BM&FBovespa, where Natura shares are listed on the New Market segment. Our Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, in April 2010 at our Cajamar facility, brought together more than 200 shareholders. These individuals had an opportunity to develop closer contact with our company, our controlling shareholders, and our executives (learn more on page 16, Governance).This year, we also held the second Natura’s Day, a meeting with 80 Brazilian and international capital market analysts and professionals. To maintain close relations with this group during 2010, we conducted quarterly conference calls and took part in conferences and individual meetings in Brazil and abroad. We held 600 meetings with investors. We also redesigned our website (www.natura.net/investidor), our main communication channel. The site’s functionality has improved, facilitating better access to information and providing greater interactivity, such as an investment simulator and the section Fale com RI (Talk to IR). Since its launch in June, we have recorded an average of 16,000 visits per month.

Created with the aim of encouraging com18,098 panies to measure, monitor, and disclose their carbon emissions, the index incorporates indicators related to climate change issues. Consisting of companies that were already listed on the IBrX-50 and that voluntarily accepted these emissions standards, the new index requires companies to run periodic emission inventories to remain in the portfolio. Natura has been conducting emission inventories since 2007 (for more details, see page 62 in Creation of Environmental Value). 2008 2009 2010 1. Source: Economática. PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS On February 23, 2011, Natura’s Board of Directors approved a proposal for the payment of R$659.6 million in dividends and R$59.9 million in interest on capital (R$50.9 million net of withholding tax) for the 2010 financial year. This proposal was to be shared at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on April 8, 2011. On August 12, 2010, Natura paid dividends amounting to R$253.9 million and interest on capital of R$30.1 million (net of withholding tax). The remaining balance, to be paid on April 14, 2011, following ratification by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, will be R$405.6 million in dividends and R$20.7 million in interest on capital (net of withholding tax).These dividends and interest on capital referring to earnings for 2009 will represent net earnings per share of R$1.65 (R$1.37 per share in 2009), corresponding to 99% of free cash generation1 and 95% of net income2 for 2010. 1.

WE WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE PROCESS OF FORMULATING PUBLIC POLICY, PL AYING A LE ADING ROLE IN SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION ON ISSUES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR WORLD VISION. Once again, our main efforts were aimed at introducing a new legal framework for access to biodiversity and associated traditional knowledge, ensuring the conditions for sustainable use of the nation’s genetic heritage and the traditions associated with it. This matter has been on our agenda for 10 years. We believe that if Brazil is to create wealth from the sustainable use of its biodiversity, consolidating its global leadership in this area, legislation is required to provide guidance and protection to companies and researchers. Today, the issue is regulated by an incomplete and inconsistent Provisional Measure that does not guarantee institutional stability for the development of Read more on the full science and technology. We believe that building a model that brings together production, consumption, version of the Report at: and conservation is the only way to contain loss of biological diversity. Establishing alternatives depends on www.natura.net/relatorio the government resolving the current standoff. 56 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHO WE WORK WITH Our action plan for moving this issue forward is focused on three priorities: communication, which can improve societal understanding and unite the community to demand action; engagement with communities to seek support for this effort; and influencing decision makers to move forward with the legal framework. We believe that the bill, which has been stalled with the chief of staff of the President of the Republic since 2007, should be sent to Congress. Throughout 2010, we reaffirmed this belief. In the legislature, the bill will be discussed, negotiated, and adapted to provide an appropriate legal framework. As a result of Brazil’s imperfect regulatory framework, in 2010 we received infraction notices from the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama). We disagree with these findings and have formally challenged them (read more on page 64, Creation of Environmental Value). Another topic on our agenda was the participation of Guilherme Leal, then co-chairman of the Board of Directors, in the 2010 presidential elections. (read more on page 18, Governance). In relation to taxation, we worked with the Brazilian Association of Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Industry (Abihpec), to raise awareness in Congress about the effects of Provisional Measure 497 of July 2010. This measure would dramatically increase the tax burden on cosmetics companies. Taxation is already very high, and further increases would also have a significant impact on consumers. We obtained financing from government agencies through tax incentives that reached just over R$34 million in 2010.

LOBBYING AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE We favor the practice of political lobbying when it is done transparently and ethically. We support regulation of this activity, which is lawful and legitimate but lacks rules and limits. In attempting to fill this regulatory vacuum, we follow our own guidelines for government relations. Lobbying on behalf of our company is conducted by Daniel Serra, Elizabete Vicentini, Kassia Reis, Rodolfo Guttilla, and Thais Chueiri, who are all Natura employees. In addition, we publish other documents outlining our positions and our conduct. We distribute these documents at our meetings with government representatives.

We continue to build on our intiatives related to waste generation and efficient uses of water and energy. In 2009, we made a decision to be mindful not only of our own impacts on the environment, but to consider the environmental performance when evaluating potential supply chain partners. As such, our calculation 1.TOTAL EMISSIONS CO2e 1 2 of our key indicators – water and electricity consumption and waste generation – included data from con(METRIC TONS) tracted suppliers. In 2010, we began to include the performance of our distribution centers and other Natura 253,312 facilities in these indicators. Our challenge now is to include the results of our international operations in 232,827 these data. Through these initiatives, we can glean a more accurate portrayal of the impact generated by our business, devise more comprehensive action plans, and influence our suppliers to take measures to ensure 201,493 environmentally balanced production. CARBON NEUTRAL In 2007, we started our Carbon-Neutral Program to significantly reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases 2008 2009 2010 (GHGs). This initiative compels us to find alternatives for improving our efficiency and ensures our success by mitigating the environmental impacts of our rapid growth. Starting the program was the first step of a commitment we made to society: to reduce the company’s GHG emissions by 33% within five years, using our 2006 emissions as a baseline. Since than, we reached a 2. RELATIVE EMISSIONS (KG OF CO2e/KG 21% reduction and induced a profound transformation in the processes of our business, besides we neutralPRODUCTS BILLED)1 2 ized our emissions by supporting social-environmental projects. Through a diagnosis, in 2010 we reviewed the program deadline for achieving the goal of 2011 to 2013 (read more on next page). 3.82 Last year, Natura’s absolute emissions totaled 253,312 metric tons of CO2e, continuing the trend we set in 3.55 recent years for emissions to grow at a slower pace than our business output. In relative terms, there was a 7.3% decline in GHG emissions, due primarily to significant process improvements in our order cycle (which 3.30 involves product distribution), international operations, and business management. Three core components form the heart of the Carbon-Neutral Program: expanding the scope of our inventory; reducing GHG emissions; and offsetting those that cannot be avoided (graphs 1 and 2). 2008 2009 2010 1. CO2e (or CO2 equivalent), a measure used to EMISSIONS INVENTORY express GHG emissions, based on their global warming potential. To calculate our inventory, we take into account the total volume of our emissions related to scope 1, 2 and 2 The inventory calculation model was up3 – in other words, the survey covers the extraction of raw materials in nature to the final disposal of the graded in 2010. The 2009 base has been recalculated to ensure comparability, and the product.

PwC, an independent auditing and consulting firm, conducts specific verification (limited assurance) of the data in the 2010 Natura Consolidated GHG Inventory Report. 62 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHAT FOOTPRINT WE LEAVE REDUCTION Only carbon-emissions cuts will contain climate change and its impacts. That is why reducing our GHG emissions is central to the Carbon Neutral Program. The complexity of the actions, which involve a deep transformation of how we do business, partly explain the revised deadline for attaining the target reduction of 33% . Several forecasts made at the outset of the program in 2007 turned out to be incorrect or were overly ambitious to achieve the goal in five years. We also found ourselves behind schedule in implementing some of our projects, partly because of a slower-than-expected technological evolution of the market. Among the difficulties we currently face is a low supply of raw materials from plant origin, like biopolymers used in manufacturing lower-impact plastic packaging, and a shortage of commercially viable recycled materials with traceable chains for use in the manufacturing of packaging. To accelerate carbon-emission reductions in the years ahead, we launched the Less Carbon, More Productivity program in 2010. This initiative is structured on five action fronts: staff engagement, education, and training, identification of projects, improvements in processes, and connecting with the business. In the last three pillars, significant advances have been made in incorporating the carbon impact into business decisions by creating policies for prioritizing materials and new measurement tools. We also now generate detailed analyses of the emissions from Natura’s major processes. We have a tool capable of estimating gas emissions from each process, which enables managers to understand the impact of their activities on the company’s emission inventory and to make more conscientious decisions as a result. In the new product development area, we have created a tool for estimating emissions from products and packaging beginning with their conception. In other words, based on specific data, this tool can forecast a potential product’s future environmental impact in addition to making comparisons with items of the same category and Business Unit. We have already begun to reap the fruit of this process by exceeding the relative emissions reduction target, having achieved 7.3% in 2010 compared to a projected target of 4.4% . The decline is primarily due to significant reductions in several processes like the Order Cycle (which involves the distribution of our products), international operations and Business Management. We also face the additional challenge of reducing absolute GHG emissions by 10% between 2008 and 2012. This target refers to direct emissions and electricity consumption (the so-called scopes 1 and 2 of our Brazilian operations). We are sticking to our commitment, although we have not yet reached the expected results given the delay in implementing projects, in addition to external factors. Because of the delay in release of the environmental license, we postponed by almost a year the installation of a flex boiler, which began operating at the end of 2010. Another postponed initiative was the adoption of ethanol-powered vehicles for the sales force, implemented beginning March 2011, eight months after the initial period. These two initiatives will produce results this year and represent over 60% of the emisLearn more about sions to be cut. actions that enabled us to reduce our emissions at: A further difficulty involves the increased use of coal-fired thermal power plants in Brazil. With a more www.natura.net/relatorio polluting energy matrix, the emission factor of the electricity grid was increased by over 100% in the composition of total GHG emissions. OFFSETTING Emissions that cannot be avoided are offset through projects that focus on energy efficiency, the exchange of fossil fuels for renewable energy, and the reforestation of degraded areas. Methods are selected using a biannual public tender available throughout Brazil. In the process for the 2009–2010 two-year period, six projects were selected in Brazil, from among the 82 submitted, which were expected to neutralize 465,237 metric tons of CO2e emissions in 2009 and Learn more about 2010. Part of these emissions were offset by purchasing credits and others will be offset with future the offseting projects at: credits. In 2011, a new contract is expected to be concluded that will include a project to offset emiswww.natura.net/relatorio sions in Latin America. 63 BIODIVERSITY The United Nations declared 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity. We strengthened our actions in support of a policy that leads to sustainable development through the use of biodiversity assets and the creation of a new Brazilian legal framework for access to genetic heritage and its associated traditional knowledge. Since 2008, we have relied on the Natura Policy for the Sustainable Use of Biodiversity and Traditional Knowledge. This policy establishes directives for the use of raw materials and the sharing of benefits, such as raw material extraction with the mandatory use of sustainable stewardship through extractivist family agriculture-based systems. It is the fruit of the experience acquired as part of a group that plunged into little-explored complex topics and followed the principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity established by the United Nations. It presents action guidelines for all internal departments involved in product research and development on the basis of genetic resources and/or their associated traditional knowledge. In the case of our relationship network, it serves, among other purposes, as an instrument to support decision making by upholding our values and the manner in which we work (learn more on page 25, High-Priority Topics/Biodiversity). See the list of certified species at: www.natura.net/relatorio SANCTIONS APPLIED BY IBAMA In November and December 2010, Natura received 68 infraction notices from the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) with fines of R$22 million for allegedly irregular access to biodiversity for research and product development. Other local and foreign companies, scientists, and public research institutions also received notices. Natura does not agree with these actions and has formally challenged them. We believe that the need for authorization from the government to start research is a barrier to the development of science and does not uphold the rights of traditional communities nor does itguarantee protection of biomes. In addition, the time taken to analyze an application, usually about two years, would mean that pure or applied research by business would not be feasible. We believe that our activity complies with the principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations treaty on which Natura bases its policy for the sustainable use of biodiversity and tra1.

Natura has prior approval from all suppliers of biological materials, has signed contracts IMPACT OF PACKAGING BY with them, and shares benefits from the commercial exploitation of species, and does so fairly and equitably. QUANTITY OF PRODUCT (MPT/KG) We view the notifications as a positive opportunity, however, to discuss the urgency of developing a legal 71.3 framework for biodiversity. 69.5 CERTIFICATION OF INGREDIENTS 65.4 We ended the year with 36 certified species, which means that more than 60% of the biodiversity assets used by Natura have certified production and origin. This process is part of our Program for the Certification of Ingredients, which is a statement of our commitment to respecting the ecological limits to the production of ingredients we acquire from supplier communities. This 2008 2009 2010 program guarantees that production remains within the levels the environment is capable of supporting. The certifications include family farmers and the traditional communities whose production is certified by 2. RECYCLED MATERIALS three different protocols: organic agriculture (the Biodynamics Institute, Ecocert, the International AgriculUSED (%)1 tural Organization, and the Ecological Market Institute); sustainable agriculture (the Sustainable Agriculture 13.0 Network); and forestry (the Forest Stewardship Council). 10.4 10.4 PRODUCT IMPACT We monitor the impact of our product packaging using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool, in addition to carbon emissions. This tool enables us to quantify and monitor the ecological impact of packaging materials from the extraction of the raw materials through production, use, and disposal (graphs 1 and 2). In 2010, we launched in Brazil the first cosmetic product with green polyethylene packaging: refills for 2008 2009 2010 Natura Erva Doce hand soap.

Natura internal studies. 64 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHAT FOOTPRINT WE LEAVE We also launched a new refill for the Todo Dia (Everyday) moisturizer. Internal studies showed 66% less environmental impact in comparison with the previous refill, 83% less plastic than in regular packaging, and a 97% reduction in waste generated. In spite of these advances, we saw a decline in the use of refills in comparison with all items billed by Natura. We sought to achieve a target an 18.5% of the total of these items; our rate in 2010 was 16.9% . This development was due in part to greater representativeness of sales of items in special or seasonal kits that cannot be refilled. The potential for increasing refills is significant. While 40% of our products have a refill option, they represent 55% of our billed products. In our international operations, use of refills is increasing in most countries except Mexico, with a consistent recovery in Argentina and Chile. For 2011, our challenge is to increase the awareness of refill options for our consumers outside Brazil.

In 2010, we began to develop an extensive solid waste management project covering the entire life cycle of our products, from the extraction of raw materials to the disposal of packaging and the reuse of materials (learn more on page 29, High-Priority Topics/Impact of the Products). We recorded an increase of 19.8% in total waste generated last year and 8.2% in the relative index, which compares the quantity of waste per product unit billed. This increase can be attributed to the inclusion of data in the indicator from four distribution centers and the Natura Houses in Brazil. Had these areas not been included, the index would have remained at the same level as the previous year. Our increase in pro2008 2009 2010 duction and the higher disposal of obsolete products also affected waste generation. These developments 1. Before 2008, the indicator was calculated present a glimpse of the challenge we face in improving our waste management processes (graph 1). considering only the waste generated at Natura units. In 2010, we included main contractors To reverse this situation, we have established an action plan that includes alternatives that minimize the and improved the calculation basis to match the indicators of water and energy. For this environmental impact of the primary waste-generating processes, periodic verification of the indicator, and reason, the historical record was recalculated. a review of items currently incinerated or sent to landfills so as to define alternative recycling methods. We also plan to standardize data collection at Natura and third-party units. The goal of this is to improve the quality of the information collected and initiate waste monitoring in our international operations. Our target for 2011 is to reduce the total weight of waste per unit billed by 3% . With new alternatives for disposing of materials that were previously incinerated, and through a partnership with our cardboard supplier to recycle 100% of this material in Cajamar, we increased the percentage of recycled waste by 8.3% . Today, 92.1% of all waste produced at Natura is recycled. 2. WATER CONSUMPTION PER UNIT BILLED (LITERS/ UNIT BILLED)1 WATER AND EFFLUENTS 0.52 Following the implementation of efficiency projects, awareness programs and water consumption control, we achieved a 10% reduction in relative consumption per unit billed. Our absolute consumption of water remained stable, even as our production rose. The improvements implemented in waste management 0.48 also resulted in gains in water reuse and recycling in 2010. Knowing that sustainable use of water is a major 0.47 global challenge, we have made progress in analyzing our water footprint (learn more on page 29, Highpriority Topics/Impact of the Product). The reduction in relative water consumption was motivated by reductions at Cajamar and Itapecerica da Serra, which reduced consumption by 5% . However, there was a 17% increase in water use in other Natura 2008 2009 2010 areas, the result of having incorporated the Simões Filho Distribution Center, in the state of Bahia, into the 1.

To achieve this 447.3 result, we implemented several improvements, primarily at Cajamar, in addition to efficiency gains from 443.8 better energy resource management. In absolute terms, the Cajamar and Itapecerica da Serra units registered a 2.8% combined increase in consumption, owing to the installation of new manufacturing equipment. The 22.1% increase in other Natura areas was the result of having incorporated the Simões Filho Distribution Center, in Bahia, in this indicator, as well as the modernization of three other distribution centers. Total consumption by major subcontractors parties rose by 30.8% because of the greater number of units acquired (graph 1). 2008 2009 2010 We registered a 74% decline in diesel oil consumption in our generators, due to fewer power outages at 1.

NATURA INSTITUTE We have made systematic private social investments since the 1990s because we believe this is a way to express our Essence: that the value and longevity of a company are related to its ability to contribute to the evolution of society and its sustainable development. In 2010, we took an important step forward by founding the Natura Institute, an independent nonprofit organization, to extend and strengthen our initiatives, and improve internal management and governance processes and practices for our social initiatives. Fostering education a priority for sustainability in Natura’s view is also the pillar that supports all the activities of the new organization. The Institute was founded with the participation of members of our Board of Directors and executives. In 2011, we will make progress in its administrative organization and set up an audit committee and an advisory board, as well as define a strategic plan for the institution. The institute is given 0.5% of Natura’s annual net income in addition to funds from Natura’s Crer para Ver (Believing is Seeing) program. CRER PARA VER (BELIEVING IS SEEING) PROGRAM The highlight of our societal activity in 2010 was the record amount of funds raised by the Natura Crer para Ver 1. PENETRATION program. We had committed to reaching R$6 million, but by the end of the year we had reached R$10 million, CRER PARA VER (% CYCLE) 1 the largest amount raised by the program since its inception in 1995. In 2010, the program invested more than R$3.9 million in projects.

Therefore, the difference of more than R$5 million 7.1 between the amount we collected and what we spent in the year is available in cash holdings for use in 2011 and will help us expand the current projects. The goal of Crer para Ver is to improve the quality of public schooling. The program funds literacy initiatives in preschools and elementary schools, as well as for young adults. Our consultants actively participate in the program by selling the exclusive Crer para Ver product line, receiving no commission for doing so.

Net revenues reached R$1.3 million in 2010, compared with R$430,000 in the previous year. Funds in these countries are invested in teacher training and benefit vulnerable populations. In Chile, for instance, some of these funds are helping to rebuild schools destroyed by the February 2010 earthquake. The main initiative of the Crer para Ver program in Brazil is the Trilhas (Trails) Project. This project benefits 310,000 children and 15,000 educators in 4,300 schools. The Trilhas Project is designed for children ages 4–6 and provides instructional materials and support for teachers and school principals to help students develop reading, writing, and speaking skills. In 2010, we signed a technical cooperation agreement with the Ministry of Education, enabling the ministry to share this methodology with other municipalities and institutions — transforming the project into a public initiative.

In 2010, we allocated R$24.3 million to intiatives that fall under three broad themes: strengthening civil society organizations, supporting sustainable development, and promoting Brazilian culture with a focus on music. Our business model entails the expansion of relationships with organizations that are committed to building a sustainable society, which is why we invest in organizations that share our vision for the world and that support causes that are significant to our industry. For instance, we sponsored several programs of the Ethos Institute for Business and Social Responsibility. These Ethos programs included the Sustainable Amazon Forum, Sustainable Connections, Corporate Responsibility in the Media, and Promotion of Integrity and Fighting Corruption. In 2010, we participated once again in the Global Entrepreneurship Week, coordinated by the Endeavor Institute, which is located in Brazil. As the largest global movement focused on entrepreneurship, the event took place simultaneously in 102 countries for seven days of talks, competitions, workshops, games, fairs, and awareness-building activities. We continued to support the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which develops international guidelines and standards for compiling sustainability reports. We sponsored GRI’s Amsterdam Global Conference on Sustainability and Transparency (May 26–28, 2010), at which our stakeholders met to discuss sustainability and transparency-related issues. We enjoy a partnership with Associação Brasileira de Comunicação Empresarial (Brazilian Association of Corporate Communication – Aberje). This organization presented an event designed to help Brazilian companies develop guiding principles for communicating with the news media and key opinion leaders. Natura sponsored this event and presented its connection with biodiversity, focusing on its relationship with supplier communities. We continue to underwrite initiatives that increase societal awareness about sustainable development. One such example is our support of the documentary Tudo mudo pode mudar o mundo (Everyone Can Change the World). This film, by Mara Mourão, presents stories of societal leaders and the Afro-Reggae cultural group. Learn more about The Natura Musical (Musical Natura) program continues as our primary expression of support for Brazilian the projects supported culture. A national call for projects and another regional call in the state of Minas Gerais allowed us to choose in 2010 at: projects from different artistic areas, as well as those selected directly by the program. In 2010, we supported www.natura.net/relatorio 17 projects. Since Natura Musical began in 2005, we have supported more than 140 such initiatives.

CONSOLIDATED Consolidated net revenue in 2010 was R$5.136 billion, an increase of 21.1% over 2009. EBITDA (earnings NET REVENUE (R$ MILLIONS) before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) was R$1.256 billion with an EBITDA margin of 24.5%. 5,136.7 Net income was R$744.1 million. This performance reflects the strength of our marketing strategy, the launch 4,242.1 of new products, and an 18% increase in the number of consultants — who now total more than 1,221,000 3,576.2 in our operations in Brazil and overseas. COSTS AND EXPENSES We reduced the costs of goods sold (COGS) from 30.5% in 2009 to 30.3% in 2010. Inflationary pressure remained under control, the exchange rate was favorable during this period, and our strategy for increasing prices proved to be efficient, with less dispersion among the categories. These positive effects, however, 2008 2009 2010 were partly offset by higher product losses in Brazil — the result of additional inventories generated in the final quarter of 2009. For 2011, the loss-prevention process is being strengthened, and we expect a significant improvement in this indicator. We also recorded a reduction in sales expenses, accounting for 33.2% of net revenues in 2010 (35.3% in 2009). We made greater investments in marketing, which provides vigorous support for product launches, as well as training and events for the sales force. This increase was mitigated by greater logistical efficiency and the dilution of sales force costs. The highlight was the percentage of orders placed over the Internet in Brazil, which stood at 86% in 2010 (71.2% in 2009). Administration and general expenses accounted for 11.8% in 2010 (10.6% in 2009). The increase in the yearover-year comparison, which was in line with our forecasts, is due to higher expenditures for research and development (rising from 2.5% of net revenues in 2009 to 2.8% in 2010); higher investments in projects that enable the company to grow, primarily in the areas of information technology, logistics, and leadership devel2.

In 2009, we recorded a lower effective IR/CSLL rate as a result of having accelerated the fiscal amortization of goodwill in the period. This fiscal benefit ended last year. This year, the effective tax rate was 33.5%. 2008 2009 2010 Consolidated EBITDA stood at R$1.256 billion in 2010, up 24.6% over 2009. The margin rose from 23.8% to 2008 2009 2010 24.5% in 2010 (graph 2). 70 //NATURAREPORT2010_WHAT FOOTPRINT WE LEAVE SUMMARY OF CASH FLOW Free cash generation for the year was R$716.3 million versus R$418.6 million in 2009. This 71.1% increase resulted from more efficient working capital management by extending payment terms for suppliers; reducing inventory coverage; reducing the balance of recoverable taxes; and making the change from annual to quarterly income tax assessments and payments. We are refining cash flow management processes, which should result in even more efficiency in 2011. Internal cash generation was R$832.9 million for the year. This growth of 7.3% over the previous year is in line with the growth of 8.8% recorded in net income for the period.

Investments in property, plant and equipment in 2011 are estimated at R$300 million and will concentrate on the ongoing development of our information technology platform, including a sound base for the international area, in addition to continuing our project to improve logistics and increase our industrial capacity. PRO FORMA RESULTS PER OPERATION BLOCK The profit margin achieved on exports from Brazil to international operations was deducted from the COGS of the respective operations, revealing the real impact of these subsidiaries on the company’s consolidated results. Accordingly, the Pro Forma Statement of Results for Brazil shows only sales in the domestic market. The performance of our operation in Brazil remained strong, with growth of 20.6% in net revenues, reaching R$4.764 billion. The EBITDA in Brazil was R$1.335 billion compared to R$1.085 billion in 2009, representing growth of 23%. Margins were 28% in 2010 and 27.5% in 2009.

The result was influenced by several negative factors, such as the earthquake in Chile in February of 2010, which partially destroyed our facilities and interrupted billings for 22 days. The pro forma EBITDA of this group of operations showed positive consolidation at R$13.1 million for the year, a growth of 47.8% over 2009. This reflected a dilution in sales and administrative expenses in spite of the increasing investment in our brand in these countries. Operations under implementation (Mexico and Colombia) showed high growth rates of 69.2% in local currency (64.5% in Brazilian reais), disregarding the revenue from the operation in Venezuela, which was closed in 2009. Pro forma EBITDA showed a loss of R$32.5 million (versus R$42.3 million in 2009), reflecting recent and continuing investments to expand these operations.

BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING Segment reporting is consistent with the management reports provided by the main operating decision-maker to assess the performance of each segment and the allocation of funds. Although the main decision-maker analyzes the information on revenue at its different levels, according to the reports used by management to make decisions, the Company’s business is mainly segmented based on the sales of cosmetics by geographic regions, which are as follows: Brazil, Latin America (“LATAM”) and other countries. In addition, LATAM is divided in two groups for analysis: (i) Argentina, Chile and Peru; and (ii) Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia. The segments’ business features are similar and each segment offers similar products through the same consumer access method. Net revenue by region is presented as follows in 2010: • Brazil: 92.8% • Argentina, Chile and Peru: 5.0% • Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia: 1.9% • Other: 0.3% 100 Although international segments do not represent more than 10% of the information required to aggregate a segment, as established by the aggregation criteria described in IFRS 8 Operating Segments, management has substantial evidence that its foreign business share will increase considerably against consolidated financial balances and, thus, management opted to report them separately. The accounting policies of each segment are the same as applied by the Company.The performance of the Company’s segments was assessed based on the net operating income, net income and noncurrent assets. This measurement basis excludes the effects of interest, income tax and social contribution, depreciation and amortization.

Itapecerica da Serra SP We have audited the accompanying individual and consolidated financial statements of Natura Cosméticos S.A. (the “Company”), identified as Parent and Consolidated, respectively, which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2010, and the statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Management’s responsibility for the financial statements Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the individual financial statements in accordance with Brazilian accounting practices and the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as issued by International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and in accordance with Brazilian accounting practices and for such internal controls as Management determines it is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors’ responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit, which was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international standards on auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the Company’s financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion on individual financial statements In our opinion, the individual financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Natura Cosméticos S.A. as of December 31, 2010 and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Brazilian accounting practices. Opinion on consolidated financial statements In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Natura Cosméticos S.A. as of December 31, 2010 and of their consolidated financial performance and their consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the IASB, and Brazilian accounting practices. Emphasis of matter As described in note 2.1., the individual financial statements were prepared in accordance with Brazilian accounting practices. For Natura Cosméticos S.A. these practices differ from IFRS, applicable to separate financial statements, only in relation to measurement of equity method investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint-controlled entities, which are measured based on cost or fair value in accordance with IFRS. Other matters Statements of value added We have also audited individual and consolidated statements of value added (DVA) for the year ended December 31, 2010, whose presentation is required by Brazilian corporate law for public companies, and as supplementary information under IFRS which do not require the presentation of DVA. These statements were subject to the same audit procedures previously described and, in our opinion, are appropriately presented, in all material respects, in relation to the overall financial statements presentation. Convenience translation The accompanying financial statements have been translated into English for the convenience of readers outside Brazil. São Paulo, February 23, 2011 Edimar Facco Auditores Independentes Engagement Partner CRC nº 2 SP 011609/O-8 CRC nº 1 SP 138635/O-2 106 DNV ASSURANCE STATEMENT SUMMARY NATURA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 1. Context and responsibilities Det Norske Veritas (DNV) has been commissioned by Natura Cosméticos SA (‘Natura’) to provide assurance services in connection with the Portuguese version of Natura’s Sustainability Report 2010 (‘the Report’). The Board of Natura is responsible for all information provided in the Report as well as the processes for collecting, analysing and reporting that information. DNV’s responsibility regarding this verification is to Natura only, in accordance with the scope of work commissioned. The stakeholders of Natura are the intended users of this Assurance Statement. DNV disclaims any liability or responsibility to a third party for decisions, whether investment or otherwise, based upon this Assurance Statement summary, or its full version available in Portuguese at www.natura.net/relatorio. Our conclusions are based on the assumption that the data and information provided to DNV is complete and true. 2. Independence DNV states its independence and impartiality with regard to this commission. DNV was not involved in the preparation of any text or data included in the Report, except for this Assurance Statement summary and its full version available in Portuguese at www.natura.net/relatorio. Moreover, in 2010, DNV did not provide any services to Natura that could compromise the independence or impartiality of our findings, conclusions or recommendations. 3. Scope and limitations DNV’s assurance engagement consisted of the verification of information provided in the Report, as well as the assessment of the underlying data management and reporting processes, for the period of 12 months ending on 31 December 2010. Based on the scope of work commissioned by Natura, the main objectives of this engagement were to assess and verify: • Processes and activities carried out by Natura in order to identify, assess and prioritise material sustainability issues; • Processes and activities carried out by Natura in order to identify, analyse and respond to stakeholders’ interests and concerns in relation to the company’ sustainability strategy, management and performance, and the content of the Report; • Systems, processes and tools to collect, aggregate, control and assure the quality of data and report on sustainability-related information; • The description of sustainability related policies, strategies, objectives, initiatives, achievements and performance in 2010, as described in the Report; • Adherence of reported information to the principles of materiality, reliability, balance, clarity and comparability set out in the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, 2006 and AccountAbility’s AA1000 Assurance Principles Standard, 2008 (AA 1000 APS); • Verification and endorsement of the GRI (2006) application level declared by Natura. This statement does not cover the verification of information or processes related to greenhouse gas emissions, which were subject to assessment and assurance by another third party. This assurance engagement focused primarily on the quality of the sustainability information and data presented in the Report and the underlying reporting systems. DNV’s scope of work did not include an assessment of the adequacy, effectiveness or efficiency of Natura’s sustainability strategy or management practices. It also excluded the assessment or verification of sustainability management, performance or reporting practices by Natura’s suppliers or any other third parties mentioned in the Report. 4. Approach This assurance engagement was carried out between January and April 2011 by suitably qualified and experienced professionals, following DNV’s Protocol for Verification of Sustainability Reports. DNV’s Verification Protocol has been developed in accordance with the most widely accepted reporting and assurance standards, including AA1000 APS (2008) and the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, 2006 (GRI G3). 107 The methods used in this engagement included: • Interviews with 32 directors, managers and staff responsible for processes related to the management of material issues at Natura’s headquarters and production units in Cajamar and Benevides (Brazil); • Participation (as an observer) in a multi-stakeholder engagement event organized in Belém, State of Pará (Brazil) to discuss the material issues related to sourcing in the Amazon region; • Interviews with 4 selected external stakeholders representing supplier communities of the company and a local regulatory agency; • Review of documentation and other evidence of developments in the company’s sustainability objectives, resources and activities; • Review of sustainability performance-related reports, performance records and samples of data at source; • Assessment of the quality and effectiveness of data management systems and tools for collection, aggregation quality control, and reporting of sustainability information. This also involved testing selected data samples; • Review of the outputs of materiality assessment and external stakeholder engagement initiatives carried out by Natura, as well as internal and external communications regarding Natura’s commitment, approach and performance on sustainability; • Assessment of draft and final versions of the Report against relevant reporting and report assurance standards and guidelines. 5. Main conclusions and opportunities for improvement Based on the work undertaken as part of this assurance engagement, DNV concludes that: • Natura’s Sustainability Report 2010 generally provides a reliable and fair representation of Natura’s sustainability related policies, management approach, initiatives and performance over the reporting period. • The Report is well aligned with the principles established in the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (2006). DNV also endorses the GRI Application Level of A+, declared by Natura. • Natura continued to develop their understanding of material topics, in close collaboration with stakeholders in Brazil and overseas (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, México and Peru). The outcomes from these initiatives have been adequately considered in the preparation of the Report. • The reliability of the information is still limited due to the lack of systematization of the company’s data management processes, in particular in the international operations. In the course of the verification, DNV identified the following opportunities for improvement: • Inclusivity and responsiveness: continue to improve the description of the company’s stakeholders’ interests and expectations in relation to Natura’s sustainability strategy and the content of the Report. The Report could also better describe how Natura has responded or intends to respond to stakeholder expectations. • Reliability: increase the systematization of data management processes, in particular in the company’s international operations. Internal audits of sustainability data are also recommended. • Comparability: • improve the monitoring of sustainability performance in international operations, in order to increase the scope of reporting of performance in the Report. This should also increase comparability of performance across the various operations of Natura; • continue to deepen Natura’s understanding of the sustainability performance of its main products and supply chains, following the pilot initiatives initiated in 2010. • Clarity: improve the clarity and homogeneity of future translated versions of the Report into English. Detailed information on DNV’s approach, conclusions and recommendations is provided in the full Assurance Statement available in Portuguese at www.natura.net/relatorio.
