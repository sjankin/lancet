Our work involves us in almost all areas of public policy as we endeavour to improve its design and implementation to benefit people, planet and profit. We have a long history, over 80 years, of working on these issues and these define the character of our company. They are reflected in our code of business ethics (see http://www.ecorys.com/code-of-businessethics/index.php) which are closely aligned with the principles of the UN Global Compact. This document and reporting for the UN Global Compact This document is submitted as part of Ecorys Netherlands’ commitment to the UN Global Compact and its 10 principles. It is based on our annual CSR report, and is structured consistent with the 3 requirements of the Global Compact Reporting Policy, namely: 1. A statement by the chief executive expressing continued support for the Global Compact and renewing the participant's on-going commitment to the initiative and its principles. Our general ethical, social and environmental policy is presented in section 2, with a signed statement of the Ecorys Managing Director. This includes our commitment to adhere to the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact. 2. A description of practical actions (i.e., disclosure of any relevant policies, procedures, activities) that the company has taken (and plans to take) to implement the Global Compact principles in each of the four issue areas (human rights, labour, environment, anti-corruption). Note: In cases where a COP does not address one or more of the four issue areas, an explanation must be provided ( report or explain ). 3. A measurement of outcomes (i.e., the degree to which targets/performance indicators were met, or other, qualitative or quantitative, measurements of results). Our CSR reporting framework is grouped by 3 themes (see sections 4, 5 and 6) which cut across the 10 principles of the Global Compact. Our reporting structure first presents our policy and existing actions in each of the 3 theme areas. This is in line with point 2 of the reporting guidelines, describing the practical actions we have taken in CSR and implementing the Global Compact principles in practice. Each section then details the measurement of outcomes of the implemented measures, before setting new actions, targets and objectives for the next period. This is in line with point 3 of the reporting guidelines. Specifically against the 10 core principles of the UN Global Compact we can report the following: Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Ecorys NL CSR 5 Ecorys is conscious of and respects each individuals human rights. This is true for both employees and wider society. Internal procedures offer support for employees to maintain their dignity and to provide mechanisms that can support them in resolving any conflict or issues they face. Our ethical code is clear in its commitment to honesty, integrity and to follow the rule of law wherever we work. This commitment is also reflected in the terms and conditions we set out to those we work with, asking them to uphold the same values. We work around the world providing assistance to governments, a commitment to human rights is embedded in our work, to provide technical assistance that supports these aims. We are also involved in various projects that monitor the implementation of development aid and technical assistance in other countries, with human rights one of the criteria for evaluating their performance, examples of this include, a project we carried out on result oriented monitoring of operations financed by the EC in Asia and Central Asia, and a project evaluating the support provided by the European Commission to Belarus. Labour Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Section 5 of this report details our commitments and responsibilities to labour, these are underpinned by our commitment to work by the legal and regulatory framework of all the countries in which we work. We support our staff and their personal development at Ecorys, and have put in place policies, procedures, counselling and ‘whistle-blowing’ to minimise and manage cases of discrimination in the workplace. We do not use child or forced labour in our work. At Ecorys we uphold freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. At Ecorys we have an active Employee Work Council that represents the views of employees at management level. This group meets regularly and engages with employees to fully represent them. The group is included or consulted on all major management decisions and during 2011 has issued formal advices to management on structural changes within the company. These advices are published internally for all staff to access. Our work interacts with social policy and labour rights, both in the Netherlands and internationally, and we uphold the Global Compact principles in the work we carry out. Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Section 4 details the significant progress we have made in our commitment to the environment, including switching to green electricity suppliers and offsetting our CO2 emissions from flights. These are the headline actions we have taken to reduce our environmental impact, which have successfully reduced our carbon footprint by an estimated 80%, but this is not all we do. These actions are supported by other smaller, but still important, measures related to printing, recycling, travel choices and energy use in our daily work. These actions are part of our internal Environmental Management System (EMS) which since February 2011 has been certified as ISO 6 Ecorys NL CSR 14001 compliant. This demonstrates that we systematically assess, monitor and take action to manage our environmental impact. In addition to this, our work also has a cross-cutting focus on environmental sustainability, from the dedicated work carried out by our Energy and Environment team to work by our Transport, Real Estate teams. The projects we have carried out have all contributed to improving the knowledge base and effectiveness of public policy to improve environmental responsibility and the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Two examples of our work in this area can be found here: Brochure on Sustainable Industry and Resource Efficiency http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainablebusiness/files/brochure_sustainable_industry_150711_en.pdf Mid-term evaluation of FP7 Energy http://ec.europa.eu/energy/evaluations/doc/2010_research_fp7.pdf Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. This is clearly set out as a core ethical principle in our code of business conduct. ‘Ecorys does not give or receive bribes in order to retain or bestow business or financial advantages. Ecorys employees are directed that any demand for or offer of such bribe must be immediately rejected.’ We adhere to this rule in practice. Our work also provides us opportunities to support governments and public administrators around the world in improving their practices to reduce and eliminate corruption. Examples of this include our work to assess the progress made in Public Finance Management in India and providing budgetary training and support to advisors from BTC (the Belgian Development Agency). Ecorys NL CSR 7 1 Introduction This document is a restatement of the Ecorys CSR policy with updated achievements for 2010 and new goals and objectives for 2011-12. 1.1 Background Every individual, every organisation has an impact on their environment and on other people, simply by existing. Companies affect their environment through their policies and strategies, and through the way they conduct their day-to-day business. Examples of positive effects are employment and (economic and social) progress, while on the negative side there are issues like carbon footprints and social and economic inequality. Ecorys Netherlands takes its corporate social responsibility seriously. That is why Ecorys Netherlands has adopted a CSR policy which binds our organisation and its staff members to a set of core CSR principles. We have also signed up to the UN Global Compact and its ten principles for human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption1. The central thought in our CSR policy is the following. 1.2 Main objective of our CSR policy Ecorys Netherlands aims to achieve its business objectives in a sustainable and corporate responsible manner through recognising the economic, social and environmental implications of our activities and consistently aiming at improving ourselves in this domain. 1.3 Scope of the CSR policy The scope of our CSR policy includes all activities performed by ECORYS Nederland B.V.. In addition, we strive for sustainable forms of co-operation also with our free-lancers and subcontractors, with this now being a standard clause in our cooperation contracts 1.4 Dissemination of our CSR policy On our intranet all policy papers are available. We produce periodic information bulletins that are distributed to all staff. The public can access summary information regarding our CSR policy at our website, with updates and news items posted as appropriate. 1.5 Accountability Each staff member has the responsibility to act according to our CSR management system. Governance and final responsibility of the system are in the hands of the Managing Director of ECORYS Nederland BV. The CSR coordinator Matthew Smith is member of the CSR working group, which meets at least 6 times a year on all relevant CSR issues. He is responsible for maintenance of the management system, internal audits and reporting to the Managing Director. 1 See http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/TheTenPrinciples/index.html for further information Ecorys NL CSR 9 Each year the Managing Director, along with the CSR group, formulates targets, aimed at continuity and prevention of environmental impacts of the organization. The Managing Director and CSR group are responsible for dissemination of the policy, ensuring that all staff understand, support and live up to the CSR principles. The MD and environmental co-ordinator are supported by the CSR working group, which is composed of staff across Ecorys. At present the group includes: CSR Working Group 1. Wim Spit (MD) Chair 2. Matthew Smith (MSB) Environmental coordinator 3. Afke Mulder (MSB) 4. Anja Willemsen (MSB) 5. Wouter Vos (Real Estate) 6. Robert Eijkelstam (M&C) 7. Paula Klaasen (T&M) 8. Elvira Meurs (RSE) 9. Robert Ossevoort (T&M) 10. Jan de Bruine If you have some ideas or would like to become more involved then we’d be delighted to hear from you please get in touch the environmental co-ordinator or another member of the group. 10 Ecorys NL CSR 2 Statement of the Ecorys Nederland Directors’ team Ecorys Netherlands aims to achieve its business objectives in a sustainable and corporately responsible manner through recognising the economic, social and environmental implications of our activities. To do this Ecorys Netherlands is committed to a set of core CSR principles.  Legal Performance – adherence to the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate.  Sustainability – the agenda of Sustainable Development (i.e. environmental protection, social justice and equity, and economic development) is integrated into our corporate culture, strategy and practice. We stimulate Ecorys Netherlands staff to live up to the Ecorys ethical code:  Social the monitoring, assessment and management of the social impacts of our operations upon all stakeholders.  Environmental continually monitor, assess and manage the environmental impacts of our operations. We choose and promote effective environmental management systems and practices wherever possible. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our environmental performance and pollution prevention.  Economic – generate profit through business practices of integrity and fairness in-line with company values. As a majority employee-owned company we make a profit in order that we continue to operate, generate a reasonable return to our shareholders, to employ people and deliver our services. We are also sensitive to the wider economic implications of our corporate operations.  Stakeholder engagement – we will maintain open lines of communication with all stakeholders. This ensures that we are aware of their views and can therefore be pro-active in integrating their needs with present and future business operations.  CSR reporting – we will provide stakeholders with accurate information relating to our CSR performance in an annual report. Integration of management and reporting systems ensures the continual improvement of our performance.  Implementation – We strive to have in place organisational arrangements with clearly defined responsibilities for company-wide implementation, enforcement (where necessary) and review of our CSR policies, objectives and procedures. The responsibility for successful implementation lies within each individual, teams and the company as a whole.  Monitoring Progress against CSR objectives is monitored by the Board of Management, based on reports from the Operating Companies.  Communication We will actively communicate about our CSR policy and actions to all relevant (internal and external) stakeholders.  UN Global Compact – For areas of the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact not covered in the commitments listed above, Ecorys re-affirms it’s commitment to Human Rights, Labour, the Environment and Anti-Corruption and the principles thereunder. On behalf of the Ecorys Nederland Directors’ team, Wim Spit Ecorys NL CSR 11 3 Our CSR policy in general The three primary areas covered by our CSR policy are Ecorys:  and the Environment  as a Workplace  and wider Social Responsibility Environment ECORYS Netherlands strives to organise its operations in a sustainable manner. We continually monitor, assess and manage the environmental impacts of our operations. We choose and promote effective environmental management systems and practices wherever possible. Our achievement against these objectives has been recognised with our successful certification for ISO14001. Yet our ambitions do not stop here and we are committed to the continuous improvement of our environmental performance. It is our ambition to reduce our company greenhouse gas emissions and our use of office supplies each per year, either in total, or if this is not possible on a per capita (turnover) basis. From 2010 we have offset the largest part of our environmental footprint, emissions from flights. This is performed through the purchase of Gold Standard Verified Emissions Reductions (VERs). Workplace The welfare and wellbeing of our staff is of major importance to our functioning as a company. Ecorys Netherlands strives to be the best employer it can be and to provide its staff with equal opportunities. We have an active and comprehensive Employee Benefit Programme in place, including policies on removing barriers for diversity, employment of disabled staff, health care benefit schemes and part time working. Social Responsibility Ecorys Netherlands recognizes the importance of social responsibility. We address this through the promotion of socially responsible procurement. This means to purchase goods, and deliver our work and services in an environmentally and socially responsible way that delivers value for money and benefits to all relevant stakeholders and to Ecorys Netherlands. We strive to continuously improve our performance in this respect. Besides this aspect social responsibility also encompasses our role in the community around us. Ecorys Netherlands is currently looking into ways to achieve a positive and mutually beneficial interaction with the local community and wider society. Ecorys NL CSR 13 4 Ecorys and the environment 4.1 Our performance 4.1.1 Implementation Existing measures in Ecorys Since we started defining our environmental friendly policy in 2007, several measures have been implemented or are being implemented. These measures include (but are not limited to):  Recycling of paper;  Default setting of all printers on double sided printing;  Promoting use of public transport for commuting reasons by more generous travel allowances for public transport compared to private transport;  Car lease arrangements in ECNL that limits to cars in emission A/E category, categories F and G are excluded since 2008;  Use of green (100% renewable) electricity, as of January 1st, 2010;  Replacing of all desk top computers by Citrix, reducing energy use of individual desktop units from 350-500 watts (PC) to 11 watts;  Improved the cooling installation of the central computer room, reducing power use by 30%;  Switched to lower energy use LCD monitors, from CRT monitors;  Use a certified recycling company for IT equipment, this ensures that old IT hardware is either re-purposed for re-use (i.e. in third world countries) or recycled according to laws and regulations.  Compliance with legal requirements relating to air-conditioning maintenance, the municipality and development of an energy savings plan.  Sustainability house rules for employees included in induction and periodically promoted around the office. Sustainability house rules 1. Don't waste energy Turn off your monitors, pc’s and other electronic equipment when not in use, for instance if you are in a meeting or if you go outside for lunch. 2. Take responsibility for your workspace Keep it tidy, don’t leave your personal work stuff on the desk but put it in cupboards, lockers etc. Flex desks should be flex, not stacked with papers and cups. 3. Don't waste paper Don’t print emails and documents unnecessarily. Print double sided and preferably two pages per side. Also, be aware of what you actually print. Printing an email without checking first may mean you're printing a long chain of messages and reactions, with various disclaimers etc. 4. Help us separate waste Please use the plastic, paper and glass waste facilities that are available on floors and in the basement. Old batteries and electronic equipment can be handed in at the ICT helpdesk. Ecorys NL CSR 15 5. Promote our CSR goals: Many of our clients expect or even demand of us that we have an active CSR policy. Put information on our CSR policy in your proposals and contracts. Downloadable Dutch and English declarations are available in the CSR section on the intranet. 6. Office paper complies with FSC We only buy and use FSC or equivalent office paper in our Dutch offices. We also aim to produce our brochures, review etc. on FSC or equivalent paper. 7. We compensate our CO2 footprint for flights We offset our CO2 footprint for flights, our biggest environmental impact, by buying VER’s (Verified Emission Reductions, or 'carbon credits'). 8. We promote the use of public transport In our route descriptions and on our website we state this and we provide information on public transport first, followed by info on travelling by car. The route description also provides information on our bike storage facility (Rotterdam). Furthermore we promote the use of ICT tools (video conferencing etc.) over air travel. 9. We buy locally when possible Local procurement helps local business and keeps unnecessary transports (emissions and pollution) down. 10. We keep energy use as low as possible Because many of us use pc's and related equipment for much of the day and many of us spend much time in the office, we have a relatively high energy consumption. We strive to lower this as much as we can. Achievements and Actions in 2010 Significant progress was made in implementing our environmental policy in 2010, including:  ISO14001 Certification – following significant efforts by the CSR team and support from all at Ecorys NL, we have had our environmental management systems certified to ISO14001 from February 2011.  Offsetting of flight emissions – 945.32 tonnes of CO2 were offset for all of our flights in 2010, through purchase of Verified Emission Reductions (VERs). All emissions from flights will be automatically offset through a ‘Green Seats’ programme with our travel agent in 2011.  Information campaigns within Ecorys to promote energy efficient behaviour i.e. switch off monitors.  Consumption of office supplies investigated and changes made based on this.  Improved the visibility of bicycle garage for visitors.  Standard contracts adjusted to include clause for subcontractors to act in an environmentally responsible manner – in accordance with Ecorys policy.  All paper is now certified for sustainability (FSC, PEFC or other).  Switched standard black and white printing paper from 80g / m2 paper to 70g / m2 paper in March 2011.  Standard text introduced for proposals highlighting our commitment and certification to ISO14001.  Added standard email signature “please don’t print this email”.  Website directions to Ecorys give preference to public transport options.  Establishing liaison with Ecorys UK and their environmental policy initiative to promote cooperation, learning and consistency. 16 Ecorys NL CSR  Reduced the number of physical IT servers through use of server virtualisation. We now have 8 virtual servers, which together host up to 50 server operating systems. In the past this would have meant running 50 physical servers. This not only reduces maintenance and hardware investment costs, but also reduces power output and the need for more cooling equipment. 4.1.2 Impact Our first attempt to calculate our carbon footprint was carried out in 2007 and the exercise has been repeated since. The table below charts our progress from 2007-2010 and shows how our activities translate into our carbon footprint. This shows how our carbon footprint has fallen in each year, and in 2010 was only 19% of the footprint in 2007. The primary reasons for this change are the actions we have taken to switch to renewable energy in the Rotterdam office and to purchase carbon offsets for our flights, the activity with the highest footprint. It should be noted that these estimates carry some significant margins of error due to the availability and timeliness of data – the single biggest item subject to this is the estimate of business travel using public transport (trains, metro, trams, buses), for which no reliable, easily accessible data is recorded.

This trend has faltered in the final period, 2009-10 with the decrease in turnover, not being equally reflected in decreased energy use and travel . The move to offsetting and green electricity is offsetting this 18 Ecorys NL CSR impact, but we should also carefully monitor this trend into 2011 and consider how to manage and mitigate further increases. Other points of interest We now use 100% renewable electricity in the Rotterdam office which minimises the environmental impact. Yet energy use still has an environmental impact, through the disruption and emissions caused in building and running the renewable energy power stations. In addition it also has a financial impact to the company. For these reasons it remains important to be more efficient in our energy use where possible, so please remember to switch off lights, monitors and other equipment when not in use. Interesting fact: It has been estimated that 32.1 KWh of electricity are required each year to store one Gigabyte of data. The energy use of our server room has increased from 44 354 KWh in 2005 to 80 717 KWh in 2010, almost doubling, despite the excellent work by the ICT team to reduce energy use and improve efficiencies. Server energy use now accounts for over 10% of our total electricity use. Obviously we need to store our work and the size of this will grow naturally over time, but next time please think to spend 10 minutes when a project is finished to delete unnecessary files, emails etc; to save space. You’ll be saving energy, money and the environment at the same time too. 4.2 Actions for 2011-12 In line with our commitment to continual improvement of our environmental performance the following actions have been prioritized for 2011-2:  Strive to improve our environmental management system, by: Developing processes and monitoring systems, i.e. data gathering for impact estimates. Commit to updating our environmental aspect register on a quarterly basis  Investigate options to improve energy efficiency in the office – implement these where possible.  Better link our CSR policy and ISO certification to our work on sustainability and environmental issues, by: Buildings links between the CSR and Sustainability (Duurzaam) working groups. Integrating environmental impact into project thinking by revising internal project evaluation form. Issuing regular press releases on relevant sustainability related work.  Improve our internal and external communications, by: Carrying out a new range of awareness raising campaigns to promote and incentivise sustainable choices – target at least one promotion each quarter. Improving the range of CSR information available on both the Ecorys NL website and the intranet – make information clearer and have sustainability link on homepage. Contributing environmental performance to Ecorys annual report. Hold a ‘knowledge sandwich / broodje kennis’ to update on progress of the CSR team. Promote and communicate our sponsorship of the RSM chair (Gail Whiteman). Develop standard text for proposals explaining and promoting our offsetting policy. Work with other groups on developing integrated newsletter – e.g. quality group  We will investigate the possibilities to upgrade our IT and communications equipment to enhance the possibilities for video conferencing – to reduce air travel where it is not necessary.  Evaluate low emission lease car policy. Ecorys NL CSR 19  Investigate the need and resources for an external assessor to carry out an energy assessment.  Benchmark our carbon footprint against other, similar companies. 4.3 CSR and ISO 14001 Ecorys’s environmental management system (EMS) was certified to ISO14001 in February 2011. This was a significant achievement for our environmental management systems and is based around the 4 step ISO14001 system: Plan => Do => Check => Act! This plan forms one of the key aspects of this process, it’s initial development the planning stage and its updates as part of the check and act stages. This plan presenting our achievements for the previous period and the outcomes from review of these achievements in terms of future actions and objectives. The ISO14001 system is an important framework for our environmental management system. It provides structure and guidance for our system and the certification process is a driver to meet the high standards we set ourselves. With this in mind it is important that we are aware of our own policy, our responsibilities and actions. The intranet provides a key resource in this aspect, with information on CSR located from the home page through the link NL: CSR/ISO 14001. Please check this if you are not sure of anything. At the heart of any ISO 14001 certified environmental management system is:  Environmental policy – to have one and have commitment to it and continual improvement  Environmental aspects – understanding, managing and monitoring of our main environmental impacts  Legal compliance – meeting all relevant environmental legislation  Objectives and targets – setting and meeting environmental objectives and targets  Environmental management – to have a system and procedures in place to manage company environmental performance  Structure and responsibility – environmental management is structured and has defined roles and responsibilities, with ability to deal with change and preparedness for incidents or emergencies  Training, awareness and competence – staff are aware of the system and receive appropriate guidance and, where appropriate, training  Communication – internal and external of policy, actions, achievements  Documentation & document control – to keep and maintain records related to the environmental management system  Monitoring and measurement – to understand impacts and detect areas of weak or strong performance to take appropriate action  Audit – the system is audited internally and externally  Management review – the system is subjected to review at management level to maintain its suitability and effectiveness Our system is designed to be compliant in all these areas to deliver effective environmental management for Ecorys NL. 20 Ecorys NL CSR 5 Ecorys as a socially responsible workplace 5.1 Our performance 5.1.1 Implementation Existing measures in Ecorys Ecorys has a set of corporate values that is very much employee oriented, aiming to create a fair and just workplace with equal opportunities for all. The fact that the company aims to be majority owned by the majority of staff is an important part of this. A large part of the proceedings of our work eventually goes to our staff, however always taking the long term continuity of the company into account. More about the benefits package of Ecorys is available through the intranet and contract details. More important for corporate social responsibility to employees of Ecorys is our commitment, beyond meeting all relevant legal requirements, to our own ethical code and providing a workplace that all employees are happy with. Company policies and actions to achieve these goals and include:  All new employees receive an induction program after a couple of months. CSR in Ecorys is also part of the content.  Behavioural code, procedure for complaints and the whistle blowers’ regulation.  Confidential counsellor support.  Active anti-RSI support, through inductions and provision of equipment and software as appropriate.  Training programmes and support for staff. Achievements and Actions in 2010 Progress was made in improving the Ecorys workplace, conditions and benefits in 2010, including:  The bicycle plan has been extended for employees who live more than 15 km from Ecorys and use the bicycle for transportation to the train or bus.  HRM has launched the page Fit & Fun on intranet. Fit & Fun gives a range of useful information about vitality and health for Ecorys employees.  A check on the yearly RI&E round. (RI&E is a document that describes all possible risks for employees in the field of Safety, Health and Wellbeing). 5.2 Actions for 2011-12 Overall we should assess on which topics we can improve ourselves against “best practices”. As a company we have a general commitment to improving our practices in line with our CSR policy, this includes employee benefits and other workplace issues The following specific actions can be identified at this stage:  Introduction of a new set of competences Ecorys wide based on the ‘CREDO’ values. Ecorys NL CSR 21  Introduction of a new appraisal and evaluation system. This system to stimulate greater feedback and enable better appraisal and planning of training and development.  Introduction of a formal personal development plan. Juniors (up to consultant) to be obliged to fill in this form in 2011. Employees with the functions senior consultant of higher are obliged to fill in the personal development plan in 2012.  Progress in greater harmonisation of labour conditions Ecorys-wide. 22 Ecorys NL CSR 6 Ecorys and wider social responsibility 6.1 Our Performance 6.1.1 Implementation The previous years’ social responsibility plan update by the ITP came to the conclusion that we were only at the beginning of acting responsibly in this domain. Progress has been made since then with the following existing measures identified: Existing measures In ECNL, while there is no formal socially responsible procurement policy, in practice, our larger purchasing decisions (e.g. in 2009 buying our new furniture) have a CSR consciousness. Achievements and Actions in 2010 Progress was made in implementing socially responsible procurement policy in 2010, particularly by the catering team, with an increasing focus on more sustainable and fair trade options in office food and drink consumption. Progress includes:  Sustainable and organic food produce provided each day in canteen.  Move towards local (Rotterdam) source suppliers (bakers, butchers, other).  Decision taken to not source certain endangered or unsustainably sourced foods, e.g. Tuna, eel.  Catering and cleaning contractors also in process of ISO 14001 certification.  80% of tea and coffee now either sustainably sourced and/or Fair Trade.  Switched from plastic to sustainably sourced wooden stirring sticks.  Sugar 100% sustainably sourced.  Paper towels are made from 100% recycled paper.  Now use ecologic type cleaning materials. 6.2 Actions for 2011-12 It is clear our focus has been quite narrow and internal to this point. There remains room for improvement in this domain. There is a desire to express our social responsibility as an external action in the local community. To this end the following action is one of the central goals of CSR policy for this year. A policy proposal is being drafted to be put into action in 2011-12, watch this space! In addition to this the catering team also wish to continue to push towards sustainable procurement, with cradle-to-cradle thinking underlying their choices and ambitions, which extend to:  Moving towards being a green labelled caterer within 3 years.  To promote sustainable procurement in replacement of catering equipment (e.g. coffee machines, ovens, etc;) when required.
