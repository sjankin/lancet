Income taxes are reported in profit or loss unless the underlying transaction is reported in other comprehensive income or in equity. In those cases, the related income tax is also reported in other comprehensive income or in equity. A current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable for the current or prior years. Deferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet liability method. The calculation of deferred taxes is based on either the differences between the values reported in the balance sheet and their respective values for taxation which are referred to as temporary differences, or the carry forward of unused tax losses and tax credits. Temporary differences related to the following are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition (other than in business combinations) of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associated companies to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. In the calculation of deferred taxes, enacted or substantively enacted tax rates are used for the individual tax jurisdictions. 48 Atlas Copco 2010 1. Continued New and amended IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations The following standards, interpretations and amendments to standards have been issued but have not become effective as of December 31, 2010 and have not been applied by the Group. The assessment of the effect of the implementation of these standards and inter­ pretations could have on the consolidated financial statements is preliminary. • IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (not yet adopted by the EU) deals with classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and with derecognition. The standard requires financial assets to be classified on initial recognition as measured at amortized cost or fair value. Regarding financial liabilities most of the added requirements were carried forward unchanged from IAS 39. However, for financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss, the amount of change in the fair value attributable to effects of changes in credit risk of the liability is recognized in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk on other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 but may be applied earlier. The standard generally requires retrospective application in accordance with IAS 8 but there are several exceptions to this principle and the transitional requirements are extensive. If an entity adopts IFRS 9 for reporting periods beginning before January 1, 2012 it is not required to restate prior periods. The effects of the implementation of IFRS 9 are not yet determined. • Amendment to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement (not yet adopted by the EU) removes unintended consequences arising from the treatment of prepayments when there is a minimum funding requirement. The amendment results in prepayments of contributions in certain circumstances being recognized as an asset rather than an expense. It shall be applied from the beginning of the earliest periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011, but may be applied earlier. It will only have a limited impact on the consolidated financial statements. The following amended IFRS standards and new IFRIC inter­ pretations are not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements: • Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (not yet adopted by the EU) • Revised IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures (2009) • Amendments to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues • IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments • Improvements to IFRSs (May 2010) (not yet adopted by the EU). • Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes (not yet adopted by the EU).

No revenues are disclosed for former Atlas Copco distributors. 3) The acquisiton of the Chinese part of Quincy Compressor was finalized in August after regulatory approvals from Chinese authorities. The above acquisitions were made through the purchase of 100% of shares and voting rights or through the purchase of the net assets of the acquired operations. The Group received control over the operations upon the date of acquisition. No equity instruments have been issued in connection with the acquisitions. All acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of consolidation. The amounts presented in the following tables detail the recognized amounts aggregated by business areas, as the relative amounts of the individual acquisitions are not considered significant. The fair values related to intangible assets are amortized over 5–15 years. For those acquisitions that include a contingent consideration clause, the fair value has been calculated based on an assumed discount rate of 10.5%. The Group is in the process of reviewing the final values for the acquired businesses but any adjustments are not expected to be material.

Profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent 2010 2009 Profit for the year 9 921 6 244 Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent and the basic weighted average ­number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share are calculated based on the profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding and, if dilutive, by adjusting the profit for the year for the difference between cash-settled and equity-settled treatment of options for which employees can choose settlement in shares or cash. The dilutive effects arise from the stock options that are settled in shares or that at the employees’ choice can be settled in shares or cash in the share based incentive programs. The stock options have a dilutive effect when the average share price during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options. The dilutive effect increases in proportion to the increase in the difference between the average share price during the period and the exercise price of the options. The exercise price is adjusted by the value of future services related to the options when calculating the dilutive effect.

This program is, therefore, considered anti-dilutive and is not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. If the average share price exceeds the strike price in the future, these options will be dilutive. 60 Atlas Copco 2010 12.

Management’s judgment also considers rapidly changing market conditions which may be particularly sensitive in customer financing operations. Additional information is included in section Credit Risk in note 27. Inventory obsolescence The Group values inventory at the lower of historical cost, based on the first-in, first-out basis, and net realizable value. The calculation of net ­realizable value involves management’s judgment as to over-stock articles, out-dated articles, damaged goods, handling and other selling costs. See note 16. Legal proceedings In accordance with IFRS, the Group recognizes a liability when Atlas Copco has an obligation from a past event involving the transfer of ­economic benefits and when a reasonable estimate can be made of what the transfer might be. The Group reviews outstanding legal cases regularly in order to assess the need for provisions in the financial statements. These reviews consider the factors of the specific case by internal legal counsel and through the use of outside legal counsel and advisors when necessary. To the extent that management’s assessment of the factors considered are not reflected in subsequent developments, the financial statements could be affected.

The annual accounts and the consolidated accounts are included in the printed version of this document on pages 12-97. The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for these accounts and the administration of the company as well as for the application of the Annual Accounts Act when preparing the annual accounts and the application of international financial reporting standards IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the Annual Accounts Act when preparing the consolidated accounts. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the annual accounts, the consolidated accounts and the administration based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the accounts. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and their application by the Board of Directors and the President and significant estimates made by the Board of Directors and the President when preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as well as evaluating the overall presentation of information in the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts. As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from liability, we examined significant decisions, actions taken and circumstances of the company in order to be able to determine the liability, if any, to the company of any Board member or the President. We also examined whether any Board member or the President has, in any other way, acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion set out below. The annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and give a true and fair view of the company’s financial position and results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Sweden. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the Annual Accounts Act and give a true and fair view of the group’s financial position and results of operations. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts. We recommend to the annual general meeting of shareholders that the income statements and balance sheets of the parent company and the group be adopted, that the profit of the parent company be dealt with in accordance with the proposal in the administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the President be discharged from liability for the financial year.
