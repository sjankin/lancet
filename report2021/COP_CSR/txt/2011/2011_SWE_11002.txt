Services include technical support, maintenance services, condition monitoring and training. SKF was founded in 1907 and grew at a rapid rate to become a global company. As early as 1920, the ­company was well established in Europe, North and Latin America, Asia and Africa. Today, SKF is ­represented in more than 130 countries. The company has more than 100 manufacturing sites and also sales companies supported by about 15,000 distributor locations. SKF also has a widely used ­e-business marketplace and an efficient global distribution system. SKF groups its technologies in five platforms: Bearings and units, Seals, Mechatronics, Services, and Lubrication Systems. By utilizing capabilities from all or some of the platforms, SKF develops tailor-made offers for each customer segment, helping customers improve per­formance, reduce energy use and lower total costs, while bringing increased added value to SKF. SKF does business mainly through three divisions: Industrial Division and Service Division, servicing industrial original ­equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and aftermarket customers respectively, and ­Automotive Division, servicing automotive OEMs and aftermarket customers. SKF operates in around 40 customer segments, whereof examples include cars and light trucks, wind energy, railway, machine tool, medical, food and beverage and paper industries. The Group has global certification to IS0 14001 (environmental management systems) and OHSAS 18001 (health and safety) standards. Its operations are also certified to either ISO 9001 or applicable ­customer industry standards, e.g. ISO/TS 16949 (automotive), AS9100 (aviation) or IRIS (railway) for ­quality management systems. The Group’s efforts in research and development have resulted in numerous innovations, forming bases for new standards, products and solutions in the bearing world. In 2010, the number of first filings of patent applications was 251. 2 This is SKF New long-term financial targets were set in October 2010.

Within each of these four cornerstones, key focus areas and targets are defined to drive continuous performance improvement. BeyondZero is a commitment, launched in 2005, stating that SKF is to realize business objectives in such a way that negative environmental impact resulting from our operations is minimized, while positive impact achieved through the use of our solutions by customers is enhanced. BeyondZero goes beyond traditional practice of reducing negative impact by striving for an overall positive environmental impact. BeyondZero influences SKF’s development of products and solutions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is by far the most significant greenhouse gas generated as a result of SKF’s operations. Therefore, the Group has set a target to reduce CO2 emissions by a minimum of 5% annually, irrespective of production volume. 3 President’s letter In 2010, we operated in an improving world economy in nearly all areas of our business, geographically as well as from an industry viewpoint.

SKF’s Six Sigma activities and projects continued to mainly focus on reducing inventories and costs in 2010. As sales volumes rose over the year, an increasing number of projects were also geared towards expanding production capacity and improving availability of products. The combination of SKF Six Sigma and Manufacturing Excellence has led to a successful concept of escalating cases of failures or complex problems discovered in the workplace, as a daily part of the Manufacturing Excellence program, to be tackled by Six Sigma project teams. This leads to permanently eliminating discovered deviations. Over 40% of all SKF Six Sigma improvement projects in the Group are in non-manufacturing processes. A combination of Lean and Six Kits for the vehicle service market, SKF Vehicle Parts Sigma methodologies and tools, as part of SKF Six Sigma, has proved in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Administration Report • Sensitivity analysis 23 SKF – the knowledge engineering company SKF has been a leading technology provider for more than 100 years and is increasing its investment to maintain this leadership. SKF’s fundamental strength is its ability to continuously develop technologies, products and services that enhance competitive advantages for its customers while giving the right return on investment for its share­holders. This is achieved by both investing in core technology areas and by combining the knowledge across the SKF technology platforms – Bearings and Units, Seals, Mechatronics, Services and Lubrication Systems – to develop value propositions for the different industries and customers around the world. It is also built on the foundation of a commitment to develop SKF’s employees and its corporate culture. SKF’s offer has evolved over many years from primarily being based on different types of bearings to products and services from all five technology platforms including advanced unitized modules, integrating the knowledge and capabilities from the different SKF platforms. A key driver of SKF’s technology development today is an increased focus on developing products and services which improve efficiency and reduce energy losses thereby helping to reduce the environmental impact both in its operations and for its customers. SKF’s vision is “To equip the world with SKF knowledge”. To take the knowledge from over 100 years of operation to develop and deliver products, services and solutions which enable customers to develop their businesses successfully and profitably. SKF knowledge can be defined as the combination of the following three dimensions: The geographic dimension The customer dimension The competence dimension – global and local presence – industries and segments – ­technology platforms SKF is a global company with a local presSKF’s customers can be found in lots of SKF’s five technology platforms are ence, which has primarily been in place industries and industry segments, currently Bearings and Units, Seals, Mechatronics, since the early years of the SKF Group. defined as around 40 specialized segments.

The markets for actuation and motion control rebounded in 2010 especially in key segments like semiconductor and machine tools and are estimated to be worth around SEK 65 billion worldwide. Almost half of the market is in Asia, one third in Europe and the remainder in North and Latin America. The market consists of many suppliers with different backgrounds and offers; from producers of basic mechanical compon-ents to specialists in motors, software or controls. Largest competitors are LINAK, Denmark, in the actuator business and THK, Japan, in the linear motion area. There is a clear industrial trend towards a higher use of mechatronic solutions driven by increasingly stringent demands on reliability, flexibility, cost of ownership, energy efficiency and environmental impact. SKF provides a comprehensive range of mechatronic components, modules and sub-systems for many industrial and consumer appli­ cations, offering extensive customer benefits. SKF focuses primarily on the oil and gas industry, medical industry and factory automation. SKF is a leading supplier for actuation systems, roller screws and magnetic bearings including controllers, motor drives and high-speed motors.

Ultimately, for the Service Division, it is not just about delivering Expanding the knowledge infrastructure value – but doing so consistently, day in and day out. To serve our customers better, the first SKF Solution Factory was inaugurated in 2008, combining the full range of SKF’s expertise within technology platforms with workshop facilities, thereby providing customized service and solutions. In 2010 the network of Solution Factories rapidly grew – by the end of the year there were 17 spread around the world. One of many companies that benefited from a Solution Factory in 2010, was drive automation company SEW-Eurodrive. The company sent a number of spindles of different designs to the SKF Solution Factory in Tianjin, China for reconditioning. In comparison to sending spindles to Europe, the benefits to SEW are expected to be almost 50% reduced costs, and more than 50% savings on “repair cycle time”. Many Solution Factories have functioned as a knowledge hub for distributors to bring their customers to, and see with their own eyes the full palette of SKF knowledge. One of our biggest distributors brought about 250 customers to its local SKF Solution Factory.

In Europe, we received new fork seal orders for off-road motorcycle front suspensions from WhitePower Suspension Austria. The seal improves fork performance in terms of reduced friction and enhanced dirt protection in off-road applications, as well as minimizing stick-slip effects. This seal also plays an important role in enhancing comfort and feel when riding a motorcycle. Electrical segment In 2010, we launched a new application called the SKF Drum Support Unit, a value-adding solution for front-loading washing machines. This solution reduces energy consumption by using energy-efficient bearings, low friction seals and enabling exact alignment of the shaft. Another benefit is the mechanical integration of the drum and the water container. Tests started with a major European OEM in 2010. In Europe, we are currently the largest supplier of the bearing and sealing solutions for the washing machines of Whirlpool Europe.

SKF Sustainability Report • SKF Care 125 Business Care Business Care encompasses the development of shareholder value, delivering high quality products and services to customers, ethical business conduct, responsible demand chain and environmental technology development. SKF’s overall financial objective is to create value for its shareholders, see page 21. This objective must be delivered by the business in accordance with the principles defined by SKF Care. SKF’s strategic focus on customer, technology, manufacturing and markets can be found in the section – SKF – the knowledge engineering company, page 24. The following section covers the processes in place to enforce the SKF Code of Conduct and other Group-defined policies at SKF and with its business partners. International as well as other internally determined fraud risk ­parameters. The fraud risk assessment is mainly used for determining the legal units to be audited. The roll-out of the fraud awareness training initiated by Group Audit in 2008 continued during 2010. The training covers different types of fraud, fraud risk management and SKF’s whistle-blowing policy. Financial managers and local management must participate in the training. The Group takes all allegations and complaints submitted seriously. Assessments and investigations are carried out immediately. For more significant cases, external auditors are assigned to the investigation. One confirmed case of fraud was discovered in 2010. As a result of this case, one SKF employee was dismissed. The SKF Code of Conduct was issued in 2002 and was updated and re-launched in 2007 in a new publication called the SKF Commitment. Available in eighteen languages, the SKF Commitment covers SKF’s Vision, Mission, Drivers, Values and Code of Conduct.

Conveyors spanning many kilometers are typically used to move mined material and around 6,000 bearings are needed to support a single kilometre. The friction in each bearing adds to the energy which must be provided by the ­driving motors. Working with customers’ engineering teams and maintenance departments during 2009 and 2010, SKF’s engineers were able to demonstrate the value of the SKF E2 bearing solution in energy and carbon savings. As a result SKF has won significant new business replacing less efficient solutions in locations from Inner Mongolia to Hunan. SKF’s solution saves over 400 tonnes of CO2 in a typical 6.3 km installation over a five-year period. 128 Sustainability Report • Business Care savings as well as reduced environmental impact for the Group and its Marketing and communications customers.

Sustainability Report • Business Care 129 Environmental Care It is broadly recognized that industrial activities result in a negative impact on the environment. SKF’s BeyondZero strategy aims at breaking this link by providing SKF’s customers with innovative products and solutions that realize environmental gain. Nevertheless, the Group’s fundamental commitment to constant action to reduce the environmental impact from its own operations has long informed the company’s strategy and will continue to do so going forward. landfills, most of which have not been used for many years. The majority of these cases concern so-called Superfund sites in the US. In most of these cases, SKF USA was one of many companies contributing to waste disposal at landfill sites in the past and SKF’s share is generally very low – a few per cent or less. Apart from that, a few ongoing remedial activities are being carried out in Italy for soil and ground water contamination. Relevant provisions have been made to cover these costs. Two SKF units also paid penalties in 2010 to the environmental authorities for minor non-compliances. Before any acquisitions or divestments an environmental due ­diligence assessment is carried out to determine whether a clean-up is required. Potential liabilities identified by a preliminary (Phase I) investigation may be subject to a further (Phase II) investigation.

The factory will provide the rapidly expanding Russian rail network with latest technology axle bearings and services. As part of the Group’s evaluation of the LEED standard for new constructions, it was decided to follow this standard and aim for certification in the project (along with other projects in India and the US). The end result was that in 2010 the facility was awarded Gold level certification – the first in Russia, and the first for a factory in Europe.

The provisions of this regulation came into force in June 2007. SKF is predominately a downstream user (as opposed to a producer) of chemicals as defined in the regulation and is complying by communicating both up and down the supply chain. This is to ensure that chemicals used in SKF’s products and manufacturing are registered and safe for use. A designated steering group was formed to communicate REACH demands inside and outside the company. This includes supplier contacts to verify compliance regarding use of chemical substances, and customer contacts to ensure compliance of SKF’s products and activities.

Human rights and labour standards Upholding and protecting human rights principles and labour standards are of the utmost importance to SKF. Formulating business ethics into official documents enables systematic compliance assessment and risk identification. Consequently, SKF published the SKF Code of Conduct in 2002, covering its responsibilities towards its stakeholders and the policy is applicable to all operations worldwide. The policy has also been used as a reference to establish other documents such as the SKF Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Sub-contractors, and the SKF Code of Conduct for Distributors, demanding similar high levels of commitment from business partners. For more information about the SKF Code of Conduct and adherence to international principles and charters, please see pages 125 and 126. A Code of Conduct compliance audit was established in 2004 with the aim of ensuring that SKF units globally have sound monitoring systems in place for complying with this policy.

Training plans for the employee’s People and Business Excellence. On-site gym for SKF employees Following the sustainability training programme in 2006, one reoccurring idea from UK employees based in Luton was an on-site gym. The local ­sustainability team took responsibility for the idea, which clearly supported the company’s commitment to Employee Care and well-being. In April 2008 the Luton gym was opened; available 24/7 and free for all Luton-based employees and contractors. The gym has been a huge success and changed the way employees use their time around working hours. The Luton Sports Committee was set up as a result, to ensure that the gym remained a fun and safe environment. The Committee has also provided other fitness activities during working hours including yoga, badminton and table tennis. It is clear that more Luton employees are choosing to incorporate some physical activity into their working day. Access to fitness centre, on-site or through third parties, is also offered in other countries such as Sweden, Germany, and Austria. 140 SKF Sustainability Report • Employee Care Community Care With over forty thousand employees globally, and more than one third in Central/Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East and Africa, SKF invests strategically in these regions in terms of technology, capacity and helping people to progress. Providing safe, long-term employment to employees and being a ­responsible corporate citizen in local communities is essential, and SKF’s long-term commitment and ­aspiration is to find ways of growing and developing with local communities. This commitment is clear from the wide range of Community Care programmes deployed by SKF throughout the world, for promoting education, health, sports, and helping the less fortunate. the children and providing families in the country with basic necessities such as food and medical care, were SOS Children’s Villages’ top priority. A similar magnitude earthquake hit Chile about a month later. SKF units in nearby countries provided immediate help by sending food, clothes or monetary support. During the summer, the Czech Republic suffered severe flooding. SKF’s unit in this country donated SEK 20,000, and ten employees volunteered, providing help to the local residents in Chrastava, one of the cities badly damaged by the flood.
