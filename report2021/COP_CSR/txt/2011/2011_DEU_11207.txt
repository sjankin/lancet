Indeed the progress made in the 2009 fiscal year, a year in which the Company managed to generate a very robust balance sheet in the face of numerous challenges, provided an excellent foundation for the fiscal year ended: helped along by measures to reduce costs and boost productivity, by further gains in market share and by the general improvement in the economic environment, Infineon grew revenue by 51 percent to 3.3 billion euros and posted a net income of 660 million euros in the 2010 fiscal year. This means that we grew considerably more strongly than the semiconductor market as a whole and that our return on capital employed was well ahead of our capital costs. Our consistency and our successful restructuring and refinancing, as well as successful activities in the market, have enabled us to emerge from the crisis not just intact, but genuinely stronger and more capable. The Supervisory Board and Management Board will propose a dividend of 10 eurocents per share at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in February 2011 in order that you, our shareholders, might also share in this success. We intend to make sure the success of the last two fiscal years does not end here. Our choice of title for this year’s Annual Report, “Turning Potential into Value”, underlines the importance we attach to building on the improvements already apparent in our financial indicators and reinforces the fact that, for us, the 2010 fiscal year too was just another step on the path to realizing sustained long-term success and further increases in value for our owners – that is to say for you our shareholders. Our pursuit of these lasting, long-term value gains is organized around a series of companyspecific strategic principles adopted by us as the basis for an ever more competitive Infineon. Some of these principles stem from our historical strengths, while some are completely novel (further details maybe found in subsequent sections of this Annual Report): 1. The focus areas – energy efficiency, mobility and security: The Company’s activities concentrate on the focus areas of energy efficiency, mobility and security. All three are of enormous importance for society as a whole and hence have the capacity to drive above-average growth over the long term. 2. Focus on target markets: The priority attached to the key issues drives growth in semiconductor solutions in the automotive sector, in industrial applications and in chip cards and security technologies. Our three divisions, Automotive, Industrial & Multimarket and Chip Card & Security, ensure that our organization is perfectly aligned with these very target markets, enabling us to make optimal use of their vigorous growth and bring the Company’s innovative prowess to bear where the rewards are greatest. 3. Technological core competencies: We have stolen a march on our competitors in the fields of analog and mixed-signal circuits, embedded control and power semiconductors, and are creating further differentiation through our proprietary manufacturing processes. Now we are working simultaneously to enhance our position as technology leader in these demanding disciplines and to capitalize on this edge in the form of concrete competitive advantages, increased growth and stronger margins. 4. System know-how: Our extensive knowledge of the overall systems in which our semiconductors are used and our wealth of technical experience in advising system producers are helping us to become the preferred partner of the automotive industry. This is true for today’s technology and even more so in relation to the conceptual design of future hybrid and electric vehicles. Working in conjunction with customers in industry, we are defining inverters for solar power generation, IGBT modules for highspeed trains and LED drivers for future lighting solutions. Not only that, but we have also created the next security standard for passports, identity cards and the like with our new Integrity Guard concept. The net result of all of these achievements are exceptional customer relationships leading, in turn, to an increased share of the relevant markets. Targeting the Company’s efforts according to these principles enables us to survive and prosper in the face of stiff competition. The foundation for the successful implementation of these principles is a good management team. Our management team has helped us successfully negotiate the difficulties of recent years. Collectively we have resolved to continue developing our leadership skills in order to be ready for the future. Key priorities in the coming years will be: to decentralize entrepreneurial initiatives, set ambitious targets, respond faster by slimming down our processes, and in this way steer our employees and the Company to longterm success. Thanks to consistent portfolio management, moreover, we have been able over the last 18 months to give Infineon an even tighter focus on relatively stable growth areas and less volatile sectors where we have a leading market position. This realignment led in the 2010 fiscal year to the completion of the sale of the Wireline Communications business and the signing of a contract providing for the sale of the mobile phone business of the Wireless Solutions segment to Intel. Infineon is currently the world market leader in each of the three remaining areas – automotive, industrial electronics and security – and enjoys excellent prospects in these markets in terms of both growth and profitability. This then is the strategic foundation on which we are now building. Pleased as we are with the results for the fiscal year ended, what we really want with this foundation is to create sustainable value for the long term and to this end we have come up with simple yet ambitious objectives: On the back of annual revenue of around four billion euros, our aim in the medium term is to achieve a gross margin in the low 40 percent range and a Segment Result margin of more than 15 percent. We want to leverage our high earning power in order to maintain a positive cash flow even in economically difficult times and strengthen our ability to make strategically important investments. Our outlook for the 2011 fiscal year, in which we aim for an increase in revenue of almost 10 percent and a Segment Result margin in the mid to high 10 percent range, represents one of the first steps on the way to making this aspiration a reality. Inspired by our strategic principles and objectives we want to realize returns on equity and assets capable of delivering long-term and sustainable gains in value for our shareholders. I am convinced that we can and will achieve these targets. There are good reasons for this confidence: Our target markets, which are crucial to the development of Infineon as a company, are likely to see average annual growth in excess of 10 percent over the longer term assuming general economic conditions remain healthy. We face this growth as the market leader in all of our target markets and so start from a platform of proven success in the historical evolution of what are now core business activities. Driven by a high pace of innovation, prudent investment in world-class production facilities, and continuous optimization of our portfolio and cost structures, our growth should make gross margins of more than 40 percent perfectly feasible. We intend to maintain our strict discipline in respect of overhead expenses, which should as a result rise in step with or slower than revenue. Our overriding aim with these measures is to achieve our margin target for the Segment Result. We would like to emphasize that we have only been able to achieve such significant results with the help of our employees and that our ambitious objectives for the future will only be reached with their continued support. Our employees have remained steadfast and resolute in their commitment and dedication to the future of Infineon through all the trials and hardships thrown up by the uncertainty of the last two years – the entire Management Board wishes to express its sincere gratitude for this outstanding achievement. Now we are beginning to reap the rewards of our labors. Our corporate culture has changed significantly over the last two years and with our employees at all levels we have seized the associated opportunities with both hands to create a company ripe for sustainable long-term success.

Infineon increased its revenue by more than 50 percent year on year in the 2010 fiscal year and improved overall results significantly at the same time. Infineon is thus well-positioned as a profitable, fastgrowing and stable enterprise. 8 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce Strategy and Finance 01 2010 was a successful fiscal year for Infineon: On the basis of revenue of 3,295 million euros from 02 continuing operations, we generated a total Segment Result from continuing operations of 475 million euros, equivalent to a Segment Result margin of 14.4 percent. 03 04 I. Success story continues This means that in the 2010 fiscal year we were able to continue a success story that started back in 2008, when Infineon began to restructure the Company from the ground up and to focus on new business areas that promise above-average growth and margins. By taking various measures 03 throughout the Company, we achieved significant improvement in Infineon’s financial situation and 05 thus greatly increased the Company’s attractiveness for our investors. 06 The process was kick-started in the summer of 2008 with the launch of the IFX10+ cost cutting 07 program, which brought significant cost savings. These savings helped us not only emerge from 08 the economic crisis unscathed and remain a strong player in the semiconductor market, but also to 09 increase our profitability. 10 We have also actively pressed ahead with portfolio management in the last two years: In addition to the deconsolidation of Qimonda in the 2009 fiscal year and the sale of our Wireline Communications business in the beginning of the 2010 fiscal year, an agreement was signed in summer 2010 for the sale of the mobile phone business of the Wireless Solutions (WLS) segment to Intel. By taking these 11 measures we focused Infineon on less volatile, rapidly growing target markets in which we occupy 12 leading market positions. We are in the number one position in the global market in all three remain13 ing core businesses, automotive, industrial electronics and security. Successful capital market measures, which generated more than 900 million euros, also helped us significantly strengthen our 14 balance sheet as of the end of the 2009 fiscal year. 15 16 17 03 Company restructuring drives financial success: Corporate-wide package of measures increases the Company’s profitability 18 • Targeted capacity increase (i.e. Kulim, Malaysia) 19 Management of • A llocation management market upturn 20 21 • Signing of sale of the mobile phone business of the Wireless Solutions Segment (WLS) to Intel Portfolio Management • Sale of Wireline Communications (WLC) • Deconsolidation of Qimonda • Convertible bond (due 2014) Refinancing • Capital increase • Cost savings (e.g. IFX10+) Restructuring I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 9 In the 2010 fiscal year we were able to build on the successes of the previous year and, helped along 01 04 by a sharp recovery in demand, increased our revenue by 51 percent year-on-year to 3,295 million 02 euros. As for our continuning operations, we were able to turn a total Segment Result of negative 03 05 140 million euros into a positive total Segment Result of 475 million euros. Moreover, after a net loss of 674 million euros in the 2009 fiscal year, we generated a net income of 660 million euros in 04 06 the past fiscal year. Free cash flow rose in the 2010 fiscal year to 573 million euros from 274 million euros in the 2009 fiscal year. The net cash position as of the end of the 2010 fiscal year was 1,331 million euros, an increase of 674 million euros compared with the end of the crisis year 2009 (657 million euros). 04 05 05 Development of REVENUE development of segment result from continuing operations from continuing operations € in Millions € in Millions 06 07 1,050 175 171 942 08 885 900 150 138 781 09 750 687 125 609 10 96 600 100 70 450 75 300 50 33 11 150 25 12 0 0 Q4 | FY09 Q1 | FY10 Q2 | FY10 Q3 | FY10 Q4 | FY10 Q4 | FY09 Q1 | FY10 Q2 | FY10 Q3 | FY10 Q4 | FY10 13 14 15 06 Development of Free Cash Flow from continuing operations € in Millions 16 17 236 18 250 185 19 200 173 150 140 20 21 100 50 0 –50 –21 –100 Q4 | FY09 Q1 | FY10 Q2 | FY10 Q3 | FY10 Q4 | FY10 10 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 01 II. Utilize potential – add long-term value 02 We do not, however, see the successful 2010 fiscal year as our final destination, but rather as a 03 milestone on our journey to lasting success for our Company. While in 2010 we achieved a signifi04 cant increase in Infineon’s profitability and further strengthened our balance sheet, we aim not only to generate sustainable profits, but also want our corporate success to become more predictable and less volatile. To achieve this, we tap into potential and skills that are represented by the following four strategic principles. Some have emerged from traditional strengths, while others have been newly defined. Whatever the case, they are intended to help us leverage the potential within the Company and translate it into value added. 05 1. Concentration on the focus areas of energy efficiency, mobility and security 06 Our Company’s activities are focused on the three major challenges facing society: energy efficiency, mobility and security. All three of them offer above-average growth prospects for the long term. 07 08 • Energy efficiency: Energy efficiency plays a key role in modern society. The world’s population 09 is constantly increasing, pushing up global demand for energy. Electricity is becoming the most important energy carrier of the 21st century. Firstly because the supply of fossil fuels is set to 10 decline in the foreseeable future, and secondly because electricity can be transmitted quickly and cost-effectively and can be converted efficiently. Semiconductors from Infineon increase energy efficiency at all stages of the value chain in the energy industry: in the generation, the transmission, and especially the consumption of electrical 11 energy. They form the basis for the intelligent and optimized use of energy in industrial applica12 tions, power supplies for computers and consumer electronics, as well as in automobiles. The use 13 of semiconductors helps reduce CO₂ emissions and thus meet the global climate targets. Increasingly, renewable energies are also used as sustainable sources of energy. All these factors drive 14 our business in the areas of industrial applications as well as automotive electronics. 15 • Mobility: People’s mobility requirements are another major challenge of modern society. This trend 16 strengthens in particular our business with semiconductor solutions for the automotive industry. 17 But increasing urbanization also increases demand for reliable public transport. For a large 18 number of train systems, Infineon supplies the power semiconductors for drive controls, thus 19 facilitating people’s mobility within and between urban centers. We seek to develop ever more compact solutions for high-speed trains, trolley buses, metropolitan trains, and electrically pow20 ered bicycles so that we can offer our customers greater functionality with higher power density. 21 • Security: The demands on secure data systems are constantly increasing, and this benefits Infineon’s business with hardware-based security solutions. Our semiconductors make it possible to uphold the world’s most stringent security standards. They ensure that exchanges of data, financial transactions, logistic systems and border controls are easier to use and maintain, as well as being more secure. Other areas of application are electronic passports, ID documents and payment cards, and increasingly also other security applications that go beyond chip cards. I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 11 2. Company’s focus on target markets 01 The dynamics of the focus areas mentioned above are driving the market growth for semiconduc02 tor solutions in automotive and industrial applications as well as chip card technologies. Through 03 its three divisions, Automotive, Industrial & Multimarket, and Chip Card & Security, the Company’s organization tracks these target markets in order to make optimal use of their growth potential. 04 • Automotive: In its Automotive (ATV) division, Infineon covers the major automotive applications: powertrain, safety and comfort electronics. The semiconductor products required in these applications are microcontrollers, sensors and power semiconductors. With a global market share of 9 percent, Infineon is world number one in the automotive electronics market (source: Strategy Analytics, April 2010). This success is driven by a close working relationship with customers, innovative 05 products and technologies, and system know-how, and one of the best quality assurance programs in the industry. 06 07 • Industrial & Multimarket: Infineon is the only company worldwide to offer power semiconductors and power modules for the entire electrical energy chain, from generation, through transmission, 08 to consumption. These products – in particular IGBT modules, discrete and integrated power semi09 conductors – have been combined under the roof of the Industrial & Multimarket (IMM) division. 10 The product portfolio also includes small-signal transistors and diodes as well as radio-frequency (RF) components and modules with a protective function. Infineon is the world’s number one in power semiconductors with a market share of 11 percent (source: IMS Research, July 2010). 11 • Chip Card & Security: We supply microcontrollers for the SIM cards in mobile phones, security chips for payment cards, and chip-based solutions for passports, ID documents, driver’s licenses, 12 and other official documents. In addition, we develop solutions for applications with strict security 13 requirements, such as pay TV and trusted computing. Our chip solutions, which serve all the above 14 areas of application of our customers, fall under the Chip Card & Security (CCS) division. With a market share of 27 percent, our Company was the global market leader in chips for card applica15 tions in 2009 for the 13th year in succession (source: Frost & Sullivan, October 2010). 16 17 18 19 20 21 12 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 01 3. Technological core competencies 02 We see our technological core competencies in the three disciplines of analog and mixed-signal circuits, embedded control, and power semiconductors. What gives us this confidence is that we have 03 developed special proprietary manufacturing processes for all three disciplines, optimally tailored 04 to the respective circuit requirements. The combination of circuit design know-how and optimized manufacturing processes has made us the preferred semiconductor supplier of many customers. • Analog and mixed-signal circuits: For technical and financial reasons it is often necessary to house not just the digital logic, but, depending on the application, also analog circuit units, such as sensors, interfaces, and power electronics, on one chip. Implementing complex function blocks using leading-edge production technologies enables semiconductor devices to be built that are specifi05 cally tailored to the customer’s requirements. Since fewer components are required, the vulner06 ability of such control systems to faults is reduced. These competencies are used in applications such as our new SPT9 manufacturing process (ninth-generation smart power technology), which 07 allows us to accommodate all the control functionality for a power window lifter on a single chip, 08 for example. 09 • Embedded Control: Embedded control is an application-specific microcontroller integrated on a 10 chip, combined with interface components and a nonvolatile memory (embedded flash). These types of chips can be used to control complex applications by means of software. The challenge is to adapt the computing power of the microcontroller, the combination of the interfaces, and the memory to the customer’s specific application in the most costand energy-efficient manner pos11 sible. Such embedded control solutions are used in microcontrollers for industrial and automotive 12 applications, for example. It is likewise very important in hardware-based security for the require13 ments for the particular area of application to be in perfect balance. In particular in applications using contactless transmission, the trick is to reconcile diverse criteria such as computing power, 14 electricity consumption and security while achieving the lowest cost point each time. 15 • Power semiconductors: Power semiconductors are used to switch and control high currents and 16 high voltages, i.e. high electrical loads. Infineon is the only company in the world to offer power 17 semiconductors and power modules for the entire electrical energy chain, encompassing genera18 tion, transmission and conversion. Maximum efficiency and thus minimum heat generation, as 19 well as compact package design are the hallmarks of our products. A high degree of efficiency and system miniaturization is impossible to achieve without excellent manufacturing technology. The 20 P. 61 global leadership of our thin wafer technology is proof of our top position in manufacturing tech21 nologies for power semiconductors. I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 13 4. System know-how 01 Infineon’s profound understanding of its customers’ semiconductor-based systems is virtually 02 unmatched by other semiconductor manufacturers. 25 years of experience in security chips and 03 around 40 years of systems expertise in automotive and industrial applications have made us the preferred partner of our customers. Here are three examples: 04 Due to the many sensors, control circuits and networked control units, modern passenger cars are already highly complex. For hybrid cars, the combination of combustion engine and electric motor significantly adds to their complexity. Only if the interaction of electric motor and combustion engine is optimized and thus works efficiently can the development and use of this new vehicle category be justified. The same applies to all-electric cars. The main challenges of these two vehicle 05 types are the electric drive motor control, battery management, and the charging unit. We serve all these areas of application, mainly with our power semiconductors but also with microcontrollers and 06 sensors, thus contributing to their optimization. 07 Inverters play an important role in the generation of solar power. They convert the direct current 08 generated in the solar modules into alternating current and feed it into the electricity grid. Although 09 the inverters of our customers already achieve an efficiency rate of more than 90 percent, further 10 improvements are being developed. This is because any increase in efficiency reduces power loss, thus lowering system costs for our customers and increasing their competitive advantage. In close consultation with our customers we supply the power components, such as IGBT, MOSFET and silicon carbide (SiC) components, suited to their inverter topologies. Further efficiency gains at this 11 high level can only be achieved if all the components operate in harmony with one another. 12 A system-wide view is also essential for security-critical applications. Attackers often target the 13 S. 59 weakest link in the chain. It is with this in mind that we have created Integrity Guard, a new secu14 rity standard for official documents, payment cards and the like. With Integrity Guard, the security controller offers comprehensive error detection and complete encryption over the whole data path 15 in the chip. The processor core consists of two units that monitor each other all the time and detect 16 immediately whether or not a computing operation has been performed correctly. Another technical 17 innovation of Integrity Guard is that it uses encrypted data for computing in the processor core itself, thus eliminating one of the weaknesses of conventional security controllers, which unencrypt data 18 before processing it, thus briefly making it visible in plain text and exposing it as a worthwhile target 19 for potential hackers. 20 The strategic principles described earlier are supported by our High Performance Program aimed at 21 turning our Company into an organization of excellence, which delivers outstanding service on a permanent basis and meets or exceeds the expectations of all its stakeholders. Potential for improvement is identified and realized on the basis of selected key projects and with the involvement of employees. In addition to cultural aspects of the consistent excellence claim, it is above all internal structures and processes that are enhanced in key projects. This helps us deal more flexibly with market fluctuations and continue on Infineon’s steady growth path in emerging markets by increasing our focus on regional requirements. 14 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 01 07 our target operating model 02 FY 2009 FY 2010 Target 03 Revenue 2.2 bn € 3.3 bn € ~4 bn € 04 Gross margin 22.8% 37.5% Low 40ies % Segment Result margin (6.4%) 14.4% High teens % 05 06 07 III. Our target operating model 08 As described, our business actions are based on four strategic principles: 09 • We focus on the three major challenges faced by society: energy efficiency, mobility and security. 10 • We align our organizational structure with the target markets in which our customers operate. • T hrough our technological core competencies, we strive to set ourselves apart from the 11 competition. 12 13 • We generate further competitive advantages through our extensive system know-how in the applications addressed by our customers. 14 15 Focusing on our strategic principles is the prerequisite for ensuring sustained profitable operations 16 at a high level. Based on the above, we aim for an operating model that enables us to generate value for our customers on a permanent basis. 17 18 In our target operating model, we have set ourselves an annual revenue target of around 4 billion 19 07 euros, a gross margin in the low 40ies percentage range, and a Segment Result margin in the high teens percentage range. Achieving these financial targets will bring us a return on capital employed 20 that is greater than our average capital costs. 21 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 15 08 development of combined revenue for the automotive, industrial & multimarket and Chip Card & Security segements in the 2000 to 2010 fiscal years € in millions 01 02 03 3,500 compound annual growth rate +6.1% 04 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 05 500 06 0 FY 2000 FY 2001 FY 2002 FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 07 08 09 10 IV.

To highlight the growth and profit prospects of the remaining core business, the chart above shows 11 08 the development of revenue and Segment Result for Automotive, Industrial & Multimarket, and Chip Card & Security. 12 13 As the figure 08 reveals, the average growth rate of Infineon’s three core businesses over the 14 11-year period between 2000 and 2010 is slightly above 6 percent. Apart from the 2009 fiscal year, these segments showed low volatility and were profitable. The operating result of our Industrial & 15 Multimarket segment, for example, was negative in only one out of 44 quarters; the Automotive seg16 ment returned a negative result in only three quarters. 17 18 19 20 21 16 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 01 09 Global automotive, industrial electronics, and chip card semiconductor market $ in billions 02 compound annual growth rate +8.3% 03 120 compound annual growth rate +13.3% 04 100 compound annual growth rate +11.3% 80 3.0 2.8 2.7 2.8 60 2.6 2.5 55.4 2.0 46.3 50.4 40 44.2 34.6 40.0 29.7 20 16.0 15.7 17.0 18.1 19.3 21.0 12.3 0 05 2008 2009 2010e 2011e 2012e 2013e 2014e 06 Automotive semiconductor market Industrial electronics semiconductor market Chip card semiconductor market 07 Source: iSuppli, September 2010 08 09 According to the latest market studies, the growth prospects for the three core businesses are also 10 very positive in the years to come. The following compound annual growth rates are expected for our three target markets for the 09 period 2009 through 2014: 11.3 percent for Automotive, 13.3 percent for Industrial & Multimarket, 11 and 8.3 percent for Chip Card & Security. 12 13 We are the market leader in all three segments and believe that we can manage Infineon in its new core segments in the future so that it is sustainably profitable and less volatile. In the following we 14 provide a more detailed explanation of our confidence for each segment. 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 17 Automotive 01 The 2009 fiscal year was characterized by a collapse in the global economy, a 12 percent decline in 02 10 production in the automotive industry in calendar year 2009, and additionally a 23 percent decrease 03 11 in revenue generated with automotive semiconductors in the same period. 04 The picture that presents itself for the 2010 fiscal year is, however, completely different: The recovery of the global economy means that car production should even exceed the level reached in the pre-crisis fiscal year 2008. The car manufacturers are currently benefiting from growth in China, India, Russia and Brazil – and not, as in the previous year, from government-financed scrapping premiums in Western Europe. The situation has thus turned around completely within a period of twelve months. Moreover, there was particularly strong demand from China and all over the world 05 for higher-end vehicles, in which the value of semiconductors used is higher than average. 06 Growth potential and growth drivers for Automotive 07 Market research company iSuppli expects an average growth rate of 11.3 percent for the automotive semiconductor market for the period between 2009 and 2014, slightly ahead of the corresponding 08 9.0 percent growth rate in car production (source: CSM, November 2010) and the 9.2 percent antici09 pated for the semiconductor market as a whole. 10 We regard the following trends as the main growth drivers in the automotive segment: electrification of powertrain, greater safety and more stringent CO₂ requirements, as well as cost-efficient cars in emerging economies. 11 Electrification of powertrain Electromobility will be one of the most significant developments in the automotive industry in the 12 coming years. According to a study by Boston Consulting, vehicle numbers will double to 2 billion in 13 the next 40 years. Without fully electric drives, the world’s climate will not be able to cope with this 14 increase in motorized transport. Currently, around 30,000 hybrid and 1,600 electric cars drive on Germany’s roads. It is expected that the total number of these types of cars will rise to one million by 15 2020. A mid-range vehicle contains semiconductors worth a total of 300 U.S. dollars; in a hybrid or 16 electric car, the semiconductor content increases by 600 to 700 U.S. dollars, depending on engine 17 capacity and features. Infineon will benefit from being the market leader not only in the automotive semiconductor mar18 ket, but also in power semiconductors – the key components for hybrid and electric drives. Thanks 19 to the comprehensive system know-how of our developers, hardly any of our competitors know the 20 needs of our customers as well as we do. We aim to be the leading chip provider in the future electro­ mobility market. We expect the electromobility segment to generate revenue in the hundreds of 21 millions by the end of the decade. 18 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 01 Electromobility is highly significant for Infineon even outside the car. In this area, Infineon offers 02 microcontrollers, Hall sensors, and special power semiconductors, such as power transistors and voltage regulators. With the 8-bit microcontrollers in the XC800 family for e-bikes, i.e. electrically 03 powered bicycles, Infineon has advanced to a market share of about one third within just three 04 years: Around eight million e-bikes controlled by Infineon semiconductors were sold in 2009 – primarily in China – and the trend is sharply upward. In addition to the Asian market, there is huge potential also in the European market. Greater safety and more stringent CO₂ requirements Greater safety means more sensors that can provide information about a wide variety of safetyrelevant events. Our product focus for safety applications is on airbags, side impact protection, 05 electronic power-assisted steering, seatbelt tensioners, ABS/electronic stability program (ESP), 06 electronically controlled chassis systems, radar-based driver assistance, and tire pressure monitoring. Infineon regards itself as the global market leader in tire pressure sensors and pressure sensors 07 for side-impact airbags. 08 Compliance with more stringent CO₂ requirements (such as the Euro 6 standard already approved 09 in Europe) requires not only more sensor technology, but also more computing power. Turbochargers are used to get higher engine output from engines with smaller cylinder capacities and often also 10 a smaller number of cylinders, while reducing consumption at the same time. Spark ignition and diesel engine downsizing is the name given to this development step. These improvements affect the entire control loop, from the sensors through computing power to the control electronics. This makes processes even more precise: The amount of fuel injected is already measured in milliliters 11 and the control times in microseconds. 12 Our 32-bit AUDO Future and AUDO MAX controllers have been specifically developed to meet the 13 requirements in engine and transmission control applications. Our 32-bit automotive controllers ensure a low-emission drive in every third automobile manufactured around the world. 14 15 Affordable cars in emerging economies 16 In China, each household already has more than one mobile phone. 97 percent of urban households have a washing machine. Over 50 percent of households have a computer. But only 6 percent own a 17 car. An increase in the standard of living has led to significant growth in demand in Asia, above all in 18 China and India. By 2020, there will be more cars on China’s roads than in any other country. 19 Together with our customers we are striving not just to design vehicles that match people’s requirements but also to hit cost targets. For example, we have adapted a variant of our 32-bit 20 TriCore™ family to fit the specific requirements for the emerging markets. 21 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 19 10 worldwide Car production millions of units 01 02 140 03 compound annual growth rate +9.0% 120 04 100 84.2 88.3 78.3 80 69.7 72.4 65.7 57.5 60 40 20 05 0 06 2008 2009 2010e 2011e 2012e 2013e 2014e 07 Source: CSM, November 2010 08 09 11 Automotive semiconductor market $ in billions 10 35 compound annual growth rate +11.3% 30 11 25 21.0 12 19.3 20 17.0 18.1 16.0 15.7 13 15 12.3 14 10 15 5 16 0 2008 2009 2010e 2011e 2012e 2013e 2014e 17 18 Source: iSuppli, September 2010 19 20 Strong customer loyalty, high entry barriers, improved profitability High quality requirements lead to strong customer loyalty and high entry barriers. No new competi21 tor has joined the major market players in the past ten years. The market is divided among European, U.S., and Japanese manufacturers. In 2009, Infineon occupied the number one position in the automotive semiconductor market, with a market share of 9 percent. Our IFX10+ program significantly improved the profitability of this segment. With revenue of 340 million euros in the fourth quarter of the 2010 fiscal year, our Automotive segment generated a Segment Result margin of 17.1 percent. In the fourth quarter of the pre-crisis year 2008, the segment had achieved a margin of 6.7 percent on revenue of 312 million euros. 20 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 01 Industrial & Multimarket 02 According to estimates by market research company iSuppli for the Industrial & Multimarket segment, the pre-crisis level in the market for semiconductors for industrial applications will already 03 be exceeded in the current year. For the period from 2009 to 2014, iSuppli estimates a compound 04 12 annual growth rate of about 13 percent in the market for industrial semiconductors. As an example from the area of power electronics, figure 13 shows the market development pre13 dicted by market research company IMS Research for modules for the variable speed drive control of electric motors in industrial applications – one of the growth drivers of our industrial portfolio. This market is expected to expand at an average rate of 13.0 percent a year. In the area of industrial semiconductors, Infineon offers above all power electronics products, 05 i.e. components, mostly power switches, that are used at different points in the power supply chain 06 for converting and managing currents and voltages and for controlling motors. 07 Growth potential and growth drivers for Industrial & Multimarket 08 Three macroeconomic trends play a key role for our industrial electronics business: the industrial09 ization of emerging economies, global efforts to reduce CO₂ emissions, and the urbanization of metropolitan areas. Electricity, the most important energy carrier of the 21st century, is the focal point 10 of all three trends. Our components play a role wherever electrical energy is generated, transmitted or consumed. Voltages and currents are converted and managed at all these points of the electrical value creation and consumption chains. Based on the three macroeconomic trends, we regard the following as growth areas for our Industrial & Multimarket segment: 11 12 Renewable energies 13 Boosted by national subsidies in Germany granted under the “Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz” (German Renewable Energy Act) and export opportunities due to rapid expansion rates abroad, wind 14 energy is a dynamically growing business area for plant manufacturers, and thus for Infineon as a 15 supplier. Market researcher IHS EER believes that by the end of the year wind turbines with a total 16 output capacity of 190 gigawatts will be installed around the globe. Of this capacity, 35 gigawatts will have been newly constructed in 2010. Further double-digit growth is expected for 2011. For 17 example, 5,000 wind turbines with a capacity of 25 gigawatts are to be built in the German sectors 18 of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea over the next 20 years. Built for maximum reliability, our robust 19 switches, known as IGBT modules, are found in the nose of wind turbines manufactured by com­ panies such as Enercon, Goldwind, Siemens and Vestas, as well as in inverter platforms. 20 In addition, Germany is the world’s largest market for photovoltaics (PV). Around half of the 21 world’s installed PV capacity is built in Germany. For 2011, market research company iSuppli expects this capacity to grow by another 44 percent to 9.5 gigawatts of newly installed capacity, following an expansion of more than 70 percent in 2010. In addition to Germany, the markets in Italy, France, and the United States are also expected to expand sharply. iSuppli forecasts that the global PV market will grow by a healthy 43 percent to 20 gigawatts in 2011. To our customers, which manufacture inverters for feeding solar energy into the grid, we supply IGBT, MOSFET and SiC components. This allows our customers in this sector – such as SMA Solar Technology – to achieve world-record-breaking efficiency levels.

How21 ever, since the occurrence of wind and sun is difficult to forecast and power generation from these sources can therefore be unpredictable and volatile, the integration of renewable energies into the power grid poses the greatest challenge to be faced by the energy sector in the coming years. One problem with integrating renewable energies is that it is not possible to store the generated energy. For the grid to be stable, the amount of energy generated has to match the amount consumed at all times. To ensure this balance, the whole supply grid has to be designed in such a way that conventional power plants can increase or decrease their output quickly, in line with the power consumed in the grid and the power generated from renewable energy sources. 22 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 01 The smart grid, as this new power network of the future is called, requires new power supply lines to 02 be built. In addition to simply transporting energy, this grid will also have to facilitate smooth communication between energy utilities and consumers. A basic component of the smart grid is a digital 03 consumption meter, also known as a smart meter. Smart meters and the corresponding communica04 tion-capable home appliances are the extensions of the smart grid into consumers’ homes. Smart meters send consumption data through the data network and simultaneously inform consumers in real time how much energy they are consuming and what it costs. In all of this, secure, i.e. encrypted, communication that cannot be accessed or manipulated by third parties is an important prerequisite. Infineon offers end-to-end solutions for security as well as for data and energy transmission. In addition to the smart grid, the expansion of conventional power supply grids is also driving 05 demand. This is particularly relevant in emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, China or India, 06 which tend to have long distances between where the power is generated and the fast-growing metropolitan areas where it is consumed. Over long distances it makes sense to use the low-loss 07 technology of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission. HVDC transmission is also used to 08 connect offshore wind farms. It requires the most powerful semiconductor components in Infineon’s 09 portfolio: IGBT modules and bipolar components such as thyristors. Our customers include Siemens and Alstom Grid. 10 Rail transport Rail transport is enjoying a renaissance. Vast new tracks are being built In China, India, Brazil, on the Persian Gulf, in Europe, and even in the United States. 30,000 kilometers of rail track are cur11 rently under planning or construction around the world. In Europe, countries such as Spain and Italy 12 are building high-speed tracks. As part of a huge economic stimulus program, China is investing 13 the equivalent of 80 billion euros in the rail system. The United States is also planning to use funds from its economic stimulus program to expand its rail network with a focus on public transport. New 14 railroad lines are being planned throughout the country, including high-speed lines like those in 15 Europe, for example between Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. 16 The rail renaissance is driven by two factors: Firstly, rail technology has progressed. Not only Europe, but also and in particular Japan provides excellent examples of how fast and easy modern 17 trains can be, especially for medium distances. Simultaneously, time-consuming security checks 18 have made air travel less attractive than it once was. In addition, airports and roads, especially in 19 the major conurbations, are increasingly reaching the limits of their capacity. Virtually all new lines are based on electric trains. This benefits us, because we supply the compo20 nents used in electric drives. Infineon supplies IGBT modules controlling the powerful electric motors 21 to major rail manufacturers like Siemens, Alstom or Bombardier. In Spain, Russia, and – since 2008 – also in China, for example, each Velaro from Siemens, the international equivalent of Germany’s ICE train, has power semiconductors worth between 50,000 and 100,000 euros on board. I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 23 Speed control for electric motors 01 Our power electronics components are also used in speed control of electric motors (variable speed 02 drives – VSDs) in drives, pumps and ventilators. The purpose of VSDs is to match the output of 03 electric motors continuously and exactly to the load. Overall, this uses energy more efficiently and typically reduces power consumption by 30 to 40 percent. The market penetration of VSDs is still 04 very low at present. According to estimates published by ZVEI (Zentralverband Elektrotechnikund Elektronikindustrie e.V., the German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers’ Association), VSDs have a share of 20 percent in Europe and of only 5 percent globally. Although their share in new investments is also still low (in Germany it has edged up to 25 percent), there is a distinct upward trend, because investments have short payback periods due to the rise in energy prices. This sector can look forward to decades of potential growth. 05 For electronic drive speed control, we offer IGBT modules covering a wide power range, from a few hundred watts to megawatts. Our solution offering is complemented by microcontrollers opti06 mized for motor control as well as IGBT driver components. 07 Power supply 08 The power consumption of data centers is approaching that of major cities. Data centers and server 09 farms, which store billions of web pages, e-mails, social contacts, blog entries, images, or videos, 10 have a voracious appetite for electricity. Today, the largest data centers consume between 50 and 100 megawatts of power, equivalent to the consumption of 80,000 households. This has turned electricity into the largest single cost factor in data center operation. Increasing the efficiency of power supplies on the scale that can be achieved with our CoolMOS™ 11 high-voltage power transistors can make a very significant contribution to reducing costs and CO₂ emissions. Power supply efficiency can be further enhanced by introducing digital power manage12 ment in server power supplies in the 500-watt to 1,000-watt category. 13 14 Quality and reliability have made us market leader for the seventh time in succession With a market share of 11 percent, Infineon was the leader in the power semiconductor market for 15 modules and discrete components for the seventh time in succession in 2009. This market share and 16 the fact that our power electronics products are designed with quality and reliability in mind have 17 put us in pole position to benefit from the growth potential in our target markets. Through the IFX10+ program, the Industrial & Multimarket division has also made significant 18 headway toward greater profitability. With revenue of 413 million euros in the fourth quarter of the 19 2010 fiscal year, the division generated a Segment Result margin of 23.7 percent. By comparison, in 20 the fourth quarter of pre-crisis fiscal year 2008, the division had achieved a margin of 17.2 percent on revenue of 325 million euros. 21 24 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S tr ate g y a n d Fin a nce 01 chip Card & Security 02 Market research company iSuppli predicts that the semiconductor market for chip cards will only return to pre-crisis levels in 2011. For the period from 2009 to 2014, iSuppli estimates a compound 03 14 annual growth rate of 8.3 percent. In this segment, Infineon provides security chips for applications 04 such as electronic travel and identity documents, payment cards, contactless electronic tickets for local public transport, SIM cards, as well as for applications such as trademark protection or secure machine-to-machine communication. Growth potential and growth drivers for Chip Card & Security Electronic travel and identity documents, payment cards and embedded security are the main growth drivers of our Chip Card & Security segment. Figure 15 shows the market development up to 05 15 2014 for electronic government identity documents as estimated by market research company IMS 06 Research. For the period from 2009 through 2014, IMS Research expects unit numbers to grow by an average of 10.6 percent per annum. 07 08 Electronic identity documents 09 There is a clear global trend toward the use of security chips in identity documents, which began with the introduction of electronic passports a few years ago. Today, ID documents, healthcare cards and 10 driver’s licenses also have integrated security chips. The security and life cycle requirements of these products are much greater than for high-volume products such as SIM cards. This is why they have higher entry barriers, command higher average selling prices, and are less exposed to price erosion. At the same time this market is one of the fastest-growing areas of application for security chips. 11 12 Payment cards 13 The trend toward secure cashless payments is another driver in the Chip Card & Security segment. For example, only around 20 percent of all EC and credit cards have a security chip – although the 14 trend is clearly upward. 15 Among people living in large cities in rapidly expanding economies, quick and easy payment with 16 contactless cards enjoys increasing popularity. In addition to paying small amounts, these cards can also be used as tickets in local public transport systems. We have identified additional growth 17 potential in the use of near field communication (NFC) technology, which is to facilitate payment by 18 mobile phone – initially for public transport tickets. 19 Embedded security 20 Embedded security enables applications that are intended to prove the authenticity of data or prod21 ucts on the basis of security chips. Large and small firms around the world want to clarify that what they ship to their customers are genuine products, not counterfeits. The products tested for authenticity range from medicines through memories to machine parts. Data authenticity is also critical for the success of the energy supply grid of the future, the smart grid. As explained, smart meters will allow energy utilities to read their customers’ authentic consumption data remotely. Secure data transfer will be a critical factor for their success.

These efforts are complemented by active product portfolio management, as part of which Infineon prioritizes high-growth, more profitable products, while selectively withdrawing from markets that tend to stagnate or generate poorer margins. The focus of the Chip Card & Security division is less on growth and more on improving profitability. Thus, with revenue of 115 million euros in the fourth quarter of the 2010 fiscal year, the division generated a Segment Result margin of 10.4 percent. This compares with a margin of 5.2 percent achieved by the division on revenue of 115 million euros in the fourth quarter of the 2008 fiscal year. 26 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 P ro d u cts a n d Applic ations 01 AT V IMM 02 ms 9% ms 11% 03 04 05 06 1 1 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 1 3 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 CcS WlS ms 27% ms 14% 16 Growth in the market: leading position, high market share (ms) I n f i n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 p r o d u c t s a n d a p p l i c at i o n s 27 Products and Applications Millions of people trust our products daily – whether they‘re aware of it or not.

These are the competencies that have made us the preferred partner of our customers for more than 40 years. Our innovative focus is on integrating functionality, so we are concentrating our attention on semiconductors that provide an outstanding price/performance ratio. We are committed to the future drivers and growth drivers and hence to improved energy efficiency, increased safety and the emerging affordable car segment. Depending on the requirements for powertrain, safety applications or comfort electronics, the most suitable semiconductor solution can be assembled from our product portfolio of microcontrollers, smart sensors and power semiconductors. That is why it is very satisfying that this year, for the first time, we have been honored with Toyota’s coveted award for “exceptional quality maintained over five consecutive years”. CO₂ reduction through downsizing The evolution of conventional internal combustion engines is directed toward a downsizing of spark ignition and diesel engines. Turbochargers enable higher engine performance along with reduced fuel consumption to be achieved from smaller swept volumes and often also from a smaller number of cylinders. These improvements relate to the complete control loop from the sensor system to the computing performance to the drive electronics. As for the engine, further optimization of the combustion process leads to reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions. But it doesn’t stop there: engineers also have their sights set on transmission controllers with the aim of improving shifting sequences. Engineers are also intent on developing “tailor-made” solutions. The objective here is to feed the engine precisely the amount of fuel it needs at a given instant. This happens along the entire delivery chain, from the pump to the fuel injectors and injection pumps – all the processes become even more precise, for the amounts have long been measured in milliliters, the control times in microseconds. This is precision at the highest level, attainable only thanks to the more sophisticated sensor technology and higher computing power of the most cutting-edge automotive semiconductor generations. With a view to future-generation drives and compliance with the most stringent emission and safety standards, we are working with a lead customer on developing the 32-bit P. 59 multi-core microcontroller family AURIX™. The individual cores are required for delivering the necessary computing power and for the redundant calculation of safety-critical processes. Shipments are slated to start in 2014; we have already signed agreements running up to 2028. This project also illustrates the trend toward long product lifecycles in the automobile industry. These lead to a comparatively stable and predictable business. Electrification of the powertrain – also in commercial vehicles Why electrification? As regards the conventional internal combustion engine, we will see further significant progress being made in CO₂ reduction, particularly in subcompact cars. However, only the electrification of the powertrain will lead us to a sustained breakthrough across all vehicle categories. The leaders of the large car-making I n f i n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 P r o d u c t s a n d A p p l i c at i o n s 35 companies are therefore unanimous: Ultimately we will see the all-electric drive. The debate is not about “whether”, but simply about “when”. The trend toward powertrain electrification is also evident in the bus and commercial vehicle sector, particularly where traffic in cities is concerned. The main drivers of this trend are restrictions on entering city centers, such as those already in place in megacities like London and Shanghai. Around 80 percent of the additional semiconductors required for hybrid and electric vehicles are power semiconductors. This is where we benefit from the decades-long experience of the industrial business. Discrete IGBTs and IGBT modules do not need to be developed from scratch: with a few minor modifications they can be adapted to fit the requirements of automotive engineering. This saves on research and development costs. As the number 1 in both automotive electronics and power semiconductors, we are ideally positioned to benefit from the growing hybrid and electric car market. Sensors are vital for active and passive safety Our product priorities for safety applications are focused on airbags, side impact protection, electronic power steering, belt tensioners, ABS/vehicle stability control system (ESP), electronically controlled chassis systems, radar-based driver assistance, and tire pressure monitoring. ESP (Electronic Stability Program) has meanwhile become the most important safety system in the automobile in addition to the safety belt and the airbag. Our partner Bosch developed the first system for series production, and since production started in 1995 it has already produced 50 million systems. We furnish ESP systems with steering angle and wheel speed sensors, as well as other components. Affordable individual mobility In growth regions, too, the automobile has come to epitomize individual mobility. In countries like India and China there is one thing it must be above all else: affordable. But the market for compact and subcompact cars is also becoming increasingly important internationally, in Japan and Europe, for instance. Together with our customers we are striving to design vehicles that both match people’s expectations and meet cost targets. Because of the high volumes involved, we are also turning our attention to two-wheeled vehicles. Two developments are driving the market – particularly in Asia: Firstly, the popular two-strokes must be made more environmentally friendly. Secondly, it has been several years since two-wheelers fitted with internal combustion engines were banned in Beijing. This has given a huge boost to the market for electric bicycles, also known as ebikes, pedelecs or electric scooters. With our industry-leading know-how in the electronics for high-efficiency electric drives, we are also a partner for motorcycle and bicycle manufacturers. 36 I n f i n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 P r o d u c t s a n d A p p l i c at i o n s * For discrete power semiconductors and modules. 19 Division industrial & MULTIMARKET 37 D i v i s i o n I n d u s t r i a l & M u lt i m a r k e t a p p l i c at i o n s Industrial applications 01 Onshore Offshore wind farm 02 02 04 Solar farm 01 / IGBT modules in offshore wind turbine (up to 6 MW) 08 / IGBT modules for drive and recuberation in trams 02 / Thyristors for HVDC undersea cables and local and high-speed trains 03 / IGBT modules in onshore wind turbine (up to 2.5 MW) 09 / CoolMOS™ and OptiMOS™ power transistors in 14 / LE 04 / IGBT modules in PV inverters server power packs 15 / Dri 05 / Lightand electrically-triggered thyristors 10 / Digital voltage regulators in server power packs 16 / IGB 06 / IGBT modules for diesel-electric drives 11 / IGBT modules for fan control in air conditioning system 17 / IGB 07 / IGBT modules for ship electrical system 12 / IGBT modules for escalator motor control 18 / IGB 13 / IGBT modules for elevator motor control suc wind farm 03 High-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission 05 Passenger and cargo ships 06 07 Railways, trains 18 08 08 08 D drivers for LED architectural lighting 19 / LED drivers for traffic lights, street furniture vers for energy-saving light bulbs and fluorescent lamps and street lighting T module for diesel-electric drive in commercial vehicles 20 / Discrete IGBTs and IGBT modules for charging T module for electric drive in electric and hybrid buses electronics at electric charging points T module for electric drive in commercial vehicles 21 / IGBT modules for electric motors in robots, h as fork trucks conveyor belts, drives, etc. 11 High-rise, Data center office block 15 10 14 09 15 13 12 16 Commercial vehicles Industrial drives, 19 automation 17 20 21 21 21 D i v i s i o n I n d u s t r i a l & M u lt i m a r k e t a p p l i c at i o n s 40 Domestic applications 02 03 01 06 05 07 05 04 04 08 04 09 05 10 11 04 01 / Washing machine: IGBT module for motor drive 07 / PV  inverter: CoolMOS™, OptiMOS™ 02 / Induction hob: Discrete IGBTs to control power transistors, SiC diodes and IGBT modules for induction coils DC-to-AC conversion 03 / LED office lamp: 08 / F lat screen: Discrete IGBTs LED drivers for LED lighting elements for background illumination 04 / PC/notebook/games console/DVD player: 09 / printer: Tags with ORIGA chip on printer CoolMOS™, OptiMOS™ power transistors and cartridges for brand protection SiC diodes in power pack 10 / Digital camera : Tags with ORIGA chip on 05 / PC/notebook/games console: OptiMOS™ battery for brand protection power transistors and power ICs on motherboard 11 / H earing aid: 06 / PC: OptiMOS™ power transistors and power Special IC for audio signal processing ICs on graphics card I n f i n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 P r o d u c t s a n d A p p l i c at i o n s 41 INDUSTRIAL & MULTIMARKET • Infineon achieved revenue of 1,374 million euros in the Industrial & Multimarket 20 division in the 2010 fiscal year.

Infineon is the only company worldwide to provide power semiconductors and power modules for the end-to-end process of generating, transmitting and consuming electrical energy. Our products are hugely significant for the future supply of energy, both in terms of the use of renewable energies and in terms of the efficient use of electrical energy in industry and commerce, as well as in the private domain. Electricity is set to become the most important energy carrier in the 21st century. Of that we are convinced, not only because fossil resources will become scarce by the middle of this century, but also because electricity can be transported cost-effectively and extremely quickly and be converted efficiently. Boom in wind power and solar energy continues unabated Many governments around the world have declared their intention to develop wind power in order to increase the proportion of regenerative energies in the energy mix and reduce CO₂ emissions. In addition to new systems business in newly designated areas, repowering – the replacement of existing, aging installations by new and more powerful systems – is also gaining momentum. Modern wind turbines generate around 2 megawatts of power, whereas their older-generation counterparts produce less than 0.5 megawatts. The large-scale expansion of wind energy at sea (“offshore”) will add new impetus. With a capacity of up to 6 megawatts, the systems installed off the coast are even bigger than those on land. Because they are installed in harsh environments, what counts for these energy generators is maximum reliability. Our rugged, seaproof switches, so-called IGBT modules, can be found in the nacelle at a height of more than 100 meters and in the inverter platforms. All in all, further development of the IGBT P. 60 modules and their adaptation to suit the specific needs of our customers constitute a continuous process. Along with wind energy, photovoltaics (PV) also remains on course for growth. PV systems, as installed on the roofs of houses or used in freestanding systems, require an inverter for feeding the DC voltage generated in the solar modules into the electricity grid. In addition to the acquisition costs, the efficiency of these inverters is the critical factor for the cost-effectiveness of the system. We supply the inverter manufacturers with IGBT, MOSFET and SiC components. As a result our customers achieve world record levels of efficiency. Smart grids are designed to improve load management in the power supply networks The rapidly growing percentage of electricity from renewable energies must be fed into the power supply networks (EU directive: by 2020, 20 percent of electrical energy demand are to come from renewable energies). This type of electricity generation is decentralized and irregular. In spite of this, the performance of the networks must I n f i n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 P r o d u c t s a n d A p p l i c at i o n s 43 not be allowed to fluctuate, nor must the stable supply of power at consistently high quality levels be jeopardized. To achieve this, consumption must be brought into line with generation, which is often dependent on the weather, and ways must be found to store surplus electricity. The distances over which power has to be transmitted from the wind farms and PV installations to the consumer centers lead to not inconsiderable energy losses, though such losses can be reduced significantly by intelligent high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems. By enabling data exchange between suppliers and consumers, smart grids, the intelligent power networks of the future, are intended to help gear consumption to the supply fluctuations of the energy sources. A fundamental part of the smart grid is the digital consumption meter, also known as a “smart meter”. The smart meter and the domestic appliances suitably equipped with communication capability are the extension of the smart grid to the consumer. The smart meter delivers consumption data over a data network, while simultaneously keeping consumers informed in real time about their electricity consumption and costs. Secure communication, i.e. the encrypted exchange of data that cannot be read or manipulated by third parties, is an important prerequisite for this. Infineon provides total solutions covering security, data communication and energy transmission. Mobility in metropolitan areas Increasing urbanization also fuels the demand for reliable public transportation systems. Infineon supplies the power components for the drive controls for a wide range of train systems and so plays a part in promoting the mobility of citizens in and between the metropolitan centers. We are engaged in developing more and more compact solutions for high-speed trains, trolleybuses and metropolitan railways so that we can offer our customers greater functionality in smaller and smaller units. For example, we supply IGBT modules for the French TGV and AGV as well as for the Siemens Velaro train family, which is used in Germany, Spain, Russia and China. LEDs as an energy-efficient lighting alternative 25 percent of energy worldwide is needed for lighting. With incandescent bulbs, 80 percent of that energy is wasted as heat, with only 20 percent being converted into light. LEDs, on the other hand, do not get hot, are far superior in terms of the light yield, and have a much longer lifetime. They are used for a wide range of applications: in street lighting, architectural lighting, for office lighting, car lighting, and in domestic situations. There has been an explosive growth in demand for these light sources, for which Infineon supplies driver ICs. Moreover, Infineon also provides components for energy-saving lamps and for ballast controllers for fluorescent lamps. The examples described demonstrate how semiconductors can increase levels of efficiency in the generation, transmission and conversion of electrical energy. Power semiconductors will consequently come to play an ever more prominent role in all areas of our daily lives. 44 I n f i n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 P r o d u c t s a n d A p p l i c at i o n s 21 Division chip card & securit y 45 Division Chip C ard & Securit y a p p l i c at i o n s Communication Public telephone Mobile telephone 02 01 Notebook 04 03 Machine-machine communication 05 01 / Prepaid phone card 04 / Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on motherboard 02 / SIM card 05 / Security chip for wireless machine-machine 03 / SIM card in USB dongle communication via cellular networks 46 Division Chip C ard & Securit y a p p l i c at i o n s Identification 01 01 Library book checkout access control 02 01 / RFID chip in cover for contactless checkout 02 / Contactless security chip in and return of library media ID card for access control Division Chip C ard & Securit y a p p l i c at i o n s 47 Payment cards Electronic ticket Payment card and electronic ticket 01 02 NFC ATM 03 05 04 Credit card 01 / Contactless security chip for mass public transport 03 / NFC (Near Field Communication) security chip 02 / Contactless security chip for mass public in smartphone to pay for travel tickets transport and small payments 04 / Contactless security chip in credit card 05 / Security chip in bank card for cash withdrawals Division Chip C ard & Securit y a p p l i c at i o n s 48 government id Electronic passport Identit y card 01 02 Residence permit 03 Driving license 04 Healthcare card 05 01 / Contactless security chip in electronic passport 04 / Contactless security chip in electronic 02 / Security chip in electronic identity card driving license 03 / Contactless security chip 05 / Security chip in electronic healthcare card in electronic residence permit I n f i n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 P r o d u k t e u n d a p p l i k at i o n e n 49 CHIP CARD & SECURITY • Infineon achieved revenue of 407 million euros in the Chip Card & Security division 22 in the 2010 fiscal year.

These include electronic passports, identity cards, contactless and contact-based payment cards, access cards and RFID applications, as well as chips for trusted-computing solutions. When it comes to security, we have 25 years’ experience in handling the largest and most demanding chip card projects. With our industry-leading security know-how, we are also benefiting from the growing security requirements of an increasingly mobile world. And our innovations in security and contactless technology in turn contribute toward ever-increasing mobility and greater freedom based on the foundation of security and protection of the private sphere of each and every individual. Our success is based not least on numerous innovations in three core competencies: Tailored Security: By this we mean the implementation of made-to-measure security functions which fulfill application-specific security needs. In order to encounter future P. 59 attack scenarios as well, we have implemented the revolutionary Integrity Guard security concept in the new SLE 78 family. Contactless Excellence: Fast, reliable and secure transfer of the data stored on the card or in the identity document is paramount in avoiding delays, especially in mass transit, identification and payment applications. A high data transfer rate is key to achieving a high level of acceptance and user friendliness in such contactless transactions. We are one of the world leaders in this field, and we intend to strengthen this position. Embedded Control: Our many years’ experience in the hardware-based security field is most clearly evidenced by our ability to find an optimal balance between the requirements for the field of application in question. Here the trick is to reconcile diverse criteria such as performance, power consumption and security at best costperformance-ratio. Our innovations in these three areas of competence enable our customers to implement cutting-edge hardware-based security solutions. These create the necessary confidence in the new applications of the mobile data society and combine freedom and mobility of the individual with maximum security and protection of privacy. Seen from a different angle, deploying security solutions leads to more and more pioneering applications in communications, transportation and IT infrastructure. Infineon provides the industry’s broadest product portfolio of chips and interfaces to meet the relevant security requirements in these areas. With our R&D activities we believe we will continue to be the leading and most savvy chip supplier for security solutions in the future as well.

Infineon supplies the biggest national projects at the present time with security controllers for passports (including the U.S. passport), identity cards and healthcare cards. Small payments and public transport Using contactless cards for secure payments is becoming increasingly popular. This fast and convenient way of making small payments is going from strength to strength, nowhere more so than in the booming cities of the world’s most rapidly expanding economies. As well as being useful for retail purchases, many of these cards can also be used as tickets in public transport. By the end of 2010, several hundred million Infineon ICs were exported for cards and tickets in China, Korea, Singapore, Brazil, the U.S.A., Great Britain, Russia, and many other countries. The Company is expanding its business areas beyond the traditional chip card by developing applications using other package designs, e.g. for measured data acquisition in the machine-to-machine (M2M) communication sector, payment functionality in mobile phones, and trademark protection. Here are three examples: Secure data transmission in the smart grid P. 42 M2M communication is used in many applications, including in the smart grid. In this area, smart meters enable the utility companies to read out consumption data remotely. Smart meters also allow time-variable tariffs to be introduced and provide end customers a transparent view of their consumption. Data privacy and protection against manipulation are basic requirements for these systems if this technology is to become accepted by the general population. NFC – purchasing tickets by mobile phone Near-field communication (NFC) technology is intended to allow users to pay for their purchases with their mobile phone in future, simply by holding the phone close to a payment terminal. The first pilot projects are already up-and-running in public transport, with mobile phones featuring NFC technology replacing the usual paper ticket. The security functions essential for this are integrated in a chip made by Infineon. Product and trademark protection It is important to be able to prove the provenance and authenticity of original products – whether they be high-quality, high-value medicines or expensive machine parts. Special chip-based tags (known as RFID labels) enable end-to-end tracking and logging of the value chain from the place of manufacture of the product across customs boundaries and national frontiers to the end consumer. In this way proof can be furnished that the customer has received the original goods, and not a fake. 52 I n f i n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 P r o d u c t s a n d A p p l i c at i o n s 23 Division wireless solutions I n f i n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 P r o d u c t s a n d A p p l i c at i o n s 53 WIRELESS SOLUTIONS • Infineon achieved revenue of 1,372 million euros in the Wireless Solutions division 24 in the 2010 fiscal year.

The transaction is due to be completed at the latest in the first calendar quarter of 2011 with the transfer of around 3,400 employees to Intel. The Wireless mobile phone business will then be run as a standalone business within Intel. Infineon’s business activities with tuners, satellite receivers and radio-frequency power transistors for base stations are not part of the deal. Infineon is not just a manufacturer of traditional mobile phone components such as baseband processors, radio frequency (RF) transceivers and battery management chips for the devices; it also provides complete platforms including software solutions, customization and required interoperability tests. The large mobile phone manufacturers are relying more and more on these integrated platform solutions and reducing their inhouse development in equal measure. Infineon sees itself as leading in the fields of RF technology, system-on-chip integration and system software. According to our assessment, mobile computing, smartphones and low-cost telephones for newly industrializing countries are the fastest growing markets. We serve these with components and platform solutions ideally adapted for this purpose. Mobile internet Mobile use of the internet is regarded as one of the most powerful drivers of growth in the industry. Sixty percent of hits on internet pages in China are already made via mobile devices – mostly smartphones featuring high data rates and comprehensive application options. In fact, mobile phones are the only means of accessing the internet for many users. That is why it is becoming increasingly important to make the advantages of fast 3G connections available not just in the premium segment, but also in the low-end price segment of the market. We supply both segments with our high-performance HSDPA/HSUPA and low-cost 3G platforms. In 2010 we have been very successful in establishing our XMM™ 6160 HSUPA platform in the market. For example, since summer 2010 we have been supplying Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy S model, among others. In the entry segment, our XMM™ 6181 platform provides an affordable solution for Android-based telephones. But we are already turning our attention to the next transmission technology: HSPA+. For this, Infineon supplies a winning solution for smartphones with its XMM™ 6260 platform manufactured in 40-nanometer technology. Thanks to large-scale integration, all of the modem functionality can be accommodated in just 600 square millimeters of board space. This is made possible essentially by a revolutionary approach in our new SMARTi™ UE2 RF transceiver. The transmitter architecture is defined here such that the different modulation types of the major international wireless standards (GSM, GPRS, EDGE, W-CDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA+) are combined in one signal path in the chip. This is a first in the mobile communications industry. Infineon thus I n f i n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 P r o d u c t s a n d A p p l i c at i o n s 55 provides the industry’s most compact and battery-friendly HSPA+ solution. Customers from Asia and the U.S.A. are already working on the first models. Mobile internet access from any portable computer In three to five years, virtually every portable computer – whether notebook, netbook or tablet PC – will have mobile access to the internet. All these devices are equipped with a communication module, enabling the user to connect to the internet anytime, anywhere, e.g. in order to interface with friends in social networks or to download new reading material. Infineon is achieving great success with its HSDPA/HSUPA platforms, notably in the booming tablet market. Further growth potential with entry-level phones Growth in the ultra-low-cost (ULC)/entry segment continues to be driven by strong demand for affordable mobile phones in newly industrializing countries. Despite the fact that there are already 4.5 billion mobile phone customers today – equivalent to about three quarters of the world’s population – this number is set to increase further in the next few years as more and more people in India, South America and Africa want to make telephone calls from a mobile phone. An additional factor is that more and more mobile phone customers want to buy a new phone offering more functions, such as radio reception, music playback, e-mail and web access, which means further growth for the industry. We are benefiting from this development with our single-chip solutions, which integrate the main mobile communication elements such as baseband processor, transceiver unit, battery management and RAM monolithically on one chip. More than 300 million single-chip solutions sold to date is an impressive statistic that speaks for itself. In the 2010 fiscal year we witnessed the very successful market launch of our thirdgeneration ULC mobile phone chip, the X-GOLD™ 110, as well as the new X-GOLD™ 213 EDGE single-chip solution. All the leading mobile phone manufacturers in this segment, such as Nokia, Samsung and LG Electronics, figure among our customers. More than 350 million mobile phone radio frequency transceivers shipped Infineon continues to occupy a world-leading position in the mobile phone RF transceiver market and shipped more than 350 million units in the 2010 fiscal year. This impressive sales success takes the total number of mobile phone RF transceivers sold to date to around 1.8 billion units. 56 I n f i n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 p r o d u c t s a n d a p p l i c at i o n s our strategy 01 / Focus on the growth opportunities offered by energy efficiency, mobilit y and securit y. 02 / Organizational structure along the target markets of automotive, industrial electronics and securit y. 03 / Technological core competencies in analog and mixed-signal circuits, embedded control, power electronics and manufacturing know-how. 04 / System know-how of our customers‘ products, assemblies and components.

The Company employed 5,771 people in research & development at the end of the fiscal year (including the employees who will be tranferred to Intel in the context of the the sale of the Wireless mobile phone business), thereof 2,939 in Germany. We have decades of experience in analog and mixed-signal circuit design, microcontroller solutions 05 for engine and motor control systems (embedded control), security applications and, not least, 06 the integration of large numbers of function blocks on a single chip. This expertise and our system know-how in relation to their products, assemblies and components have enabled us to establish 07 ourselves as a strategically important development partner for our customers. 08 09 Infineon now generates more than half of its revenue with power semiconductors, which are a vital ingredient for customers wishing to make their systems more energy-efficient. Not surprisingly, our 10 power electronics development team is among the largest in the sector. Innovations hold the key to the markets of the future, making them a consistently sought-after commodity throughout the business world. The following pages introduce a few of our innovative ideas 11 that will shortly begin to appear in full-fledged Infineon products. 12 13 14 26 r&d expenses € in millions (left scale) and in % of revenue (right scale) 15 16 200 20.0 17 150 15.0 18 19 100 10.0 20 50 5.0 21 0 0 Q1 | FY09 Q2 | FY09 Q3 | FY09 Q4 | FY09 Q1 | FY10 Q2 | FY10 Q3 | FY10 Q4 | FY10 R&D in € millions in % of revenue I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 R ese a rc h & De v elop m ent, P ro d u ction 59 AURIX™: our 32-bit multicore microcontroller series for future vehicle platforms 01 Our 32-bit automotive microcontrollers (MCUs) are developed especially for CPU-intensive appli02 cations including safety-critical functions such as radar-based adaptive cruise control as well as 03 powertrain and chassis control solutions. 04 A glance into the R&D departments of the leading carmakers shows that even the most powerful of the MCUs currently available will not be able to meet the performance requirements of future standards. The driving forces behind the need for greater computing power are new safety specifications for passenger and pedestrian protection and the electrification of the powertrain – in other words the move from internal combustion engines to electric motors. Real-time capability, the ability of a microcontroller to respond to unexpected external interrupts within a defined space of time, also has a role 05 to play in all of these new developments. All of our 32-bit-MCUs provide this all-important capability. 06 Thanks to its 32-bit multicore architecture, our new AURIX™ series can provide the computing power 07 needed for future generations of automobiles. Each chip carries up to five integrated processor cores, so time-critical calculations can be shared between multiple cores and safety-critical calcula08 tions can be carried out on more than one core at a time for redundancy. AURIX™ is based on the 09 TriCore™ processor architecture. 10 An extensive range of memory and interface configurations adds to the flexibility of the new AURIX™ series. Customers consequently have access to a consistent scalable processor architecture for everything from the most straightforward application to highly complex systems, which 11 should simplify and speed up their hardware and software development. The first models in the AURIX™ series will be produced in 65-nanometer technology from 2014. We expect the products in 12 this MCU series to have a life of at least 15 years. 13 14 Integrity Guard: a revolutionary security concept for the most demanding settings Attacks on chipcard applications have grown more and more effective over recent years. Now 15 Infineon’s revolutionary Integrity Guard security technology signals the dawn of a new age in 16 hardware-based security for chipcard and security applications. 17 Developed especially for demanding and long-lived chipcard and security applications such as 18 payment and electronic ID cards, the Integrity Card concept has enabled Infineon to create the first 19 security controller in smartcard history to provide full error-detection capabilities and comprehen20 sive encryption of all chip functions over the entire data path on chip. This revolutionary technology is also referred to as “digital security” in recognition of this property. 21 Integrity Guard features in the new SLE 78 series of 16-bit security microcontrollers and has been certified by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in this application. It is considered to be the most advanced solution in existence for protecting data on security chips. 60 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 R ese a rc h & De v elop m ent, P ro d u ction 01 .XT technology: IGBT internal packaging technology for improved reliability 02 Infineon revealed a new internal packaging technology for IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistor) modules in May 2010 that can significantly extend the life cycle of these modules. The new 03 27 .XT technology (XT = extended) optimizes all interconnections within an IGBT module that are vital 04 for long life and reliability, enabling Infineon to satisfy the ever tougher demands of current and future applications in terms of module lifetime in particular. .XT technology underlines Infineon’s technical leadership in the design and manufacture of IGBT modules. The technology can extend the life cycle of IGBT modules up to a factor of 10 as compared with conventional interconnect technologies. It can alternatively be employed to increase power density by up to 25 percent and also opens up the possibility of higher junction temperatures for 05 new chip technologies. 06 Temperature changes caused by power cycling between onand off-state expose the interconnects 07 within an IGBT module to mechanical stress. The differing coefficients of linear expansion of the 08 various layers create internal strains that can eventually lead to material fatigue and wear. The new 09 .XT technology covers all of the areas in which power cycling resilience is critical: the bond wiring on the chip front side, the soldering on the chip back side and the soldering connecting the DCB (Direct 10 Copper Bond) carrier board to the copper base plate. 11 27 IGBT module (based on .XT packaging technology) 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 R ese a rc h & De v elop m ent, P ro d u ction 61 The new technology promises to help optimize all kinds of applications including large transport 01 vehicles, construction machinery (mining vehicles), agricultural vehicles and electric buses with 02 electric-only or hybrid diesel-electric drive. High availability – and thus high reliability – is increas03 ingly important for our customers in these areas. Our .XT technology is also used in offshore wind turbines. Replacing parts on the high seas is complicated and expensive, so here too a long life 04 cycle and high reliability are vital for all components. Extension of thin wafer technology from 200 mm wafers to 300 mm wafers Wafers for power semiconductor applications typically have a thickness of around 350 micrometers once sawn into individual chips. Wafers that have been polished down to a thickness of less than 170 micrometers are known as thin wafers and those that measure less than 100 micrometers 05 thick are known as “ultrathin”. Infineon currently employs thin wafer technologies in the 170 to 40 micrometer range depending on product requirements. Human hair, by comparison, is typically 06 between 50 and 70 micrometers in diameter. Infineon is the only manufacturer in the world with the 07 technological mastery to produce (on 200 millimeter wafers) power semiconductors with a thickness 28 of just 40 micrometers. 08 09 Handling these thin wafers is particularly challenging. Wafers less than 100 micrometers thick break 10 easily and it is difficult to handle and transport them or subject them to any further processing. 28 40 micrometer thin wafer with a diameter of 200 millimeters (today) / 300 millimeters (in future) 11 12 13 14 200 mm / 300 mm 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 40 µm 62 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 R ese a rc h & De v elop m ent, P ro d u ction 01 Thin wafer technology has several major advantages though. Unlike normal ICs, most power 02 semiconductors have the current flowing from the front of the chip to the back. Thin wafers make it possible to process both front and back, which opens up new circuit and design functionalities. 03 The more energy-efficient chips manufactured on thin wafers make it possible both to reduce losses 04 and to remove the heat generated more effectively too and of course thin wafers fit into more compact packages. Components produced on thin wafers include IGBTs and high-voltage (CoolMOS™) and low-voltage (OptiMOS™) power transistors. IGBTs are used in induction hobs to switch the high-frequency currents in the induction coils that generate the heat for cooking in the pans. OptiMOS™ and CoolMOS™ power transistors convert mains AC voltage into the required DC voltage in power sup05 plies and adaptors. Infineon components and the systems built from them help to improve energy 06 efficiency thanks to our thin wafer technology. 07 Infineon worked closely with the appropriate equipment manufacturers on every relevant step when 08 developing 200 millimeter thin wafers to help bring the entire process chain to maturity successfully. 09 We now intend to conduct a review within a year to determine the extent to which 300 millimeter wafers might also be used for power components with thin wafer technology and will be setting up a 10 pilot line in Villach, Austria, one of Infineon’s development facilities for power components, from the end of 2010, for this purpose. 11 Production 12 13 DifferenTiation by unique production know-how We have stolen a march on our competitors in the fields of analog and mixed-signal circuits, embed14 ded control and power semiconductor development by devising special proprietary manufacturing 15 processes that are optimally matched to the relevant circuit requirements in all three application 16 areas. Our effectiveness in combining our circuit expertise with optimized production processes has enabled us to become the strategic semiconductor supplier of choice for many customers. 17 18 Most of our products are manufactured in our own facilities. Power semiconductors, integrated 19 nonvolatile memories (embedded flash) and analog circuit blocks require special manufacturing methods that are not freely available in the world market. Our production processes for both wafer 20 processing (front-end) and testing and packaging (back-end) thus constitute a significant differenti21 ating feature for our products. We had to halt capacity increases at our production facilities during the economic crisis. Investment was frozen to save money in most cases and we even mothballed some of our production lines. The situation changed suddenly at the beginning of the 2010 fiscal year, with the unexpectedly strong economic recovery leading to mothballed production lines being reactivated. Encouraged by strong customer demand for power semiconductors for automotive and industrial electronics applications in particular, we began to expand our newest front-end facility in Kulim, Malaysia, rapidly and had installed almost half of the plant’s maximum possible production capacity by the end of the 2010 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 R ese a rc h & De v elop m ent, P ro d u ction 63 fiscal year. We expect the Kulim site to reach the maximum production capacity beginning of the 01 2013 calendar year. 02 03 The rate of capacity expansion at all of our other production sites was limited by the availability of new production equipment, but by the end of the fiscal year we were still able to supply more goods 04 to our customers than we had initially planned twelve months previously. Significantly this not only made our own extraordinarily high growth in revenue possible, but also helped our customers capture extra revenue. Our production operations (four front-end sites and eight back-end sites) employed a total of 17,924 people at the end of the fiscal year (production sites: see map of the world on the next two05 page spread). 06 Inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 07 Throughout the entire semiconductor development process, Infineon is focused on efficient and careful resource management. Moreover, our innovations should significantly contribute to sustain08 ability, not only at our customers, but already during our own manufacturing process. And it is not 09 only the economic dimension that we care about, we care also about the use of raw materials and 10 energy as well as its consequences for our employees. As a result of these efforts, we are pleased to report that Infineon was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Europe in September 2010. Already after first application for assessment, Infineon managed to be among the ten most sustainable semiconductor companies in the world. 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 64 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 R ese a rc h & De v elop m ent, P ro d u ction 01 02 Productions sites Front-end production Back-end production Front-end and back-end production 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 Morgan Hill 11 12 13 14 15 no r t h a mer ic a 16 17 18 19 20 21 usa Morgan Hill 132 employees Center of competence for radio-frequency power transistors 29 production sites I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 R ese a rc h & De v elop m ent, P ro d u ction 65 germany hungary a u s t r ia 01 Dresden Regensburg Regensburg Warstein Cegléd Villach 02 1,699 employees 718 employees 939 employees 504 employees 517 employees 1,279 employees CMOS, analog/mixedPower semiconductors, Special technologies, Modules, Modules Power transistors, 03 signal technologies sensors, chip cards, power semiconductors R&D for modules center of competence eWLB, discrete semifor thin wafer 04 conductors, center technology of competence for package development 05 06 07 euro p e 08 09 10 Warstein Dresden Regensburg Villach Cegléd 11 12 Wuxi 13 14 15 16 17 Kulim Malacca Singapore Batam 18 19 a sia 20 21 I n d o n e s ia m a l ay s ia Si n g a p o r e china Batam Kulim Malacca Singapore Wuxi 2,132 employees 942 employees 5,746 employees 1,351 employees 1,023 employees Power semiconductors CMOS, power Chip cards, discrete Testers, R&D for Chip cards, discrete transistors semiconductors, sentesting concepts semiconductors sors, R&D for packages 66 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S u sta in a b ilit y at I n f ineon Sustainability at Infineon – taking responsibility for future generations 01 As a global company and a participant of the UN Global Compact initiative we voluntarily take 02 responsibility towards the international community. We take social responsibility and environmental protection very seriously and both are part of our overall corporate strategy. This voluntary commit03 ment reflects our fundamental values. We have defined the necessary structures, processes and 04 guidelines internally on the basis of the UN Global Compact principles. Our involvement with the UN’s Global Compact initiative, to which we signed up already in 2004, is indicative for Infineon as a conscientious and responsible enterprise. 05 06 07 Acting in a sustainable manner requires linking all aspects of our operations, be they economic, 08 ecological or social in nature. We focus on six key areas: human resources management and human 09 rights; corporate citizenship; business ethics; occupational safety and health; environmental protection; and sustainability in our supply chain. We are always looking for potential improvements in 10 these areas and implement them not as a duty but rather as a self-evident element of our everyday business activity. One consequence of our achievements in the area of sustainability is Infineon’s inclusion in the Dow 11 Jones Sustainability Europe Index this year. The progress we have made so far only encourages us 12 to aim higher in future: we expect sustainability to remain a major challenge and will continue to 13 confront the issues involved with vigor. 14 15 16 17 18 Our social engagement 19 Our Company helps the less fortunate all over the world on a voluntary basis. The scale of the earthquake disaster in Haiti and the terrible conditions in which the country’s citizens found themselves 20 living shocked us all. We wanted to play a part in the aid and reconstruction effort and consequently 21 decided to support the aid organizations involved financially in the fiscal year ended. Our employees give their time to help other people. Examples include our participation in June 2010 in the Munich City Company Championship (MCCC 2010) charity soccer tournament. Our team at the event – Germany’s largest company soccer tournament – helped to raise money for the Freudentanz project, an initiative that sticks up for socially disadvantaged children in the Munich area. The tournament also raised money for UNICEF’s Schools for Africa project. I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S u sta in a b ilit y at I n f ineon 67 Our value chain 01 We apply our values throughout the entire value chain. Services provided by our contractors and 02 the products, materials, tools and equipment we purchase have to meet our environmental protec03 tion, occupational safety and health protection requirements and must satisfy our expectations in respect of social and labor conditions. Our defined standards and measures can be implemented 04 more effectively by building stable partnerships and fostering open communication. Last fiscal year we proactively took up the subject of conflict metals, addressing it towards our suppliers to ensure that we do not use metals sourced from conflict areas. We are also raising the subject in the various trade associations to which we belong in order to increase awareness and establish the issue as a matter of concern within the sector as a whole. 05 The requirements and restrictions concerning the use of certain materials in electrical and electronic products have become tougher all over the world in recent years. While it should go without 06 saying that we comply with these restrictions, we also feel it is very important for customers to be 07 able to have complete confidence that our products are indeed compliant. Creating this confidence requires efficient communication in addition to the implementation of corresponding processes. The 08 acknowledgement we receive from customers and again in audits and meetings, demonstrates that 09 we do in fact inspire confidence in practice. 10 Responsibility for our employees The first priority in terms of our responsibilities for our employees has to be preventing and avoiding potential risks. We apply the same advanced concepts of occupational health and safety consistently 11 30 worldwide and we never stop looking for opportunities to improve. Our accident statistics document the success of these safety measures and show that we really do follow our principles in practice. 12 13 The rate of accidents at Infineon is substantially lower than the average reported by BG ETEM, the 14 German Social Accident Insurance Institution for the Energy, Textile, Electrical and Media Products sectors. Significantly our figures cover the whole of our operation worldwide and include all work15 related accidents leading to an absence of at least one day, whereas the BG ETEM reports work16 related accidents resulting in at least three days’ absence of work. 17 18 30 Statistics on occupational Accidents per 1,000 employees 19 20 30 27 21 24 21 18 15 12 9 6 3 0 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Infineon (worldwide): accidents as of 1 day of absence German Social Accident Insurance Institution for the Energy, Textile, Electrical and Media Products sectors: accidents as of 3 days of absence 68 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S u sta in a b ilit y at I n f ineon 01 31 Simplified scheme of the production and use-phase of a semiconductor including the main environmental variables 02 03 target: maximizing ecological benefit 04 Efficiency increase, recyling, Environmentally recover, reclaim friendly applications Front-end transportation BACK-END transportation Logistics transportation use-phase of product 05 06 07 Water, energy, materials, chemicals Recycling of 08 end product 09 Waste, emissions 10 target: minimizing environmental impact 11 12 13 Environmental sustainability of semiconductor manufacturing Infineon Technologies complements its endeavors in the commercial and social spheres by making 14 a concerted effort to expand its portfolio of energy-saving solutions and to reduce emissions and 15 minimize consumption of ever-scarcer natural resources in the production of its semiconductors. 16 Global demand for resources, especially energy and water, will continue to rise over the coming 17 years. Access to these resources is a necessary condition for a thriving national economy, so making 18 sure we always use them in an efficient and responsible way simultaneously helps to protect the 19 global environment – for example through intelligent measures to combat climate change – and to facilitate a more equal distribution of wealth and the attendant social benefits. 20 21 A company’s environmental footprint is one of the principal measures of its environmental impact and a key tool in identifying potential improvements. Figure 31 presents a simplified environmental footprint scheme for our semiconductors showing the parameters energy, material usage, water consumption, waste generation, recycling, transportation, and environmental impact in the use-phase. Like just about any industrial production process, semiconductor manufacturing necessarily entails the use of a certain amount of energy, water, chemicals and other materials. For technology reasons, a core area is our front-end production, where the silicon wafers are structured, and it is here that the most energy – principally electrical energy – is consumed. I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S u sta in a b ilit y at I n f ineon 69 Motivated by our conviction that energy savings are the best energy source, we have been working 01 systematically for many years – and certainly since long before such measures quite rightly became 02 high-profile public and political issues – to reduce our energy consumption per square centimeter 03 manufactured silicon wafer. Following this principle we were able to reduce energy consumption at our front-end production facilities considerably over recent years in spite of the increasing complex04 ity of our products and processes. The improvements realized range from examining consumption figures prior to purchasing infrastructure and manufacturing equipment to refining existing systems to measures designed to raise awareness of our sustainability concept among employees and contractors and encourage them to share it. A unit known as the “negajoules” has been implemented to measure the impact of such steps. The 05 term describes the energy not consumed because of enhanced energy efficiency. Figure 32 shows 32 the Negajoules of our front-end facilities for the period 2002 to 2009. The amount of energy, or elec06 tricity, saved up to 2009 is equal to 716,000 tons of carbon dioxide. 07 Internal knowledge sharing and international benchmarks make sure that improvements are imple08 mented right across all sites throughout the Company. This means that our back-end production 09 facilities, where our structured silicon wafers are processed to create finished semiconductor prod10 ucts, have been optimized in much the same way as the front-end facilities even though back-end operations are by their very nature considerably less energy-intensive than front-end processes. While our manufacturing operations certainly account for the lion’s share of our energy consumption, 11 we are by no means content to stop here. We analyze every potential saving, including in our offices. Publicity campaigns at our Campeon corporate headquarters site, for example, have raised employee 12 awareness of relevant issues and given them concrete recommendations to follow. Thanks to these 13 measures, our annual carbon dioxide emissions for this site are 172,000 kg lower than they would 14 otherwise be. We took another interesting step in the fight against climate change in June 2010 with the commissioning of a geothermal heat supply system at Campeon. 15 16 17 32 Negajoules TWh 33 PFC emissions 1995 to 2010 (EU) CO₂ equivalents (%) 18 2.0 1,000 19 1.8 900 20 1.6 800 1.4 700 21 1.2 600 1.0 500 0.8 400 0.6 300 0.4 200 0.2 100 0 0 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 1995 1998 2001 2004 2007 2010 Negajoules cumulated Estimated emissions Amount of energy saved (what is known as negajoules) at Goal based on the voluntary commitment our front-end production facilities, excluding our former Real emissions subsidiaries, between 2002 and 2009 (in terawatt-hours). 70 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S u sta in a b ilit y at I n f ineon 01 Geothermal energy is heat stored in the upper regions of the Earth’s crust in forms including natu02 rally heated water. Geothermally heated water at 122 degrees Celsius from a depth of 3.5 kilometers is used for district heating and electricity generation. Geothermal energy is virtually inexhaustible, 03 is categorized as a renewable source and saves carbon dioxide at our corporate headquarters by 04 around 1,000 tons a year. The semiconductor industry is not a major consumer of chemicals, but limited quantities are essential in chip manufacturing, for example in the creation of the structures on the silicon wafers. We implement recycling and optimize our processes wherever feasible in order to minimize our environmental footprint. Water we use principally in the form of process water and cooling water. We use closed-loop systems wherever possible to avoid unnecessary water consumption. We continuously 05 compare our performance in the areas of water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, energy 06 efficiency and waste reduction and recycling against international benchmarks. This exercise indicates that our production facilities have been at the leading edge of active environmental protection 07 since many years. 08 09 Reducing energy consumption is just one of the ways in which we can help to protect our environment. Another major environmental challenge, especially in the context of the threat posed by 10 climate change, is the need to reduce emissions. We recognized this at an early stage, as evidenced 33 by our voluntary commitment adopted in 1998 to reduce perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). PFCs are greenhouse gases necessary for the production of semiconductors. Our voluntary target was to reduce our absolute PFC emissions to ten percent below 1995 values by 2010, calculated in carbon 11 dioxide equivalents. Thanks to our employees’ ingenuity in finding alternative process chemicals 12 and our intelligent approaches of abatement systems, we achieved this ambitious target three years 13 ahead of schedule in 2007, meaning that we actively contribute to climate protection. 14 Our policy in respect of abatement systems aims to realize the ecological optimum. We have identi15 fied the theoretical main emitters using internal analyses and implemented abatement systems – 16 But treatment itself requires inputs of energy and in some cases also chemicals, so it is important to establish the point at which diminishing returns make further treatment counterproductive by 17 increasing rather than decreasing the overall environmental impact. Striking the right balance 18 requires rigorous environmental engineering assessments. 19 As the curve in the figure showing our real emissions illustrates, we have continued to apply the 20 concepts described consistently even after surpassing our voluntary commitment. 21 Facilitating sustainability through our products and solutions A company’s environmental footprint does not end when its products leave the factory gate: any analysis must also include proper consideration of the products’ use-phase. Ultimately we have to consider whether the consumption of resources involved in manufacturing a product actually “makes sense” from an ecological viewpoint. Mindful of this, Infineon provides products that not only help to improve security and enable mobility, but also facilitate the realization of energy-efficient concepts and end products across an enormous range of fields and applications. Our products and innovations create considerable value added for the environment as compared with conventional technologies. I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 S u sta in a b ilit y at I n f ineon 71 This value added extends from energy generation and distribution to the use phase of applications 01 and end products. Our products and solutions feature in wind and solar power plants, for example, 02 in lighting systems and in power supplies. As the global market leader in semiconductors for auto03 motive, our products and solutions also underpin improvements in energy consumption in a huge number of automobile applications, an area in which their overall impact on reducing consump04 tion is particularly noticeable. We offer semiconductor solutions for all relevant applications in the electromobility segment too and are hence playing an important role in supporting developments in this innovative field of technology. The products and solutions mentioned underline the importance of innovations in moving toward true sustainability. The following selected examples give an idea of the powerful implications of our accomplishments in this area: • Our products and solutions in automobile enable annual reductions equal to 3.8 million tons of 05 carbon dioxide. 06 07 • Our products and solutions for PC power supplies enable annual reductions equal to 140,000 tons of carbon dioxide. 08 09 • Our products and solutions for electronic ballasts enable annual reductions equal to 330,000 tons 10 of carbon dioxide as compared with conventional magnetic ballasts. The numbers and our calculated indicators show that in our case at least, the consumption of resources involved in manufacturing our products really does makes sense from an ecological 11 viewpoint: the volume of emissions, expressed in each case in carbon dioxide equivalents, saved in end products thanks to the use of our products and solutions is almost seven times as high as the 12 volume of emissions generated in the manufacture of our products. 13 14 The notion of taking responsibility for people and the environment stands at the very heart of the modern integrative concept by which our actions at Infineon are guided. What matters more than 15 anything else in this connection is that we put our professed social and environmental principles 16 into practice proactively every day in our production facilities, in our products and in everything we 17 do. Infineon, moreover, applies these selfsame principles worldwide: national boundaries have no part to play when it comes to caring for people and the environment. 18 19 As the environmental efficiency of our production facilities and the environmental benefits opened 20 up by our products ably demonstrate, innovation and responsibility for the environment are two sides of the same coin for Infineon. Using our products is thus also a smart move from an ecological 21 point of view – it “makes sense” for the environment. We believe our product portfolio, which facilitates efficiency improvements throughout the energy value chain including distribution and consumption, is absolutely unparalleled. That we manufacture these products in such an efficient manner is in turn sustainable. 72 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 P eople excellence in a h i g h per f or m a nce co m p a n y People excellence in a high-performance company 01 The corporate Human Resources function exists first and foremost to ensure that Infineon is staffed 02 with qualified and committed employees working in lean and efficient structures. This is a crucial factor both in the value creation process and in building Infineon’s reputation as a high-performance 03 company. Human Resources pursued numerous projects and initiatives in the 2010 fiscal year in this 04 connection, such as successfully completing its crisis management activities from 2009 and playing an active role in Infineon’s reorganization. The launch of our new mission statement intended to give employees orientation after the crisis and create a shared new identity marked a conscious effort to signal the dawn of a new era. Another important step was the introduction of a new compensation system throughout the Company, which ties future variable compensation exclusively to the financial success of Infineon as a whole. We made a priority of cultivating and enhancing our attractiveness as an employer in order to secure the long-term commitment of our employees and play a key 05 role in the implementation of business decisions such as the pending sale of our Wireless mobile 06 phone business. As in all such matters, we emphasize to work constructively with the employee representatives at all times. 07 08 Ensuring sustainable profitability 09 Despite the positive financial results of the first quarter, ensuring sustainable profitability was our first and main concern in the 2010 fiscal year. Like other functions, Human Resources continued to 10 feel the effects of the previous year’s crisis management activities for much of the first half of the fiscal year ended: in a few areas the implementation of the measures introduced to reduce staffing levels carried on, we continued to work on realizing organizational changes and the cost control measures (such as restrictions on travel) were largely maintained. The training budget in particular 11 remained tight such that external training could only be provided where required by law or essen12 tial to the business. For us and our people development, this implied a renewed focus on internal 13 training options. Working with the departments, we managed to arrange numerous internal training sessions in 2010 as well as facilitating knowledge sharing through our “Innovation Fab” and 14 “Innovation Star” initiatives and the resulting “iCommunities”. Human Resources faced its toughest 15 challenges at our production sites. The rapid rise in demand following the crisis required us not only 16 to increase local capacities, but also to arrange quick and flexible availability of labor. 17 A new mission statement: the Infineon Compass 18 Infineon coped extraordinarily well with the crisis of the last two years. Maintaining this success 19 in the future will mean ushering in a new phase of profitable growth and devoting all our efforts to developing Infineon from a good company into a true high-performance company. Sustaining 20 our profitability is paramount in this: The revenues we generate must cover our capital costs and 21 permit investment so that we continue to be competitive and attractive in the financial markets. At the same time our ambition is to be the innovation leader in semiconductors in the fields of energy efficiency, mobility and security. Our new mission statement, the Infineon Compass, will guide us on this journey to becoming an enduringly successful company by helping our employees understand where we are, where we want to be and how we plan to get there and by highlighting the values that guide our actions.

Israel) North America Asia/Pacific (incl. Japan) 07 1 Approximately 3,400 employees worldwide from our Wireless Solutions segment and from central functions are intended to be transferred to Intel upon closing of the sale of the Wireless mobile phone business. 08 09 10 Our actions are governed by the four values: “We commit – We innovate – We partner – We perform” – and these are what drive our day-to-day activities. They are complemented in our mission statement by four cardinal high-performance criteria: 11 • Ambitious goals and a clear focus on results: We set ourselves ambitious targets and focus with what we do on things that lead us to the aspired result. 12 • Entrepreneurial decision-making: We take decisions entrepreneurially – accept responsibility 13 for target attainment and are alive to opportunities and risks. 14 • Lean and fast execution: We swiftly and efficiently implement decisions that have been made, instead of calling them into question time and again. 15 • Passionate and talented people: We work with passion and confidence across organizational 16 boundaries towards joint success. 17 The Compass and its principles create an intellectual framework for our operations without restrict18 ing the freedom of every team and every last employee to add their own individual contribution. For 19 this we have been holding Compass workshops in all areas and at all levels of the Company since 20 the middle of the year. 21 Introduction of a new compensation system The introduction of a new compensation system for employees previously covered by the old Bonus & Incentive Guideline on October 1, 2010 represents another milestone on the path to becoming a high-performance company. The new system removes the link between variable compensation and individual targets, tying future bonus payments solely to the performance of Infineon instead. Every employee receives an attractive basic salary plus a performance-related bonus based on targets and metrics that reflect the commercial success of the Company. This change gives employees an even greater stake in the Company’s business achievements. 74 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 P eople excellence in a h i g h per f or m a nce co m p a n y 01 We believe the new compensation system offers other significant advantages too, not least the 02 fact that the annual employee reviews will now be able to concentrate on specific feedback from manager to employee. This does not mean that discussing past performance and defining individual 03 targets will take a back seat; on the contrary we expect severing the direct link between individual 04 performance and the level of bonus payments to make discussing performance and targets not only easier, but also more productive. The new arrangements fit in well with our drive to make internal processes faster and more efficient as well. They reduce administrative work and help streamline internal human resources processes, giving us greater opportunity for effective dialog between managers and employees. Corporate culture, diversity and talents 05 Developing and maintaining a corporate culture attractive to our work force is a key step for 06 Infineon on the path to becoming a high-performance company. Enhanced employee commitment is just one of the benefits of having an attractive corporate culture and a positive image as an 07 employer: employees who are excellent ambassadors for the company brand can spread the word of 08 Infineon’s appeal as an employer outside the organization with unrivalled credibility. 09 The Great Place to Work® employee survey was carried out across the German sites of Infineon Technologies AG and Infineon Dresden for the first time at the beginning of the 2010 fiscal year in 10 order to evaluate Infineon’s corporate culture and image as an employer. We have taken the findings as a call to engage even more actively in the cultivation of a positive employer image among our employees: we now know where we stand and what we need to work on in order to secure a place among the leading employers in future even in difficult times. We consider regular feedback from our 11 employees to be vital in our ongoing effort to reshape the Company. The participation in 2009 was 12 no one-off: we intend to conduct the survey every year and will start with the next survey once again 13 at the beginning of the new fiscal year. 14 One of our main priorities in building and enhancing an attractive employer brand is to ensure that our 15 corporate culture at Infineon values diversity and provides fair working terms and equal opportunities 16 for all employees. To this end Infineon launched a diversity management initiative some time ago now to address the associated issues in depth at an interregional level. The number of women in manage17 ment positions has been one of the most frequently discussed topics in recent months and has also 18 been considered by the Company’s top management. We have been working hard for many years – and 19 not without success – to generate enthusiasm for careers in the natural sciences among women and men alike and to ensure their progression on a strategic basis in all areas of the Company and at all 20 levels of responsibility. This has enabled us to increase the proportion of women in top management 21 roles significantly over recent years. In this regard we are focusing on activities that help women enjoy the same opportunities as men and make it easier to combine work and family. We want the importance of family life to be recognized and acknowledged across all aspects of Infineon’s operations and for this to become a permanent and prominent element of our corporate culture. We took another significant stride toward realizing this objective in the summer of 2010 with the completion of a “berufundfamilie” (career and family) audit. The audit results form the basis of a three-year action plan detailing how we can provide even better support to help our employees combine career and family. Developing women to occupy positions in senior management is one of Infineon’s corporate objectives. We have resolved to increase the proportion of women in leading positions from about 11 percent at present to 15 percent by 2015, and to 20 percent by 2020. Equally, Infineon has set itself the overriding task of ensuring plans are in place to secure future talent for the Company, particularly in the technical areas. I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 P eople excellence in a h i g h per f or m a nce co m p a n y 75 Infineon operates in a global context, so individual and cultural diversity are highly significant. We 01 launched a talent management initiative in Asia in the 2010 fiscal year in order to make better use of 02 the potential of diversity within the Company. Asia is vitally important for us: home to an enormous 03 range of cultures and harboring immense potential for growth, it offers unparalleled opportunities to recruit talented employees for us. We are accordingly investing in cooperative agreements with 04 respected universities and institutions in the region in order to secure a supply of future talent for the company. We aim to do even more to help our Asian employees acquire the skills necessary for key positions in order to expand our talent pool at both regional and global level. In the medium to long term, we want to create real value from diversity and make the most of all of the different strengths within our organization, for example by bringing employees from different cultures together as part of the talent program. We as a company are also witnessing first-hand the rapid 05 developments taking place within Asia. Keeping pace with these changes – and keep pace with them we must – demands a thorough understanding of the market and close local contacts, an area 06 in which the advancement of talented local employees clearly has a particularly important role to 07 play. Scheduled to commence operations in Asia at the beginning of the new fiscal year, our talent management program is intended to offer selected development and training opportunities for high08 potential employees to help them augment their Asia-specific knowledge with international manage09 ment skills and build up an optimal internal contact network for their subsequent career at Infineon. 10 We are additionally planning to roll out the standardized talent program worldwide. Realization of the sale of our Wireless mobile phone business Human Resources also plays a key role in implementing the business management decisions made 11 on the path to becoming a high-performance company. Chief among these at the moment from our perspective is the planned sale of our Wireless mobile phone business, which involves the trans12 fer of around 3,400 employees spread across more than 20 locations around the world. Human 13 Resources faces a number of challenges in connection with this project. We assist with the process 14 to devise a legal structure for the new company, negotiated with the Works Council in Germany and concluded the balancing of interests. As well as helping to design the new structures involved, we 15 offer managers special trainings in relevant aspects of labor law and the field of change manage16 ment in order to prepare them for the necessary dialogs with employees supposed to transfer to 17 the new company. Human Resources also has one further important contribution to make for both Infineon and the new company: it is essential to ensure in both organizations that all functions and 18 processes remain available in efficient structures when the carve-out is effected. For us this means 19 not only ensuring a smooth operational transfer of employees, compensation systems, structures 20 and HR data, but also – and perhaps even more importantly – reinforcing the self-confidence and motivation of the employees of both companies and making sure they are on board for another excit21 ing journey into the future. Infineon moved ahead with its restructuring activities over the course of the fiscal year ended, consciously embarking on a new phase in the Company’s development in the process. The changes being made place particular demands on Human Resources as both a driver and a facilitator of Infineon’s evolution into a high-performance company. We have already taken significant steps on the way to becoming a high-performance company, with the launch of the Infineon Compass and the introduction of the initial set of high-performance-inspired measures, and will continue to play an active role in helping the Company scale the heights to which we all aspire. 76 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 T H E I N F I N E O N S HA R E Infineon Technologies AG share capital, shares outstanding and market capitalization September September As of Change 30, 2009 30, 2010 Share capital in € millions 2,173 2,173 0% 01 Shares outstanding in millions ¹ 1,087 1,087 0% Yearly average in millions ² 855 1,171 +36.96% 02 Market capitalization in € millions 4,189 5,521 +31.80% 03 Market capitalization in U.S. $ millions 6,129 7,514 +22.60% 04 1 undiluted 2 diluted Share information Infineon share statistics Fiscal year ending September 30 Ordinary registered shares in the form of shares or American 2008 2009 2010 Share types Depositary Shares (ADS) with a notional value of 2.00 euros each (ADS:shares = 1:1).

Speculation that Infineon had lost an important customer order only exacerbated the downward trend and our share price hit its low for the year of 3.05 euros on October 28, 2009. Even Infineon’s November 6 announcement that the sale of the Wireline Communications business had been completed successfully produced only a negligible 1 percent rise. When Infineon upgraded its outlook for the first quarter of the 2010 fiscal year on December 22, however, the price began to rise sharply and continued on this trajectory well into January. From the middle of February 05 onward the Infineon share also benefited from the accelerating economic recovery. General speculation that the second quarter would also yield very good quarterly results then gave our share price 06 another significant boost toward the end of the first half of the fiscal year. 07 Relevant benchmark indices also picked up over the first half of the 2010 fiscal year: in the six 08 months to March 31, 2010, the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductor Index rose by 12 percent, the Phila09 delphia Semiconductor Index rose by 19 percent and the German DAX stock index rose by 8 percent. 10 The Infineon share price increased by 33 percent over the same period. SECOND HALF SHAPED BY RESTRUCTURING AT INFINEON AND CONCERNS ABOUT THE SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET The positive trend in the development of the Infineon share price over the first half of the fiscal year 11 continued into April 2010 and the share peaked for the year at 5.54 euros on April 26, 2010. Two days later Infineon upgraded its forecast for the second time, but instead of strengthening further, 12 the price actually began to fall as a result of macroeconomic fears rooted in the Greek debt crisis. 13 The Infineon share price then began to rally again from the middle of May 2010 following a general 14 upturn in stock market activity and also, quite possibly, speculation in the media about the sale of the Company’s Wireless mobile phone business. Uncertainty about the prospects for the global 15 economy in general and the semiconductor industry in particular and concerns about inventory 16 building in the supply chain and the consequent risk of a sharp drop in demand became the prevail17 ing influences on the Company’s share in the months of July and August. August proved a particularly difficult time for the share as a result. 18 19 The price of the Infineon share rose continuously from the middle of September as a growing number 20 of investors welcomed the Company’s new alignment following the August 30 announcement of the sale of the Wireless mobile phone business. Infineon upgraded its quarterly forecast for the third 21 time in the fiscal year on September 21, 2010, announcing at the same time that it aimed to keep revenue stable in the first quarter of the 2011 fiscal year as well, and this also helped to sustain the upward trend in the share price. Concerns about the semiconductor market in the second half of the fiscal year also had a negative impact on the relevant semiconductor benchmark indices, with the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductor Index (-7 percent) and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (-5 percent) both falling between March 31 and the end of September 2010. 78 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 T H E I N F I N E O N S HA R E 01 36 Development of the Infineon Technologies AG share compared to Germany's DAX Index and Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductor Index from the beginning of the 2010 fiscal year (daily closing prices) 02 03 Infineon share price in € 6.75 04 quarter 01 quarter 02 5.79 4.83 05 06 3.86 07 08 2.90 10 | 2009 11 | 2009 12 | 2009 01 | 2010 02 | 2010 03 | 2010 09 10 The Infineon share price, however, fell by just 1 percent over the same period (DAX: +1 percent). Our share also outperformed the benchmark indices by a substantial margin over the fiscal year as a whole: while the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductor Index and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index 11 posted gains of just four and 13 percent respectively, the Infineon share price rose by 32 percent 12 (DAX: +10 percent). 13 SEC DEREGISTRATION COMPLETED; SUPERVISORY BOARD and MANAGEMENT BOARD PROPOSE PAYMENT 14 OF A DIVIDEND 15 An average of 20.7 million Infineon shares were traded every day in the 2010 fiscal year via Xetra, 16 the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and other German regional exchanges. The previous year’s daily average was somewhat higher at 24.1 million shares. Trading volume in euros, in contrast, rose 17 by 120 percent to 23.9 billion euros (previous year: 10.9 billion euros) and helped to stabilize the 18 Company’s position in the DAX index following its return in September 2009. Infineon’s position in 19 the DAX ranking by trading volume in euros improved from 24th on September 30, 2009 to 14th on September 30, 2010. 20 21 Average trading volume on the over-the-counter OTCQX market fell from 1.6 million ADSs a day 35 in the previous year to 160,000 per day in the 2010 fiscal year. ADSs continued to decline as a proportion of the total number of Infineon shares outstanding in the period under review. There were 37.6 million ADSs in circulation at the beginning of the fiscal year but just 14.1 million twelve months later.

Deregistration was 19 effected on November 4, 2010. This means that Infineon no longer has to comply with the reporting 20 duties defined in the Securities Exchange Act, which include the submission of an annual report on Form 20-F and regular financial reports on Form 6-K. 21 In light of the Company’s excellent progress in the 2010 fiscal year, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board decided to propose a dividend of 0.10 euros per share to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. The Group’s parent company, Infineon Technologies AG, reported accumulated income of 109 million euros for the 2010 fiscal year following accumulated deficit of 5,940 million euros in the previous year. 80 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 in f ineon w orl d w i d e 01 02 Infineon sites  Headquarters P Production S Sales  Majority holding R&D Research & Development DC Distribution center 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 Livonia | S Kokomo | S 10 11 12 Morgan Hill | R & D | P Milpitas | R & D | S 13 Torrance | R & D  | S | Lebanon S | Durham 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 S | São Paulo 38 sites I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 in f ineon w orl d w i d e 81 Warstein | R & D | S | P S | Hannover Großostheim | DC ger m a n y Duisburg, Epos |  | R & D R & D | P | Dresden Duisburg | R & D | S Stuttgart | S S | Erlangen 01 Karlsruhe, Hitex Development Tools | R & D | S | P R & D | P | Regensburg 02 R & D | S | Augsburg  | R & D | S | Munich, Neubiberg 03 04 S | Birmingham, Hitex S | Dublin R & D | S | Bristol R & D | Ascot S | Copenhagen 05 06 07 R & D | S | Kista 08 09 S | Moscow 10 S | Rotterdam S | Antwerp  | P | R & D | S | Cegléd R & D | S | P | Beijing R & D | Buckarest S | P | Wuxi 11 S | Vienna R & D | S | Shanghai R & D | Graz S | R & D | Seoul 12  | R & D | Linz, DICE S | Nagoya S | Klagenfurt 13 S | Tokyo R & D | S | P | Villach DC | Narita 14 S | Osaka R & D | S | Taipeh 15 16 R & D | Padua S | Milan 17 S | Hong Kong S | Zurich S | Shenzhen S | Marseille 18 P | Batam S | Toulouse R & D | S | P | DC | Singapore 19 S | Saint-Denis P | Malacca 20 P | Kulim R & D | S | Bangalore 21 S | Melbourne 82 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o g i e s A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 10 in f ineon 2 0 10 INFINEON 2010 01 quarter 01 11|2009 Infineon and TSMC extend their development and production partnership agreement 02 to 65 nanometer embedded flash process technology for automotive and chip card 03 applications. 04 11|2009 Completion of the sale of Wireline Communications to Golden Gate Capital.

the General shareholders’ Meeting 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 Prof. Dr. Kl aus Wucherer 10 Chairman of the Supervisory Board 11 Ladies and gentlemen, 12 13 The Supervisory Board hereby presents its report on the performance of its duties over the course of the 2010 fiscal year. A very different year to the difficult and turbulent 14 2009 fiscal year, the 2010 fiscal year saw the Company make excellent progress to achieve 15 a Segment Result margin from continuing operations of 14.4 percent and announce a 16 dividend to shareholders. 17 18 The Supervisory Board tracked the position of the Company closely as usual in the 2010 fiscal year and both the full board and its committees met many times during the year. 19 The Supervisory Board monitored the Management Board’s management of the Company 20 regularly and assisted the Management Board in its advisory capacity. The Supervisory 21 Board was directly involved in all decisions of fundamental importance to the Company. The Management Board provided prompt and comprehensive reports on the course of business and financial and investment planning and on the financial position of the Company and its individual segments in the ordinary meetings of the Supervisory Board and all matters of concern were discussed thoroughly with the Management Board. The Management Board also provided verbal or written reports on events of particular importance in extraordinary meetings and between meetings. The Management Board submitted detailed quarterly 86 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o gi e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 R e p o r t o f t h e S u p e r v i s o r y B o a r d t o t h e G e n e r a l s h a r e h o l d e rs ’ M e e t i n g 01 02 03 reports to the Supervisory Board covering topics such as the economic and financial devel04 opment and profitability of the Company over the respective quarter ended, major business transactions, risks and material lawsuits. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, the Chairman of the Investment, Finance and Audit Committee and the Chairman – and later the Chairwoman – of the Strategy and Technology Committee also held individual discussions with the Management Board in order to remain 05 abreast of significant developments and decisions within the Company. 06 07 The Supervisory Board convened in four ordinary meetings and four extraordinary meet08 ings during the year under review. All members of the Supervisory Board attended at least 09 half of the Supervisory Board meetings held over the period. 10 MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD 11 Sale of the Wireless Solutions unit to Intel 12 The Management Board reported in full on the proposed sale of the Wireless Solutions 13 business unit, which accounted for around 30 percent of Group revenue in the 2009 and 14 the 2010 fiscal year, in two ordinary meetings and two extraordinary meetings. The Super15 visory Board devoted particular attention in these meetings to the reasons behind the 16 Management Board’s decision to dispose of the mobile phone chip business, the different 17 transaction structures of relevance, the purchase price to be realized, the implications for 18 employees and the strategy and prospects for the Company’s remaining business activities. 19 The Supervisory Board asked the members of the Strategy and Technology Committee to 20 discuss the plans, developments in the negotiations and the steps necessary for realiza21 tion with the Management Board in detail in light of the great significance of the transaction for the whole Company. The Strategy and Technology Committee carried out thorough preparatory work for all deliberations on this matter involving the full Supervisory Board. Following a final round of intensive discussions with the Management Board in relation to the transaction, the Supervisory Board gave its consent to the sale of the Wireless Solutions business unit to Intel Corporation on August 25, 2010. I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o gi e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 R e p o r t o f t h e S u p e r v i s o r y B o a r d t o t h e G e n e r a l s h a r e h o l d e rs ’ M e e t i n g 87 01 02 03 The Supervisory Board supports the Management Board’s intention to focus Infineon’s 04 business on energy efficiency, mobility and security and shares the Management Board’s conviction that these already very prominent fields will become even more important over the years ahead. Transactions requiring approval 05 The Supervisory Board’s rules of procedure stipulate that certain transactions and 06 ­measures, specifically including financial and investment plans, the investment budget and the setting of borrowing limits, require the consent of the Supervisory Board. 07 08 The aforementioned sale of the Wireless Solutions business unit was considered by the 09 Supervisory Board in accordance with this requirement, as were the financial and invest10 ment plans and investment budget for the 2010 fiscal year, which were discussed on the basis of different scenarios for future revenue development in the Supervisory Board meetings on November 26, 2009 and August 4, 2010. The Supervisory Board also set a borrowing limit as part of this process. 11 12 Management Board compensation 13 14 The Supervisory Board considered in detail the provisions of the German Act on the 15 Appropriateness of Management Board Remuneration (Gesetz zur Angemessenheit der Vorstandsvergütung) and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code 16 relating to Management Board compensation and commissioned external independent 17 compensation experts to assess the compatibility of the existing compensation system 18 with these provisions and recommendations and drew up a modified Management Board 19 compensation system for the Company on the basis of this assessment. The proposals 20 put forward by the external experts were discussed in detail and prepared for approval by 21 the full Supervisory Board over the course of a number of Executive Committee meetings. The fundamentals of the new compensation system were then discussed in detail in the Supervisory Board meeting on August 4, 2010 and the system as a whole was approved in the meeting on November 22, 2010. Particulars of the new compensation system may be found in the compensation report, which appears in the Annual Report, starting page 102. The new compensation system will be submitted for approval by the 88 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o gi e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 R e p o r t o f t h e S u p e r v i s o r y B o a r d t o t h e G e n e r a l s h a r e h o l d e rs ’ M e e t i n g 01 02 03 2011 General Shareholders’ Meeting and is intended to apply to all future Management 04 Board members. The existing contracts with Management Board members Peter Bauer and Dr. Reinhard Ploss will be amended to bring them into line with the new compensation system. Management Board matters 05 The Supervisory Board decided in August 2009 to reduce the compensation due to former 06 Chief Executive Officer Dr. Wolfgang Ziebart following the entry into force of the German 07 Act on the Appropriateness of Management Board Remuneration. Constructive negotiations 08 with Dr. Ziebart led to agreement on a settlement reducing Dr. Ziebart’s pay and pensions 09 entitlements by an appropriate amount. The Supervisory Board discussed the content of this agreement and approved the conclusion of the settlement. 10 The Company is also close to concluding an arrangement with former Chief Executive Officer Dr. Ulrich Schumacher to settle various reciprocal claims. The Supervisory Board 11 approves of this arrangement having discussed the terms of the settlement thoroughly at 12 two meetings. The matters covered by the settlement include compensation claims lodged by the Company, so the conclusion of the agreement also requires the approval of the 13 General Shareholders’ Meeting. 14 15 Dr. Marco Schröter left the Management Board in August 2010 as a result of differences 16 of opinion concerning the Company’s future business policy. The Supervisory Board 17 addressed the situation with respect to the Management Board in detail in its August 4 18 meeting. A mutually acceptable solution covering his pay and pension entitlements and the cancellation of his contract was agreed with Dr. Schröter in September 2010. The Super­ 19 visory Board would like to thank Dr. Schröter for his efforts on behalf of Infineon. 20 21 Management Board member Prof. Dr. Hermann Eul is to assume the post of chief executive of the newly founded Intel Mobile Communications company in connection with the sale of Infineon’s mobile phone chip business to Intel. The Supervisory Board discussed and approved the terms for cancellation of the contract with Prof. Dr. Eul. The Supervisory Board would like to thank Prof. Dr. Eul for his very considerable service to the Company. Prof. Dr. Eul tackled the Wireless Solutions operation with enormous personal commitment and his methods have proved so effective that a business unit initially beset by financial difficulties has now attracted a purchase price of 1.4 billion U.S. dollars. I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o gi e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 R e p o r t o f t h e S u p e r v i s o r y B o a r d t o t h e G e n e r a l s h a r e h o l d e rs ’ M e e t i n g 89 01 02 03 The Executive Committee discussed the aforementioned matters and completed the 04 ­necessary preparatory work in advance of the associated resolutions by the full Super­ visory Board. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 05 The Supervisory Board reviewed the applicable corporate governance rules and their 06 implementation within the Company on a regular basis in the 2010 fiscal year just as in previous years. It discussed the changes to the German Corporate Governance Code adopted 07 by the Government Commission in May 2010 in its meeting on November 22, 2010, during 08 which it also specified concrete objectives regarding its composition in accordance with 09 the recommendation in section 5.4.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code. 10 The Supervisory Board adopted the 2009 Declaration of Compliance in accordance with section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) in November 2009 and the 2010 Declaration of Compliance in November 2010. The 2010 Declaration of Compliance 11 was published on the Company’s website on November 23, 2010. This and further details 12 of Infineon’s corporate governance are described in detail by the Management Board and 13 Supervisory Board in the Infineon Corporate Governance Report. 14 15 The Supervisory Board reviews the efficiency of its work, including its interaction with the Management Board, once a year. An external independent consultant was engaged in the 16 2010 fiscal year to conduct the first detailed survey of Supervisory Board activities. The 17 Supervisory Board engaged the external consultant in response to a suggestion from share18 holders. The consultant held confidential one-on-one interviews with all members of the 19 Supervisory Board and Management Board between July and September 2010. The work of 20 the Supervisory Board to date was analyzed on the basis of these interviews and recommen21 dations for its future operation were generated. The findings of the efficiency study were presented and discussed in the Supervisory Board meeting on November 30, 2010. 90 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o gi e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 R e p o r t o f t h e S u p e r v i s o r y B o a r d t o t h e G e n e r a l s h a r e h o l d e rs ’ M e e t i n g 01 02 03 The members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board disclose any conflicts 04 of interest to the Supervisory Board without delay. Material transactions between the Company and members of the Management Board or their close associates require the approval of the Supervisory Board. No conflicts of interest arose among the members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board in the 2010 fiscal year. 05 COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD 06 07 The Management Board instituted status proceedings in 2009 to reduce the Supervisory 08 Board from 16 members to twelve. The Supervisory Board thus now consists of six share09 holder representatives and six employee representatives. 10 The employee representatives were elected in December 2009. Mr. Wigand Cramer, Mr. Alfred Eibl, Mr. Peter Gruber, Mr. Gerhard Hobbach, Mr. Jürgen Scholz and Mr. Gerd Schmidt were elected. Ms. Kerstin Schulzendorf, Mr. Horst Schuler and Mr. Alexander Trüby 11 no longer sit on the Supervisory Board. 12 The term of office of the shareholder representatives expired at the end of the 2010 13 General Shareholders’ Meeting, which elected Prof. Dr. Renate Köcher, Prof. Dr. Doris 14 Schmitt-Landsiedel, Mr. Hans-Ulrich Holdenried, Dr. Manfred Puffer, Dr. Eckart Sünner and 15 Prof. Dr. Klaus Wucherer as the new shareholder representatives. Mr. Max-Dietrich Kley, 16 Dr. Siegfried Luther and Mr. Arnaud de Weert have left the Supervisory Board. 17 18 The term of office of the new Supervisory Board began at the end of the General Share­ holders’ Meeting on February 11, 2010 and runs until the end of the General Shareholders’ 19 Meeting that decides on the approval of the acts of the Supervisory Board during the 20 2013/2014 fiscal year. 21 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o gi e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 R e p o r t o f t h e S u p e r v i s o r y B o a r d t o t h e G e n e r a l s h a r e h o l d e rs ’ M e e t i n g 91 01 02 03 The Supervisory Board wishes to thank all of its former members for their constructive and 04 trusting contribution and would like to express its particular gratitude to its chairman of many years Max-Dietrich Kley, who always defended the Company’s interests through thick and thin with great personal dedication and commercial foresight. The constitutive meeting of the Supervisory Board on February 11, 2010 chose Prof. Dr. Klaus Wucherer as Supervisory Board Chairman and Gerd Schmidt as 05 Deputy Chairman. 06 The Supervisory Board has established the following committees: a Mediation Committee 07 in accordance with Section 27 (3) of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungs08 gesetz), an Executive Committee, an Investment, Finance and Audit Committee, a Strategy 09 and Technology Committee and the Nomination Committee recommended in the German 10 Corporate Governance Code. It has been decided by the Supervisory Board that all of its committees should have an equal number of employee representatives and shareholder representatives apart from the 11 Nomination Committee, which consists exclusively of shareholder representatives. 12 13 The Supervisory Board has elected Prof. Dr. Wucherer as Chairman of the Mediation Com14 mittee and the Nomination Committee, Dr. Sünner as Chairman of the Investment, Finance 15 and Audit Committee and Prof. Dr. Schmitt-Landsiedel as Chairwoman of the Strategy and Technology Committee. In accordance with the Supervisory Board rules of procedure, 16 the Chairman of the Executive Committee is the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, 17 Prof. Dr. Wucherer. 18 19 Prof. Dr. Wucherer intends to resign from the Supervisory Board on the day of the 20 2011 General Shareholders’ Meeting. The shareholder representatives on the Super­visory 21 Board decided on November 22, 2010 to propose to the General Shareholders’ Meeting that Mr. Wolfgang Mayrhuber be elected to the Supervisory Board as representative of the shareholders. Mr. Wolfgang Mayrhuber was nominated for the post of future Chairman of the Supervisory Board by the entire Supervisory Board at the same meeting. 92 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o gi e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 R e p o r t o f t h e S u p e r v i s o r y B o a r d t o t h e G e n e r a l s h a r e h o l d e rs ’ M e e t i n g 01 02 03 SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEE REPORTS 04 The Investment, Finance and Audit Committee convened in four ordinary meetings and two extraordinary meetings during the year under review. The committee’s activities centered on monitoring the financial reporting process, reviewing the quarterly financial statements, conducting the preliminary audit of the annual 05 financial statements, consolidated financial statements and combined Operating and 06 Financial Reviews, discussing the audit report with the auditor and reviewing and debating 07 the financial and investment plans and the borrowing limit. Other matters addressed by the 08 committee included the effectiveness of the internal control system, internal audit system 09 and risk management system and the Company’s compliance organization. 10 The committee’s duties also entailed specifying the key areas to be examined in audit activities in the 2010 fiscal year and monitoring the auditor’s independence and the additional services performed by the auditor. It prepared the Supervisory Board’s proposal to 11 the General Shareholders’ Meeting regarding the selection of the auditor and engaged the 12 auditor to audit the annual and consolidated financial statements and carry out the auditor’s review of interim financial reports. 13 14 The auditor attended all of the Audit Committee’s ordinary meetings and reported in detail 15 on its audit activities. 16 17 The Strategy and Technology Committee convened in four ordinary meetings and four 18 extraordinary meetings during the year under review. 19 The planned sale of mobile phone chip business dominated the committee’s work in the 20 year under review and the project was discussed in detail with the Management Board 21 in two ordinary meetings and four extraordinary meetings. The committee’s deliberations in this connection encompassed not only the Management Board’s proposal to withdraw from mobile phone chip business, but also the other options for this business area and the future direction and strategy of Infineon’s remaining business areas.

The Executive Committee convened in eight meetings in the year under review. The committee examined the external consultants’ proposals for a new Management Board compensation system thoroughly over the course of a number of meetings. It paid 05 particular attention to the appropriateness of the compensation, the extent to which the 06 new system was comparable with compensation in other companies and the structure of employee compensation, the design of variable compensation components, stock-based 07 long-term compensation components and pension provisions for the Management Board 08 in this process and carried out the preparatory work for a decision on these matters by the 09 full Supervisory Board. 10 The Executive Committee also completed the preparatory work for the Supervisory Board resolutions in relation to the aforementioned Management Board matters and selected an external consultant to evaluate the work of the Supervisory Board. 11 12 It addressed the low level of Supervisory Board compensation as compared with other 13 DAX 30 companies too and engaged an independent consultant to draw up proposals for 14 the revision of Supervisory Board compensation. It is intended that the revised Supervisory 15 Board compensation plan will be submitted for approval by the 2011 General Shareholders’ Meeting after consultation with the full Supervisory Board and the Management Board. 16 17 The committee recommended to the full Supervisory Board that the deductible in the D&O 18 insurance for the Supervisory Board be increased to bring it into line with a recommenda19 tion of the German Corporate Governance Code. 20 21 The Nomination Committee convened in four meetings in the year under review. Its meeting in October 2009 deliberated on the candidates to be put forward to the full Supervisory Board for proposal to the 2010 General Shareholders’ Meeting. 94 I n fi n e o n T e c h n o l o gi e s A n n u a l R e p o rt 2 0 10 R e p o r t o f t h e S u p e r v i s o r y B o a r d t o t h e G e n e r a l s h a r e h o l d e rs ’ M e e t i n g 01 02 03 The committee’s subsequent meetings dealt with the process to identify and select a suit04 able successor to Prof. Dr. Wucherer, who had publically announced prior to the General Shareholders’ Meeting that he intended to leave the Supervisory Board and surrender his position as its chairman in the occasion of the 2011 General Shareholders’ Meeting. Following a meticulous selection process, the committee engaged an international consultant to assist the Supervisory Board in identifying candidates and defined the individual steps in the process leading to the proposal of a candidate by the Supervisory Board at the 05 2011 General Shareholders’ Meeting. 06 07 Having completed its detailed deliberations, the committee was able to propose to 08 the Supervisory Board in November 2010 that Mr. Wolfgang Mayrhuber succeed 09 Prof. Dr. Wucherer as its chairman. 10 The Mediation Committee formed in accordance with section 27 (3) of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz) was not convened in the year under review. 11 The committee chairs presented regular and comprehensive reports to the full Supervisory 12 Board in the latter’s ordinary meetings. 13 14 ANNUAL AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15 16 KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, audited the annual financial statements 17 of Infineon Technologies AG and the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 18 2010 as well as the combined Operating and Financial Reviews of Infineon Technologies AG and of the Infineon Group and awarded them an unqualified audit opinion.

The Company deconsolidates a subsidiary when it loses the right to control the financial and operating policies of such entity and no longer benefits from such entity’s activities, e.g., through a sale of all or a portion of the shares of a subsidiary. Furthermore, for example, the Company could lose control of an entity that is subject to insolvency proceedings.

Since the delisting from the New York 03 Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the Infineon ADSs have been traded 04 over the counter on the OTCQX International Premier market as a sponsored Level 1 program.
