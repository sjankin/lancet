This index presents the list of indicators from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 Guidelines which were covered in our 2010 Sustainable Development Report, which achieved a GRI-checked application level of A+ for the third consecutive year. For all core indicators we provide the source indicating where you may find the corresponding information or, alternatively in some cases, the reasons for omission. We also provide information on some additional indicators. For more information on the GRI guidelines visit www.globalreporting.org We became a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact in 2004. This is a voluntary initiative that promotes good corporate practices in human and labor rights, the environment and anti-corruption. We are committed to its ten principles which are fully integrated into our Code of Ethics, our policies, and our sustainability approach. The index also presents a summary of our performance against the ten Global Compact’s principles in relation to the GRI indicators we reported in 2010.
