Six examples demonstrate how we ­create value – for BASF and for society. 1 Beauty at any age With the acquisition of Cognis, we are becoming the leading supplier of ingredients to the c ­ osmetics industry. 2 Eco-efficient diapers BASF’s Eco-Efficiency Analysis evaluates the sustainability of products and helps customers choose optimal solutions. 3 Sustainable coastal protection Elastocoast®, a composite of BASF specialty plastics and stone ballast, offers long-lasting erosion protection for coastlines and dikes. 4 The fun of learning In our host communities worldwide, BASF supports projects that aim to improve access to education and make learning fun. 5 Increasing crop yields BASF develops crops that are more resistant to drought. 6 The future of energy storage Together with partners from the fields of business and science, BASF is researching efficient battery materials for use in electric cars. 1 Beauty at any age TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS When it comes to cosmetics, every age has specific product ­requirements. This will lead to greater demand for new ­ingredients in the future. With the acquisition of Cognis, BASF is becoming the leading supplier of ingredients to the cosmetics industry. Our portfolio is not only now more diverse, it is also more cyclically robust. For more on the acquisition of Cognis, see page 57 onward • To our shareholders 7 Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors 10 Board of Executive Directors 12 BASF on the capital market BASF Report 2010 To our Shareholders Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors 7 Dr. Jürgen Hambrecht, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE The year 2010 was both eventful and successful. We took advantage of the strong economic upturn and put BASF on the right track for future success. We achieved record sales and earnings, but even more importantly, we once again earned a high premium on our cost of capital. And we are becoming even stronger thanks to our acquisitions of Ciba and Cognis as well as our innovations in future markets. The BASF team is continuing to write BASF’s success story – we can all be proud. I would like to thank all employees for their exceptional performance. The BASF share was also a winner in 2010: our shares reached a new all-time high in December. With an increase of 37.4% over the year, the BASF share significantly outperformed the key benchmark and industry indices. We are adhering to our ambitious dividend policy and will propose a dividend of €2.20 per share at the Annual Meeting an increase of 29% compared with the previous year. Overall, we have emerged from the economic crisis stronger, demonstrating that in recent years we have successfully implemented our long-term strategy for profitable growth and made our business more cyclically robust. 8 To our Shareholders Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors BASF Report 2010 Strengthening our portfolio In 2010, we made our portfolio even more oriented to our customers so that we can create sustainable value together. Our two major acquisitions have been crucial steps related to this: We rapidly and successfully integrated the former Ciba businesses and completed the purchase of Cognis at the end of 2010. This broadens our business with innovative activities that are growing faster than the industry average. At the end of 2010, we began the divestiture process with the carve-out of a large part of our styrenics activities. We plan to combine our business with that of INEOS in a 50-50 joint venture called Styrolution, thus creating a leading global styrenics company. “ Over the long term, companies that conduct business sustainably and act responsibly will be more successful than the competition. That is why sustainability has long been an integral part of BASF’s strategy.” Securing future growth In order to continue to grow profitably, we are active in growth markets. Between 2011 and 2015, we are planning investments of €12.6 billion, including projects with our strong partners. These include the expansion of our Verbund site in Nanjing, China, with Sinopec and investments in world-scale production plants for specialty chemicals in Malaysia with PETRONAS. Furthermore, we are also active in exploration and pipeline projects in the Oil & Gas segment, some with our partner Gazprom. In recent years, we have renewed our regional strategies and set ourselves ambitious goals: In Europe, Asia and North and South America, we want to grow faster than the market average and achieve sales of over €90 billion by 2020. Opening up future markets Through innovation, we open up new markets to help people deal with important future issues and pressing challenges: significant global population growth, rising demand for food, increasing urbanization and the growing consumption of raw materials and energy. We have therefore further increased our investments in research and development to nearly €1.5 billion. BASF Report 2010 To our Shareholders Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors 9 Our research and development is mainly concentrated on these challenges, with a focus on five growth clusters: plant biotechnology, white biotechnology, nanotechnology, energy management and raw material change. For example, we are working with partners from science and business to conduct research on materials and components for innovative battery systems for electromobility and electricity storage. Other areas include higher-yielding crops, new catalysts and processes to manufacture petrochemicals from alternative raw materials as well as processes to capture and use carbon dioxide as a synthesis building block. Overall, we are investing up to €350 million annually in research projects related to these growth clusters, amounting to 25% of our research and development expenditures. In 2015, we aim to generate sales of up to €8 billion with product innovations – new or improved products or applications that have been on the market for less than five years. Conducting business sustainably Over the long term, companies that conduct business sustainably and act responsibly will be more successful than the competition. That is why sustainability has long been an integral part of BASF’s strategy. We consider it our ongoing responsibility to continuously improve our business and we are committed to the implementation of the principles of the Global Compact. Our strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and our transparent reporting are recognized by investors: For the tenth year in succession, BASF has been included in the world’s most important sustainability index, the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World). We were also once again represented in the prestigious Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) and are now included in the new Carbon Performance Leadership Index (CPLI). We are very confident for 2011. Despite continuing risks, the global economy will grow moderately. At the same time, we are prepared for increasingly volatile markets and intensifying competition. This means: the winners will be those who are faster, more flexible and more successful than their competitors. We are convinced of our ability to master this challenge.

For example, after extensive planning, remediation began in 2010 at the former hazardous waste landfill Le Letten in eastern France, a contaminated site of a former Ciba location. Worldwide, BASF produced around 1.86 million metric tons of waste in 2010 (2009: 1.69 million metric tons). Oil and gas exploration accounted for 0.06 million metric tons. Around 48.5% of our waste was recycled or subjected to thermal recovery (2009: 42%); we aim to further increase this rate. The residual waste was disposed of by underground storage (15.8%), through incineration (50.5%) and by landfilling (33.7%).

Impairment losses are recognized when the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable value. Impairment testing relies upon long-term earnings predictions based on economic trends. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on the “Capital Asset Pricing Model” (CAPM) plays an important role. The WACC is made up of the risk-free interest rate, the beta of the BASF share as well as assumptions as to the spread for credit risk and the market risk premium for the cost of equity. Additional important assumptions are the predictions for the detailed planning period and the terminal growth rates used. For more information, see Note 12 from page 167 onward Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment: The estimated useful life and depreciation method chosen are based on historical values, plans and estimates. These estimates also consider the period and distribution of future cash inflows. The depreciation and amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date. Impairment tests on assets are required whenever certain triggering events indicate that an assessment is necessary.

Contracting and execution of derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes is conducted according to internal guidelines, and is subject to strict control mechanisms. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated using valuation models which use input parameters observable on the market. The valuation of some commodity derivatives, on the other hand, is based directly on market prices. In this way, fair values of minus €24 million in 2010 (2009: minus €25 million) were determined.

It is a problem for both farmers and consumers when crops do not produce the expected yield due to difficult environmental conditions. That is why BASF is working together with Monsanto on the development of stress-tolerant crops, such as corn (maize), that are more resistant to drought. This helps farmers to increase their crop yields and conserve water at the same time. For more on plant biotechnology, see page 72 supplementary information on oil and Gas Activities • Supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities 195 Supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities BASF Report 2010 Supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities 195 Supplementary information on oil and gas producing activities (unaudited) The following tables provide supplemental information on the The regions include the following countries with operational Exploration & Production business sector of the Oil & Gas seg­activities: ment.
