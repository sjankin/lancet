REPORT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 2010 The Concept of the Sustainability Flower What is the Sustainability Flower? The Sustainability Flower (SF) represents a communication and information management tool symbolizing the concept of sustainable development in its four dimensions (ecology with its six sub dimensions, societal life, cultural life, and economic life). It was developed within a network of international organizations from the organic – biodynamic – green – sustainable movement cooperating under the umbrella of the „International Association of Partnership“ (IAP). Each dimension has several Performance Aspects which themselves have different Performance Indicators (based on the GRI G3 of the Global Reporting Initiative) with specific targets. In the last years we learnt a lot through applying this concept to our work, also which Performance Aspects are easy to assess and which are not. Currently, we are adapting the Sustainability Flower framework according to our learnings, so that also other companies can make better use of the tool. From next year on we are going to report correspondingly. Why does SEKEM use the Sustainability Flower? • As an information source for all stakeholders of SEKEM (clients, employees, customers, investors, business partners, media etc.), the Sustainability Flower helps to disclose SEKEM’s self-concept as a responsible company and, thus, make it possible that SEKEM serves as a role model for other organizations that aim at sustainable development. • As a strategic management tool for collecting data on SEKEM’s economic, social, cultural and ecological performance, the SF helps aligning the organization to its vision, mission and policies. Most importantly, it supports management in setting targets, measuring progress, and identifying room for improvement. The performance of SEKEM is summarized in the Sustainable Development Scorecard (SDC, see page 7). The evaluation of the reached levels follows the methodology described on page 84ff. • The contribution of the individual SEKEM companies to the overall sustainable development of the SEKEM Holding becomes more clear and transparent after applying the Sustainable Development Scorecard also on company level (see page 64ff).

Although this will demand challenging adjustments on many different levels from our side, we are happy and excited about the coming time. SEKEM has dreamed of a better Egypt since the beginning. Now, Egyptians throughout the whole country are willing and full of enthusiasm to bring about change, longing for a better life and a promising future. Our goal will be to fill the current vacuum of disorientation, another effect of the sudden uprising, with a strong vision for sustainable development. What makes us so confident facing these new developments is an extremely successful business year 2010 that clearly shows the pay-off of our constant efforts in the field of sustainable development. With this fourth Report on Sustainable Development, we would like to share with you our progress, as well as our challenges, in relation to each of the four dimensions of sustainable development: Economic Life, Societal Life and Cultural Life, embedded in our planet’s Ecology. Given our experience in the field of sustainability reporting we focus much more on our weaknesses this year. We perceive 2010 as an important milestone in our sustainable development reporting activities as the first threeyear cycle of target setting has come to an end. We definitely learned how to improve our target setting process and will apply this in the upcoming period. We succeeded in matching our Sustainability Flower with the GRI standard as well as with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. For the year 2011, we are planning to focus on further developing and revising our reporting in accordance with the Sustainability Flower. Also we want to explore further potential to align our reporting to the recently published ISO 26000 guidelines. We have made big steps in 2010 in all of the four sustainability dimensions. Our economic performance has improved: sales reached the target and increased by 15.7% with a profit margin of 7.9%. Besides of that, we have developed our sustainability risk assessment and gap analysis on a company level, as well as monitoring and strict alignment to our sustainability strategy. Our cultural activities were highlighted by the first bachelor graduates in eurhythmy in the whole of Egypt. Moreover, we have 17 running R&D projects in various different topics such as phyto-pharmaceuticals, soil-born pathogens and the development of educational materials for Egyptian schools. We are additionally facing the challenge of enhancing a fully implemented one-year training plan for every single employee. Our societal and political involvement has focused on the empowerment of social workers in all companies, as well as continuous gender empowerment. As for our ecological impact, we are strictly adhering to the Demeter standard of cultivation and keeping animals. Furthermore, we succeeded in starting our own seed and seedling production and sales; these are extremely resistant to pests and the like and decrease the need for pesticides and chemical fertilizers in conventional agriculture. Although our ecological footprint is – compared to conventional agricultural cultivation and companies – relatively low, we are still aiming to decrease it further, mostly through assessment, monitoring and evaluation of our full impact in order to implement comprehensive long-term solutions that adhere to best-practice standards. This is the beginning of a new era in Egypt; our country will change and we in SEKEM will do our very best to steer this change towards a more sustainable future and provide a living example for long-term competitiveness.

We see it regulations is currently low for SEKEM. as our duty and opportunity to get involved in this momentum on national and international levels. 8 SEKEM Report on Sustainable Development 2010 ECONOMIC LIFE Modern societies worldwide are characterized mainly by the division of labor in economic activity. Through cooperation, values are created and exchanged as products and services. In this exchange, it is essential that those creating these values are rewarded for their effort with a fair income enabling them to achieve and to improve such results also in the future. Therefore, the establishment of a worldwide cooperative network of value creation, accumulating values for fair interchange relations, is fundamental for sustainable development of the economy. Management Approach All SEKEM companies conduct their businesses in a control and of all qualitatively relevant processes, as responsible and ethical way. well as the enhancement of customer satisfaction. We aim for the highest product quality based More on the product level, we comply with a range exclusively on organic raw materials. We always take of standards like Fairtrade, International Demeter a long-term perspective towards our development Standards and Global Gap. Our currency is not and give a high priority to the preservation of nature reduced to financial figures. We measure success for future generations. Our strong goals can only throughout all dimensions of the Sustainability Flower. be achieved by building long-lasting partnerships This extensive performance evaluation framework throughout our supply chain. That’s why we are with all the Performance Aspects and related committed to supporting our suppliers in satisfying monitoring of key performance indicators is our way our qualitative, social and environmental requirements to address the precautionary approach (Article 15 of so that they may therefore receive their appropriate the Rio Principles) and is part of our risk management. share in the value creation.

How can we be economically self-sufficient and competitive? How can we design sustainable products and services? How can we grow without necessarily increasing resource consumption and pollution? ECONOMIC LIFE Growth through Desert Reclamation The acquisition of new desert lands in Sinai, Bahareya and Minya were important elements of our long-term strategy. It goes hand in hand with our rationale to focus on our own growth through supply security and further improved quality. That is why the overall investments over the last three years exceeded 200 mio EGP. About 100 mio EGP were invested in aquiring the estates for the new farms, which means into SEKEM for Land Reclamation. By the end of 2010, SEKEM has cultivated in total 1,628 feddan (684 hectares) of fertile soils of which 86% belongs to new farmland. The most essential Farm in Minya. investments in 2010 went into new land and the further reclamation of desert land. Overall Investments of SEKEM, EGP (‘000) 94,327 68,781 62,377 Farm in Bahareya. Note: In addition to the scope of the report the investment figures also include the SEKEM laboratories that are mainly relevant for the management of land. SEKEM’s long-term success is only viable through the constant pursuance and integration of sustainable development in all its activities and initiatives. Biodynamic agriculture is the basis of SEKEM’s approach to sustainable development. Without sustainable agriculture, common agricultural practice in the world will deprive nature from its natural resources, consume all its nutrients and will Sinai farm in January 2008 Sinai farm in June 2009 leave exhausted land behind. Indirect consequences are intensified climate change, increased poverty soil carbon sequestration, guarantees food supply and and thereby increased food insecurity. Biodynamic thereby food security and livelihoods. Biodynamic agriculture however builds up solid matter in soils agriculture therefore guarantees the long-term and closes the nutrient cycle to counter leaching, existence of SEKEM and its surrounding communities. erosion and soil degradation. Consequently, soil Agriculture however cannot be reduced solely to its can be cultivated endlessly which provides jobs and economic basis. The term “culture” in agriculture is thereby incomes, counters climate change through a very important element as it points to the human 10 SEKEM Report on Sustainable Development 2010 ECONOMIC LIFE Mother farm and Adleya (263 feddan = 110.46 ha): At the mother farm clover, verbascum, chamomile and wheat have been cultivated on the open field.

It is often neglected or overlooked Egypt consists of over 95% desert which leaves less that this essential part of sustainable agriculture also than 0.02 feddan (= 84 m2) arable land per person needs a lot of financial resources. for over 85 million people. The population grows annually by 2% on average, which raises the question of future food security in Egypt. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that, according to SEKEM cultivated area of the latest World Bank figures, approx. 20% of the agricultural land by farm Egyptian population lives below the national poverty line. 8% Desert land reclamation is, therefore, not only an 6% SEKEM “Motherfarm” option but a necessary strategic approach of Egypt 32% SEKEM Adleya to increase Egypt’s resources of arable land.

Besides this fee, to retain current levels of self-sufficiency to prevent water is practically free of charge. According to the dependency on exchange rates and the volatile World Bank online database the energy price is kept international food markets. artifically even lower as these subsidies constitute almost 5% of GDP. Both subsidies support the inefficient use of water and energy while it hides the efficiency advantages of biodynamic agriculture due to its better soil structure and the use of organic instead of chemical, energy-intensive fertilizers and pesticides.

Access and affordability: The rural areas, where the greatest yield increases could be achieved Agriculture has significant climate change mitigation through eco-intensification methods, are often potential. The most widely discussed way to do so is the same regions where poverty and hunger are through soil carbon sequestration. The soil sequestration widespread. Increased yields therefore directly potential depends greatly on the initial carbon levels tackle access to food and nourish the farming of the soil and on management practices including the population. As sustainable farming systems are intensity of organic inputs. This is why carbon depleted more labor intensive, a substantial amount of jobs soils like the desert have outstandingly high carbon would be created which, in turn, would enable sequestration potential. many more people to buy foodstuffs for their Organic agriculture has particularly high soil carbon families. sequestration rates. The optimum scenario of an FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)-estimation The SEKEM farms are all located in rather poor mirrors the result of organic farming, with reduced rural areas. With the employment of thousands tillage on arable land with an additional sequestration of workers and tens of thousands of seasonal rate of 500kg C/ha/year compared to a business-asworkers, SEKEM and its suppliers alleviate usual conventional agricultural production. Long-term poverty, which is an important aspect of food comparative field trials in temperate regions of the USA security. have shown carbon sequestration rates of 1000kg and 2000kg C/ha/year – notably, additional to conventional agriculture. These rates are achieved when high levels of cover crops and compost are used in conjunction with appropriate tillage operations. SEKEM carbon sequestration levels are around 1000kg C/ha/year. A study by IFOAM in 2004 estimated the sequestration potential of agricultural soils under various organic agriculture management practices. The impressive result is, that with the highest standards for soil fertility building and conservation (respectively 2000kg C/ha/year) and 100% conversion of all agricultural land to organic agriculture, 32% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions can be sequestered – notably, above business as usual conventional agricultural production. While this seems to be a utopian number and an unrealistic goal, it, nonetheless, is an aspiration level that has to be known in climate politics so that appropriate policies can be taken which might include the desirable wide-reaching political and economic support of organic agriculture.

The principles of sustainable development now prevail in all areas of our life. It is a question of survival – our survival and the survival of future generations.There can be no improvement of living standards in ruined environments. The year 2010 was the “last of its kind” as we are now in an era “after the Egyptian Rebellion”. Not only the external circumstances will change for SEKEM, but also internally, adjustments and compromises have to be made to adapt to the new environment. 2010 was an extremely successful and in this regard encouraging year and this report shows that we are more and more managing to live up to our standards of being a sustainable development initiative through and through. But the 25th of January also showed us what we all theoretically know but tend to forget in a generally professionalized and efficiency-oriented business life: that there are historical event that cannot be grasped by any however sustainably and holistically oriented gap analysis or risk assessment; and that nevertheless this unexpected and still in various regards inconceivable event might enable the biggest shift towards sustainable development, much more influential than any company-internal reporting procedure could ever be. 62 SEKEM Report on Sustainable Development 2010 CHAIRMAN’S EPILOGUE During the last decade academics, poets and phiprocesses of transformation and change must be losophers from the Arab world have created with understood, respected and supported. their works a spiritual and intellectual basis for A positive spiritual complement is important. a change that starts with a new way of thinking.

Report on the consolidated financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of SEKEM Holding for Investment Company – S.A.E., which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of 31. December 2010, and the consolidated statements of income, changes in equity and cash flow for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. Management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s management as management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Egyptian accounting standards and in the light of relevant Egyptian laws and regulations. The management’s responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. This responsibility also includes selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditor’s responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. Except as mentioned in the basis of qualification paragraph (a), we conducted our audit in accordance with Egyptian standards on auditing and in the light of relevant Egyptian laws and regulations. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatements. The consolidated financial statements of the company for the year ended 31. December 2009 were audited by another auditor whose report dated 30. April 2010 expressed a qualified opinion on these consolidated financial statements, regarding inability to obtain appropriate and sufficient audit evidence to assess the adequacy of provisions for probable obligations. Also, two subsidiaries of the Group (ISIS for food processing Co., LOTUS for organic products Co.) applied the international accounting standard No. 17 “Leases” instead of the Egyptian Accounting Standard No. 20 “Accounting for Finance Leases”, which constitutes a departure from the Egyptian Accounting Standards. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statement. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. BDO Khaled& Co 82 SEKEM Report on Sustainable Development 2010 ANNEX Basis of qualified opinion a) As mentioned in Note (11) to the consolidated financial statements, although seven of the subsidiary companies “SEKEM Holding for Investment Company, SEKEM Laboratories for Organic Products, NATURETEX for Clothes Company, ATOS Company for Herbal Medicine Manufacturing, LIBRA Organic Cultivation, ISIS for Food Processing, and LOTUS for Organic Products Company” provided for claim provisions by L.E. 7,842,810 as of 31 December 2010 (2009: 3,365,225), however we do not have sufficient information to determine the nature of the provision for and whether it is adequate or not. b) As mentioned in Note (17) to the consolidated financial statements, four of the subsidiary companies “ISIS for Food Processing, and LOTUS for Organic Products Company, NATURETEX for Clothes Company, ATOS Company for Herbal Medicine Manufacturing” account for the sale and lease-back arrangements in accordance with the International Accounting Standard No. 17 Leases, which constitutes a departure from the Egyptian Accounting Standard No. 20 “Accounting for Finance Leases”, which require that all lease arrangements to be accounts for, by the lessee, as operating leases. As such had EAS 20 been applied from the date those arrangements were entered into, net profits for the year ended 31. December 2010 would have been reduces by L.E. 1.8 million (2009: L.E. 2.4 million) while the beginning balance of retained earnings would have been reduced by L.E. 4.3 million (2009: L.E. 1.8 million). Qualified Opinion In our opinion, except for the effect of the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph on the consolidated financial statements, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of SEKEM Holding for Investment Company – S.A.E. as of 31. December 2010, and its consolidated financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Egyptian Accoundint Standards and the light of relevant Egyptian laws and regulations. Emphasis of Matter Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention that two subsidiaries of the Group “LOTUS Upper Egypt for Organic Products Co., and Organic & More Egypt Co.” had accumulated losses amounting to L.E 4.5 million as of 31. December 2010 which exceeded 50% of their paid up capital resulting in a deficiency of assets amounting to L.E. 2.8 million, which indicates that these subsidiaries will not be able to meet their liabilities as they fall due. However, the financial statements have been prepared under the going concern concept. According to Article No. 69 of the Companies Law No. 159 of 1981, an Extraordinary General Assembly Meeting is required to be held to decide on the continuity of the two subsidiary companies. Taha M.

It is important to know that the criteria given in the tables express MINIMUM requirements for a specific classification. While ‘green’ stands for excellence, ‘yellow’ covers a potentially broad range from initial steps up to significant engagement. The targets presented in the Status and Target Overview sections are related to the SEKEM Sustainable Development Scorecard (SDSC) but are evaluated independently. A ‘green’ SDSC evaluation does not necessarily mean that we have achieved all our targets and vice versa.

It includes the principles of accountability, transparency, materiality, stakeholder engagement and reporting. Biodynamic agriculture Biodynamic agriculture is a method of organic farming that treats farms as unified and individual organisms, with emphasis on balancing the holistic development and interrelationship of the soil, plants, animals as a closed, selfnourishing system. Carbon Footprint The total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2e). CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e) Carbon dioxide equivalents provide a universal standard of measurement against which the impacts of releasing (or avoiding the release of) different greenhouse gases can be evaluated. Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a network-based organization that has pioneered the development of the world’s most widely used sustainability reporting framework and is committed to its continuous improvement and application worldwide. Low-carbon economy A low-carbon economy is a concept that refers to an economy that has a minimal output of greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. carbon dioxide) into the biosphere. Stakeholder A stakeholder is a person, a group, organization, or system who affects or can be affected by an organization’s actions. Sustainability Flower The Sustainability Flower is a framework for a holistic perspective on sustainability performance and communication for food and agriculture-related companies. Its design is based on the GRI principles and was developed in cooperation with the IAP companies. Threefold order The threefold order is a sociological theory developed by Rudolf Steiner. It distinguishes between three realms of society: the economy, politics & human rights and cultural institutions. According to Steiner the three can only function together in harmony if each is granted sufficient independence. “True cost” prices True cost pricing attempts to include negative externalities (e.g. environmental, economic and social costs) of products and services into the price for the consumer and thereby arrive at the “true costs”. Turnover (Employment) Employment turnover is the rate at which an employer gains and loses employees. UN Global Compact The UN Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption. By doing so, business, as a primary agent driving globalization, can help ensure that markets, commerce, technology and finance advance in ways that benefit economies and societies. 13-villages project The 13-villages project was an EU-funded social development project for the 13 villages in the surrounding area of SEKEM including trainings on hygiene, medical services and waste management. 94 SEKEM Report on Sustainable Development 2010 ANNEX Abbreviations BoD Board of Directors CEO Chief Executive Officer CFO Chief Financial Officer CO2 Carbon dioxide COO Chief Operating Officer CPO Cotton People Organic COP15 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change CSE Cooperative of SEKEM Employees DEG Deutsche Entwicklungsgesellschaft EBDA The Egyptian Biodynamic Association EGP Egyptian Pound ENCC Egyptian National Competitiveness Council EU European Union Expolink Egyptian Exporters Association FAO Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FDA Famers Development Association Feddan 1 feddan = 0.42 hectare FLO Fairtrade Labeling Organization GA General Assembly GDP Gross Domestic Product GERPI Genetic Resources Policy Initiative Egypt GMP Good Manufacturing Practice GRI Global Reporting Initiative Gt Giga tonnes HQ Headquarters HR Human Relations IAP International Association for Partnership IMC Industrial Modernization Center ISO International Organization for Standardization IT Information Technology kg Kilogram kWh Kilowatt hour MENA Middle East North Africa mio Million NGO Non-Governmental Organization NOP National Organic Program NREA New & Renewable Energy Authority OHSAS Occupational Health & Safety Standards PR Public Relations R&D Research & Development SDF SEKEM Development Foundation SESC SEKEM Environmental Science Center TUEV Technischer Überwachungsverein / Technical Inspection Association UNIDO United Nations Industrial Development Organization WEF World Economic Forum WFC World Future Council SEKEM Report on Sustainable Development 2010 95 Imprint Issuer/Publisher SEKEM Holding for Investment Company S.A.E.
