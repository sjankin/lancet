Thought Leadership Banyan Tree continued to promote sustainable business practices by engaging academic, business, and thought leaders to explore issues and implement solutions. Besides helping enable the Caux Round Table Global Dialogue in Beijing, Banyan Tree Global Foundation organised a number of Distinguished Lectures and Dialogue sessions attended by some 330 people. Group-wide Efforts Over the course of the year, Banyan Tree also took significant steps in the group wide initiatives of Resource Conservation, Greening Communities, and Seedlings. Resource Conservation Expanding upon Banyan Tree Lijiang’s in depth and successful pilot, we began a phased roll out of the EarthCheck sustainability benchmarking and certification program. In 2010, the number of resorts under the EarthCheck program grew from one resort up to 13 resorts (see page 12-13 for a complete list) working towards EarthCheck benchmarking and certification, with Banyan Tree Lijiang in pursuit of Silver Certification for the fourth year in a row, and five others (Banyan Tree Ringha, Banyan Tree Bintan, Banyan Tree Ungasan, Angsana Bintan, and Angsana Velavaru) achieving Bronze Benchmarked status. Greening Communities In 2010, our resorts planted 46,980 trees across 17 resorts (up from 12 in 2009), well beyond our target of 34,000 for the year. This brought our four year total to 96,673 trees planted, exceeding the four year cumulative target of 96,000 trees. Seedlings In 2010, the University of Wales team once again conducted mentor training to ensure we had the internal capabilities to train our future mentors as the first step of the year’s expansion. Another four properties then joined the Seedlings effort and we added 20 new young people under mentorship and scholarship across the group. By the end of the year, Seedlings participation included 11 resorts, 12 internal mentor trainers, 46 young people, 46 active mentors, and 43 more associates already trained to be mentors. International Recognition Our sustainability journey once again attracted international acclaim this year. Acclaim for our sustainability efforts this year included: > Winning the World Travel Awards 2010 in the World’s Leading CSR Programme category > Most Transparent Company in the Hotel and Restaurant category of the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) Investor’s Choice Awards, for the fourth year running Condé Nast Traveler World Savers Awards 2010 Banyan Tree was named Overall Winner for large hotel chains as well as runner-up in the Health Initiatives category, and received honourable mentions for Education Programs, Preservation – Environmental and/or Cultural, and Wildlife Conservation. Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2010 3 “The global tourism industry has both the potential to destroy through insensitive Executive development, the very source of its existence, or to create a symbiotic relationship Chairman’s with our natural environment, preserving and enhancing it for future generations to enjoy. There is another dimension to the relationship between tourism and the Statement environment, however, which I would like to touch upon here. Our interpretation of the concept “environment” is that it has two dimensions: the physical environmental and the human environment. Much of the world’s concern has been with the former: the preservation of the flora and fauna and biological ecosystems around us. But the human environment is also vital, and it is a contradiction particularly affecting resort development in the Developing World. This is the disparity in lifestyles and living standards between those who relax in our resorts and those who build them or work in them. Resorts in the Developing World have both the potential to be agents of social and economic development in less developed areas, or as a source of friction and alienation within the local community.” When I spoke those words some 18 years ago, the concept of Banyan Tree was in its earliest infancy. Since that time, we have not only launched Banyan Tree, but we have built it into a global hospitality company defining sustainability as the creation of long term value for multiple stakeholders and destinations. We have also experienced challenges such as natural calamities like the Indian Ocean tsunamis of 2004; global pandemics like SARS, bird flu, and H1N1; and financial meltdowns of both a regional and global level. Yet the crux of the matter remains constant: business needs to make the shift from shareholder driven to become stakeholder driven. If the global business community cannot affect that shifted mindset, we as corporations will be undercutting the very raison d’être of business: to create value for stakeholders. Only while in pursuit of creating value can businesses succeed in the long term. Hence, we must remember the simple, but all too easily forgotten truism: the mission of business is to build a better society for us all. Such truism extends beyond the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and should be a beacon for all businesses, to consider how collaborative efforts with communities can unlock value for shareholders and stakeholders alike while safeguarding the latent value within our ecosystems. Yours Sincerely, Ho KwonPing Executive Chairman, Banyan Tree Holdings “We must remember the simple, but all too easily forgotten truism: the mission of business is to build a better society for us all.” Mr Ho KwonPing, Executive Chairman, Banyan Tree Holdings 4 Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2010 Welcome to our fifth Banyan Tree Sustainability Report! Amid the dynamism of Banyan Tree the current global setting, it feels quite fitting to reiterate some of the key concepts Global Foundation and themes touched upon over our past reports. Chairperson’s In 2006, it was the concept that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is not just about Statement philanthropy or monetary donations. It is about doing good even as companies seek profitability. It is about creating value for a community, no matter if those community members are neighbours to the company, suppliers to the company, customers of the company, or employed by the company. Through partnerships with aligned organisations, businesses can create more value that the sum of the individual parts involved. In 2007, we discussed the need to harness core competencies to enhance the value we can provide for community and environmental initiatives. Furthermore, business has the massive potential and power to facilitate and create change through product offering as well as something as simple as purchasing power. In 2008, the values of CSR and sustainability were suggested as preventative measures that, when embedded and embraced by the business community, could restrain the excesses which stressed our global financial systems to the point of near collapse. In any case, the values of social responsibility provide a formula for harmonising the constructive and beneficial outcomes of individual enterprise with the interests of stakeholders. In 2009, we looked to the values of Sustainability as the core to a new concept of “Communitarian Capitalism” whereby success for a business is defined upon the triple bottom line of financial, social, and environmental success. This very Communitarian Capitalism can provide the framework for a free market system to reach a more true potential of value creation, whereby society at large prospers as whole. Now that we have closed the books on our fifth Sustainability Report, we invite you to review our progress over the years, from discussing our efforts to quantifying the impacts of our internal as well as external efforts. We invite you to review this as well as our past Sustainability Reports (all available in soft copy via www.banyantree.com/ csrpublications) to see the progression we have made along our ongoing journey in pursuit of sustainability. Yours Sincerely, Claire Chiang Chairperson, Banyan Tree Global Foundation “While markets have bounced back somewhat, has our collective mindset progressed enough to realise we need a more thoughtful

Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2010 9 Embracing the Environment As safeguarding the environment is central to Projects by Locations Banyan Tree’s goal of sharing the original beauty of any of our locations with our guests, we have implemented numerous site and region specific initiatives to support and instill environmental awareness among our associates, our guests, and the local communities supporting our resorts. Meliopona Bee – Mayakoba To protect the endangered Mayan Stingless Bee (Melipona Bee) and an important part of the Mayan tradition and culture while also providing local communities with additional incomes, Banyan Tree Mayakoba’s Melipona Bee project promotes bee husbandry in neighbouring communities. Since opening, Banyan Tree Mayakoba has provided materials and training for local communities to traditionally keep and harvest bee colonies. In December 2010, Banyan Tree purchased the first harvest for development into upcoming signature Banyan Tree Spa treatments. Seafood Savers Program – Ungasan Banyan Tree Ungasan joined a core group of companies in Indonesia to focus on marine fisheries and the sustainable seafood under WWF Indonesia’s Seafood Savers initiative. A big part of this effort will be to raise the profile of sourcing from sustainable fisheries and seafood suppliers using sustainable practices. Awareness Activities – Bintan Banyan Tree and Angsana Bintan expanded their complimentary environmental themed guest activities to include guided Nature Walks, a guided Tree Trek, and guided Bird Watching sessions. All conducted by the Banyan Tree Bintan Conservation Lab, these are in addition to regularly scheduled presentations covering the local flora and fauna of both marine and land based conservation efforts. Monitoring Flora & Fauna – Mayakoba Banyan Tree Mayakoba’s Environmental Management System includes a Fauna Management Program which tracks and records all animal sightings within or nearby the resort grounds. As a part of the wider Mayakoba development effort, Banyan Tree is also active in sea turtle protection efforts monitoring and awareness. The overall monitoring effort has recorded a 500% increase in species sighting recordings from the first recording before development of the Mayakoba complex. Conservation Presentations and Guided Walks – Bintan In addition to paid recreational activities including a guided coral safari and coral planting, Banyan Tree Bintan expanded its complimentary environmental themed guest activities to include guided Nature Walks, a guided Tree Trek, and guided Bird Watching sessions. These are in addition to the complimentary regularly scheduled conservation presentations covering the local flora and fauna and issues facing both marine and land based conservation efforts in the immediate vicinity and region. All such sessions are regularly scheduled up to four times per week and are led by the dedicated team from the Banyan Tree Bintan Conservation Lab. 10 Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2010 NUS Research – Bintan Banyan Tree Bintan’s Conservation Lab hosted visiting research teams including National University of Singapore Marine Biology lecturer Dr. James Guest to study coral, including its growth and reproduction, as well as the genetic connectivity of corals in Bintan, Singapore, and other South East Asian reefs. This ongoing partnership included presentations to hotel guests and associates during each of the multiple visits, and has laid the foundation for the Lab to host increased and wider ranging research studies. 5,000 Bird Monitoring – Bintan Fish released As avian populations are generally good indicators for the health of an ecosystem, the Banyan Tree Bintan Conservation Lab conducted an initial bird survey from June to September. Some 41 different species were recorded in and around the resort grounds, establishing the basis for free bird watching sessions led by the Conservation Lab team. Vermicompost – Phuket Banyan Tree Phuket launched an onsite vermicompost effort to help naturally process organic, food, and garden waste to both reduce solid waste sent to landfill as well as 571 provide fertile topsoil for onsite nurseries, gardens, and landscaping. Turtles released Fish Release – Hangzhou As part of an Earth Day celebration with the local Forestry Bureau, guests, suppliers, and media, Banyan Tree Hangzhou released some 5,000 indigenous Crucian, Chub and Herring fish into the wetland canals surrounding the resort. With presentations discussing the importance of these native fish to keep the waters clean and control the growth of algae and mosquitoes, this session reinforced with the strict ecological guidelines to preserve the natural diversity of the Xixi National Wetlands. Community Clean Up Days – Mayakoba, Bintan, Phuket, Seychelles, Ungasan Banyan Tree associates also continued to conduct an array of local community and habitat clean up sessions. In Mayakoba, this translated to an associate beach cleaning day at the Sian Ka’an Biosphere Reserve, where data about the amount and types of waste collected was forwarded to Ocean Conservancy. In Seychelles, the quarterly Wetlands Cleanups continued, involving local schools and associates. Bintan’s associates have an array of options for environmentally themed volunteer activities which range from beach cleanups to herb gardening sessions. Banyan Tree Ungasan’s effort was transformed into a monthly competition recognising the associate who collects the most trash. Since it started in July 2010, this effort has collected and removed some 100kg of trash, or over 100 large trash bags, from the surrounding community area. Turtle Conservation – Samui, Seychelles, Bintan, Phuket Turtle Conservation – Samui, turtle eggs laid on its shores, while ensuring Seychelles, Bintan, Phuket 466 young turtles emerged to start their ocean Identifying sea turtles as a key species to journey in 2010.

Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2010 15 Empowering People Seedlings Launched in 2007, Seedlings is a group-wide initiative to enhance the long term prosperity of communities by building the capacities of young people. A holistic approach for nurturing youths at risk of societal exclusion, Seedlings aims to provide young people with the motivation and means for completing their education and to successfully enter the labour force as adults via three pillars: 1. Mentorship – the first phase of the programme, mobilises associates from Banyan Tree resorts to inspire youths between the age of 12 and 18 to achieve what previously might have been beyond their means. To effectively mentor youths, associates from Banyan Tree resorts undergo training conducted by the University of Wales which has facilitated national mentoring schemes in over five countries. 2. Scholarships – youths who cannot afford to continue their education. 3. Internships – Upon completion of school and after becoming a young adult, optional internships provide job training and valuable work experience in the participating resort’s operational areas such as housekeeping, food and beverage, engineering, frontline customer service, marketing, reservations, procurement, security or landscape architecture. In 2008, Seedlings completed its first full school year, and we took the occasion to review the effectiveness of our efforts. Initial feedback from the participating youths included encouraging reviews such as “I feel livelier and hope to be a successful person”, “I want to be like my mentor, a successful person”, and “My mentor made me more enthusiastic about studying. I hope that my future will be better than before, so that I can make my parents happy”. However, a more formal review of the impacts of our Seedlings initiative was conducted through a survey of not only the youths but also their mentors, parents and teachers. This survey prompted additional enhancements to the programme such as adding structured topics akin to a curriculum for the mentors and youths to follow. Following this, our teams scheduled activities to touch on 4 key areas: Social, Environmental, Academic Interests, and Health & Sports. 2007 2008 Seedlings is launched with 19 participating Expanding to 24 participating young people, young people from Banyan Tree Phuket, Seedlings completes its first full year.

The GIF mechanism aims to widen the reach and effectiveness of the company’s efforts by providing CSR Funds critical financial support to worthy environmental action and community based projects where Banyan Tree has a presence. At Banyan Tree branded properties, every guest is invited to be a supporting partner through a small contribution of US$2 per room night, under an “opt-out” arrangement. At Angsana properties, the amount is US$1 per room per night. Our hotels then match these guest contributions, dollar for dollar, under the GIF mechanism. To furthermore link the performance of the resorts with contributions to the contributions to our Group CSR fund, each property must maintain a contribution level of at least 1% of its profit. Combined with the mechanisms to match each guest’s US$2/US$1 per room per night, the level of the resort’s contribution will at times exceed the amount of guest contribution for that year, but the amount the hotel contributes will never be lower than the guest contribution. Resort Autonomous CSR Budget Each year, every property is given an Autonomous CSR budget for the year amounting to 20% of their previous year collection and contribution though the GIF mechanism. This fund can be spend at the complete discretion of the property’s General Manager and CSR Champion with the following 3 prohibitions: > purchasing turndown gifts for guests, > paying service charge to associates, > paying wages. Eligibility Projects eligible for funding are those which support communities or environmental issues around the group’s properties. A maximum of 20% of the expense can be used for administrative purposes, while the bulk of the funding must directly support the beneficiaries. Banyan Tree Global Foundation oversees the finances of our Group CSR Fund, allocating funding to worthy projects.

The three main pillars will remain in alignment with external efforts focusing on both biodiversity and capacity building as well as internal efforts focused on operational efficiency. External Focus Greening Communities We have planted a four year total of 96,673 trees across a total of 17 resorts participating, compared with a four year total target of 96,000 trees. We look forward to continuing to plant more trees and welcome more resorts to participate, but most of all, we look forward to continuing to work with local communities to raise awareness about climate issues. Seedlings Even as we conducted the additional mentor training to enable our volunteer mentors, we also expanded the effort to include 4 more resorts participating. We will continue to expand Seedlings to include more resorts, more young people, and more mentors. Promoting Sustainability As we continue arranging our Banyan Tree Global Foundation Distinguished Lectures and Dialogue sessions, we look forward to helping inspire innovative solutions and implementations across industries. We are also excited to test pilot a number of efforts to build into easily executable programmes which other hotels and/or businesses focused on sustainability can implement. Internal Focus Efficiency While ramping up the implementation of the EarthCheck system to reach 13 resorts in 2010, we look forward to pursuing achievements from those already active within EarthCheck, while also expanding EarthCheck participation. We are also eager to follow the continued progress of Banyan Tree Lijiang as it pursues maintaining Silver Certified status for another consecutive year. New Resort Design As Banyan Tree continues its global expansion, we look forward to an ongoing effort to enhance the internal processes focusing on sustainable design. A newly formed internal Green Design Audit framework and process should begin to embed and demonstrate standards for design from both the overall global perspective as well as within tourism and hotel specific standards. Governance In addition to our ongoing efforts in the areas of enhanced transparency and governance, we expect our expanded EarthCheck efforts to deliver third party verified results which will feed into our internal goal of continual improvement. Supporting Research While we have worked with many institutional and individual researchers, we look forward to a continued formalisation of our collaborative efforts with such bodies so we can better contribute to the overall scientific body of knowledge. While efforts will naturally gravitate to sites with dedicated facilities like the Banyan Tree Maldives Marine Labs and the Banyan Tree Bintan Conservation Lab, we continue seeking to connect all of our resorts with leading researcher efforts. Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2010 27 Banyan Tree Global Foundation Structure Sustainability With the formation of Banyan Tree Global Foundation in 2009, the governance of Committee the Banyan Tree’s Sustainability and CSR efforts was formalised under the Singapore based Board of Directors for Banyan Tree Global Foundation including Chairperson Ms Claire Chiang, Co-Chairperson Mr Ariel Vera, and Chief Financial Officer Mr Eddy See, and managed by Coordinating Director Mr Michael Kwee. Banyan Tree’s two full-time Group CSR Directors then jointly oversee the Sustainability/ CSR teams onsite at each property. While not all resorts have full-time positions addressing Sustainability and CSR, all resorts do have a CSR Champion onsite who is the key contact point for their respective resort in terms of their sustainability efforts and practices. In some cases the CSR Champion is the resort’s General Manager, while in other cases it is either a full-time dedicated resource or it is a team member empowered by the resort’s General Manager. CSR General Committee First established in 2004, the Banyan Tree CSR General Committee is made up of all General Managers from each resort and key management associates of each resort, including the resort’s CSR Champion. In 2008, we formalised an onsite CSR Committee for each resort, coordinated by the respective CSR Champion in order to unite all the departments at each property. This CSR General Committee functions as the network to share best practices and experiences while working towards fulfilling the CSR Strategy Committee’s and Banyan Tree Global Foundation Board’s directives.
