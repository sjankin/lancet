European Commission, Directorate General for Economic 02 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2009 “ The crisis that the Greek economy faces is mainly associated with chronic problems and imbalances that have been accumulated and is incidentally only the result of the impact of the global financial crisis. The adverse economic situation of the country is reflected in the soar of the fiscal deficit and the public debt, as well as the problem of the external deficit and debt. The deterioration of the fiscal performance is due to the lack of timely and systematic measures that were necessary to contain the already excessive amount of public debt, as well as the non-consolidation of policies that would ensure prudent fiscal management. The burden of social security costs, the low efficiency of public expenditure, the extensive informal economy and tax evasion have created a very difficult financial situation that contributed to the formation of public debt to GDP ratio at very high levels (2009: 126.8%). The dynamics of debt under the current international economic conditions is aggravated by increased interest payments due to the rising interest rates and the sharp decline in GDP growth, thus favouring the further expansion of public debt as a percentage of GDP. The problem of the external deficit and debt is reflected in the widening current account deficit since the country became a member of the euro area and in the strong rise in gross foreign debt as a percentage of GDP over the past five years. The worsening current account deficit reflects the inadequacy of national savings to meet domestic investment spending. National savings as a percentage of GDP have followed a downward trend for several years and over the past five years have stood at rates below 10%, which are the lowest among the countries of the euro area. This reflects the negative savings of public sector and the decline in the savings of the private sector at levels that are considered extremely low to finance investment activity. The accession of Greece to the EMU has lead to an improvement of expectations and to lower interest rates. These factors contributed to an increase in investment and private consumption, which also benefited from the spectacular rise of bank financing to households. Because of these developments an important part of domestic investment spending was financed with funds from abroad, while the current account deficit and borrowing from abroad, both, increased. These high external deficits are directly related to the low competitiveness of the Greek economy and reflect its structural weaknesses and chronic rigidities. The competitiveness problem of the country is largely associated with the inability of domestic supply to adapt to the new standards and the changing composition of both external and domestic demand. In the manufacturing sector, the production structure and the exports of the country mainly consist of low and medium technology products that compete with the exports of countries with low cost, while EU countries are specialized in high and medium technology products which benefit from the structure of international demand. The supply of services in which Greece displays a comparative advantage, such as tourism, lag behind its competitors. It is obvious that the elimination of macroeconomic imbalances requires, beyond the commitment to fiscal discipline, the adaptation to a new sustainable pattern of development. The growth dynamics of the country should become more outward looking in order to achieve low unemployment and high living standards. This goal can be pursued by the shift of production to areas with dynamic comparative advantages. In this new course, the banking sector can play a key role in the mobilization of factors that are favourable to growth. The new pattern of development encourages a change in the mix of bank credit, with greater emphasis on business finance. In the field of business credit, there will be challenges for a more selective credit policy in favour of sectors that meet the comparative advantages of the Greek economy. Businesses that will benefit from this process will be those that combine the traditional comparative advantages with innovation and quality. Apart from the traditional outward looking sectors of tourism, shipping, food, etc., the Greek economy has considerable growth potential in a range of products and services that benefit from the geomorphology, the climate and the geographical location of the country. The banking sector can be the driving force for the promotion of new comparative advantages. Adapting to a new more outward looking economic environment is a challenge for domestic banks. With the adoption of efficient credit and risk management systems domestic banks can contribute decisively to the desirable and efficient allo“ cation of capital.

Given the large volume of cases managed, the Bank cooperates with collection agencies, which fulfil the criteria set by the relevant legislation in force, for the management of amounts due. The main terms of cooperation with collection agencies are a) the Context of Communication that must be followed by the collection agency in order to ensure the privacy of customer’s personal data and b) the professional discretion for all types of information and hence the protection of banking privacy and c) the respect to the customers personality and dignity. Non-performing business loans: The way the Bank prevents the over-borrowing of enterprises is the detailed examination of their financial data, the frequent review of data and the gradual expansion of the credit facility. However, non-performing business loans may occur for various reasons, which are usually related to market conditions, over estimation of their prospects, incorrect customer selection and over-borrowing. 16 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2009 C.6 We listen to our customers’ complaints The main reasons for customer complaints in 2009 were Our customer complaints are welcomed because they help us charges and various fees (84% for individual customers 49% improve.

Educational Institutes & ΣΤΕΠ “ Crédit Agricole: Diversity Charter Encouraging pluralism and pursuing diversity, through the hiring and development of employees, are major factors for progress. They are forces that make our company more effective and improve relations with human resources. In addition, they can have a positive effect on our image to customers, suppliers and consumers, both in France and on a global scale. Our company has adopted the Diversity Charter to express its unwavering commitment to support cultural, national and social variety within our organization in France. In accordance with the terms of the Charter, we make a commitment that: 1. We will promote awareness and provide guidance on discrimination and diversity issues among all executives and employees dealing with the hiring, training and development of personnel. 2. We will comply with and promote the elimination of all forms of discrimination at each stage of human resources management, and in particular in hiring, training and promotion, as well as career development. 3. We will try to ensure that the makeup of our human resources will reflect the makeup of the French society — and of cultural and national diversity, in particular — at all levels of our human resources. 4. We will inform all our employees on our commitment to fight discrimination and promote diversity, as well as on the practical results of that commitment. 5. We will discuss the preparation and implementation of our policy on diversity with employee representatives. 6. We will devote one chapter of our Annual Report to our commitment to fight discrimination and promote diversity, “ providing details on our action, the practices we encourage and the results we achieve. 22 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2009 Treatment Policy http://www.emporiki.gr/cbg/gr/career&research/career&research_story.jsp?docpath=/gr/Ca reer/static/equal_opportunities “ At Emporiki Bank we recognize gender equality as a common value and its implementation in our daily life as a collective responsibility. We commit to ensuring that each dimension in the management of human resources – hiring, placements, promotions, undertaking positions of responsibility, compensation, transfers, training and education, dismissals – is governed by the principle of equal treatment. We commit to undertaking our banking activities with respect for cultural differences and our employees’ dignity. Keeping in mind our values of transparency and meritocracy, we aim: • That the composition of our human resources reflects the composition of our society • That the composition of our management reflects the composition of our human resources • That education and training program opportunities are made available in practice to all employees • That welfare programmes aim at supporting employees and their families and at reconciling family life and professional obligations For Emporiki Bank, equality is not just either a matter of numerical equilibrium or implementing the required legislation. We recognize that applying the principle of equality as a value in our daily operation is a responsibility for us all and is affected by mainstream social patterns and stereotypes. We recognize that true gender equality is also connected to changing those mentalities and stereotypes, which entrap companies, men and women and restrict or even hamper creativity. “ We commit to work systematically so as together to achieve the goal of equality Mary Nikolaidou Head of Group Human Resources Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2009 23 Average Age Persons with Disability The average age of our personnel in 2009 was 42.0 years, verAt the end of 2009, the Bank employed 197 persons with dissus 42.1 in 2008.

Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2009 31 UNION OF EMPORIKI BANK EMPLOYEES Athens, 30 September 2010 The founding regulation of the Union of Employees of Emporiki Bank refers to the objective of its foundation “the protection and improvement of professional, economic, and pension rights of employees”. For 64 years since its establishment, with great consistency and dedication the Union has been striving to achieve these objectives. With the universal support of its employees – its only source of inspiration and support – in the context of continuously changing economic, political and social conditions, it aims to fulfill the commitments and obligations made towards employees. Over the years the Union has proven itself to be a strong, influential and creative force in the evolution of Emporiki. On the other side from that of the Bank, the Union supports the business’ trajectory and its efforts to achieve growth and profitability, supports personnel as the necessary and competent way of fulfilling this and primarily supports the expansion and solidification of the economic, labor and pension rights of employees. Consultation and dialogue, while always the starting point of our relationship with the Bank, has not always been enough to achieve our goals during the many years of our operation. Thus on numerous occasions the signing of Collective or Corporate Contracts – but mainly the implementation on the part of the Bank of its legal and contractual obligations – has come to disagreements and challenges. Our Union, honoring our position as an expression of the rights of workers and also as a social partner, has always promoted the position of employees with respect for institutions and agreements. During the current circumstances, in an exceptionally uncertain social, economic and labor environment, we try to encourage the Bank and the reflexes which support highlighting its “humane, social sensitive” side, which a modern financial institution is obliged to display in its actions towards employees, customers and society. Crisis can give birth to opportunities. It is an opportunity for Emporiki Bank to promote its corporate social responsibility and its humane side. During our long history, our Union not only applauds but tries to strengthen every effort, activity and initiative of the Bank which supports the real economy, Greek households and consumers. We are confident that the tradition, history, culture and corporate responsibility of our Bank can and must be incorporated within strictly business criteria as well as the steps towards the future. With respect for the rights of employees, care for customer needs, responsibility for the human dimension and the social consequences of its role, Emporiki Bank can once again retain its position in the Greek Banking System, something we all want. Within this context, we believe the 2009 Corporate Social Report can be much more than a simple reporting of information for all. It can constitute our written commitment to continue our efforts and serve as a guide for improved actions in the future.

We examine the programs that we fund so that they do not damage biodiversity in protected areas. Response of Emporiki Bank’s Campsite In 2009 particular emphasis was given to the development of environmental awareness programs for children during all three camping periods focusing on highlighting the value of biodiversity. In these programs, 257 children and young people, aged 12 – 23, participated. Specifically, in June in the context of the World Environment Day, the teaching team at our campsite contributed to the environmental activities of the Acharnes Municipality. It presented a play entitled “People and ecological awareness” to three groups of elementary school children. During the same month they organized two two-day excursions including hiking up Parnitha and Mount Oiti with a special emphasis on efforts to encourage the development of eco-tourism in the region. In the next two camp sessions, in the months of July and August, excursions were organized to Olympus, Dirfi, and the National Park of Eastern Pindos, of three, two and five days duration respectively. The excursions included climbing, detailed information on the flora and fauna of the area and hiking.

In this context, there were no environmental fines, penalsuance of all legally required licenses and permits. One of the ties or other environmental sanctions on the Bank. most important permits is that for the environment. Any deviation from the permit issued to a financed project constitutes breach of contract. The validity of permits furthermore, in most cases of loan financing, constitutes a precondition for any project finance accommodations. Mines – Quarries Our credit exposure to the Mining – Quarries sector is limited, given that credit approvals to the sector constitute 0.33% of the total Corporate Investment Banking (CIB) approved credit limits. With respect to Small-Medium Enterprises in the sector, we finance 17 companies with credit limits totaling 0.9% of the total Small-Medium Enterprises portfolio. The credit limits we enforce are those established by Bank’s Risk policy: the evaluation of companies in all sectors, in addition to the quantitative elements of the balance sheet, is accompanied by qualitative standards and sectorand market-specificities. Environmental legislation and compliance with it by companies in the sector is taken into consideration within the evaluation of companies that are financed, affecting the company’s rating and subsequently its credit terms. Shipping In 2009 we financed a total of 118 ships of which 39 were being built and 79 were trading vessels. The fleet of 79 financed vessels includes 19 bulk dry-goods carriers, 6 container vessels and 54 tankers. Of the 54 tankers, 49 are double-hull and five are single-hull, but either double sided or double-bottomed and thus of sturdier construction. In all cases in which we finance single-hull tankers, the end of the loan period precedes the end of the vessel’s commercial life as required by law. Financing terms include specific terms such as: • Compliance with Environmental Laws and Environmental Approvals • No Environmental Claims • Environmental Law or any Environmental Approval • Environmental indemnity • Pollution Liability Insurance 48 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2009 “The increasing frequency of natural disasters and their impact on human health, enterprises, the economy and the ecosystems is becoming more and more evident. We have become almost used to disasters such as floods and draughts, windstorms, air and water pollution, extreme temperatures and other similar disasters. I believe that the climate change constitutes one major environmental, social and economic threat. The successful confrontation of the climate change consequences requires the collective effort of governments, enterprises and individuals. We, at Emporiki Bank, know the impact of our corporate operation on the climate change field: we contribute towards climate change both directly – through the use of electric energy, natural gas, heating oil and corporate transportation means – and indirectly through the enterprises of our customers. However, we are also building on a strong commitment to being responsible. In this context we apply practical measures, such as: • Measuring CO2 emissions, at corporate level. • Setting targets for reducing our CO2 emissions by improving the energy efficiency of our corporate operations. • Providing finance on projects involving renewable energy sources. • Incorporating environmental responsibility criteria in our credit policy. • Designing products and services that help our customers reduce their impact on climate change. • Including environmental responsibility criteria in the contracts with our suppliers. • Reviewing and managing the risks and opportunities related to climate change. I have undertaken a strong personal commitment: to work, together with the Bank’s Administration and employees, towards the further improvement of our energy efficiency and our environmental responsibility. Through its loan and insurance products, Emporiki Bank aims to “ operate as a leading environmentally responsible financial institution.

Equally important is the London School of Economics (LSE) effort made to undertake a mutual dialogue with company stakeholders which largely determines the relevance of issues to be included in a Social Report. My recent involvement with the issue of Social Accounting in Greece allows me to single out the Corporate Social Responsibility Report of Emporiki BankCredit Agricole for several reasons. First of all it doesn’t impress with frothy small talk but uses simple, understandable language. Second, it doesn’t try to influence the reader with images which encourage sentimentalism and positive impressions. Third, it is an honest report which doesn’t hesitate to talk about the reduction in personnel and even about the types of customer complaints it receives. Fourth, the bank doesn’t present its non-financial performance in terms of winning awards for its social profile but takes on the cost of external evaluation despite its non-profitable position. Finally, the official statement of the Employees’ Union on the bank’s social report is one more guarantee of the relevance of the information it contains.” With regards, Panagiotis A.
