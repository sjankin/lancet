FOREWORD BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD 4 2010 I. FOREWORD BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD For the fifth year in a row KONČAR is reporting about corporate social responsibility in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative indicators and Global Compact principles, thus proving its commitment to respecting the internationally accepted standards for corporate social responsibility in business. In a year when a recession has had an impact on the entire world, KONČAR managed to justify its commitment to corporate social responsibility in all segments of its business. In times of crisis and increased business difficulties, we did not accept the idea that profit is the exclusive goal of a business, and we did not forget the importance of maintaining a quality relationship with our employees, our community, the environment, customers, suppliers and other partakers. In KONČAR, we strongly believe that employees are an integral part of the company and we prove it by our fulfilling our obligations to them and respecting their rights in compliance with laws and regulations. Additionally, we improve the quality of life in the work place as well as in employees’ free time by investing in education and professional development, quality work processes and places, sports, recreation, health protection and more. There are many activities which demonstrate as much, although we pointed out only a few in this report. As a producer of equipment that is used in the environment, in cities and for the inter-city transport of people and goods, industrial facilities, public buildings and households, one of the main necessities included the development and production process is product responsibility. Certificates as well as customer satisfaction with purchased equipment and products prove we hold ourselves up to the highest international standards. One of the main requirements that we incorporate into all phases of our business processes is a responsibility towards buyers and customers as well as the environment in which our products are used. Our active involvement in society and other outside activities is founded on the desire to invest in the young, enhancing their education and free time. During a recession, our social sensitivity is even more noticeable through aiding and inspiring activities that help those who need it most. In KONČAR, responsibility is an integral part of business processes in all phases, while the constant development of those activities is our mission. Even as we are proud of our business results, research and development, entry into new markets, newly developed products and everything else that makes our company successful, we regard social responsibility as one of the most important factors bringing about ever better outcomes. Chairman of the Board Darinko Bago 5 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT II. REPORT ACCORDING TO GLOBAL COMPACT 6 2010 II. REPORT ACCORDING TO GLOBAL COMPACT Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights within their sphere of influence Employees, as custodians of the development and success of the company, are KONČAR’s greatest asset.

KONČAR employees are members of the Metal Workers Union Coordination of Croatia, as well as the Electrical Industry Unions of Croatia. Priciple 4 Businesses should eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labor KONČAR operates with respect to the Constitution and positive legal requirements that forbid forced and compulsory labor, which not only violates basic human rights, but also denies the community the opportunity to develop skills and human resources. KONČAR, within its companies, promotes the professional development of individuals, values work and competence, offers equal opportunities for advancement and organizes other activities that maximize satisfaction, because motivated employees are the biggest asset of a company. 7 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT II. REPORT ACCORDING TO GLOBAL COMPACT Principle 5 Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labor Child labor is a form of exploitation that violates human rights.

Principle 7 Businesses should support a cautious approach to challenges faced in the area of environmental protection Rational and efficient use of energy sources is not only mandatory in KONČAR, but is treated as a business opportunity. Primarily, this means that in KONČAR priority is given to the usage of more efficient and advanced technologies as well as research and development of more efficient products. KONČAR has outlined its Environmental Management Policy, which is familiar to all employees, whose constant motivation and education helps to further environmental protection awareness. Principle 8 Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Constant promotion of greater environmental responsibility serves as an example to others how respectful behavior and activity may reduce the harmful impacts on the environment to a minimum. Upholding the values of environmental responsibility is the duty of every KONČAR employee in his sphere of activity. KONČAR products operate in many diverse natural environments, especially impacting on the use of natural resources. It is thus important to continuously develop and apply solutions that minimize potentially harmful effects on nature equilibrium. The environmental protection policy is thought through strategically and achieved through established Quality Management Systems (ISO 9001) and Health Protection and Safety at Work (OHSAS 18001). 8 2010 II. REPORT ACCORDING TO GLOBAL COMPACT Principle 9 Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies KONČAR continuously invests in development of existing and new products and technologies complying with the principles of energetic efficiency and use of renewable energy resources.
