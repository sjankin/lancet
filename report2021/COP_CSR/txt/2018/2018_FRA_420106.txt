In this context, appropriate means of prevention, control and audit are key. Business ethics: identify the risks to better target efforts One of the main challenges of the prevention of corruption is to proportion the actions to risks and stakes, in order to secure the business activities while accompanying the operational staff in their efforts. It is therefore first of all about identifying the risks, building the appropriate action plans and keeping Enhanced vigilance over “Our mission is everyone’s attention on these subjects, through training and sensitization.

The frequency rate of lost-time accidents hit a historic low of 3.74 (in 2009, the Group recorded a frequency rate of 11.30). Unlike in 2015 and 2016, there were no fatality in any Fives’ activities (including subcontractors), and the number of severe accidents was halved from seven in 2016 to three in 2017. “We can only 2020 Fives Safety Ambition: a shared commitment achieve our In 2017, the Executive Committee, the Executive Board, and business lines management committees were mobilized to set new Safety goals to 2020 objectives achieve for the Group and for each of its entities. These objectives were if everyone is then broken down into specific action plans for each Group company. This new ambition aims to maintain the dynamic of the Group improvement of fully committed Safety practices and culture to develop a strong Safety culture shared by 2020 Safety Objectives all. Targets were set in terms of Safety culture (using the Bradley curve) and to pursuing the results (including the frequency rate of lost-time accidents). These objectives were set for Group employees and temporary initiatives under workers (2016 reference year). way and if we Enhance the Safety culture, with reference to the Bradley curve: ‒ Achieve the “Independent” maturity status at Group-level change how ‒ No companies with “Reactive” status ‒ Reach “Interdependent” status for some Group companies we think about Safety.” Improve the safety results: — ‒ No fatality (including subcontractors) ‒ No severe accidents ‒ Reduce the accident frequency rate to 2.5 or below Group Safety Golden Rules: improving the safety culture ‒ Halve the number of accidents with lost-time (LTI) in Fives’ workshops In 2016, Fives launched the deployment of the Group Safety Golden Rules, which cover the ten main at-risk activities that can cause severe accidents on its sites and workshops. These rules apply to all Martin Duverne Group activities and all personnel under Fives’ responsibility (Fives employees, temporary staff, and Member of the Executive Board subcontractors). The year 2017 showed that close to 90% of all accidents (lost-time, severe or potentially severe) which occurred in the Group’s activities were directly related to poor compliance with the Group Safety Golden Rules. The initiatives which are under way to implement stricter compliance with these rules should significantly reduce the number of severe and potentially severe accidents and continue the trend towards improving behaviors and creating safer work environments. 2018 Report # 2017 financial year 58 • 59 OUR COMMITMENTS ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE FROM ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT CONCERNS Fives designs and manufactures equipment for a range of industries, some of which are energy-intensive and major emissions generators. Environmental concerns, energy performance, and operational performance TO STRATEGY CHALLENGE are increasingly linked. Fives supports its customers by working on the two environmental levers within its scope: eco-design and control of the environmental impact of its own industrial sites. An innovation and continuous improvement process focused on eco-design Launched in 2012, Fives Engineered Sustainability® eco-design program combines operational excellence with high environmental performance. This voluntary innovation approach covers both environmental issues (energy, emissions, material consumption) and safety as well as operational performance (operating costs, flexibility, productivity). The entire program is based on the ISO 14062 eco-design standard and was independently certified by EY in 2013. Supplier innovation In 2017, deployment of the Engineered Sustainability® program continued in two areas: On one side, by working to obtain or renew the Engineered Sustainability® brand on products considered 2017 was an opportunity to encourage the innovation of suppliers.

Its results confirmed the specifications to foster innovation during the industrialization phase. “This efficient and cooperative approach made it possible to continue and control of economic, organizational, and reputational benefits of eco-design. to innovate on the burner’s design and performance, enhance our the environmental intellectual property, and achieve competitive manufacturing costs while An environmental approach that continues to gain ground within the Group optimizing the supply chain: this optimization was another challenge Fives is continuing its work on achieving the target it has set in 2012: all Group’s industrial sites must implement impact of its own an environmental management system and obtain ISO 14001 certification. At end of 2017, 80% of the target sites for the market launch of this burner” says Pierre André Jarniac, the Combustion Business Purchasing & Supply Department manager. industrial sites. were ISO 14001-certified (including new industrial sites acquired after 2012).
