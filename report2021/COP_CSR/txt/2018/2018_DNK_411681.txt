Together with our energy business, this gives us a central position in the Danish and European agricultural and food cluster. We wish to take the lead and set the course for the industry. This means that as a company we recognise and accept social and environmental responsibility. DLG is convinced that a company's work with social responsibility must be measured by its concrete actions. As a consequence, in 2012 we adopted the UN Global Compact, an international initiative with ten principles focused on corporate sustainability. As part of the Global Compact, DLG is working to implement the principles for human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption in the day-to-day operations of the Group. We are committed to actively communicating the Group's CSR activities and results in an annual progress report – a Communication on Progress (COP). This is our COP, in which we publish our goals and initiatives for social responsibility. We also describe how we wish to develop in the course of the next year. We are pleased and proud to confirm our continued support for the UN Global Compact. 4 DLG Group CSR Report 2017 DLG’S EXECUTIVE BOARD COO CEO CFO Ole Christensen Kristian Hundebøll Lars Sørensen DLG Group CSR Report 2017 5 WHAT WE PROMISED IN 2017 – AND WHAT WE ACHIEVED RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY FOOD PRODUCT SAFETY • √ DLG expects to use the CHAIN MANAGEMENT opportunities for DLG Feed to register for the Danish Veterinary • √ Continue to stimulate market-driven and Food Administration’s new demand for sustainable soya inspection system based on chain control and third-party • Continue the work to implement ÷ certifications as part of public DLG's Code of Conduct for inspection Suppliers, so that before the end of 2017 it has been presented to and • √ DLG will participate actively in accepted by DLG’s suppliers within the cooperation with the Danish the most significant areas Veterinary and Food Administration on the development of the • ≈ Document the sustainability of interaction between public and Danish-produced rapeseed for private inspection activities energy purposes Purpose: Best possible inspection – effectiveness and transparency in • √ Support the ‘Roundtable on inspection Sustainable Palm Oil’ (RSPO) 6 PEOPLE IN DLG • ≈ Ongoing control of the implementation of the anti-corruption policy • √ Launch of workplace evaluation aimed at improving the working environment RESOURCE EFFICIENCY • √ Continued focus on preventive • ≈ Ensure the continued dissemination work in the working environment of LEAN principles among all employees, to ensure focus on • √ Competence mapping of the OSH resource efficiency organisation • All business units to scale back their ÷ • √ Ongoing measures to increase primary energy source by 2% Each workplace diversity in DLG business unit must specify their primary energy sources and prepare • √ Training of managers in diversity an action plan to achieve the target in recruitment as part of DLG's manage­ment training • √ Change lighting to LED sources or other resource-saving lighting • ≈ Working persistently to increase the proportion of female managers • Continued focus on optimising ÷ at all levels, thereby ensuring an transport.

Within 15 years, we have developed from a Danish cooperative into an international Group with companies in more than 18 countries and turnover of almost DKK 49 billion. Today, the Group has 6,500 employees, of whom 3,800 in Germany, which is the Group’s largest market. As a Group, we have many different roles. DLG supplies farmers with feed from its own production facilities, together with seed, fertiliser, agricultural limestone, crop protection and fuel for day-to-day operations. The DLG Group is also one of Europe’s largest exporters of malting barley, seed corn, feed and milling grain, and rapeseed. Via the Group's affiliated companies and subsidiaries, DLG is also involved in the processing of vegetable crops, such as rapeseed oil.

In 2018, we will continue to work on developing common accounting Vilofoss Group principles for CSR data for use in the report, including data on energy, HaGe Kiel employees and supply chain management, etc. We will develop new KPIs Svenska Foder AB and policies that ensure full compliance with the increased requirements laid down in the Danish Financial Team AG State­ ments Act. The report covers DLG’s business, which in principle means DLG a.m.b.a. and majority owned subsidiaries. Associated companies in which DLG does not have a decisive influence are not included in the report. DLG Group CSR Report 2017 17 DLG'S CSR ORGANISATION The managerial responsibility for DLG's work with social responsibility is anchored in the Group's Executive Board. A CSR coordinator has been appointed, who is responsible for coordinating cross-­s ectoral activities, internal and external communication, and Global Compact reporting. The work of preparing goals, action plans and reporting was assigned to a number of cross-sectoral work groups in 2017. The groups consist of representatives from all parts of the Group, subject to the management responsibility of DLG's Executive Steering Committee (EXCOM). The Executive Steering Committee is also responsible for implementing the cross-sectoral and sector-specific CSR initiatives in practice. The individual business units are responsible for implementing the CSR goals in concrete action plans. In conjunction with the forthcoming risk assessment and revision of the CSR policy, we will also re­ assess the Group's CSR organisation. 18 DLG Group CSR Report 2017 COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS?

This work will continue in 2018. Our Code of Conduct is based on the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the DLG Group's three core values. The fundamental philosophy is that, in a market-leading company like DLG, we must also be able to set particularly high requirements for our employees. We call our Code of Conduct ‘How we are’ because we wish to take the lead – every single day. We will live up to the responsibility, commitment and privilege of being a front-runner in our industry.

Only raw materials approved in the EU are purchased for the production of vitamins and minerals. This means that, in this respect, DLG’s suppliers have a ’gatekeeper’ function if the product comes from a third country. With regard to quality management, we follow up with analytical controls by using the HACCP system in the areas where we see the greatest risks. HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) is a system for quality assurance of food products throughout the production chain. The system builds on the identification of microbiological, chemical and physical risks in the raw materials, the designation of particularly critical steps in production and processing, and also DLG ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF in packaging, and the subsequent establishment of control points in the production cycle. Each of the approximately 200 raw OF DENMARK’S IMPORT OF SOYA MEAL materials used in vitamins and minerals is approved according to a fixed procedure: assessment of familiarity with the company, the product information and the nutritional characteristics of the item in question, its safety for humans and animals, and whether the item can be used in the production facility (e.g. with regard to dust and odours).

DLG Group CSR Report 2017 33 FROM WASTE TO DISTRICT HEATING Dankalk’s quarry in Aggersund annually dries 125,000 tonnes of chalk for the manufacture of various calcium carbonate products for industrial use. Dankalk has two drying lines, which operate at a temperature of 850 degrees. The moist chalk is dried by evaporating the water content. Until now, the warm and humid air from the drying process has been emitted to the atmosphere. However, in an ambitious new project which was kicked off at Dankalk’s facility on Friday 19 May 2017, the surplus heat is now collected and used for district heating instead. Dankalk has invested in a flue gas condensing plant, while Løgstør District Heating Plant has invested in an extension of the heating pipe network and an accumulation tank on Dankalk’s site. In this way, the waste heat is channelled out into the district heating system. This means that Dankalk’s surplus heat can cover the annual heat consumption of approximately 700 households, or one quarter of all of Løgstør District Heating Plant’s customers. 34 DLG Group CSR Report 2017 DANKALK’S SURPLUS HEAT CAN COVER AROUND 700 HOUSEHOLDS’ ANNUAL HEAT CONSUMPTION DLG Group CSR Report 2017 35 PEOPLE IN DLG 36 DLG Group CSR Report 2017 DLG Group CSR Report 2017 37 DIVERSITY At DLG we endeavour to be a work1.

The gender distribution at management level is characterised by the fact that we have many hourly-paid employees in physically­ oriented job functions which are traditionally male occupations and for which the recruitment pool primarily consists of men. On the other hand, if we solely consider the gender distribution of salaried employees, the gender balance is more equal than the gender balance for all employees. 40 DLG Group CSR Report 2017 FEMALE MANAGERS FEMALE MANAGERS FEMALE EMPLOYEES FEMALE EMPLOYEES FEMALE SALARIED EMPLOYEES FEMALE SALARIED EMPLOYEES 14% 20% DENMARK SWEDEN 30% 43% 54% 43% FEMALE MANAGERS FEMALE MANAGERS 6% FEMALE EMPLOYEES FEMALE EMPLOYEES FEMALE SALARIED EMPLOYEES FEMALE SALARIED EMPLOYEES 12% 21% GERMANY FRANCE 21% 24% 33% 33% 40% DLG Group CSR Report 2017 41 AS PART OF MY DAILY WORK, I WORK WITH COLLEAGUES OF VARIOUS GENDERS, ETHNICITIES AND BACKGROUNDS 4 DENMARK 3.9 4 SWEDEN 3.7 4.3 FRANCE 4.1 4.1 GERMANY 3.8 0 1 2 3 4 5 IN MY COMPANY, EVERYONE HAS THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT, REGARDLESS OF GENDER, AGE AND BACKGROUND 4.2 DENMARK 3.8 4.2 SWEDEN 3.7 4.1 FRANCE 3.6 4 GERMANY 3.7 0 1 2 3 4 5 2016 2017 42 DLG Group CSR Report 2017 SUSTAINED EFFORTS TO MAKE background.
