The project mainly covers areas in the municipalities of Corleto Perticara, Guardia Perticara and Gorgoglione, and is located between the Regional Park of Gallipoli Cognato and the National Park of Pollino. The concession, named Gorgoglione, is located in the heart of a highly-valued region for tourism due to the beauty of its natural landscapes; the local archaeological heritage is a significant factor. To design and build an oil&gas treatment plant in such an environment is Recent International Energy surveys have therefore a challenge for the players involved mentioned Tempa Rossa Project as one of in terms of the safety of operations and the 280 ongoing projects which will change environmental protection. the world Energy scenario.

The plant satisfies the annual electricity needs of over 50,000 residential units with “zero impact”, preventing CO2 emissions of about 100,000 tons per year compared to a coal power plant of the same capacity. This biomass plant – among the largest currently operating in Italy – substantially contributes to the sustainability objectives set by the European Union.

There have been no cases of “confirmed incidents of corruption” within the reporting period. There have been no cases of “non-compliance” with environmental laws and regulations. The number of new hires concerns permanent employees, considering the focus on structural personnel and as indicated by workforce movements in the year. For consistent turnover analysis, the permanent workforce and the presentation of the voluntary departure rate was focused on.

Responsibility of the directors and of the Board of Statutory Auditors for the NFS Directors are responsible for the preparation of the NFS in accordance with article 3 and 4 of the Decree and with the “Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards” defined in 2016 by the GRI Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI Standards”), as laid down in paragraph “Reporting Methods, Principles and Criteria” of the NFS, identified by them as the reporting standard. Directors are responsible, in the terms prescribed by law, for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a NFS that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Directors are responsible for identifying the content of the NFS, within the matters mentioned in article 3, paragraph 1, of the Decree, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group and to the extent necessary to ensure an understanding of the Group’s activities, its performance, its results and related impacts. Directors are responsible for defining the business and organisational model of the Group and, with reference to the matters identified and reported in the NFS, for the policies adopted by the Group and for the identification and management of risks generated and/or faced by the Group. The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for overseeing, in the terms prescribed by law, compliance with the Decree. 176 Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control We are independent in accordance with the principles of ethics and independence set out in the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants published by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which are based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, competence and professional diligence, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our audit firm adopts International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italy 1) and, accordingly, maintains an overall quality control system which includes processes and procedures for compliance with ethical and professional principles and with applicable laws and regulations. Auditor’s responsibilities We are responsible for expressing a conclusion, on the basis of the work performed, regarding the compliance of the NFS with the Decree and with the GRI Standards. We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) – Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (hereafter “ISAE 3000 Revised”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and apply procedures in order to obtain limited assurance that the NFS is free of material misstatement. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in scope than those performed in a reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and, therefore, do not provide us with a sufficient level of assurance that we have become aware of all significant facts and circumstances that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures performed on the NFS were based on our professional judgement and consisted in interviews, primarily of company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information presented in the NFS, analyses of documents, recalculations and other procedures designed to obtain evidence considered useful. In particular, we performed the following procedures: 1 Analysis of the relevant matters reported in the NFS relating to the activities and characteristics of the company, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process used, in accordance with article 3 of the Decree and the with the reporting standard adopted. 2 Analysis and assessment of the criteria used to identify the consolidation area, in order to assess their compliance with the Decree. 3 Comparison of the financial information reported in the NFS with the information reported in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 4 Understanding of the following matters: business and organisational model of the Group, with reference to the management of the matters specified by article 3 of the Decree; 2 of 4 177 policies adopted by the Group with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the Decree, actual results and related key performance indicators; main risks, generated and/or faced by the Group, with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the Decree. With reference to those matters, we compared the information obtained with the information presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described under point 5 a) below. 5 Understanding of the processes underlying the preparation, collection and management of the significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the NFS. In particular, we held meetings and interviews with the management of Maire Tecnimont SpA and with the personnel of Tecnimont SpA, KT Kinetics Technology SpA, Neosia SpA, Stamicarbon BV and we performed limited analyses of documentary evidence, to gather information about the processes and procedures for the collection, consolidation, processing and submission of the non-financial information to the function responsible for the preparation of the NFS. Moreover, for material information, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group:  At a group level: a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the NFS, and in particular to the business model, the policies adopted and the main risks, we carried out interviews and acquired supporting documentation to verify their consistency with available evidence; b) with reference to quantitative information, we performed analytical procedures as well as limited tests, in order to assess, on a sample basis, the accuracy of consolidation of the information.  For the companies Tecnimont SpA, Neosia SpA, KT – Kinetics Technology SpA, Stamicarbon BV and construction sites of Alba-Bra (Italy), Lotos K-214 (Poland) and Orpic (Oman), which were selected on the basis of their activities, their contribution to the performance indicators at a consolidated level and their location, we carried out in depth analysis, during which we met local management and gathered supporting documentation regarding the correct application of the procedures and calculation methods used for the key performance indicators. Conclusions Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of Maire Tecnimont Group as of 31 December 2017 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and with the GRI Standards. 3 of 4 178 Other aspects The comparative data presented in the NFS in relation to previous years has not been subjected to any procedures.
