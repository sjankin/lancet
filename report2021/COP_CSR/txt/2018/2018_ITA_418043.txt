Adjustments are not provided for by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the European Union. The Group deems that these adjusted figures and data provide information useful to management and investors to assess the Group’s performance and compare it to other companies active in the same sector. They also provide an additional picture of the results excluding elements that are unusual or atypical. As a result, at 31 December 2017, the Group has adjusted its IFRS accounting figures to reflect the inclusion of the results of joint ventures not controlled by Lane Group and to sterilise the effects of the impairment losses recognised on some assets related to the construction of infrastructure in Venezuela. The subsequent section on “Initial considerations on the comparability of data” provides more information and details on the following reconciliation of the key adjusted figures. The “Alternative performance indicators” paragraph gives a definition of the financial statements indicators used to present the Group’s highlights. 25 Directors’ Report ADJUSTED RECLASSIFIED STATEMENT OF PROFIT OF LOSS OF SALINI IMPREGILO GROUP (In millions of Euros) 2016 Adjusted 2017 Adjusted Salini JV not Impairment Total Salini JV not Impairment Total Impregilo controlled Venezuela Adjusted Impregilo controlled Venezuela Adjusted Group (*) by Lane Group (*) by Lane Revenue 5,883.8 240.7 6,124.5 6,107.2 240.6 6,347.8 Gross operating profit 552.8 24.4 577.2 580.1 4.2 584.3 (EBITDA) Gross operating profit 9.4% 10.1% 9.4% 9.5% 1.7% 9.2% margin (EBITDA) % Operating profit (EBIT) 275.5 24.4 13.6 313.5 25.2 4.2 292.5 321,9 R.o.S. % 4.7% 10.1% 5.1% 0.4% 1.7% 5.1% Net financing costs (86.5) (86.5) (192.9) (192.9) Net gains (losses) on 9.1 (24.4) (15.3) 100.1 (4.2) 95.9 equity investments Profit (loss) before tax 198.1 13.6 211.7 (67.6) 292.5 224.9 (EBT) Income tax expense (78.0) (3.3) (81.3) (14.5) (68.2) (82.7) Profit (loss) from 120.1 10.3 130.4 (82.1) 224.3 142.2 continuing operations Loss from discontinued (20.7) (20.7) (1.9) (1.9) operations Loss attributable to non(39.6) (39.6) (22.9) (22.9) controlling interests Profit (loss) attributable to the owners of the 59.8 10.3 70,1 (106.9) 224.3 117.4 parent (*) Reclassified IFRS statement of profit or loss of Salini Impregilo Group. 26 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 27 Directors’ Report Adjusted revenue for the year is €6,347.8 million compared to €6,124.5 million for 2016. It includes revenue of the unconsolidated joint ventures of Lane of €240.6 million and €240.7 million, respectively. The main factors driving the growth in adjusted revenue are some large projects and, specifically, Lane’s ongoing projects, the Rogun dam in Tajikistan, the Forrestfield Airport Link metro in Australia as well as the Meydan One Mall project in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Adjusted revenue for the year, restated using constant exchange rates, would have been approximately €6.5 billion, up around €358 million, up 5.8% on 2016 1. The adjusted gross operating profit amounts to €584.3 million, up 1.2% on €577.2 million for 2016 while the adjusted operating profit of €321.9 million shows an improvement of about 2.7% on the previous year’s figure of €313.5 million. The adjusted gross operating profit is equal to 9.2% (9.4%) of revenue and the adjusted R.o.S. is 5.1% (5.1%). Net financing costs approximate €192.9 million compared to €86.5 million for 2016. The item comprises financial expense of €134.9 million (€146.5 million) and net exchange losses of €122.8 million (net gains of €15.5 million) partly offset by financial income of €64.8 million (€44.5 million). The €20.3 million increase in financial income is mainly due to the recognition of interest on receivables due to the Group from mainly foreign customers. The reduction of €11.6 million in interest and other financial expense is a result of the debt refinancing transaction finalised in 2017, which 1 The exchange effect on 2017 revenue was calculated by applying the average 2016 exchange rate to contract revenue accrued in 2017 in currencies other than the Euro. With respect to contracts with consideration agreed in more than one currency, the related contractually-provided for breakdown was used for simplicity purposes. 28 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 led to a decrease in bank loans and borrowings against the issue of bonds at more favourable interest rates to those previously applied. The decrease is partly offset by the recognition of interest after the settlement of a tax bill received by the Ethiopian branch during the year. Net exchange losses of €122.8 million mainly arose on the performance of the US dollar and Ethiopian birr vis-à-vis the Euro. Net gains on equity investments increased by €111.2 million to €95.9 million, due to the higher profits recognised by the equity-accounted investees for 2017, mainly the associate Autopista del Sol S.A. as a result of the compensation recognised as part of the renegotiation contract with the Argentine government. The adjusted profit before tax amounts to €224.9 million, an improvement on the 2016 balance of €211.7 million. The adjusted income tax expense amounts to €82.7 million (€81.3 million) and the tax rate is 36.8% (38.4%). The loss from discontinued operations amounts to €1.9 million (€20.7 million) and relates to the costs of the USW Campania business unit. The balance for the previous year included the exchange losses of €13.9 million accumulated in the translation reserve related to the foreign operations of Todini Costruzioni Generali sold on 4 April 2016. Non-controlling interests amount to €22.9 million (€39.6 million), mainly related to the group companies working in Saudi Arabia on the construction of the Riyadh Metro Line 3 (roughly €13.8 million) and some of Lane’s subsidiaries (€9.3 million). 29 Directors’ Report ADJUSTED NET FINANCIAL INDEBTEDNESS OF SALINI IMPREGILO GROUP (In millions of Euros) 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Adjusted Salini Impregilo Salini Impregilo Impairment Total Group (*) Group (*) Venezuela Adjusted Non-current financial assets 62.5 188.5 56.6 245.1 Current financial assets 323.4 94.3 94.3 Cash and cash equivalents 1,602.7 1,320.2 1,320.2 Total cash and cash equivalents 1,988.6 1,603.0 56.6 1,659.6 and other financial assets Bank and other loans and borrowings (866.4) (457.5) (457.5) Bonds (868.1) (1,084.4) (1,084.4) Finance lease liabilities (119.7) (81.3) (81.3) Total non-current indebtedness (1,854.2) (1,623.2) (1,623.2) Current portion of bank loans and borrowings (398.6) (311.0) (311.0) and current account facilities Current portion of bonds (18.9) (302.9) (302.9) Current portion of finance lease liabilities (55,3) (48.6) (48.6) Total current indebtedness (472.8) (662.5) (662.5) Derivative assets 0.1 0.2 0.2 Derivative liabilities (7.2) (1.5) (1.5) Net financial position with unconsolidated (5.3) (18.6) (18.6) SPEs Total other financial liabilities (12.4) (19.9) (19.9) Net financial indebtedness continuing (350.8) (702.6) 56.6 (646.0) operations Net financial indebtedness including (350.8) (702.6) 56.6 (646.0) discontinued operations (*) Figures taken from the IFRS statement of financial position of Salini Impregilo Group. 30 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Adjusted net financial indebtedness is €646.0 million compared to € 350.8 million at 31 December 2016. The increase in this item is mainly a result of: a decrease of €329 million in cash and cash equivalents and financial assets; a €28 million reduction in total financial indebtedness. The Group’s net financial indebtedness at 31 December 2017 using constant exchange rates would have been €457 million compared to the adjusted €646 million (reduction of approximately €189 million). 31 Directors’ Report Performance 32 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 This section presents the reclassified statement of profit or loss and statement of financial position of the Group and the parent and a breakdown of their financial position at 31 December 2017. It also provides an overview of the main changes in the Group’s and the parent’s financial position and results of operations compared to the previous year. Unless indicated otherwise, figures are provided in millions of Euros and those shown in brackets relate to the previous year. The “Alternative performance indicators” paragraph gives a definition of the financial statements indicators used to present the Group’s financial position and results of operations for the year. Initial Management accounts presentation of the figures considerations for 2017 and 2016 (adjusted) on the comparability The Group’s statement of profit or loss figures for 2017 and 2016 and of data its net financial indebtedness at 31 December 2017 have been adjusted as explained below in detail. Joint ventures not controlled by Lane The Group monitors the key figures of Lane Group for management purposes adjusting the IFRS figures prepared for consolidation purposes to present the results of the joint ventures not controlled by Lane which are consolidated on a proportionate basis. These figures show the progress made on contracts managed directly by Lane or through its non-controlling investments in joint ventures. Impairment Venezuela The Group calculated the recoverable amount of its total exposure to Venezuelan government agencies at 31 December 2017 to reflect the recent negative developments caused by the deterioration in the country’s credit standing. The tests performed with independent experts showed that the exposure’s recoverable amount is approximately €314.2 million, therefore, the Group recognised an additional impairment loss of €273.4 million, which added to the impairment loss recognised in the first six months of 2017, gives a total loss of €292.5 million. 33 Directors’ Report More information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of this report and section 4 “Impairment Venezuela” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Given the Group’s optimisation of its geographical and commercial Gross operating positioning, which led to its repositioning on the international market, profit performance and considering that other sector operators use a calculation method indicator EBITDA for gross operating profit different to that used previously by the Group, in order to facilitate a comparison with the figures of its key competitors, including on new markets, the Group decided to change the composition of this indicator to exclude provisions and impairment losses as, in some cases, they have a non-recurring nature. The Group deems that this new calculation method assists an understanding and the comparability of its performance indicators. The new composition of the gross operating profit indicator required restatement of the figures for 2016. This led to an increase in the gross operating profit of roughly €16.5 million for the Group in 2017 and of approximately €15.2 million for the parent in the reclassified statements of profit or loss. Both these increases are mainly caused by the accruals to the allowance for impairment for the Venezuelan receivables made in 2016. The “Alternative performance indicators” paragraph gives a definition of the financial statements indicators used to present the Group’s highlights. The effects of the restatement of the statement of profit or loss are shown in the following table (“Gross operating profit performance indicator EBITDA”): 34 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 RECLASSIFIED STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS OF THE GROUP (In millions of Euros) 2016 2016 Variation Restated Published Total revenue 5,883.8 5,883.8 Operating expenses (5,331.0) (5,347.5) 16.5 Gross operating profit (EBITDA) 552.8 536.3 16.5 Gross operating profit margin (EBITDA) % 9.4% 9.1% Amortisation, depreciation, provisions and (277.3) (261) (16.5) impairment losses Operating profit (EBIT) 275.5 275.5 Return on Sales 4.7% 4.7% Profit before tax 198.1 198.1 Profit for the year attributable to the 59.9 59.9 owners of the parent RECLASSIFIED STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS OF THE PARENT (In millions of Euros) 2016 2016 Variation Restated Published Total revenue 3,076.7 3,076.7 Operating expenses (2,691.8) (2,707.0) 15.2 Gross operating profit (EBITDA) 384.9 369.7 15.2 Gross operating profit margin (EBITDA) % 12.5% 12.0% Amortisation, depreciation, provisions and (140.1) (124.9) (15.2) impairment losses Operating profit (EBIT) 244.8 244.8 Return on Sales 8.0% 8.0% Profit before tax 127.9 127.9 Profit for the year 64.6 64.6 35 Directors’ Report Group performance The following table shows the Group’s reclassified IFRS statement of profit or loss.

(§) The reclassified statement of profit or loss for 2016 was restated to reflect the different method used to calculate gross operating profit (EBITDA) which excludes provisions and impairment losses. 36 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Revenue Total revenue for the year is €6,107.2 million (€5,883.8 million), including €5,607.1 million earned abroad (€5,344.2 million), of which €1,516.0 million in the US (€1,303.5 million) and €500.2 million (€539.6 million) in Italy. The 3.8% increase on 2016 is mostly due to the higher revenue earned in the US (approximately +€212.5 million). “Other income” mostly refers to contract work in progress and industrial activities and related works not directly related to contracts with clients. Operating profit The gross operating profit for 2017 amounts to €580.2 million (€552.8 (EBIT) million), with the increase due to the higher contract profitability. The gross operating profit margin increased from 9.4% for 2016 to 9.5% for 2017. The operating profit of €25.2 million decreased on the previous year due to the impairment of some assets related to the construction of infrastructure in Venezuela (see the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in this report and section 4 “Impairment Venezuela” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). Financing income The Group recorded net financing costs of €192.9 million (€86.5 (costs) and gains million) while net gains on equity investments amount to €100.1 (losses) on equity million (€9.1 million). investments Net financing costs of €70.1 million (€102 million) include financial income of €64.8 million and financial expense of €134.9 million. The €32 million reduction in this item is mostly due to the following: a €20.3 million increase in financial income, mainly attributable to the recognition of interest on receivables from mostly foreign clients; a €11.7 million decrease in interest and other financial expense as a result of the debt refinancing transaction finalised during the year, which led to a reduction in bank loans and borrowings against the issue of bonds at more favourable interest rates to those previously applied. This decrease is partly offset by the recognition of interest after the settlement of a tax bill received by the Ethiopian branch during the year. 37 Directors’ Report In addition, net financing costs include the financial expense arising on application of the amortised cost method of €18.8 million (€25.4 million), mostly related to the debt refinancing transaction carried out during the year. Net exchange losses of €122.8 million (gains of €15.5 million) mainly arose on the performance of the US dollar and Ethiopian birr vis-à-vis the Euro. Exchange differences, which mostly arise on the adjustment to closing rates, do not necessarily impact cash flows as the realisation of foreign currency assets is reinvested/spent in the countries or for the branches where the variation took place. The €91 million increase in net gains on equity investments is due to the larger profits recognised by the equity-accounted investees for 2017, mainly the associate Autopista del Sol S.A. as a result of the compensation recognised as part of the renegotiation contract with the Argentine government. 38 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Income tax expense The income tax expense for the year is €14.5 million (€78.0 million). The decrease is mainly due to the deferred taxes recognised in 2017 following the impairment of some assets related to the construction of infrastructure in Venezuela and the US government’s tax reform. Loss from The loss from discontinued operations amounts to €1.9 million (€20.7 discontinued million) and relates to the costs of the USW Campania business unit. The operations balance for the previous year included the exchange losses of €13.9 million accumulated in the translation reserve related to the foreign operations of Todini Costruzioni Generali sold on 4 April 2016. Non-controlling Non-controlling interests amount to €22.9 million (€39.6 million), mainly interests related to the group companies working in Saudi Arabia on the construction of the Riyadh Metro Line 3 (roughly €13.8 million) and some of Lane’s subsidiaries (€9.3 million). 39 Directors’ Report The Group’s financial position The following table shows the Group’s reclassified IFRS statement of financial position.

The balance reflects the Group’s share of cash and cash equivalents or debt of the SPEs. The 31 December 2016 balances included loans and receivables of €2.0 million and liabiltiies of €7.3 million. 40 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Net invested capital This item increased by €75.7 million on the previous year end to €1,787.9 million at 31 December 2017. The main changes are due to the factors listed below. Non-current assets Non-current assets increased by €53.0 million. They may be analysed as follows: (€’000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Property, plant and equipment 803,039 675,277 (127,762) Intangible assets 168,763 127,668 (41,095) Equity investments 201,468 317,363 115,895 Total non-current assets 1,173,270 1,120,308 (52,962) Property, plant and equipment decreased by €127.8 million, mostly as a result of: depreciation of the year of €194.7 million; disposals of €58 million; exchange losses of €47.2 million, partly offset by investments of €170.4 million, mostly for the Milan Genoa section of the high speed/capacity railway project in Italy and the Forrestfield Airport Link in Australia as well as investments made for Lane Group’s contracts and the projects in Tajikistan. Intangible assets show a net decrease of €41.1 million mainly due to: amortisation of the year of €23.9 million; the €16.6 million decrease for rights to infrastructure and concessions related to Impregilo Parking Glasgow, sold during the year. 41 Directors’ Report The €115.9 million increase in equity investments is chiefly a result of the following factors: an increase in equity-accounted investments following recognition of the Group’s share of the profit for the year of €94.8 million, mostly earned by the associate Autopista del Sol, whose results include the compensation received as part of the renegotiation contract with the Argentine government; the increase in the Grupo Unidos Por el Canal investment after injections of €53.4 million; The effects are partly offset by: dividends from equity-accounted investees of €20.1 million; a €19.2 million variation in the translation reserve of the equityaccounted investees. Goodwill This item refers to the acquisition of Lane Group (€131.3 million) and assets from Asphalt Roads and Materials Company Inc. (€23.9 million). The variation on the previous year end is entirely due to the US dollar’s depreciation vis-à-vis the Euro. The Group calculated these balances after completion of the purchase price allocation procedure as required by (revised) IFRS 3 in 2016. Net non-current assets held for sale Net non-current assets held for sale at 31 December 2017 amount to €5.7 million and solely comprise the net assets of the USW Campania projects. Provisions for risks These provisions of €101.5 million decreased by €4.2 million over 31 December 2016. 42 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Post-employment benefits and employee benefits This item amounts to €85.7 million and shows a €6.2 million decrease compared to 31 December 2016, mainly due to the actuarial valuations made at the reporting date. Net tax assets The following table provides a breakdown of this item: (€’000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Deferred tax assets 121,925 134,579 12,654 Deferred tax liabilities (108,493) (29,946) 78,547 Net deferred tax assets 13,432 104,633 91,201 Current tax assets 135,987 133,040 (2,947) Current tax liabilities (109,991) (96,839) 13,152 Net current tax assets 25,996 36,201 10,205 Other current tax assets 146,503 164,651 18,148 Other current tax liabilities (67,589) (44,811) 22,778 Net other current tax assets 78,914 119,840 40,926 Net tax assets 118,342 260,674 142,332 The increase in this item is mainly due to the taxable profits of the various group companies, also considering the changes attributable to the foreign operations. Working capital Working capital decreased by €3.7 million from €437 million at 31 December 2016 to €433.3 million at the reporting date. The main changes in the individual items making up net working capital are summarised below: • Inventories decreased by €29.6 million to €241.0 million compared to the previous year end as a result of consumption of materials for the Group’s main contracts. 43 Directors’ Report • Contract work in progress amounts to €2,668.1 million (€2,367.3 million) and refers to Italian contracts (€526.9 million) and foreign contracts (€ 2,141.2 million of which Lane: €71.4 million). The increase of €300.8 million in this item reflects the production progress calculated using the most recent estimates of the ongoing projects’ profitability and is due to: the rise in contract work in progress abroad of €226.1 million, mostly related to the contracts in Tajikistan (€142.9 million) and Ethiopia (€26.8 million); the €73.4 million increase in contract work in progress in Italy, mainly due to work on the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway section. • Progress payments and advances on contract work in progress include both contractual advances and “negative” work in progress (i.e., progress billings in excess of the cumulative value of the works built) and amount to €2,518.6 million, up €62.9 million on 31 December 2016. This increase is mainly the result of the rise in contractual advances of €220.0 million, due to the Rogun Hydropower project in Tajikstan and works in Ethiopia, and the €167.2 million decrease for works in Saudi Arabia. • Receivables decreased by €455.9 million and include €1,767 million due from third parties (€2,203.6 million) and €134.3 million due from unconsolidated group companies and other related parties (€153.6 million). The decrease is mainly a result of: a reduction of €436 million in receivables from third parties, mostly relating to the Ethiopian contracts and the high speed/ capacity Milan Genova railway section contract; an increase of €133.5 million in the allowance for impairment, principally attributable to the impairment loss of approximately €132 million recognised on receivables from Venezuelan clients; the outstanding balance of these receivables is €153.8 million mostly in hard currencies (Euros and US dollars); a reduction of €21.4 million in receivables from unconsolidated group companies and other related parties. 44 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 • Current liabilities decreased by €192.6 million and include liabilities with third parties of €2,046.3 million (€2,233.6 million) and unconsolidated group companies and other related parties of €98.5 million (€103.8 million). The decrease in this item is mainly due to the reduction in liabilities with third party suppliers (€187.3 million, including €143.2 million for the contracts in progress in Ethiopia). • Other current assets increased by €25.3 million, mainly due to the higher advances to suppliers, mostly for the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway section, the Polish road projects and the Al Bayt Stadium in Qatar. • Other current liabilities decreased by €26 million compared to 31 December 2016, mainly due to the smaller liabilities with employees and other liabilities. 45 Directors’ Report Net financial indebtedness The following table shows the Group’s net financial indebtedness at 31 December 2017 and 2016: TABLE 3 NET FINANCIAL INDEBTEDNESS OF SALINI IMPREGILO GROUP (€’000) Note (*) 31 December 2016 31 December 2017 Variation Non-current financial assets 11 62,458 188,468 126,010 Current financial assets 16 323,393 94,308 (229,085) Cash and cash equivalents 19 1,602,721 1,320,192 (282,529) Total cash and cash equivalents and other 1,988,572 1,602,968 (385,604) financial assets Bank and other loans and borrowings 22 (866,361) (457,468) 408,893 Bonds 23 (868,115) (1,084,426) (216,311) Finance lease liabilities 24 (119,742) (81,310) 38,432 Total non-current indebtedness (1,854,218) (1,623,204) 231,014 Current portion of bank loans and borrowings 22 (398,589) (311,002) 87,587 and current account facilities Current portion of bonds 23 (18,931) (302,935) (284,004) Current portion of finance lease liabilities 24 (55,281) (48,567) 6,714 Total current indebtedness (472,801) (662,504) (189,703) Derivative assets 11 156 226 70 Derivative liabilities 25 (7,180) (1,480) 5,700 Net financial position with unconsolidated (5,345) (18,618) (13,273) SPEs (**) Total other financial liabilities (12,369) (19,872) (7,503) Net financial indebtedness continuing (350,816) (702,612) (351,796) operations Net financial indebtedness including (350,816) (702,612) (351,796) discontinued operations (*) The note numbers refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements where the items are analysed in detail.

The balance reflects the Group’s share of cash and cash equivalents or debt of the SPEs. The items making up these balances are presented under trade receivables and trade payables, respectively, in the consolidated financial statements. 46 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 At 31 December 2017, the Group has net financial indebtedness from continuing operations of €702.6 million (€350.8 million). The increase is mainly due to the reduction in cash and cash equivalents due to the exchange difference effect on foreign currency items. Gross indebtedness decreased by €28.0 million over 31 December 2016 to €2,304.3 million at the reporting date. The debt/equity ratio (based on the net financial indebtedness from continuing operations) is 0.65 at group level at the reporting date.

Financing income The parent recorded net financing costs of €202.1 million (€60.8 (costs) and gains million) while net gains on equity investments amount to €139.8 (losses) on equity million (net losses of €56.1 million). investments Net exchange losses of €153.8 million (gains of €15.3 million) mainly arose on the performance of the US dollar and Ethiopian birr against the Euro. Exchange differences, which mostly arose on the adjustment to closing rates, do not necessarily impact cash flows as the realisation of foreign currency assets is reinvested/spent in the countries or for the branches where the variation took place. Net gains on equity investments amount to €139.8 million (net losses of €56.1 million). The improvement is due to the larger dividends received from subsidiaries (€88.2 million), mainly Impregilo International Infrastructures which distributed €125 million (2016: €25 million). In 2016, the net losses reflected the fair value and impairment losses of €118.9 million on equity investments. 49 Directors’ Report The €63.2 million decrease in this item is mostly due to deferred taxes Income tax recognised in 2017 following the impairment of some assets related to expense the construction of infrastructure in Venezuela.

The Group records the current and outstanding contract outcome in its order backlog. Projects are included when the Group receives official notification that it has been awarded the project by the client, which may take place before the definitive, binding signing of the related contract. The Group includes projects in its order backlog when it deems that the contract counterparties will comply with their obligations. Moreover, its contracts usually provide for the activation of specific procedures (usually arbitrations) to be followed in the case of either party’s contractual default. The order backlog includes the amount of the projects, including when they are suspended or deferred, pursuant to the contractual conditions, even if their resumption date is unknown. The value of the order backlog decreases: when a contract is cancelled or decreased as agreed with the client; in line with the recognition of contract revenue in profit or loss. The Group updates the order backlog to reflect amendments to contracts and agreements signed with clients. In the case of contracts that do not have a fixed consideration, the related order backlog reflects any contractual variations agreed with the client or when the client requests an extension of the execution times or amendments to the project that had not been provided for in the contract, as long as these variations are agreed with the client and the related revenue is reasonably certain. The measurement method used for the order backlog is not a measurement parameter provided for by the IFRS and is not calculated using financial information prepared in accordance with such standards. Therefore, the calculation method used by the Group may differ from that used by other sector operators. Accordingly, it cannot be considered as an alternative indicator to the revenue calculated under the IFRS or other IFRS measurements. Moreover, although the Group’s accounting systems update the related data on a consolidated basis once a month, the order backlog does not necessarily reflect the Group’s future results, as the order backlog data may be subject to significant variations. 57 Directors’ Report Performance by geographical segment 58 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Lane operating The Group is active in the US through the subsidiary Lane Industries segment Incorporated. Macroeconomic scenario GThe US economy continues to grow with positive development prospects. According to the IMF’s January 2018 estimates, its growth is forecast at 2.3% and 2.7% in 2017 and 2018, respectively, which is better than the IMF’s previous estimates published in October 2017. This upwards revision reflects the expected positive impact of the tax reform recently approved by Congress, which provides for a cut in the corporate tax rate and a temporary reduction in taxes for taxpayers. This review should stimulate business and, hence, trigger another boost in growth. This development is supported by internal consumption which benefits from a strongly growing labour market with almost full employment, an upturn in investments, better economic prospects for companies and the recovery of the energy sector. Overall, the development rate has been fairly stable since 2009, continuing one of the longest expansionary periods for the US economy to date. GDP GROWTH ESTIMATES AND FORECASTS: UNITED STATES ACTUAL ESTIMATE PROJECTIONS 2.7% 2.5% 2.3% 2.3% 2.2% 1.9% 1.5% 2016 2017 2018 2019 IMF OCTOBER 2017 IMF January 2018 Source: International Monetary Fund 59 Directors’ Report The US dollar depreciated by about 13% against the Euro in 2017, a trend that was not expected at the start of the year when the FED’s measures for a more restrictive monetary policy had already been announced and which were then implemented during the year. However, these measures did not significantly affect the exchange rate. Market expectations about the average 2017 EUR/USD rate was 1.04 in January (Bloomberg consensus estimates of January 2017) while the actual average was 1.13, differing from the forecasts by roughly 9%. The Euro again gained ground at the start of 2018 to exceed 1.20. Some operators’ current expectations are for an about-turn and the medium-term strengthening of the US dollar while other operators forecast the Euro’s continued growth as a result of the expected discontinuation of its accommodating monetary stance of the last few years by the ECB. Market forecasts for the short term are that the US dollar will continue to be weaker than the Euro. The construction and infrastructure sector has also benefitted from the economy’s positive performance and growth outlook for new investments. This encouraging trend has been seen at both federal and individual state level. The recently approved six-year USD18.6 billion investment plan touted by the Virginia Department of Transportation represents a potential opportunity in the local US markets. A draft law, the Transportation Bill, was recently approved in California, providing for an increase of roughly 70% in the annual budget for transportation projects compared to the average for the last four years. Meanwhile, Governor Cuomo has proposed an infrastructure investment plan of USD100 billion for New York, to be funded in part by the federal government. The likelihood that these far-reaching investment plans will actually happen is now greater thanks to the steady implementation of the Fast Act, the law approved by the Obama Administration at the end of 2015 to regulate public financing of infrastructure projects. There is also more funding available at federal, state and local level, which has led to greater funds earmarked for infrastructure investments in the transportation sector. Several large states are already reaping the benefits of these funds and are developing new investment plans. Roughly 50% of the funds for the construction of roads and highways comes from federal funds provided for by the Fast Act, which match the funding put together by the states or local communities. At state and local level, investments in transportation infrastructure have grown considerably, especially in the last year, thanks to these measures. 60 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The Trump Administration has prioritised the construction of infrastructure during its mandate and announced projects worth more than USD1,000 billion will be rolled out before 2027 (President Trump announced that this amount had been increased to €1,500 billion in his State of the Union address in January 2018) in the energy and transportation sectors flanked by the reform to simplify building permits to make the construction of roads, bridges and energy infrastructures easier and faster. If these projects go ahead, they will be accompanied by the structural investments included in the budgets already prepared by the individual states.

The project includes the construction of 21 stations along a 16-mile alignment, mainly above ground between New Carrollton and Bethesda, north of Washington DC. Lane Construction is involved in the construction work with a 30% share. I-4 Ultimate Orlando Florida In September 2014, the I-4 Mobility Partners joint venture entered into a concession agreement with the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) to design, build, finance and operate the USD2.3 billion I-4 Ultimate project. Lane Construction’s share of the construction part of the contract is 30%. The project includes the reconstruction of 21 miles of I-4 from west of Kirkman Road in Orange Country to east of SR 434 in Seminole County, including the addition of four lanes and sections in central Orlando. I-395 Express Lane Virginia On 1 March 2017, Lane won a new design-build contract worth USD336 million to extend the I-395 Express Lanes in Virginia by about eight miles between Fairfax and Arlington. 62 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The project design stage is currently underway, the first subcontracts have been assigned and the preliminary works commenced. North-East Boundart Tunnel (NEBT) In July 2017, the SA Healy (Lane) and Salini Impregilo joint venture won the design & build contract for the mechanised excavation of an 8.2 km tunnel and related works in Washington D.C. worth USD580 million. The works are part of the clean rivers project for the Anacostia River. The client issued the notice to proceed in September 2017 and the design and procurement stages are now underway. Work will start in April 2018 to be completed at the beginning of 2022. Outlook 2018 IThe Lane construction segment has become a core market for the Group, and is expected to contribute around 30% to its total revenue. This is shown by the orders acquired in 2017: I-395, in Virginia (100% Lane) worth USD336 million; Three Rivers, in Fort Wayne, Indiana (joint venture between Lane and Salini Impregilo) worth USD188 million; Unionport Bridge, in New York City, NY (JV comprising Schiavone (55%) and Lane (45%)) worth USD232 million; I-70, in Maryland, (100% Lane) worth USD118 million; Florida Turnpike, Florida (100% Lane) worth USD177 million; Building the new runway at the Al Maktoum Airport in the United Arab Emirates (100% Lane International) worth USD125 million; North East Boundary Tunnel, in Washington, D.C., 70% Lane and 30% Salini Impregilo, worth USD580 million; Florida Turnpike in the counties of Hernando and Citrus, Florida, for a combined value of USD135 million; Roadworks in Virginia on I-264 for USD105 million. 63 Directors’ Report The Group’s reference market in the US should offer a pipeline of possible calls to tender worth USD23 billion in the three years from 2018 to 2020 in the following sectors: Roughly 40% highways and bridges, mainly in the south-east, north-east and California; Roughly 20% in high speed railway projects in the south-west; Roughly 20% in tunnel works in the north-east and California; The remaining 20% in airports, the water and energy sectors and traditional railways. The Group will also monitor developments for additional opportunities in the market worth another USD60 billion. The Group is active in the construction and concessions sectors abroad. Abroad Macroeconomic scenario The global economy has picked up steadily since the end of 2016. Based on the IMF’s most recent estimates (January 2018), international growth should increase to 3.7% and 3.9% in 2017 and 2018 respectively. The upturn in trade and a better economic climate have positively affected business and stimulated consumption and investments. According to the IMF, growth in the Eurozone was 2.4% in 2017 and is expected to be 2.2% in 2018. This trend has also been seen in the emerging economies, with an improvement from 4.4% in 2016 to 4.7% in 2017, and a forecast increase to 4.9% in 2018 thanks to China’s strong performance, as a result of its very expansionary economic policies, and the more positive outlook for Brazil and Russia. The macroeconomic scenario is also satisfactory for South East Asia and North Africa although the Middle East’s economy is somewhat weaker. According to the IHS Markit report of October 2017, global infrastructure investments increased by 3.3% in 2016, boosted by the transportation sector which saw growth of 5%. The respective growth rates are forecast to be 4% and 5% for 2017 and 2018, after the roll-out of several projects that had been delayed in previous years. Over the next five years, infrastructure investments should increase by a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 5%. 64 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The IHS Markit forecasts the continued recovery of the construction sector in Western Europe bolstered by the tax measures encouraging investments in infrastructure. The expected annual growth rate is 2% for 2017 and 2018. This rate is expected to be one of the highest for the next five years in the Asia Pacific area with a CAGR of 6%. The entire region will benefit from China’s Belt & Road project which includes the construction of a network of high speed railways, motorways and sea ports to connect China with another 64 states. Investments in infrastructure in Africa and the Middle East are forecast to increase by 4% in 2018, mainly in Egypt and Qatar where double-digit growth is expected over the next five years. Finally, the HIS Markit reports a 4% drop in infrastructure spending in South America in 2017. Specifically, the decrease in investments in infrastructure has been estimated at 6% for Brazil, although growth is forecast for the next two years (3% and 5% for 2018 and 2019, respectively).

The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that the population will go from the current 24 million residents to 42 million by 2061. The Australian economy has been driven and will continue to be driven by greater residential construction closely tied to the far-reaching public spending plan for infrastructure. The Australian Industry Group expects that the annual growth in road projects in 2018 and 2019 will be approximately 21% while that of the railway projects will be around 19%. The most recent federal budgets include public works spending of around AUD75 billion (roughly €50 billion) to be allocated for railways, roads and transportation in the ten-year period from 2018 to 2027. The Group has been active in Australia since 2013 and currently operates through Salini Impregilo Australia Branch, the whollyowned Salini Australia Pty Ltd, Impregilo Salini Joint Venture and Salini Impregilo NRW Joint Venture. In December 2013, Transport for New South Wales awarded Impregilo-Salini Joint Venture the contract, worth approximately AUD700 million (including the additional consideration), for the Sydney Metro Northwest Project Design and Construction of Surface and Viaduct Civil Works. Most of the works were delivered in December 2017. The project is the first stage of the Sydney Metro Project, the largest public transport infrastructure project in Australia, which consists of the construction of the new metro line to serve north-east Sydney. Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the contractor has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. 67 Directors’ Report The costs are included in the measurement of work in progress for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s legal advisors. The following table shows the amounts involved in the contract in place at the reporting date: (Share in millions of Euros) Residual Percentage PROJECT backlog of completion Forrestfield Airport Link 582.8 27.2% Total 582.8 Forrestfield Airport Link On 28 April 2016, the joint venture of Salini Impregilo (80%) and NRW Pty Ltd (20%) was awarded the contract to design, construct and maintain the Forrestfield Airport Link by the Public Transport Authority of Western Australia. The project includes construction of a new metro line to connect Forrestfield, and hence the airport, to the existing Perth network through an 8 km underground line. As well as the design and construction of the three new metro stations, the contract also includes 10 years of maintenance of the infrastructure. It is worth approximately AUD1.2 billion. Outlook for 2018 The Group deems that the Australian market is fundamental for its growth strategy and will continue to pursue new business opportunities tied to the country’s ongoing development in 2018. Tajikistan Market This country’s economy grew at a rate of 7.5% between 2011 and 2014 while GDP contracted in the three-year period from 2015 to 2017. The annual inflation rate for 2017 was 7% according to the country’s central bank while the local currency depreciated by 12% against the US dollar and by 25% against the Euro. 68 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Exports increased by 73% in 2017 compared to the previous year while imports decreased by 14%. The project assigned to the group is of fundamental importance to boost the country’s economic growth over the next few years with the export of electrical energy generated by the Rogun hydroelectric power plant. Accordingly, in September 2017, Tajikistan successfully placed bonds worth €500 million with foreign investors to increase the amount earmarked in the national budget for the Rogun dam. The following table shows the amounts involved in the contract at the reporting date: (Share in millions of Euros) Residual Percentage PROJECT backlog of completion Rogun Hydropower Project 1,434.9 14.1% Total 1,434.9 Rogun Hydropower Project On 1 July 2016, Salini Impregilo signed a framework agreement with the Tajikistani government worth approximately USD3.9 billion to build a hydroelectric power plant (split into four functional lots). The Group, with a 100% share, has been assigned the first executive lot (Lot 2) of roughly USD1.9 billion to build a 335 metre-high rockfill dam with a clay core, the tallest in the world, on the Vakhsh River in Pamir, one of Central Asia’s main mountain ranges. The contract term is 11 years (plus two years warranty). The contract for Lot 2 will be executed by the Group’s local branch. Work has continued on schedule and the early generation phase (when electrical energy will be provided although at a lower output than when the project has been completed) is expected to commence before the end of 2018. When fully operational, the power plant will have total installed capacity of 3,600 MW generated by six turbines of 600 MW each. 69 Directors’ Report Outlook for 2018 Achievement of the contractual milestones will require the recovery of a slight delay in the works which the Group continues to monitor closely with the client. It also requires that the client completes the financing of the project. To this end, the government has already approved the issue of bonds for €1 billion (an additional €500 million to those already placed). During 2018 and depending on the availability of the above-mentioned financing, other lots should be assigned to the Group in accordance with the signed framework agreement. Saudi Arabia Market The Saudi market continues to be of great interest to Salini Impregilo. The following table shows the amounts involved in the main contracts in place at the reporting date: (Share in millions of Euros) Residual Percentage PROJECT backlog of completion Riyadh Metro Line 3 1,155.0 59.4% Riyadh National Guard Military 1,084.0 0.0% Other 182.3 Total 2,421.3 Riyadh Metro Line 3 On 29 July 2013, Salini Impregilo, as leader of an international consortium, won a portion of the maxi contract awarded by ArRiyadh Development Authority to design and construct the new Riyadh metro line (line 3, 41.2 km), the longest line of the challenging project for the new metro system of Saudi Arabia’s capital. The lot assigned to ArRiyadh New Mobility Consortium is an important part of the larger construction contract for Riyadh’s new metro system, worth approximately USD23.5 billion. 70 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The value of the works to be carried out by the consortium, i.e., the design and construction of the entire Line 3, is roughly USD6.0 billion, including approximately USD4.9 billion for the civil works, of which Salini Impregilo will carry out 66%. It sold 14% of its share to Salini Saudi Arabia Company L.t.d. (51% owned by Salini Impregilo) in 2016. Riyadh National Guard Military In December 2017, Salini Impregilo signed the agreements for a contract in Riyadh worth roughly USD1.3 billion with the Saudi Arabia National Guard (SANG). The project includes housing and urban planning on a large scale with the construction of about 6,000 villas in an area of 7 million square metres to the east of Riyadh and more than 160 kilometres of main roads and secondary routes and related services, as well as a sewage treatment plant and several water tanks above and below ground. The contract is expected to be completed in five years. Outlook for 2018 The Group will continue to pursue any new business opportunities that arise in 2018 in this country. Qatar Market Given current oil prices, the country has held back development of new infrastructure projects and has continued high priority projects (such as the Doha metro line) for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The following table shows the amounts involved in the main contracts in place at the reporting date: (Share in millions of Euros) Residual Percentage PROJECT backlog of completion Al Bayt Stadium 303.0 57.3% Red Line North 57.6 95.6% Total 360.6 71 Directors’ Report Al Bayt Stadium In July 2015, the Group was awarded the contract to build the Al Bayt stadium in Al Khor, roughly 50 km north of the capital Doha. The Group’s share of the contract, which entails the design and construction of one of the sports complexes where the 2022 FIFA World Cup matches will take place, is worth approximately €770 million. The contract was awarded by the Aspire Zone Foundation, which is responsible for the development of Qatar’s sports infrastructure. The stadium will be able to accommodate 70,000 spectators with an area of 200 thousand square metres. The project is an example of an eco-sustainable work, thanks to modern construction techniques and the use of environmentally friendly and low energy impact state-of-the-art materials. The Group’s share of the contract is 40%. Red Line North Underground, Doha In 2013, Salini Impregilo, as leader of a joint venture with a 41.25% share, won the tender called by Qatar Railways Company (Qrail) for the design and construction of the Red Line North Underground in Doha. The project, along with three other metro lines, is part of a programme promoted by Qatar to build a new infrastructure mobility system included in the National Development Plan for 2030 (“Qatar National Vision 2030”), which provides for significant investments to ensure sustainable economic growth. The contract’s value (for the Group’s share) has decreased from the previous QAR8 billion (roughly €2 billion) to the current QAR5.6 billion (approximately €1.4 billion), due to the partial use of the contractually-provided for provisional sum. Outlook for 2018 The Group will continue to pursue any new business opportunities that arise in 2018 in this country. 72 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Kuwait Market The Kuwaiti market has attracted more foreign investment over the last few years thanks to the introduction of new financial laws stimulating investments and trade relations. The Kuwaiti parliament has approved a five-year 2016-2020 investment plan, which includes investments of more than USD100 billion in the country’s infrastructure. They comprise the construction of thousands of new homes, a railway network and metro system, new oil refineries and industrial plants. In addition, there are no limits to the transfer of capital and the strong and stable dinar can easily be converted into other currencies and transferred. Finally, the high per capita GDP and long-term budget surplus encourage investment in the local market. The following table shows the amounts involved in the main contracts in place at the reporting date: (Share in millions of Euros) Residual Percentage PROJECT backlog of completion South Mutlaa City 370.3 17.8% Total 370.3 South Mutlaa City On 17 June 2016, Kuwait’s Public Authority for Housing Welfare assigned the contract for the construction of primary urbanisation works to build a new residential area in a 12 thousand hectares site located 40 km northwest of Kuwait City as part of the South Al Mutlaa Housing Project. The project, which is worth approximately €890 million, will be carried out by a consortium led by Salini Impregilo with a 55% stake and includes, inter alia, the construction of 150 km of roads and related structures and numerous other works. The consortium was awarded additional works in June 2017 for approximately €20 million to move high tension power lines out of the way. Outlook for 2018 The Group will continue to pursue any new business opportunities that arise in 2018 in this country. 73 Directors’ Report Ethiopia Market Ethiopia is one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. Its government aims to develop its natural resources and, specifically, its water resources, to encourage investments in renewable energies: the generation of electrical energy and its export to nearby nations will assist integration among African countries and generate valuable currency inflows. The following table shows the amounts involved in the main contracts in place at the reporting date: (Share in millions of Euros) Residual Percentage PROJECT backlog of completion Koysha 2,033.6 14.8% GERD 1,070.7 72.6% Gibe III 2.5 99.9% Total 3,106.8 Koysha Hydroelectric Project This project is on the Omo River, about 370 km south-west of the capital Addis Abeba. It was commissioned by Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) and includes the construction of a dam with a 9 billion cubic metre capacity reservoir, annual energy generation of 6,460 Gwh and total installed capacity of 2,160 MW. The project also includes access roads, a new bridge over the river and a 400 KW transmission line from Koysha to Gibe III. The contract is worth approximately €2.5 billion and Salini Impregilo’s share is 100%. Work is currently being carried out on the project. This important new project, together with GIBE III and GERD (the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam) on the Blue Nile, will enable Ethiopia to become Africa’s leader in terms of energy production. Gerd The GERD project, located approximately 500 km north west of the capital Addis Abeba, consists of the construction of a hydroelectric power plant, 74 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), and the largest dam in the African continent (1,800 metres long, 170 metres high). The project also includes the construction of two power stations on the banks of the Blue Nile, equipped with 16 turbines with total installed capacity of 6,350 MW. The contract is worth approximately €3.7 billion and Salini Impregilo’s share is 100%. The project is at an advanced stage of completion. Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the contractor has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of work in progress for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s legal advisors. Outlook for 2018 Development programmes for the next few years include installation of additional production capacity, including through the Gerd and Koysha projects (the latter was awarded to Salini Impreligo in 2016). The Group has a strong operating and commercial base in the country and will continue to work on its projects. It will also leverage on its know-how and existing presence in the country to exploit all new business and industrial opportunities. Denmark Market Denmark is experiencing a phase of moderate growth. The country’s infrastructure development plan entails public and private investment. The Group operates through its subsidiary Copenhagen Metro Team I/S, a company incorporated under Danish law and involved in the construction of Copenhagen Cityringen, one of the world’s most modern transport infrastructures. The following table shows the amounts involved in the contracts in place at the reporting date: (Share in millions of Euros) Residual Percentage PROJECT backlog of completion Cityringen 145.5 93.7% Total 145.5 75 Directors’ Report Copenhagen Cityringen The project consists of the design and construction of the new metro loop in the centre of Copenhagen, which entails two tunnels of roughly 16 km each, 17 stations and five monitoring shafts. The contract is worth approximately €2,294 million, including additional consideration and price reviews. During the year, work went ahead according to schedule with continuation of the electromechanical works and architectural finishings. The Group’s share of the project is 99.9%. During this year and in 2016 and 2015, the Group incurred costs for activities not originally provided for in the contract; more information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section. Outlook for 2018 The Group is monitoring the local market, and the entire Scandinavian area in general, for new transportation, tunnelling and hospital construction projects through its Norwegian branch based in Oslo. 76 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Other countries Argentina and projects Riachuelo Buenos Aires The project has significant environmental and social value as it will clean up the Riachuelo River basin. The initiative is the first part of a larger programme, financed by the World Bank, for sustainable development of the Matanza-Riachuelo catchment basin, aimed at the environmental restoration of the Riachuelo River and the areas it passes through, considered to be among the most polluted in the region. Following an addendum signed in the second half of 2016, the contract is now worth roughly €408 million (Salini Impregilo’s share is 75%). Argentina’s estimated GDP growth rate is 3.5% for 2018 and the inflation rate is currently estimated to be around 19%, compared to the government’s target of 15% (25% in 2017). The government has rolled out a big public works investment plan as announced at the end of 2016. Given these premises, the Group has decided to set up a branch office in Buenos Aires to evaluate the many bids (some of which already presented in 2017) for calls for tender in 2018. Slovakia D1 Motorway Lietavská Lúčka – Višňové – Dubná Skala Section The “D1 Motorway Lietavská Lúčka – Višňové – Dubná Skala section” project consists of the construction of roughly 13.4 km of the motorway, which includes a 7.5 km tunnel, an intersection, a rest area, nine bridges, a maintenance centre and sundry related works. The contract, mostly funded by the EU, its worth approximately €409 million (Salini Impregilo’s share is 75%). At macroeconomic level, the year-on-year increase in GDP was 5.4%, after already being above 3.% in the previous two years. 77 Directors’ Report The most recent estimates of the Slovakian central bank (NBS), confirmed by the Ministry of Finance, include a forecast growth rate of 4.0% in 2018. The planned increase in public spending, including for large infrastructure projects, and the small tax burden (the corporate rate decreased from 22% to 21% this year) together with the inexistent currency risk make this market very attractive. The Group will continue to pursue new business opportunities in 2018 in line with the country’s continued growth. United Arab Emirates Meydan One Group 1° in Dubai – Umm Lafina Project in Abu Dhabi This country is promoting numerous investments in infrastructure for Expo 2020 and this will encourage the development of new projects. The Meydan One Group project in Dubai is part of an urban development project located between Meydan and Al Khail Road. It is set to become one of the main tourist attractions of the city and country during Expo. Salini Impregilo will perform the structural works and oversee the excavations and building works for AED1.6 billion, equal to roughly €364 million. Salini Impregilo has also been awarded the €167 million contract to build a section of a transit way across two islands to connect the Capital District with the Central Business District, for which Abu Dhabi has set up a development plan to foster economic growth. The Group has a 60% share of this project. Given the potential of this market, the Group will continue to pursue any new business opportunities that arise in 2018 in this country. Fisia Italimpianti projects The Atakoy project in Turkey is one of the cornerstones of the heavily populated city of Istanbul’s urban waste water treatment programme. Its intention is to improve the environmental conditions of the Bosporus Strait and the Sea of Marmara. The contract worth roughly €84 million is being carried out by the group company Fisia Italimpianti as part of a 50:50 joint venture with the Turkish company Alkatas. 78 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The contract includes the modernisation of an existing plant which has a treatment capacity of 360,000 cubic metres of waste water per day and the building of a new section for the plant to treat another 240,000 cubic metres for a total installed capacity of 600,000 cubic metres per day. The contract also includes another advanced biological treatment unit that uses a membrane system of 20,000 cubic metres per day and a system to dry the sludge generated by the biological purification process. Works for the Shoaiba project in Saudi Arabia consist of the design, supply and construction of a reverse osmosis desalination plant of 250,000 cubic metres per day in the Shoaiba area. The plant will provide potable water to the cities of Jeddah, Medina and Taif. The contract has been agreed using a project financing structure by a SPE owned by ACWA Power, a major Saudi developer of energy generation and sea water desalination projects. The project is being carried out by Fisia Italimpianti as a 50:50 joint venture with the Spanish company Abengoa and the contract is worth approximately €215 million. It is the first of its kind in terms of the technology used and size for the group company which has previously garnered market recognition for its construction of large plants using evaporation techniques. The contract is particularly interesting given Saudi Arabia’s intention to invest heavily in desalination plants over the next five years. Concessions The Group’s portfolio of foreign concessions comprises both investments in the operators, which are fully operational and, hence, provide services for a fee or at rates applied to the infrastructure’s users, and operators that are still developing and constructing the related infrastructure and will only provide the related service in future years. The current concessions are held in Latin America (Argentina, Colombia and Peru), the UK and Turkey. They refer to the transportation sector (motorways and metro systems), hospitals, renewable energy and water treatment sectors. 79 Directors’ Report The two Argentine operators are currently in liquidation and their contracts have been terminated.

Macroeconomic scenario The Italian economy performed better than expected in 2017. According to the IMF’s estimates revised in January 2018, economic growth is now expected to be 1.6% for 2017 and 1.4% for 2018, an improvement on the organisation’s previous forecasts of October 2017. This generalised improvement was also confirmed by the better rating (BBB) given to Italy by Standard & Poor’s, whose previous upgrading dates back to 1988. The government’s tax incentives facilitated an increase in investments during the year which is expected to continue during 2018. However, in order to consolidate this positive trend, the IMF’s recommendations refer to the targets of a higher volume of state investments, an improved allocation of resources, a reduction in spending on pensions and finally a decrease in the tax impact on employee remuneration.

Although 2017 saw a reduction in investments in public works, the new forecasts include a reversal in this trend and a steady move towards more investment starting from 2018. The report shows that scheduled investments for the period from 2018 to 2033 approximate €150 billion. Investments in public works decreased in 2016 and this trend continued into 2017, especially for new works (-5.6% in 2016 and -8.3% in 2017). This trend should reverse in 2018 with an upturn in investments for public utility works. The CIPE’s (interministerial committee for economic planning) approval of the financing for some large infrastructure projects, such as the high speed Milan Genoa railway project (COCIV) and the high speed Verona Padua railway project (IRICAV DUE), appears to confirm this expected about-turn.

(Rete Ferroviaria Italia, formerly TAV S.p.A. as Ferrovie dello Stato’s operator) with the agreement of 16 March 1992 and subsequent rider of 11 November 2011. Salini Impregilo is the consortium leader with a percentage of 68.25%. The works began on 2 April 2012 and the contract is worth approximately €4.7 billion. It is split into six non-functional construction lots for a total of roughly 120 months including the pre-operating/inspection phase. During the year, RFI delivered the fourth construction lot roughly two months behind schedule, increasing the total value of the works and activities financed and under construction to €2.7 billion, €1.1 billion higher than the active lots (1, 2 and 3). On 22 December 2017, the CIPE authorised the commencement of works for the fifth and sixth construction lots, allocating the related financial resources. RFI’s effectiveness notices should be received on 2 May 2018 and 2 May 2019 for the fifth and sixth lots, respectively. The CIPE’s authorisation at the start of the works for the last two construction lots covers the entire contract amount of €4.5 billion. In line with the contract terms, five public calls to tender were made for roughly €1.3 billion during the year for the operating activities. Information about the orders issued by the Rome and Genoa public prosecutors which, inter alia, involved certain parties related to the consortium is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section. High-speed/capacity Verona Padua railway project The IRICAV DUE consortium is RFI’s general contractor for the design and construction of the high speed/capacity Verona Padua section as per the agreement of 15 October 1991. Its role was confirmed by the arbitration award of 23-26 May 2012, which has become definitive. 84 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Salini Impregilo’s current involvement in the consortium is 34.09%. On 14 April 2017, the Superior Council of Public Works issued its positive opinion on the project, while the environmental compatibility opinion had been obtained on 25 November 2016. During the year, RFI and the general contractor finalised their negotiations and adjustments to the definitive project for the first subsection Verona Vicenza junction. On 22 December 2017, after the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport completed its inspection, the CIPE approved the definitive project for the first functional lot, the Verona Vicenza junction, of the high speed/ capacity Verona Padua railway section, worth approximately €2.2 billion. It authorised commencement of the first construction works for roughly €850 million. The signing of the rider to the agreement and the related start-up of the site work is slated to take place during the first half of 2018. The works are worth €5 billion. Outlook for 2018 In line with the new direction taken in 2016, the 2017 Economic and Financial Document (DEF) divulges the strategies to define Italy’s infrastructure requirements up until 2030, redefining all its priorities with a list of 119 projects split into six areas: railway, roads, ports and freight terminals, airports and “rail therapy” in 14 cities and bicycle paths. Salini Impregilo is ready to take on the government’s challenge, drawing on its expertise and strong local roots. The aforementioned strategies include some of the Group’s major ongoing projects such as the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway section and that of Verona Padua, as well as new contracts for the high speed/capacity Naples Bari section, for which a joint venture led by Salini Impregilo (with a 60% share) was awarded the first Naples Cancello section worth approximately €400 million. The related 85 Directors’ Report contract with RFI was signed on 18 December 2017 and development of the executive project has started, scheduled for completion within 180 days. Therefore, the works will start before 30 June 2018. In addition, on 2 November 2017, RFI informed Salini Impregilo, as leader of a consortium in which it has a 51.3% interest, that it had been awarded the Bicocca Catena Nuova railway line section project as part of the contract to double the tracks for the Palermo Catania railway line. The project is worth approximately €186 million. The Group does not limit itself to infrastructure. It is also engaged in acquiring orders in the commercial building sector, thus availing of development opportunities mostly created by the growth of Italy’s large metropolitan areas. In partnership with a leading group of investors and acting as contractor, Salini Impregilo signed a contract on 28 July 2017 for the building of ENI’s new offices in San Donato Milanese. This construction contract is worth roughly €171 million (Salini Impregilo’s share: 60%). The Group has also continued the works to build Line 4 of the Milan metro. The consideration for the civil works is roughly €1 billion, including the additional consideration, of which 50% due to Salini Impregilo. 86 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Concessions The Group’s portfolio of concession activities in Italy mainly consists of investments in the operators still involved in developing projects and constructing the related infrastructure. These concessions principally relate to the transportation sector (motorways, metros and car parks).

As part of its internal controls and risk management system, the Group has a risk management framework, which it keeps up-to-date, is an integral part of internal procedures and is extended to all operating companies to identify, assess, manage and monitor risks in accordance with industry best practices. Development, implementation and circulation of the risk management framework (presented in the following chart) is designed to assist senior management with strategic and commercial planning and operations through the comprehensive, in-depth analysis of relevant factors for the Group’s business, the local contexts in which it operates and the particular operating requirements of its individual contracts, facilitating the identification and monitoring of related risks.

In addition, as part of its risk management activities, the Group carried out risk identification and assessment procedures to check its risk exposure and ensure that it matched its strategic objectives and operating practices, thus increasing the Group’s ability to create sustainable value for its stakeholders. The risk assessment activities include monitoring the progress of mitigation actions defined in 2016 to assist senior management through the ongoing improvement of the effectiveness of decision-making processes and operations. The 2017 risk assessment covered all risk categories and areas of potential significance to the Group, which are included in Salini Impregilo’s risk universe (see following chart). The assessment showed changes in the Group’s risk profile and identified management strategies to deal with the more material risks, which can be developed and introduced through specific measures. 90 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 «RISK UNIVERSE» OF SALINI IMPREGILO BUSINESS CONTEXT • Macro-economic context • Sector trends • Regulatory development • Socio-political context • Competition • Technological innovation STRATEGIC FINANCIAL LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE • Business model • Financial planning • Legal and regulatory compliance • Organisational structure • Availability/cost of capital • Policy and procedure compliance and governance • Counterparty's financial reliability • Contract management • M&A/Disinvestments • Exchange rate volatility • Contractual obligations • Portfolio management and business • Interest rate volatility • Internal/external fraud development • Commodity price volatility • Taxation • Relationships with business partners • Liquidity management • Claim management (clients, partners, suppliers, subcontrators) • Insurance management • Relationships with stakeholders and reputation OPERATIONAL • Bids • Plant and machinery • Job order planning • Human resources • Engineering • Site • Job order control • Information Technology • Authorisations • Natural events • Production management • Quality, health, safety and the • Purchasing • Operational reliability of the environment • Logistics and warehouse counterparty (clients, partners, • Budget, planning and reporting suppliers, subcontrators) Business risks External risks are those that may compromise the Group’s achievement of its objectives, i.e. all events whose occurrence are not influenced by corporate decisions. This category includes all risks arising from a country’s macroeconomic and socio-political dynamics, sector trends and competitive scenario, as well as from industry specific technological innovation and regulatory developments and the projects’ long-term nature. Because of the nature of such risks, the Group must rely on its forecasting and managing abilities. Specifically, Salini Impregilo integrates risk vision in its strategic and business planning processes through the definition of commercial and risk guidelines and the development of a process for the prioritisation and selection of initiatives to be pursued, also and above 91 Directors’ Report all based on the assessment of relevant risks linked to the country and/or sector in which operations are planned, rather than to the counterparty. Risk control is also ensured by monitoring the progress of strategic objectives, including in terms of composition and diversification of the portfolio and its development over time in terms of risk profile. Strategic risks These risks arise from strategic, business and organisational decisions that may adversely impact the Group’s performance and ultimately result in the non-achievement of strategic objectives. They include risks resulting from the choice of business or organisational models through which the Group intends to operate, those arising from M&A transactions, or the ineffective management of the order portfolio or the relationships with key counterparties (clients, partners, suppliers, sub-contractors, etc.). Salini Impregilo considers risk a key element for the preliminary assessment of decisions and strategic choices, so much so that it provided for integration of the strategy definition and development process with that for the identification, measurement and management of risks. The choices pertaining to the adoption of a business or organisational model, the assessment about the opportunity of proceeding with an extraordinary transaction or establishing a partnership are subject to preliminary analysis and evaluation of the related risks and opportunities, with the concurrent identification of risk management methods and strategies to be promptly activated should such risks arise. Financial risks Risks linked to the availability of group resources, depending on the management of receivables and cash and cash equivalents and/or the volatility of market variables such as interest and exchange rates are included in this category. Specifically, liquidity management has the objective of ensuring the financial autonomy of contracts in progress, taking into account the structure of consortia and special purpose entities, which can tie the availability of financial resources to the execution of the relevant projects. Moreover, liquidity management takes into account restrictions to currency transfers imposed by the legislation of some countries. 92 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Salini Impregilo also considers specific risk areas such as the counterparty’s credit rating, raw materials price volatility and management of assurance issues, equipping itself with effective financial planning tools. Legal and compliance risk This risk class includes risks for the management of legal issues and/or risks related to compliance with laws and regulations (e.g. taxation, local legislation, etc.) required in order to operate in the sector and/or specific countries and the risks arising from the management of contracts with business partners. Salini Impregilo deems that monitoring contractual issues linked to contract management and, particularly, the relationship with relevant counterparties, is fundamental. This also includes any internal and external fraud risks, and, more generally, the compliance with procedures and policies established by the Group to govern its operations. With respect to the aforementioned factors, Salini Impregilo implements a regulatory risk monitoring and management policy in order to minimise the impact of such risk, through a multi-level control system that entails collaborative and ongoing liaison with relevant counterparties and business units affected by regulatory developments and the comprehensive assessment of any potential impacts. Operational risks These are risks that could jeopardize value creation and are due to an inefficient and/or ineffective management of the Group’s core business, particularly those linked to bid management and actual execution of contracts. The various risk areas that fall into this class include bid design and planning, effective supply chain, logistics and inventory management, as well as those linked to the management of IT systems, personnel and planning and reporting. These risks arise during the bidding stage and/or performance of contracts, should group policies and procedures not be sufficiently adequate for the management of risk factors linked to the level of complexity of the project or unforeseeable events. To this end, the Group intends to monitor such risks starting at the bidding stage of each contract with a risk/benefit analysis of the project in the event of its award and its impact on the portfolio structure, both in terms of risk 93 Directors’ Report concentration and overall risk profile. At this time, Salini Impregilo, as part of a wider process, prepares a pre-bid risk assessment aimed at identifying potential risks and impacts linked to the project, as well as the necessary mitigation and/ or contingency measures to counter them. The risk surveillance activity is then performed again at tender stage and monitored and updated during contract execution in order to promptly detect the risk exposure development and swiftly implement adequate remediation measures. *** As part of the aforementioned framework for the identification and classification of risks applicable to group operations, Salini Impregilo has adopted a crossfunctional approach for the analysis of risk dimensions that are considered more relevant due to the specific features of its business. These dimensions include various risk areas identified and belonging to Salini Impregilo’s risk universe. Country risk The Group pursues its objectives by operating almost everywhere in the world, leveraging business opportunities in different countries and hence exposing itself to the risks resulting from the characteristics and conditions dictated by them, such as the political, economic and social scenario, local regulations, taxation and operational complexity and, last but not least, safety conditions. Being aware of and constantly monitoring country risk through specific indicators enables the Group first and foremost to define informed commercial strategies, as well as to gain an optimal understanding of the operating scenario and, therefore, adopt precautions and/or implement actions aimed at removing barriers and mitigate potential threats. Counterparty risk Management of counterparty risk requires identification of potential criticalities linked to relationships with the Group’s clients, shareholders, subcontractors and suppliers, so as to create a comprehensive overview of the features of the partners with which Salini Impregilo may start or continue to collaborate. For each of the above counterparty types, risk factors linked to financial and operational reliability apply to a different extent, as does the potential strategic role of a 94 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 partnership for a specific business initiative, as well as all legal and compliance aspects that safeguard the lawfulness of the relationship. The Group performs a counterparty analysis for each new project, involving all the competent departments and the Group Risk Officer, to obtain more precise identification of the critical issues that could arise during the contract’s operational stages and more accurate planning of the possible mitigation actions. Contract risk The contract dimension is key for an effective analysis of all risks linked to the Group’s core business, since it is considered to define tools capable of identifying and monitoring so-called contract risks starting from the bidding stage in a risk prevention perspective, as part of an in-depth analysis of the risks and opportunities linked to the pursuit of a specific activity. Another fundamental aspect is the ongoing tracking of risks once they have been consciously taken on by management, managing the resulting risk exposure in a proactive, dynamic way, as well as its ongoing development over time. *** The analysis of key risk dimensions and the related risk areas has the aim of providing management with a two-sided overview: a detailed one (i.e. at individual country, counterparty and contract level) and a portfolio one (for assessment of the overall exposure to such dimension), in order to assess the Group’s risk profile as well as its compliance with the exposure limits imposed by its risk management capacity. Moreover, the portfolio overview enables the performance of systematic assessments about the potential development of the risk profile upon occurrence of certain events and/or specific choices that may result in any changes to it, through the use of dedicated risk management tools. The risk management framework, as outlined above and subject to further and future developments, has been designed to support decision-making and operational processes at every stage of the management of projects, in order to reduce the possibility that certain events may compromise the Group’s normal business operations or attainment of its defined strategic objectives: to this end, it is integrated in strategic and business planning processes, which, therefore, cannot be separated from the Group’s risk profile, as well as from its choices in terms of risk appetite. 95 Directors’ Report Main risk factors and uncertainties 96 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Main risk factors and uncertainties In addition to the areas outlined in the “Business risk management” section above, the following specific situations linked to major outstanding disputes, country risk exposure and situations characterised by risk and/or uncertainty profiles at 31 December 2017, should be added to the universe of risk events that may potentially impact on operations. Litigation USW Campania projects The Group became involved in the urban solid waste disposal projects in the Province of Naples and other provinces in Campania at the end of the 1990’s through its subsidiaries Fibe and Fibe Campania (the “companies”). The major issues that have characterised the Group’s activities in service contracts since 1999-2000, which have been discussed in detail and reviewed in all of the reports published by the Group starting from that time, have evolved and became more complex over the years, giving rise to a large range of disputes, some of which are major and in part still ongoing. Even given the positive developments, the general situation in terms of pending disputes is still very complex. A brief overview is provided below, especially in relation to existing risk positions. Since Fibe Campania S.p.A. was merged into Fibe S.p.A. in 2009, unless otherwise stated, reference is made exclusively to Fibe S.p.A. in the rest of this section, even with regard to positions and events that affected the merged company. The USW Campania issue comprises various proceedings in different jurisdictions and pending at different court levels. The main aspects of the key proceedings are described below. Administrative Recovery of the amounts owed to Fibe by local administrations litigation for waste disposal fees up to the contracts’ ope legis termination date (15 December 2005) The special commissioner tasked by the Regional Administrative Court to collect receivables of former operators of the waste disposal service 97 Directors’ Report performed until 15 December 2005 submitted their report in November 2014, in which they stated that, despite an outstanding amount payable to FIBE as a fee for its service rendered until 15 December 2005, the administration had already collected directly €46,363,800, without forwarding it to FIBE, and that total outstanding receivables totalled €74,317,550. The Regional Administrative Court held in its ruling no. 7323/2016 that the commissioner’s activities would satisfy Fibe’s requests only after their work was completed and, hence, excluding the possibility that amounts collected from the administration could be paid to it. Fibe has challenged this ruling with the Council of State. Administrative procedures for the recording and recognition of the costs for activities carried out and the work ordered by the administration during the period after termination of the service contracts As early as 2009, Fibe filed a complaint with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court about the administrative procedures for the recording and recognition of the costs incurred by the former service contractors for activities carried out pursuant to law and the work ordered by the administration and performed by the companies during the years from 2006 to 2008 after the contracts had been terminated. As part of the aforementioned ruling, the Regional Administrative Court appointed an inspector who, on 31 March 2014, submitted a preliminary report and then their final report on 21 December 2017 finding that, in short, the amounts stated by Fibe in its appeal and the supporting documentation were substantially consistent. Interest on payment of the RDF plants With ruling no. 3886 of 5 May 2011, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court upheld Fibe’s appeal and ordered the administration to pay the undepreciated costs at the termination date for the RDF plants to Fibe, for a total amount of €205 million, plus legal and default interest from 15 December 2005 until settlement. Following the enforcement order filed by Fibe and opposed by the Office of the Prime Minister, Fibe obtained the allocation of €241 million as a final payment for the receivables for principal and legal interest and suspended 98 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 the enforcement procedure for the further amount of default interest claimed. Both parties initiated proceedings about the merits of the case. Following the adjournment of proceedings with the order of 17 July 2015, the dispute was discussed during the hearing of 21 October 2015. The judge rejected the request for default interest submitted by Fibe in the ruling of 12 February 2016, which Fibe challenged. The related hearing for clarification of the conclusions has been set for 8 February 2019. Environmental As part of the USW Campania projects, the Group had to deal with a disputes large number of administrative measures regarding reclamation and the implementation of safety measures at some of the landfills, storage areas and RDF plants. The unsuccessfully resolved proceedings are on hold pending the merit hearings. For the proceedings regarding the characterisation and emergency safety measures at the Pontericcio site, the RDF plant in Giugliano and the temporary storage area at Cava Giuliani, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court rejected the appeals filed by Fibe with ruling no. 6033 of 2012. An appeal against this ruling, based also on contamination found at a site different to those subject of the proceedings, was filed with the Council of State. It denied Fibe’s precautionary motion to stay the enforcement of the decision. A date for the merits hearing has not yet been set. With respect to the Cava Giuliani landfill, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court, with ruling no. 5831/2012, found that it lacked jurisdiction in favour of the Superior Court of Public Waters, before which the appeal was summed up. Meanwhile, Fibe is continuing with the characterisation operations for the above sites, but this does not constitute any admission of liability whatsoever. The civil In May 2005, the government commissioner filed a motion requesting litigation compensation from Fibe, Fibe Campania and Fisia Italimpianti for alleged damage of about €43 million. During the hearing, the commissioner increased its claims to over €700 million, further to the additional claim for damage to its reputation, calculated to be €1 billion. The companies appeared before the court and, in addition to disputing the claims made by the government commissioner, filed a counterclaim requesting compensation for damage and sundry expenses for over €650 million, plus a further claim for reputation damage quantified at €1.5 billion. 99 Directors’ Report In the same proceeding, the banks that issued Fibe and Fibe Campania’s performance bonds to the government commissioner also requested the commissioner’s claim be dismissed and, in any case, to be held harmless by Salini Impregilo (at the time, Impregilo), which appeared before the court and disputed the bank’s requests. On 30 November 2015, the Office of the Prime Minister received a new claim form served by both Fibe and other group companies involved in various ways in the activities performed in Campania for the waste disposal service, containing claims for the damage suffered as a result of termination of the agreements in 2005. The total amount claimed is €2,429 million. Considering that some requests are already included in other proceedings, the net amount is €2,258 million. The Office of the Prime Minister filed a counterclaim for €845 million for reasons already included in other proceedings. The court appointed an expert for an appraisal which is ongoing. Fibe’s dispute about the local property tax (ICI) on the Acerra waste-toTax litigation energy plant is worthy of note. In January 2013, the subsidiary received tax assessment notices from the Acerra municipality with respect to the waste-to-energy plant, requesting payment of local property tax and the related penalties of approximately €14.3 million for the years from 2009 to 2011. The amount requested by the municipality and challenged by Fibe was confirmed as far as its applicability but reduced in terms of its amount and penalties by the Naples Regional Tax Commission. Although it believes that it will be able to reverse the ruling through an appeal to the Supreme Court, in 2015, the subsidiary comforted by its legal advisors set aside a provision for an amount equal to just the tax plus any accrued interest as a precautionary measure. In September 2006, the public prosecutor at the Naples Court served Criminal Impregilo S.p.A. (now Salini Impregilo), Impregilo International litigation Infrastructures N.V., Fibe S.p.A., Fibe Campania S.p.A., Fisia Italimpiant 100 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 S.p.A. (now Fisia Ambiente S.p.A.) and Gestione Napoli S.p.A. in liquidation with a “Notice of the conclusion of the preliminary investigations about the administrative liability of companies” related to the alleged administrative crime pursuant to article 24 of Legislative decree no. 231/2001, as part of criminal proceedings against some former directors and employees of the above-mentioned companies, who were being investigated for the crimes covered by article 640.1/2.1, of the Criminal Code in connection with the contracts for management of the urban solid waste disposal cycle in Campania. Following the preliminary hearing of 29 February 2008, the Preliminary Hearing Judge at the Naples Court allowed the motions for indictment presented by the public prosecutor, rejecting all the civil parties’ claims against the companies finding them to be unacceptable. As part of these proceedings, in its ruling of 26 June 2007, the Preliminary Investigations Judge ordered the precautionary seizure of the profit from the alleged crime, estimated to approximate €750 million. The precautionary proceedings continued for nearly five years and finally ended in May 2012, without any action taken against the Group. On 4 November 2013, the Naples Court handed down a decision finding all defendants not guilty on all charges. In March 2014, the public prosecutor of Naples challenged the decision and the appeal hearing is taking place at the date of this report. *** In 2008, as part of a new investigation into waste disposal in the Campania region carried out after the ope legis termination of the contracts (on 15 December 2005), the Preliminary Investigations Judge, upon a request by the public prosecutor, issued personal preventive seizure measures against some managers and employees of Fibe, Fibe Campania and Fisia Ambiente and managers of the commissioner’s office. As part of this investigation, which in the record is described both as a continuation of an earlier investigation and as separate proceedings based on new charges, the former service providers and Fisia Ambiente are again charged with the administrative liability attributable to companies pursuant to Legislative decree no. 231/01. In the hearing of 21 March 2013, the Preliminary Hearing Judge ordered that all the defendants and companies involved pursuant to Legislative 101 Directors’ Report decree no. 231/2001 be committed for trial for all charges, transferring the proceedings to the Rome Court as a result of an acting judge being listed by the Naples public prosecutor as being under investigation. At the hearing of 1 April 2014, the Rome Court acquired the ruling delivered by the Fifth Criminal Chamber of the Naples Court in the aforementioned “parent” proceedings (RGNR 15940/03). On 16 June 2016, the Court accepted the public prosecutor’s request and found all the individuals involved in the proceedings not guilty. The hearing will continue for the companies involved pursuant to Legislative decree no. 231/2001. On 23 December 2011, as the party involved pursuant to Legislative decree no. 231/01, Fibe was notified of the completion of the preliminary investigations related to another investigation by the Naples public prosecutor. The allegation relates to the charging of article 24 of Legislative decree no. 231/01 relating to the committing of the crime covered and punished by article 81 and articles 110 and 640.I/II of the Criminal Code committed jointly and with the prior agreement of the defendants (individuals) and other parties to be identified with respect to management of the urban waste water purification service using purification systems. Fibe is accused as it has allegedly presented documents reporting among the other items related to the elimination of USW the cost of transferring leachate, while not mentioning why the leachate had been transferred to plants that did not have the necessary legal authorisation, technical qualifications and residual purification capacity. The public prosecutor filed a motion requesting that the Preliminary Hearing Judge of the Naples Court hear the case filed and the latter, upholding the objection presented by the defence of the public bodies, ruled that it lacked jurisdiction and ordered that the record of the proceedings be forwarded to the Rome public prosecutor. On 13 April 2015, the Rome public prosecutor requested the closure of proceedings for all defendants (both individuals and companies) and all claims. On 17 January 2017, the Preliminary Investigations Judge ordered the closure for all the individuals while the claims about the administrative offences allegedly committed by the companies were transferred to the public prosecutor that sent them to the attorney general for filing on 27 March 2017. 102 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 As the legally-established six-month period has lapsed and the attorney general has not requested any additional investigations be performed, the proceedings can be taken to have been definitively closed. The directors’ considerations about the USW Campania projects at 31 December 2017 The general situation of Salini Impregilo Group with respect to the USW Campania projects at 31 December 2017 still continues to be extremely complex and uncertain (as can be seen from the complexity of the above information). The decisions of the administrative courts regarding the claims made for the costs of the RDF plants that had not been depreciated when the service contracts were terminated (15 December 2005) and the developments of the numerous proceedings are positive and extremely important factors because they support the Group’s arguments regarding the correctness of its conduct and the resulting assessments made to date. Taking also into account the rulings handed down by the administrative judges regarding the aforementioned environmental issues (which are still pending with regard to merit) and for which the directors, with the support of the legal advisors assisting Fibe in the various disputes, deem the risk of an unfavourable outcome to be in the realm of mere possibility, at this time, an accurate timeframe for the end of the various pending proceedings cannot be reasonably determined. Given the complexity and range of the different disputes disclosed in the previous sections, the Group cannot exclude that events may arise in the future that cannot currently be foreseen which might require changes to these assessments. Panama Canal extension project With regard to this project, certain critical issues arose during the first stage of full-scale production which, due to their specific characteristics and the materiality of the work to which they relate, made it necessary to significantly negatively revise the estimates on which the early phases 103 Directors’ Report of the project had been based. The most critical issues related, inter alia, to the geological characteristics of the excavation areas, specifically with respect to the raw materials required to produce concrete and the processing of such raw materials during normal production activities. Additional problems arose due to the adoption by the client of operational and management procedures substantially different from those contractually agreed, specifically with regard to the processes for the approval of technical and design solutions suggested by the contractor. These facts, which were the subject of specific disclosures in previous reports published by the Group, continued in 2013 and 2014. Faced with the client’s persistent unwillingness to reasonably implement appropriate, contractually provided for measures to manage such disputes, the contractor and thus the original contractor partners was forced to acknowledge the resulting impossibility to continue the construction activities needed to complete the project at its full and exclusive risk by undertaking the relevant full financial burden without any guarantee of the commencement of objective negotiations with the counterparty. In this context, at the end of 2013, formal notice was sent to the client to inform it of the intention to immediately suspend work if the client refused once again to address this dispute in accordance with a contractual approach based on good faith and the willingness of all parties to reach a reasonable agreement. Negotiations between the parties, supported by the respective consultants and legal/contract experts, were carried out through February 2014 and, on 13 March 2014, an agreement was signed. The essential elements of the agreement provided that the contractor would resume works and functionally complete them by 31 December 2015, while the client and contracting companies agreed to provide financial support for the works to be finished up to a maximum of about USD1.4 billion. The client met its obligation by granting a moratorium on the refunding of already disbursed contractual advances totalling about USD800 million and disbursing additional advances amounting to USD100 million. The group of contracting companies met their obligation by directly disbursing USD100 million and additional financial resources, through the conversion into cash of existing contractual guarantees totalling USD400 million. 104 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 A The disputes before the Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB) At the end of 2014, the DAB (Dispute Adjudication Board), established by the parties pursuant to the contract, granted GUPC an extension of time of 176 days and an amount of USD243 million for the extra costs, as per the claims presented as Referral 11, of which USD233 million was paid in early 2015 and a further USD10 million in the last quarter of that year. In December 2015 and January 2016, the DAB accepted the claims made by GUPC on three separate occasions (Referrals 13B, 13C and 13D) of USD6.2 million, USD24.7 million and USD11.2 million. In addition, on 20 June 2016, the DAB approved another USD2.7 million with the decision about the claim presented as Referral 14D. On 20 July 2016, the DAB issued two decisions in GUPC’s favour: (i) that related to Referral 14B for the Testing and Laboratory Services subcontract in which it agreed with the contractor and awarded GUPC another USD6.4 million; (ii) that referred to Referral 14C Dewatering of Excavations, where it found GUPC’s claim to be grounded and that it had the right to receive USD0.2 million. The DAB rejected GUPC’s claim about the unforeseen faults and fissures in its decision of 26 July 2016 about Referral 13A by majority vote. This claim was based on similar assumptions to those of Referral 11 and the DAB’s decision (passed by majority vote) is thus contradictory to that announced for Referral 11, as shown also by the dissenting opinion of one of its three members. GUPC expressed its dissatisfaction with this decision and its claim was subsequently included in those being heard as part of another pending hearing (see the second arbitration). Finally, with respect to Referral 14A about the physical and geological conditions of the area around the sides of the reservoir and some storage areas, the DAB’s decision of 26 January 2017 (passed by majority vote) (i) rejected most of the claim made by GUPC based on similar assumptions to those of Referrals 11 and 13A and (ii) found that GUPC was entitled to a fee of roughly USD4 million compared to the requested amount of USD114 million. One of the DAB members presented a dissenting opinion and GUPC filed its dissatisfaction and commenced the related arbitration proceedings (see the “fourth arbitration”). As the DAB has not communicated a decision about the other claims within the contractual timeframe, they will be subject to arbitration. 105 Directors’ Report B Pending arbitration There are a number of separate arbitration hearings ongoing before the International Chamber of Commerce between GUPC (with its European partners Sacyr, Salini Impregilo and Jan De Nul) and the Panama Canal Authority. The first relates to the Cofferdam dispute and has been completed. The award, published on 31 July 2017, rejected the claims made by GUPC and the shareholders by majority vote (two against one) and ordered them to pay the legal costs (including the costs incurred by ACP) of approximately USD22 million. The dissenting member of the arbitration tribunal filed its strong disapproval of the vote criticising the interpretation of the facts and law in the award and identifying substantial errors. Together with the other shareholders, Salini Impregilo challenged the award before the Southern District Court of Florida (where the arbitration was heard) asking it be annulled. At the date of this report, the hearing was at a preliminary stage. The second hearing covers DAB’s decisions about the claims about the inadequate quality of the basalt compared to the quality guaranteed by ACP and the lengthy delays caused by ACP to approve the design formula for the concrete mix. After the stage performed to confirm the arbitration tribunal’s competence to rule which ended with the award that the tribunal was competent to rule on the damages incurred by the individual members of the consortium, the merits proceedings are in progress and the hearing is scheduled for the start of 2019. The third hearing relates to the extra costs incurred by GUPC due to certain unjustified conditions imposed by ACP for the design of the lock gates and other claims about labour costs. The fourth hearing involves sundry claims mentioned in the completion certification. Both of these hearings, commenced on 8 December 2016, are at an initial stage (only the original process has been filed). The arbitration tribunals have not yet been constituted and no information is available at present about the hearing dates. In July 2017, GUPC and the shareholders filed another two requests for arbitration with respect to the third and fourth arbitrations covering 106 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 the same claims already made in the third and fourth hearings, respectively. These requests were filed on a precautionary basis after the 84-day deadline given to the DAB to decide on the claims expired. As the DAB did not take a decision within the contractual deadline, any decision about these claims is now to be taken by the arbitration tribunal. There is also another dispute about the contractual advances due to ACP for which a fifth arbitration hearing has commenced. The tribunal was constituted on 9 August 2017 and its competence to decide on the disputes about the returns of the contractual advances has been approved. As part of the same proceeding, GUPC and the shareholders requested as a precautionary measure the blocking of the return of the guarantees on the advances before the merits of the dispute are decided. Concurrently, ACP commenced legal proceedings in England about the return of the advances. These proceedings are not expected to be completed before the end of 2018. Already in previous years, the Group applied a valuation approach to the project on the basis of which significant losses to complete the contract were recognised, offset in part by the corresponding recognition of the additional consideration claimed from the client and determined based on the expectation that recognition of such consideration could be reasonably deemed to be highly probable based on the opinions expressed by its technical and legal experts and in light of the damages awarded by the DAB. In 2017, the estimate for the extra costs to complete the project was updated, as well as the additional consideration claimed from the client (again with the support of the company’s technical and legal experts). The work to extend the Panama Canal has been substantially completed to the client’s satisfaction and ACP has issued the Taking Over Certificate. The Canal was re-opened on 26 June 2016. The Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date. 107 Directors’ Report Copenaghen Cityringen As a result of critical issues about this project related to its specific features and the significance of the works, the Group had to significantly revise the cost estimates for the early stages of this project. They mainly related to the construction of the concrete works, the electromechanical works and the architectural finishings. The negotiations with the client, assisted by their consultants and technical/legal advisors, led to the signing of an interim agreement on 30 December 2016 (which allowed the Group to collect €145 million) and other agreements (claim settlement agreement no. 7 and the additional agreement) which enabled it to collect another €40 million (for a total of €185 million) with the settlement of some claims, while the remaining outstanding claims have been referred to the arbitration proceeding provided for in the contract. The Group has recognised all the significant extra costs to complete the contract, partly offset by the additional consideration claimed from the client, to be decided upon by the arbitration tribunal, calculated on the basis that the Group deems it highly probable that its claims will be upheld, based on the opinions of its technical and legal advisors. However, it cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change its valuations. CAVTOMI Consortium (high speed/capacity Turin Milan line) With respect to the contract for the high speed/capacity Turin Milan railway line Novara Milan sub-section, the general contractor Fiat (now FCA N.V.) is required to follow the registered claims of the general subcontractor CAVTOMI Consortium (the “consortium”), in which Salini Impregilo has a share of 74.69%, against the client Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (“RFI”). The consortium carried out all design and execution activities for the project. Accordingly, on 18 April 2008, Fiat initiated contractual arbitration proceedings against RFI for the award, in particular, of damages 108 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 suffered for delays in the works ascribable to the client, nonachievement of the early completion bonus also due to the client and higher consideration. On 9 July 2013, the arbitration tribunal handed down an award in favour of Fiat, ordering RFI to pay approximately €187 million (of which about €185 million pertaining to the consortium). RFI appealed against the award before the Rome Appeal Court on 30 September 2013 and in October 2013 paid the amount due to Fiat, which in turn forwarded the relevant share to the consortium in December 2013. The ruling of 23 September 2015 of the Rome Appeal Court cancelled a large part of the aforementioned arbitration award. FCA appealed to the Supreme Court and issued a claims form for the revision of the Appeal Court’s ruling. Since the Appeal Court’s ruling is enforceable and following the notification by RFI to FCA of a writ of enforcement of approximately €175 million, FCA and RFI reached an agreement whereby FCA provided RFI with the following guarantees in order to prevent execution of the aforementioned ruling, without prejudice to the parties’ substantive rights, which are subject to final judgement: (i) payment of an amount of approximately €66 million, and (ii) issue to RFI of a bank security of €100 million (€75 million by Salini Impregilo). The consortium is confident that its arguments will be accepted at the end of the dispute supported by the opinion of its legal advisors. However, the Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date. On 12 October 2017, FAC informed RFI together with the consortium of another claim form presented to the Rome Court for claims made during the contract term and not covered by the previous award. 109 Directors’ Report COCIV With the claim form notified to the COCIV consortium on 18 September 2014, the client RFI S.p.A. challenged the validity of the inter partes arbitration award of 20-21 June 2013 and also requested the return of about €108 million (approximately €74 million for Salini Impregilo) collected by COCIV as a result of the award. The COCIV consortium appeared in court and is confident that the arbitration award in its favour will be confirmed by the ruling. The Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date. *** On 26 October 2016, some managers and employees of COCIV were arrested as were other persons (including the chairman of Reggio Calabria Scilla S.C.p.A., who promptly resigned). The above two legal entities were informed that the Genoa and Rome public prosecutors are investigating alleged obstruction of public tender procedures, corruption and, in some cases, criminal organisation. Specifically, the proceeding before the Genoa Court (involving COCIV managers and employees) covers alleged obstruction of public tender procedures for supplies or works on individual lots (for which the public prosecutor also intends to investigate the parent’s CEO) as well as two cases of corruption. The proceeding before the Rome Court relates to the alleged bribery of works management in order to encourage the works manager (also under investigation) to perform acts contrary to their official duties. As a precautionary measure and to demonstrate its non-involvement in the crime, a clean break with the past and full collaboration with the authorities, COCIV has implemented the following measures and actions: replacement of the individuals involved in the proceedings and withdrawal of their proxies; dismissal or suspension of these employees; ban on their access to work premises or corporate e-email or any document archives; 110 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 • lapse of all the contracts that showed their reprehensible conduct as per the remand orders; • cancellation of ongoing tenders and an awarded tender to call them again after a clear-cut break with the past; • termination of the contract with the works management service provider and temporary appointment, with the consent of RFI S.p.A., of two experts to perform this service, while communicating its willingness to transfer this duty (currently carried out by the consortium as per the contract) to the client, as per its request; • on 19 January 2017, appointment by RFI S.p.A., upon COCIV’s request, of a person identified by it to participate in the tender boards for the work that COCIV should assign under EU procedures. On 11 January 2017, as part of the proceedings commenced on 16 November 2016, ANAC sent the Genoa Prefecture a proposal for adoption of the extraordinary measures pursuant to article 32 of Decree law no. 90/14 against COCIV. On 3 March 2017, the Rome Prefecture appointed a special commissioner for the extraordinary and temporary administration of COCIV in accordance with article 32.1.b) of Decree law no. 90 of 24 June 2014, converted with amendments by Law no. 114 of 11 August 2014 for a six-month period, which has now been extended to 15 January 2019. While the criminal proceedings before the Genoa Court are still at the investigation stage, on 31 January 2017, the Rome public prosecutor notified the completion of the preliminary investigations of the individuals involved in the alleged crimes of criminal organisation and bribery, as well as COCIV and Reggio Calabria Scilla S.C.p.A. for the administrative offence as per articles 5 and 25 of Legislative decree no. 231/01. After the preliminary hearing, the companies’ positions were cleared or not committed for trial due to faults in the related notifications and they are now the subject of another preliminary hearing. All the individuals have been committed for trial at the hearing of 7 July 2017 before the Rome Court, where the pre-trial hearing of 27 March 2018 will take place. The consortium deems that the crimes allegedly committed by its personnel (should they be found guilty by the court) were to its 111 Directors’ Report detriment and were essentially committed in their own interests (and, hence, not in the consortium’s interest) by fraudulently circumventing the rules in place to control its activities. Moreover, these alleged offences would not have required RFI S.p.A. to pay a larger or undue amount or create economic benefits for the consortium but rather would have required it to pay higher costs. The consortium’s new structure (senior management and operating personnel) is committed to ensuring that the works can continue while concurrently dealing with the social and employment issues arising from the discontinuity measures that the consortium has had to put in place vis-à-vis the third party companies involved in the legal proceedings. The consortium has carefully checked the quality of the materials works previously carried out although this is not an issue raised by the public prosecutors. Its results are wholly in line with the findings of the expert appointed by the Genoa court, which both found the full compliance of the materials used by the consortium with the quality levels specified in the contracts and relevant legislation. At present, the Group does not have information that would allow it to assess whether any potential developments could require modifications to the assessments made to date or the probability or scope of such developments. The directors deem that the effects of the above measure do not affect the considerations made since 1 January 2014 about the existence of control as established by IFRS 10, confirmed by the opinion of an external consultant. Therefore, the consortium continues to qualify as a subsidiary and is consolidated on a line-by-line basis. Strait of Messina bridge Eurolink In March 2006, as lead contractor of the joint venture created for this project (interest of 45%) (subsequently merged into the SPE Eurolink S.C.p.A.), Impregilo S.p.A. (now Salini Impregilo S.p.A.) signed a contract with Stretto di Messina S.p.A. for its engagement as general contractor for the final and executive designs and construction of the Strait of Messina Bridge and related roadway and railway connectors. 112 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 A bank syndicate also signed the financial documentation required in the General Specifications after the joint venture won the tender, for the concession of credit lines of €250 million earmarked for this project. The client was also given performance bonds of €239 million, as provided for in the contract. Reduction of the credit line to €20 million was approved in 2010. Stretto di Messina S.p.A. and the general contractor Eurolink S.C.p.A. signed a rider in September 2009 which covered, inter alia, suspension of the project works carried out since the contract was signed and until that date. As provided for by the rider, the final designs were delivered to the client and its board of directors approved them on 29 July 2011. Decree law no. 187 was issued on 2 November 2012 providing for “Urgent measures for the renegotiation of the contracts with Stretto di Messina S.p.A. (the client) and for local public transport”. Following enactment of this decree and given the potential implications for its position as general contractor, Eurolink, led by Salini Impregilo, notified the client of its intention to withdraw from the contract under the contractual terms, also to protect the positions of all the Italian and foreign co-venturers. However, given the immense interest in constructing the works, the general contractor also communicated its willingness to review its position should the client demonstrate its real intention to carry out the project. To date, the ongoing negotiations have not been successful despite the efforts made. Eurolink has commenced various legal proceedings in Italy and the EU, arguing that the provisions of the above decree are contrary to the Constitution and EU laws and that they damage Eurolink’s legally acquired rights under the contract. It has also requested that Stretto di Messina be ordered to pay the amounts requested by the general contractor due to the termination of the contract for reasons not attributable to it. With regard to the actions filed at EU level, in November 2013, the European Commission communicated its decision not to follow up the proceedings, as no treaties were violated, and confirmed this on 7 January 2014, with a communication dismissing the case. As regards the civil action in Italy, Salini Impregilo and all the members of Eurolink have jointly and severally asked that Stretto di Messina be ordered to pay the amounts claimed, for various reasons, due to the termination of the contract for 113 Directors’ Report reasons not attributable to them. After completion of the investigation phase, the Judge referred the case to the Rome Court for the first level ruling. In the meantime, before the investigation phase had been completed, Stretto di Messina brought an action before the Supreme Court under article 41 of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure for a prior ruling on the Rome Civil Court’s lack of jurisdiction. After the case had been included in the register, in order that the parties can present their cases, the court suspended ruling RG no. 16617/2013 in its order published on 2 January 2018 until the united chambers of the Supreme Court hand down their ruling on the lack of jurisdiction claimed by Stretto di Messina. In December 2017, the substitute attorney general of the Supreme Court requested that the jurisdiction of the civil judge be confirmed since the action presented by Stretto di Messina was inadmissible, tardy and groundless. Considering the complex nature of the various legal proceedings and although the legal advisors assisting Salini Impregilo and the general contractor are reasonably confident about the outcome of the proceedings and the recoverability of the remaining assets (mainly contract work in progress) recognised for this contract, it cannot be excluded that events not currently foreseeable may arise in the future which would require the current assessments to be revised. Romania Orastie Sibiu highway Salini Impregilo has been operating in Romania since July 2011 following the start of the works for the Orastie Sibiu highway section contract (Lot 3). In July 2013, it was awarded a second tender for the development of Lot 2 of another highway section between the cities of Lugoj and Deva. The two contracts are part of a wider road project called Pan-European Corridor IV, which cuts through Romania from Nãdlac (on the border with Hungary) via Pitesti and reaches Constanta, on the Black Sea. Both contracts were entered into with the Romanian National Road & Highways Company (CNADNR) and 85% financed with EU structural funds and 15% by the Romanian government. 114 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The Orastie-Sibiu contract provided for the construction of 22.1 km of two-lane highway (plus the relevant emergency lanes). In September 2015, Salini Impregilo presented an application for arbitration to the client for claims about the extension of the original contractual delivery times and payment of an additional consideration due to unforeseeable events and the client’s negligent conduct. On 13 January 2016, with works completion at 99.9%, following a number of disputes between the parties, the client terminated the contract and enforced the contractual guarantees of approximately €13 million, motivating such unilateral decision as being due to the alleged non-resolution of non-compliances notified by works management. The aforementioned contract termination, which the parent deemed fully unfounded, was formally contested as a result. The dispute between the parties is currently being heard by the International Court of Arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce. The directors (also based on the advice of their legal and technical experts), believe that the parent’s operations were correct and that the amounts recognised as contract work in progress and financial assets at 31 December 2017, inclusive of requests for additional consideration also part of the claim, can be collected. Considering the uncertainties linked to the dispute stage, the Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date. Rome Metro As part of the contract for the design and construction of the works for the B1 line of the Rome Metro, Salini Impregilo commenced three legal proceedings in its name and as lead contractor of the joint venture against Roma Metropolitane S.r.l. and Roma Capitale requesting they be ordered to pay the disputed claims recorded during works execution, for which a technical appraisal by a court-appointed expert was provided. The Rome Court’s ruling of 22 August 2016 settled the first level proceedings involving the claims made for the Bologna Conca d’Oro 115 Directors’ Report section and partly accepted the joint venture’s requests, ordering Roma Metropolitane S.r.l. to pay €10,607,683.91, plus VAT and related costs. The joint venture commenced the necessary actions to collect the receivable based on this temporary enforceable ruling. It also presented an appeal for the award of a greater amount. The second proceeding relates to the first set of claims for the Conca d’Oro Jonio section and is currently at the decisional phase. The third proceeding refers to the second and last set of claims for the Conca d’Oro Jonio section, was commenced in September 2016 and is currently at the initial stages. The directors (also supported by their legal and technical experts) deem that the amounts recognised in contract work in progress at 31 December 2017, inclusive of the additional consideration claimed from the client and calculated based on the expectation that recognition of such consideration is probable also on the basis of the aforementioned expert opinions, are collectible. Considering the uncertainties linked to the dispute stage, the Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date. CONSORZIO CON.FE.MI./FERROVIENORD S.p.A. (Imprepar) In 2005, the Milan Court found the 1988 contract between the Confemi consortium (in which Imprepar S.p.A. had an 18.26% share) and Ferrovie Nord Milano S.p.A. (FNME) for the construction of the quadrupling of the Saronno-Malpensa railway section to be void due to corruption. The Court ordered that the consortium was to return the difference of approximately €44 million between the amounts received and the value of the works performed, as well as interest calculated on the payments made. In 2011, the Milan Appeal Court substantially confirmed these amounts. While awaiting the appeal ruling, Confemi and FNME signed an agreement in 2008 deferring enforcement of the ruling until it had been passed res judicata and establishing an amount of €6 million for 116 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 the party that will be found guilty, as well as Confemi’s right to request return of approximately €3 million previously paid to FNME. On 10 May 2017, the Supreme Court handed down its ruling no. 11446/17 which (i) rejected Confemi’s main appeal and (ii) accepted the first and second part of FNME’s counter appeal (damage to its reputation and return by Confemi of the amounts collected as part of the review of all the contractual prices increase of 25% allocated to Confemi by the judges who heard the merits case). The Supreme Court has therefore reversed the Milan Appeal Court’s ruling for the accepted reasons and deferred judgement about payment of the amounts of point (ii) to the same Appeal Court. In November 2017, Confemi appealed to the Supreme Court challenging the part of its ruling no. 11446/17 where it accepted the grounds for FNME’s counter appeal about the 25% reduction in the amounts to be paid to it as a review, as described above, given that Confemi deemed that a final decision on this had already been handed down during the appeal. The ruling by the Milan Appeal Court as the referring court has been resumed by FNME. Confemi has given its lawyers a mandate to represent it in court. On 20 November 2017, the consortium was put into liquidation. On 24 October 2014, FNME commenced a proceeding at the Milan Court for the alleged joint liability of the consortium members together with Confemi. The Group’s interest in the consortium had been obtained as a result of the parent’s acquisition of the business unit related to the contract from Lodigiani S.p.A. (which also included the voided contract). Impregilo transferred its interest in Confemi to Imprepar in 2001 as part of the contribution of a business unit. Both Salini Impregilo and Imprepar have been summonsed by FNME. Colombia Yuma Yuma Concesionaria S.A. (in which the Group has a 48.3% investment) holds the concession for the construction and operation of sector 3 of the Ruta del Sol motorway in Colombia. 117 Directors’ Report The Group also has a 55.27% stake (through the parent 48.97% and Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. 6.3%) in the investment fund Fondo di Capital Privado Ruta del Sol (Comparto B) set up for project financing purposes. Its investment does not give it voting rights. On 4 January 2018, the client ANI commenced a procedure to assess Yuma’s serious breaches of the concession contract (delays in carrying out the works) and whether to terminate the contract. Yuma, on the other hand, deems that the serious breaches have been committed by ANI (late payments) and, in any case, refer to events outside its control which have led to a significant imbalance in the mutual rights and obligations of the parties to the contract that the client is obliged to rectify. The operator commenced procedures for a local arbitration for contract variations and an international one for claims related to the construction stage. It is also evaluating whether to take additional legal action to protect its rights. Yuma has also entered into negotiations with the banks to extend the repayment date of the COP450,000 million bridge loan (equivalent to roughly €128 million) taken out to finance the project. The present situation with the customer ANI led to the temporary suspension of the works to build the Ruta del Sol motorway in the second half of the year by the contractor Constructura Ariguani Sas, wholly owned by Salini Impregilo Group. Considering the uncertainties linked to the dispute stage, the Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date. 118 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Country risk Libya Salini Impregilo S.p.A. operates in Libya through a permanent establishment and a subsidiary, Impregilo Lidco Libya General Contracting Company (Impregilo Lidco), which has been active in Libya since 2009 and is 60% owned by Salini Impregilo with the other 40% held by a local partner. The directors do not deem that significant risks exist with respect to the permanent establishment’s contracts as work thereon has not started, except for the Koufra airport project. Moreover, the Group’s exposure is not material. The Group is also involved in the Libyan Coastal Highway project which leads to the Egyptian border for the stretch through Cyrenaica, which had not yet been started at the reporting date. Impregilo Lidco won important contracts for the construction of: • infrastructural works in Tripoli and Misuratah; • university campuses in Misuratah, Tarhunah and Zliten; • a new Conference Hall in Tripoli. Despite the dramatic political events in Libya from February 2011, Salini Impregilo has always acted in accordance with the contractual terms. This political upheaval has not yet subsided, impeding the subsidiary from developing its business. At present, Salini Impregilo does not expect activities to be resumed in the near future as there are also serious security problems. The subsidiary Impregilo Lidco continues to be present in Libya and to maintain contacts with its clients, complying promptly with legal and corporate requirements. It informed its clients immediately of the activation of the force majeure clause (provided for contractually) given the situation in Libya, but the projects covered by the contracts should continue to be a priority for the country. 119 Directors’ Report The clients have acknowledged the contractual rights and the validity of the claims presented for the costs, losses and damages incurred as a result of the above-mentioned unrest. Once the local situation has normalised and the country’s institutions are working again, these claims will be discussed with the clients. The impairment losses on net assets and costs incurred starting from the 2012 financial statements until the reporting date are fully included in contract work in progress. The subsidiary has presented claims to the clients for these amounts, which it deems are fully recoverable as they are due to force majeure. In addition, the investments made to date are covered by the contractual advances received from the clients. The subsidiary’s legal advisors agree with this approach as can be seen in their reports. No significant risks are deemed to exist for the recovery of the net assets attributable to the subsidiary, thanks in part to actions and claims filed against the clients. This country’s situation continues to be complex and highly critical, which does not allow the Group to make reliable forecasts about whether operations can be resumed in the short term. Salini Impregilo will continue to guarantee the subsidiary’s business continuity. However, it cannot be excluded that events which cannot currently be foreseen may take place after the date of preparation of this report that could require changes to the assessments made to date. Venezuela Salini Impregilo Group has operated in Venezuela for over thirty years and has a stable presence there through its permanent organisation. It carries out important projects to develop the South American country directly or in partnerships with international partners. The work in progress, mainly in the railway and hydroelectric sectors, relates to the following contracts: 120 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Railway sector: i) Puerto Cabello La Encrucijada section project; ii) Guarico project, for the San Juan de Los Morros-San Fernando de Apure and Chaguaramas-Cabruta sections; Hydroelectric sector: i) the Tocoma dam project. The clients for the above projects are all government agencies (the Venezuelan goverment or related bodies). At year end, the Group's total exposure for its ongoing contracts in Venezuela amounted to €628.3 million, comprising work in progress, trade receivables and loans inclusive of the allowance for impairment set up in previous years. Although the Venezuelan government has recently reconfirmed its intention to complete the railway and hydroelectrical projects, deemed to be of strategic interest for the country's development, these contracts have seen payment delays, temporary suspensions and rescheduling of the work to complete them over the last few years. Venezuela's creditworthiness drastically contracted in the second half of the year due to: (i) its failure to make approximately USD200 million in coupon payments, and (ii) critical current and prospective macroeconomic data for the South American country's future development. As a result, Standard & Poor's and Fitch both downgraded the country's credit rating twice to reflect its probable default state. Given this economic and social context, the EU Foreign Minister adopted a measure approving sanctions against Venezuela. The USA imposed financial sanctions on Venezuela, limiting transactions with US financial institutions by the South American country. Considering the country's situation, the Group calculated the recoverable amount of the assets recognised in its consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017. 121 Directors’ Report As described earlier, the Group's exposure amounted to €628.3 million at year end, including €113.3 million of loans and approximately €515 million of receivables for consideration accrued on work performed (this latter figure comprises €307.5 million already invoiced and recognised as trade receivables and €207.5 million recognised as contract work in progress net of advances on contract work in progress). The Group estimated total impairment losses on these assets of €314.2 million. As it had already set up an allowance for impairment of about €22 million at 31 December 2016, it recognised an impairment loss of approximately €292 million at the end of 2017. However, in view of the delicate and complex uncertain situation that has developed at political level, the possibility that events not foreseeable at the reporting date may arise in the future that may require changes to the assessments made to date cannot be excluded. Nigeria The economic crisis caused by the drop in oil prices, the country’s main revenue contributor, continues to limit Nigeria’s ability from investing in infrastructure. Nigeria’s construction sector, like its other production sectors, is stagnant. The unemployment rate continues to rise, as do the widespread discontent and crime. The local currency prices of imported goods have increased significantly due to the central bank’s official depreciation of the Naira in July 2016 with the resulting Naira/Euro exchange rate moving from 220 to 340. There was a slight improvement in the year with visible interest in continuing the production activities for projects deemed essential by the federal government. In view of the present critical political and economic situation, it cannot be excluded that events which cannot currently be foreseen may take place after the date of preparation of this report that require changes to the assessments made to date. 122 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Turkey Despite internal political tension and the serious public order situations in certain areas which culminated with the coup d’état foiled in July 2016, Turkey showed its considerable ability to deal with the critical external and internal issues during the period. With respect to the Cetin contract, for which a dispute with the client and its parent Statkraft had been commenced, leading to legal action being taken by the joint venture and the Group in Italy, France and Norway in the period from March 2016 to June 2017, a settlement agreement was signed in June 2017. This had already been enforced in part and entailed the joint termination of the contract as well as the parties’ waiver of any claims for damage and payment of €33.5 million by the client to the joint venture. In addition, Salini Impregilo will receive reimbursement of the amounts it paid when the performance bond was enforced in March 2017. The work site is currently being dismantled. With respect to the other contract, Gaziantep, also located in a “critical” area, the province and city of Gaziantep, which is an important busy industrial hub, are protected by a large Turkish security force assisted by NATO. There is a heightened risk of possible isolated terrorist actions, especially against government sites. Ukraine This country’s political and economic situation is still extremely difficult. The continued instability has led to a serious economic recession and steady worsening in Ukraine’s public finances. Given the location of the Group’s construction site for the Capital Repair M03 Kiyv-Kharkiv-Dovzhanskiy contract near Poltava, which is far away from the areas most affected by the ongoing armed conflict in the south east, the safety of contract activities has not been significantly affected. The Group is not exposed to currency depreciation risk since the contractual amounts are expressed in Euros and US dollars. The burden of the conflict and the economic slowdown have negatively impacted the country’s public debt. The unstable institutional and 123 Directors’ Report governmental situation affected the client’s organisation (the Ukraine State Agency of Automobile Roads Ukravtodor), which has seen the introduction of new senior managers. This made it more difficult for the Group to liaise with the client. In addition, the parent’s sale of Todini Costruzioni Generali (which had been awarded both contracts in this country) made intensive communication with the client necessary to clarify the Group’s position and guarantee continuity in the Capital Repair M03 KiyvKharkiv-Dovzhanskiy project. Moreover, Ukravtodor has not accepted the company’s position and communicated its intention to terminate the contract in August 2016. The Group defended its position following the contractually-specified procedure. In December 2016, the dispute arbitration board, appointed to rule on the termination, confirmed its illegality. The Group took all necessary steps to reach an agreement with Ukravtodor to recommence the contract activities, although the client has rejected its overtures and has not acknowledged that ordered by the dispute arbitration board. It has refused to come to an agreement with the Group. On 7 March 2017, Salini Impregilo thus communicated the termination as contractually provided for and the dispute is currently before the Paris International Court of Arbitration. All the subsequent applications to the dispute board were accepted and the Group has been awarded the equivalent of roughly €75 million. The dispute board decisions were sent to the Paris International Court of Arbitration. The Group’s position in Ukraine continues to be very unclear given the country’s economic, political and social situation and the dispute about the Capital Repair M03 Kiyv-Kharkiv-Dovzhanskiy project. In view of the present critical situation, it cannot be excluded that events which cannot currently be foreseen may take place after the date of preparation of this report that require changes to the assessments made to date. 124 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 125 Directors’ Report Events after the reporting date 126 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 This section sets out the main events that have taken place since the reporting date and not commented on earlier in this report. Condotte Società Italiana per Condotte d’Acqua S.p.A., which has investments in group companies, filed a petition as per article 161.6 of the Bankruptcy Law to the Rome Court. It has also reserved the right to file a final deed of arrangement proposal (with the plan and documentation required by article 161.2/3 of the Bankruptcy Law) or an application for approval of debt restructuring agreements. On 15 January 2018, the Rome Court granted a period of up to 18 May 2018 for presentation of the above proposal. It appointed special commissioners to monitor the company’s activities until this date, requiring the company to comply with a number of measures, including disclosure obligations. Condotte has investments in the following group companies: Alta Velocità Torino-Milano consortium CAVTOMI COCIV consortium CONSAVIA consortium in liquidation EUROLINK S.C.P.A. IRICAV DUE consortium LIBYAN EXPRESSWAY CONTRACTORS – L.E.C. MELITO S.C.R.L. in liquidation PANTANO S.C.R.L. in liquidation RC-SCILLA S.C.P.A. SALERNO REGGIO CALABRIA S.C.P.A – SA-RC . SCILLA consortium in liquidation These consortia/consortium companies are carefully monitoring developments in the situation. 127 Directors’ Report Outlook 128 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The ongoing growth trend continued during 2017 even though the Group’s markets are affected by numerous macroeconomic and political uncertainties, as described earlier in this Report. The Group has an excellent order backlog for 2018 in both quantitative and qualitative terms, which will allow it to strengthen its leadership position in the large complicated infrastructure sector, confirm its number one position in the water treatment segment and its exceptional track record in the transport sector, especially in the metro, railway and road segments. The Group’s large order backlog and the encouraging expectations about growth in the infrastructure market, especially in the US, where Salini Impregilo has strengthened its base through Lane, and the ongoing rationalisation of non-core assets, ensure continuation of the Group’s development as defined in its 2016-2019 strategic plan. Its objectives may be affected by external factors that cannot currently be foreseen or controlled by management. 129 Directors’ Report Report on corporate governance and the ownership structure 130 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The corporate governance model adopted by Salini Impregilo complies with the principles enshrined in the “Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies” approved by the corporate governance committee and promoted by Borsa Italiana S.p.A., ABI, Ania, Assogestioni, Assonime and Confindustria. More information about the corporate governance system pursuant to article 123-bis of the Consolidated Finance Act (Legislative decree no. 58 of 24 February 1998, as subsequently amended) is available in the Report on corporate governance and the ownership structure, published on the parent’s website in the governance section (www.salini-impregilo.com). 131 Directors’ Report Alternative performance indicators 132 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 As required by Consob communication no. 0092543 of 3 December 2015, details of the performance indicators used in this Report and in the Group’s institutional communications are given below. Financial Debt/Equity ratio: this ratio shows net financial position (shown ratios with a minus sign when negative, i.e., net financial indebtedness) as the numerator and equity as the denominator. The items making up the financial position are presented in a specific table in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The equity items are those included in the relevant section of the statement of financial position. For consolidation purposes, equity used for this ratio also includes that attributable to non-controlling interests. Debt Liquidity and other financial assets is the sum of the following items: indicators a. Current and non-current financial assets b. Cash and cash equivalents Medium to long-term debt is the sum of the following items: a. Current account facilities and other loans b. Bonds c. Finance lease liabilities Other financial assets and liabilities is the sum of the following items: a. Derivatives b. The Group’s net amounts due from/to consortia and consortium companies operating under a cost recharging system and not included in the consolidation scope. Performance 1. Gross operating profit: this ratio shows the sum of the following items indicators included in the statement of profit or loss: a. Total revenue 133 Directors’ Report b. Total costs, less amortisation, depreciation, impairment losses and provisions This can also be shown as the ratio of gross operating profit to total revenue. 2. Operating profit: the operating profit given in the statement of profit or loss, being the sum of total revenue and total costs. 3. Return on sales or R.o.S.: given as a percentage, shows the ratio of operating profit (as calculated above) to total revenue. Given the Group’s optimisation of its geographical and commercial positioning, which led to its repositioning on the international market, and considering that other sector operators use a calculation method for gross operating profit different to that used previously by the Group, in order to facilitate a comparison with the figures of its key competitors, including on new markets, the Group decided to change the composition of this indicator to exclude provisions and impairment losses as, in some cases, they have a non-recurring nature. The Group deems that this new calculation method assists an understanding and the comparability of its performance indicators. Adjusted figures The Group monitors the key figures of Lane Group for management purposes adjusting the IFRS figures prepared for consolidation purposes to present the results of the joint ventures not controlled by Lane which are consolidated on a proportionate basis. These figures (“JV not controlled by Lane”) show the status of contracts managed directly by Lane or through non-controlling investments in joint ventures. In addition, the 2017 IFRS figures have been adjusted to sterilise the effects of the impairment losses recognised on some assets related to the construction of infrastructure in Venezuela. 134 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 135 Directors’ Report Other information 136 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Compliance with the conditions of article 15 of the Stock Exchange Regulation Salini Impregilo confirms that it complies with the conditions of article 15 of Consob regulation no. 20249 (“Regulation on markets”), based on the procedures adopted before article 15 was effective and the availability of the related information.

Non-financial Statement Salini Impregilo S.p.A. is exempt from preparation of the Non-financial Statement as per article 3 of Legislative decree no. 254/2016 as it prepares a Consolidated Non-financial Statement in accordance with article 4 of the same decree to which reference should be made. On behalf of the board of directors Chairman (signed on the original) 137 Directors’ Report 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement Prepared in accordance with Legislative decree no. 254/2016 138 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 After more than 110 years of operations, Salini Impregilo has developed a robust business model capable of creating economic value for its shareholders, investors and clients while generating social and environmental value for the areas in which it operates, adopting an approach designed to create shared value. This Consolidated Non-financial Statement (the “Statement”) refers to Salini Impregilo Group (the “Group”), which includes Salini Impregilo S.p.A. and the fully-consolidated companies. The terms “Salini Impregilo” or the “Company” are used to refer to just the parent, Salini Impregilo S.p.A.. More information about the Statement’s scope is given in the section “Methodology for reporting non-financial information”. The policies, management systems and internal procedures described below refer to Salini Impregilo. The essential content of these documents are reviewed by the competent bodies of the subsidiaries, consortia, consortium companies, etc. in which Salini Impregilo has an investment with a view to their adoption. The subsidiary Lane (USA) has its own policies and operating methods for non-financial aspects, which are based on those of the Company. Sustainability context Infrastructure is the cornerstone of the economic and social activities of all communities and is essential for growth. It facilitates access to basic services, underpins local development and improves the communities’ quality of life. The main global megatrends (climate change and resource scarcity, accelerated urbanisation, demographic and social shifts, shifts in economic power and technological breakthroughs ) influence the decisions of governments and economic operators, which have a direct impact on the infrastructure sector. The international community has recently undertaken important initiatives to manage the changes underway, like the United Nations’ Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement. 1 Source: PWC UK, Megatrends: 5 global shifts changing the way we live and do business, https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/megatrends.html. 139 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement The Agenda 2030 is an action plan signed by the governments of the 193 member states of the UN that have committed to achieving the 17 goals (the Sustainable Development Goals or SDG) by 2030. These goals attribute great importance to infrastructure, acknowledging the added value of greater access to basic services, protection from climate-related extreme events and the stimulus to economic growth and innovation. They also make an important contribution to achieving the objectives of fighting climate change contained in the Paris Agreement, as they are tied to more than 60% of the worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases2. The following table sets out the drivers that influence investments in infrastructure in various markets according to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate: Type of economy Drivers of demand for infrastructure • Rapid economic growth in emerging economies and developing countries • Government policies designed to meet the goals set in the Paris Agreement and the UN’s SDG, which Global require investments for new infrastructure and the modernisation of existing infrastructure • Need to increase the population’s access to basic services: water, energy, mobility, housing, healthcare Developing economies (low income) • Improve adaption and resilience to climate change and other social and environmental stresses • Improve connections between areas through physical and virtual infrastructures • Rapidly growing urban population • Expansion of a middle class with rising incomes • Need to guarantee access to basic services for the new urban/middle class population Emerging economies (medium income) • Need to eliminate the infrastructure gaps in urban areas and improve regional connections, focusing on resilient and low-carbon infrastructure • Need to modernise or replace obsolete infrastructure which no longer meets the population’s needs • Rethink urban development models, rectifying previous trends that led to congested cities, reliant Advanced economies on private means of transport, consuming high levels of resources and with high atmospheric pollution 2 Source: The Sustainable Infrastructure Imperative, New Climate Economy – The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, 2016. 140 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Salini Impregilo Group, a global leader in infrastructure for the water segment and a key player in the transportation and civil construction segment, helps meet the global challenges with its projects for public and private sector clients. The infrastructure sector and Salini Impregilo’s role The infrastructure market is highly regulated and its numerous operators are involved in planning, assessing, approving, developing, building and operating infrastructure according to their roles and responsibilities assigned by the relevant regulations. The following chart shows the main stages of an infrastructure project’s life cycle: Stage Activity Parties involved • Government planning (infrastructure master plan, local plans, etc.) • Public decision-makers 1. Planning • Private sector investment plans • Private investors • Site selection for projects and preliminary design of the layout • Social and environmental impact assessments and consultations with stakeholders, if provided for • Project proponents 2. Development • Drawing up of plans to manage and mitigate social and • Public authorities environmental impacts • Acquisitions of the necessary permits and authorisations • Contractor selection procedure • Project proponents • Works design 3. Engineering* • Selected contractors (if provided • Engineering of the construction processes for in the tender contract) • Procurement of the production inputs needed to perform the contract activities: Plant and machinery 4. Procurement* • Selected contractors Materials and services Labour Subcontracts • Selected contractors 5. Construction* • Performance of the construction works provided for in the contract • Subcontrators • Project proponents • Works management • Contractor (if provided for in the tender 6. Operations & Maintenance • Maintenance and upgrading contract) • Discontinuation and dismantling • Other parties engaged by the Project proponents * Main stages of the infrastructure’s life cycle in which Salini Impregilo Group is involved. 141 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement An infrastructure project is planned by a public administration or private sector body that, either directly or through other parties (e.g., the public administration usually operates through state-owned entities), is also involved in the subsequent stages of developing the infrastructure project as the Project proponent. This stage involves a number of activities that include identifying the project locations, performing feasibility studies and, based on the type of work and applicable legislation, completing the social and environmental procedures (assessment of potential impacts, consultations with stakeholders, identification of mitigation measures and compensation). The public authorities (usually ministries or state environmental protection agencies, assisted by local bodies of the area where the project is to take place) actively engage in these procedures assessing the adequacy of the social and environmental impact assessments, the consultation programmes and mitigation plans prepared by the Project proponent. Upon completion of these procedures, the relevant authorities issue the appropriate authorisations, which include any social and environmental requirements the Project proponent has to abide by during the project. Contractors such as Salini Impregilo enter the project development process only after the decision-making stage has been completed as this only involves the client and the public authorities. The Group takes part in selection procedures, organised by public and private clients to award the tenders, which may cover specific project activities (e.g., just construction) or the entire contract life cycle (engineering, procurement and construction). Therefore, the contractor does not take part in any activities prior to the assigning of the contract or the prior assessment processes, including the assessment of the project’s social and environmental impacts and consultation of stakeholders. As described earlier, these assessments are the sole responsibility of the Project proponent and of the public authorities, as they are 142 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 required to meet the relevant obligations under the applicable regulations. They also have the decision-making powers about the findings of the assessment process. It follows that the potential social and environmental impacts of the work itself (e.g., loss of biodiversity due to the infrastructure’s presence, expropriation of land) are the sole responsibility of the Project proponent and of public authorities. The contractor is obliged to comply with the social and environmental requirements of the applicable regulations, the contract and any provisions imposed by the competent authorities when they approve the impact assessments. The social and environmental impacts attributable to the contractor arise solely from the contract activities and are mainly of a temporary nature (e.g., disruptions caused by the work site, health and safety in the workplace). Material non-financial topics Given the reference context, the specific nature of the infrastructure sector, the Group’s strategies and the inputs from its stakeholders, Salini Impregilo has drawn up and regularly revises a list of material topics on which it provides non-financial disclosures pursuant to Legislative decree no. 254/2016. The Company adopts the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards in the preparation of this Statement (more information is available in the section “Methodology for reporting nonfinancial information”). The Statement is divided into sections on the following macro topics: • Personnel; • Human rights; • Environment; • Anti-corruption; • Supply chain; • Social aspects. 143 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement COMPANY ORGANISATION Salini Impregilo’s corporate governance model is based on the traditional management model and is in line with international best practices. At the end of 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors had 15 members, including four women (26.6%) and ten who met the independence requirements (66.6%). The Board of Directors has three committees: the Control and Risk Committee, the Compensation and Nominating Committee and the Committee for Related-Party Transactions. The Control and Risk Committee, comprised of five independent directors, examines this Consolidated Non-financial Statement connected to the Company’s activities and engagement with its stakeholders. The Company has an organisational and management model based on a system of principles (Code of Ethics and Policies) and management and control tools (risk management, procedures and controls) designed to supervise significant non-financial topics in line with the regulations applicable in the countries where it operates, standard principles and international guidelines. Salini Impregilo is a signatory of the UN’s Global Compact, the largest global sustainability initiative that requires companies to align their operations and strategies with ten universally-recognised principles on human rights, labour practices, the environment and anti-corruption. Code of Ethics In 2017, the Company updated its Code of Ethics, which sets out its principles and rules of conduct that people who work for or with Salini Impregilo are required to adhere to during their everyday work. The Code applies to the directors, statutory auditors, managers and employees of Salini Impregilo as well as all those parties that directly or indirectly, temporarily or on an ongoing basis, work with the Company, to the extent of their duties and responsibilities. 144 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 They are required to comply with the laws and regulations applicable in the various geographical areas in which the Company operates and to base their conduct on that set out in the Code. The Code of Ethics has three sections: Ethical principles: the reference principles to which Salini Impregilo employees are required to adhere: integrity, honesty, reliability and sustainability. Rules of conduct: the practical implementation of the ethical principles incumbent on all parties required to comply with the Code; the rules of conduct set out in the Code cover all the non-financial aspects dealt with in this Statement. Application and compliance: the internal procedures used to monitor application of the Code and the communication systems available to the parties required to comply with the Code. Company policies Salini Impregilo has issued a number of company policies that flank the Code of Ethics and represent the main points of reference for all people working for the Company. They are summarised below: Sustainability policy: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with during its operations in order to contribute to economic progress, social well-being and the environmental protection of the countries where it operates. Quality, environment, health and safety in the workplace policy: this sets out the principles that the Company is committed to complying with during its operations in order to meet and exceed client expectations and achieve the highest level of protection for the environment and employee health and safety. Anti-corruption policy: this comprises the anti-corruption principles to be adhered to by all employees. The Company strengthened its commitment to human rights and workers with the International Framework Agreement signed 145 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement in 2014 with the Italian and international trade unions of the construction sector. Some group companies active outside Italy have additional policies in place to regulate certain aspects (e.g. diversity and equal opportunities) when this is required by the local regulations or applicable best practices. Management and control system The Company has an internal control and risk management system incorporating rules, procedures and organisational structures to ensure healthy, ethical business practices that are consistent with its objectives through appropriate procedures to identify, measure, manage and monitor the main risks. The system is based on standards which require that: • business activities be based on applicable internal and external rules, can be mapped and documented; • the allocation and exercise of powers as part of a decision-making process be commensurate with the positions of responsibility and/or the size and/or significance of the underlying transactions; • those parties that take or implement decisions, that record transactions and those that are required to perform the controls over such transactions provided for by law and procedures envisaged by the internal controls be different parties; • confidentiality and compliance with the privacy legislation be ensured. Salini Impregilo has also voluntarily adopted an integrated QEHS (Quality, Environment, Health and Safety) Management System in compliance with the international standards ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001, as well an Anti-Corruption Compliance System pursuant to ISO 37001. An independent expert certifies these systems and more information is given about them in the subsequent sections. 146 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Organisation, Management and Control Model Salini Impregilo has introduced an Organisation, Management and Control model (the “231 Model”) to: • prevent the commission of the predicate crimes as per Legislative decree no. 231/01; • define and implement an internal culture based on respect and transparency; • increase awareness among employees and stakeholders. The Model sets out specific controls implemented in internal procedures in order to monitor transactions exposed to the potential risk of crimes that would trigger the administrative liability of companies. It includes measures to identify and reduce potential risks of noncompliance with the provisions of Legislative decree no. 231/01. With respect to the risk of bribery crimes, the Model’s controls are aligned to the Anti-corruption Compliance System. The Integrity Board, which is an independent control body, monitors the effective implementation of and compliance with the Model. The Company has informed its employees of an email and postal address for any communications to be made directly to the Integrity Board, guaranteeing their anonymity and protection from any form of reprisal. Notification of alleged violations of the Model can also be made using the whistleblowing system (see the Anti-corruption section) which forwards them to the Integrity Board. This complies with Law no. 179/2017 and Confindustria’s Explanatory Note dated January 2018. Non-financial reporting system Salini Impregilo has a non-financial reporting system that complies with the requirements of Legislative decree no. 254/2016 and the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards. The Corporate Social Responsibility Department supervises this reporting system. This Statement is approved by the Company’s Board of Directors after it has been examined by the Control and Risk Committee. 147 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement Main organisational changes The Group strengthened its organisational model in 2017 by introducing solutions designed to optimise processes and respond to business requirements in an increasingly efficient and prompt manner. Accordingly, it reorganised the corporate Technical Department, by strengthening the responsibility chains for the technical engineering and management services. This reorganisation aims to achieve an integrated process management model, which will provide a greater technical contribution starting from the selection of the commercial opportunities to be followed up, right through to the preparation of the bids and construction of the works. Alignment of the other corporate departments with the new organisational model has been continued, with the roll out of reorganisation projects of staff structures and business lines, assisted by the hiring of new personnel on the market. The Group also further honed its procedure system and tested and updated it to comply with the new organisation and changes in the reference legislation. 148 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 PERSONNEL Internal policies People, their skills and their dedication are fundamental to any organisation’s competitive edge. This is even truer for Salini Impregilo given the special nature of its business, as it performs complex projects which diverge greatly one from another in different and often challenging cultures and contexts. Salini Impregilo’s policy for its personnel is designed to: • Attract and cultivate talented people, especially university graduates and young professionals through employer branding programmes and contacts with the top schools and universities; • Foster a work environment that enhances individual skills and encourages employees to develop their potential through development and training courses and the transfer of skills among employees, promoting a culture of shared learning experiences; • Retain and motivate qualified professional resources with fair, balanced and incentive-based remuneration systems, in line with best market practices and based on merits and performance sustainability; • Maintain the highest levels of protection for health and safety in the workplace for its employees, ensuring the necessary prevention and protection measures are in place to avoid or minimise occupational risks and instil a safety-based culture at all levels and proactive and ethical conduct. Main risks and management methods The Company’s HR management policy complies with the principles set out in its Code of Ethics and the laws and regulations of the countries where the Group operates. The risks and methods used to manage the key employee-related aspects are described below. 149 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement Workforce At 31 December 2017, the Group’s workforce was as follows: DIRECT WORKFORCE BY CATEGORY Unit 2016 2017 Managers no. 362 351 White collars no. 7,270 7,194 Blue collars no. 26,808 23,592 Total no. 34,440 31,137 DIRECT WORKFORCE BY GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENT Unit 2016 2017 Africa no. 15,072 11,273 Central and South America no. 3,080 2,318 North America no. 4,626 4,659 Europe no. 3,848 3,423 Middle East, Asia and Oceania no. 7,814 9,464 Total no. 34,440 31,137 At year end, technical and production resources made up 77% of the workforce with office employees accounting for the other 23%. The split between open-ended and fixed-term employment contracts is 93% and 7%, respectively. The above figures related to the Group’s employees at 31 December of each year may not properly reflect the actual workforce of the related years. A more accurate indicator for companies that work on a contract basis is the total sum of hours worked by their employees, which exceeded 102 million for Salini Impregilo in 2017, up 4% on 2016. If the indirect resources (employees of subcontractors, temporary work agencies and other service providers involved in the Group’s projects) are included, the total workforce deployed by the Group in 2017 numbered 63,606 units, up 7% on 2016. 150 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 TOTAL WORKFORCE Unit 2016 2017 BY GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENT Africa no. 18,022 14,619 Central and South America no. 10,405 6,565 North America* no. 4,626 4,659 Europe no. 11,896 9,367 Middle East, Asia and Oceania no. 14,670 28,396 Total no. 59,619 63,606 * Figure for indirect resources unavailable. New hires in 2017 equalled 22% while departures accounted for 56%. The latter percentage includes personnel movements due to the transfer of resources and skills among group contracts depending on their construction phase. The highest employee movements were seen in the Middle East and Africa due to the start-up of new projects and the delivery/completion of design stages of existing projects. Recruitment and employer branding At corporate and local unit level, the HR planning, selection and recruitment process is regulated by a defined, standardised procedure which includes definition of workforce plans followed by the subsequent structured recruitment stage (internally or on the market), selection, negotiations of the employment contract and entry of the suitable identified candidates. The local units manage this process at operating level in accordance with local regulations and legislation (e.g., obligation to hire a certain percentage of employees belonging to specific categories or from specific areas). Reference should be made to the “Social aspects” section for information on the employment opportunities created by the Group in the countries where it operates. Salini Impregilo introduced a dedicated recruitment application (SAP Success Factors) to better map the process and ensure its transparency. During the year, the Company set up a Group Recruiting Unit within the Group HR, Organisation and QHSE Department, which coordinates the teams that perform recruitment activities at head office, geographical or contract level. 151 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement Recruitment activities, carried out using the above principles and practices, allow the Company to mitigate the risks to which it is exposed, such as the risk of not being able to fill positions due to the lack of qualified people on the market or a time lap between when the project is assigned and when work on it actually starts. Salini Impregilo also identified tests assessing candidates’ attitude to safety to be used in the recruitment of workers for work sites during the year. This is in line with its greater focus on the health and safety of its employees so as to be able to include these aspects right from the recruitment phase. Employee Branding activities continued during the year to scout and attract talented young people. The Company took part in many university career fairs and provided professional counselling and tutoring about construction sector career opportunities. This involves strategic agreements with universities, engagement initiatives such as career days, recruiting days, themed workshops in university faculties, presentations and visits to construction sites, with a focus on communications via digital and social media, university websites and the main on-line job boards, as these allow direct and ongoing contact with potential candidates. Specifically, the Company participated in the #MELOMERITO programme, designed to assist talented youngsters by reinventing how they interact with the Company and using language readily understood by the Millennial generation. The top competitors were invited to a special Recruiting Day and included in the selection process. For the third consecutive year, Salini Impregilo confirmed its “Best Employer of Choice” ranking at fifth place in the 2018 general classification. This continued inclusion in the category bolsters the Group’s reputation on the labour market and its appeal as an employer of choice, assisted by the ongoing communication of its job vacancies and intense recruitment activities at the main universities. Training The Company defines and carries out an annual corporate training programme based on an analysis of training requirements which 152 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 identifies any gaps and the most appropriate training to resolve these issues. The training courses include final tests and certification when possible and/or provided for. Introduced in 2015 to promote a new training model that would strengthen the existing skills and expertise and transmit these throughout the organisation, the Company’s Learning Academy continued its activities in 2017. The main training programmes provided in the year covered induction courses on internal policies and procedures for new employees, courses on companies’ administrative liability (Legislative decree no. 231/2001) and anti-corruption, health and safety, languages, the digitalisation of systems and processes, technical expertise and economic-financial issues. The Company also strengthened its E-learning Academy, the Group’s international training hub launched in 2016 as a platform to share technical and specialist know-how through e-learning courses. During 2017, the “In aula con i nostri esperti” e-learning programme was revised to include webinars and video testimonials of the main experts of the materials presented during the course. Salini Impregilo rolled out the second edition of the master degree course “International Construction Management” (levels I and II) at the Milan Polytechnic, a leading university partner. The Master course, held entirely in English, combines classroom lessons, mostly provided by Salini Impregilo professionals, with a six-month internship in Italy and abroad under the guidance of company tutors. The 2017/2018 course includes international students (33%) and female students (30%). Salini Impregilo also invests in the professional development of its employees around the world in order to ensure their performance meets with the Group’s technical, qualitative, environmental and health and safety standards and so that it has qualified personnel for its ongoing and future projects. Accordingly, projects include professional training courses for the local workforce, defined using parameters that identify the training requirements and needs for each position. Employees must attend the 153 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement specific training course identified for their roles and requirements (both classroom and on-the-job). These courses avoid the risk that employees’ technical, professional and managerial skills become obsolete as this could affect the productivity, efficiency and safety of their jobs. Training hours provided in 2017 amounted to 771,910, inclusive of both classroom and on-site training and information. AVERAGE PER CAPITA TRAINING HOURS Unit 2016 2017 Managers and white collars hours 27 16 Blue collars hours 33 28 Total hours 32 25 In addition to training given to group personnel, the staff of its subcontractors attended courses on QHSE subjects totalling 914,800 hours in 2017. Remuneration The Company has operating procedures and practices designed to ensure that its remuneration policies comply with the regulations applicable in all the countries where the Group operates and especially the minimum wage requirements, where these exist. At both corporate and operating level, the Company regularly meets with the trade union representations (when appointed) to discuss remuneration. A well-thought out remuneration policy is essential to retain key resources, mitigating the risks Salini Impregilo is exposed to, which are mainly the possible more aggressive remuneration and career policies of competitors. To this end, Salini Impregilo’s remuneration policy has the following objectives: retain and motivate qualified professional resources to pursue the Company’s and Group’s objectives; encourage these resources to stay with the Company and the Group; align, as far as possible, management’s interests with the medium to long-term 154 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 interests of shareholders and stakeholders; ensure financial balance and the sustainability of its policies over time. In 2017, the Company continued its performance management programme for a small group of key resources. This programme’s aim is to strengthen the result-oriented culture and has three categories of objectives (company performance, department/unit performance and organisational conduct) in line with those of senior management. It provides for the definition of objectives and assessment of the results/ performance. Each department is asked to meet specific objectives, which include non-financial objectives such as safety targets. Health and safety in the workplace Focus on health and safety in the workplace is one of Salini Impregilo’s fundamental values. It has a BH OHSAS 18001 certified health and safety in the workplace management system, which defines the main processes, roles and specific responsibilities to achieve its objectives and implement its safety policies. During 2017, the overhaul of the Corporate Quality, Health, Safety and the Environment (QHSE) Unit led to its organisational restructuring to better meet management’s following objectives: • Ensuring coordination of the HSE Management System activities to be of use to HSE teams at work sites; • Encouraging a change in the HSE culture through a competence centre to develop policies; • Setting up a technical safety unit to further integrate health and safety aspects within engineering processes; • Set up a corporate health unit to monitor contracts; • Ensuring continued health and safety operating support to the contract work sites. The main risk the Group is exposed to in this respect is partial noncompliance with the relevant regulations with the resulting potential impact on its workers, in terms of professional illnesses and injuries, 155 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement and on itself in terms of potential sanctions. Changes in regulations and external factors tied to the operating context (e.g., climate, social, cultural factors) are the main sources of risk for the Company. Specifically, workers are exposed to various types of risks that could affect their health and safety based on the geographical location of each operating unit and their specific activities. Each office and work site has the following measures to manage these risks: • Identification and assessment of the exposure to the risk; • Identification of the persons at risk; • Identification of control measures to reduce the risk; • Monitoring work areas to check that control measures are in place and effective; • Making employees aware of these risks through information, training and communications. These measures are regulated by internal guidelines and procedures, which include, inter alia, the documentation each operating unit is required to have, comprising the risk assessment document, operating safety plans, emergency and evacuation plans, fire prevention and control plans and first aid plans. The Employer and downstream (in line with the proxy system) the managers, officers and workers shall ensure that health and safety management measures are in place. Specialist teams ensure their management in each operating unit. Specific attention is given to training employees about specific duties and the operating controls over work processes, performed either directly by Group’s employees or subcontractors’ staff. Employees may also use the whistleblowing system described in the section on “Anti-corruption” to make notifications about health and safety issues or they may use the other available channels at group level (e.g., reporting to their superior) or work site level (e.g., the workers’ representatives, post boxes, grievance mechanisms). The Corporate QHSE Unit regularly performs specific audits of the safety measures in place at the Group’s work sites and assesses 156 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 application of the internal health and safety in the workplace regulations. As described in the section on “Remuneration”, the Company has a system to assess performance in terms of health and safety for its managers which rewards dedication and the results obtained by the relevant units and units over which they have influence. The Company continued the Safety Builders programme in 2017 to encourage a strong corporate safety culture, based on strengthening leadership abilities at all management levels. This programme, developed as part of a more wide-reaching safety communication strategy, Valyou Our Health and Safety Way, was launched in December 2017 by the CEO and the Group’s senior management team. Their objective is to encourage strong commitment from the top which will be transmitted throughout all organisational levels. Salini Impregilo has designed and developed the programme to identify the most appropriate tools to understand and alter behaviour by encouraging prudence and dissuading conduct deemed dangerous to safety. It specifically created the programme to develop the safety leaders within the Company as they are the interface between health and safety leadership and an effective safety culture throughout the organisation. The programme includes interrelated actions that develop gradually in three stages using a top-down approach. The Company’s main workplaces celebrated the World Day for Safety and Health at Work during the year involving more than 200 employees in the Rome and Milan offices in Italy and over 3,700 people at roughly 25 group work sites which carried out programmes designed to meet the specific requirements of the operating units. The “Monthly Best Site HSE Award” continued for the project to build Line 3 of the Riyadh metro (Saudi Arabia) during the year. Every month, the project team (including the subcontractors) that achieves the best HSE results is rewarded. This project has also received external recognition, such as three “Health and Safety Awards” from RMTC (the client’s engineering consultant) and a “Best HSE Performance” award which is assigned monthly by the client to the 157 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement best performing consortium of those involved in building the metro projects in Riyadh. Other projects in the Middle East, like the Red Line North Underground in Doha (Qatar) and the airport projects in Dubai (Al Maktoum) and Abu Dhabi also clocked up significant results in terms of the hours worked without injuries during the year. The injury rates are set out below covering both the Group’s employees and those of its subcontractors.

Salini Impregilo guarantees protection of its workers’ health in the workplace with a special internal healthcare unit, which schedules preventive procedures, health checks and healthcare monitoring programmes. It also performs regular checks of the work sites and makes sure they are provided with the relevant information to ensure that safety conditions are in line with the applicable legislative requirements. When adequate local healthcare units are not available, the Company sets up work site medical clinics which offer 24-hour healthcare assistance and outpatient services to direct and indirect employees as well as their family members residing in the work site accommodation. The Group ensures that the local populations are also provided with healthcare assistance for all acute or serious problems in remote areas not served by public healthcare units (reference should be made to the section “Social aspects” for more information). 159 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement HUMAN RIGHTS Internal policies Salini Impregilo is committed to ensuring respect for the rights enshrined in the International Charter of Human Rights and the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organisation in line with the principles established in its Code of Ethics and Sustainability Policy. The Company protects the integrity of its employees, ensuring work conditions that respect the dignity of individuals, safeguarding workers from physical or psychological violence or mobbing and opposing any discriminatory or damaging behaviour to an individual, their convictions and inclinations. Salini Impregilo does not accept any form of illegal, child labour or forced or compulsory labour. It offers, without discrimination, equal opportunities based on the individual’s professional qualifications and performance capacity. It recognises and values the diversity of its employees as an essential element for its growth. It adopts appropriate measures to avoid favouritism, nepotism or patronage during the recruitment process and throughout the employment relationship. Salini Impregilo guarantees its employees their right to freedom of association and collective bargaining in accordance with the legislation applicable in the country where they work. It adopts a positive approach to labour organisations and an open attitude to trade unions and their activities. The Company also respects the rights and culture of the communities affected by its work and ensures an ongoing open dialogue with them. Main risks and management methods As part of its measures and practices to protect human rights, in 2014, the Company signed a framework agreement with the national trade unions (Feneal-UIL, Filca-CISL and Fillea-CGIL) and the international trade 160 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 union for the construction sector (BWI Building and Wood Workers’ International) to jointly affirm and encourage respect for compliance with the basic principles and rights in employment relationships, encourage social justice and sustainable development by both itself and the consortia of which it is a member and vis-à-vis its contractors, subcontractors and suppliers. The framework agreement covers child labour, forced or compulsory labour, the freedom of association and collective bargaining, nondiscrimination, work hours, economic treatment, work conditions, specialised training, the environment, welfare and employment relationships. The Company agreed to authorise access to its work sites by trade union representatives after local agreement with the project and to adopt the most efficient process should a BWI member request a trade union be recognised. The agreement also provides for monitoring and assessment tools to be used by the Company and the trade unions, which meet at least once a year to discuss them. With respect to child labour, the potential risk of hiring people under the minimum working age established by the applicable local regulations is minimal while there is a higher probability that workers who are above the legal minimum but are less than 18 years old may be hired, especially in countries where false identity documents are widespread. In order to mitigate this risk and irrespective of the local regulations, the Group only agrees employment contracts with people who are 18 years old. In African countries, where the presence of false identity documents is rife, the Group has special procedures in place to check the authenticity of the documents, especially driving licences, assisted by the local authorities. The main risks with respect to forced or compulsory labour are tied to the hiring of migrant workers, mainly in the Arab countries (Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) where the local labour force is insufficient and/or inadequate for the Group’s needs. Specifically, there are two risk factors: • Use of recruitment agencies that oblige the workers to pay recruitment fees (when hired), employment fees (throughout their employment) and cash deposits which are forms of debt (debt bondage); 161 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement • Labour conditions that limit the migrant workers’ freedom of movement which are allowed or facilitated by local regulations, such as the ban on leaving their accommodation outside work hours, limitations on holiday arrangements, resignations and changes of employer. The Group ensures that candidates in these countries are provided with exhaustive information about the contractual terms and work conditions in their own language before they leave their country of origin. In addition, the Group fully bears the costs of recruitment, travel, visa, medical visits, etc.. Migrant workers are guaranteed the possibility to change jobs and to leave their destination country. No workers are deprived of their identity documents unless this has been authorised by them and solely for their safekeeping. The Group requires the recruitment agencies to comply with these principles through specific contractual clauses and non-compliance entails termination of the contracts. It checks that the principles are complied with by providing the migrant workers with a questionnaire when they arrive in their country of destination. With respect to the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the Group ensures its employees have access to “alternative systems” for dialogue in the Arab countries (Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) where the right to the freedom of association is restricted by law. These systems include worker committees, committees set up in the camps and complaint management procedures (grievance mechanisms). The Company ensures open communications with the workers and management’s availability to discuss any issues that may arise with individual employees. The workers may also avail of the whistleblowing system described in the section on “Anti-corruption” to communicate issues related to their work and human rights. The Group enters into employment contracts with its employees that comply with the applicable local regulations, the principles of the framework agreement signed with BWI and those in any agreements signed with the local trade unions with respect to work conditions, work hours, economic treatment and employment relationships. The Group’s intention is to ensure scrupulous compliance with the applicable regulations in each country to mitigate the risk of non-compliance. 162 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 When possible, the Group provides its workers with conditions that are better than the standards envisaged by local regulations. For example, to facilitate the reconciliation of employees’ personal requirements with organisational and production requirements, it signed an agreement with the trade union representatives of the Rome and Milan offices providing for the use of parental leave on an hourly basis starting from 1 December 2017. In addition, Isarco S.C.a.R.L. signed an agreement with its trade unions to amend and integrate a trade union agreement about work hours to allow workers to return home more frequently. As part of the integration process of the Milan and Rome offices, commenced in September 2015 and still ongoing, the Company extended the voluntary redundancy procedure introduced in previous years until 30 November 2018, with the relevant trade unions’ agreement, and offered it to those employees who meet the legal requirements for retirement in the period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018. The Company has not received any reports, either directly or through the trade unions, alleging grounded violations of minimum working conditions. The Group may potentially be exposed to the risk that discrimination against an individual employee or specific categories of employees may take place in the workplace. In this respect, the Company’s HR management procedures do not allow the different treatment of employees based on their gender, origin, religion, age, political beliefs, sexual orientation, disability or other characteristics protected by the regulations ruling in the countries where the Group operates during the entire HR management procedure (recruitment, training, assessments and termination of employment). Specifically, the Company is committed through the framework agreement with BWI to guaranteeing its employees equal remuneration for the same positions and equal conditions for migrant workers and employees on secondment compared to the local workforce. Its employees may use the tools described previously to notify any violations of these principles. The Group’s work sites have employees from more than 100 countries. The following table shows a breakdown of its employees useful to highlight further diversity aspects: 163 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement EMPLOYEES BY AGE Unit 2016 2017 < 30 years % 32% 28% 30-50 years % 54% 57% > 50 years % 14% 15% EMPLOYEES BY GENDER Unit 2016 2017 Men % 91% 91% Women % 9% 9% The women’s employment rate is affected by the construction sector’s characteristics, as it is traditionally a male domain. At group level, women make up 7% of the management team, 20% of white collars and 6% of the blue collars, while at functional level, they represent 4% of the technical and production staff and 28% of the office employees. The presence of female employees is higher at the central Milan and Rome offices, where they make up 35% of the total workforce. The number of women managers increased by 27% from 2015 to 2016 at these central offices and grew again by 7% in the two years from 2016 to 2017. The average remuneration received by women compared to that received by men in 2017 was 72% for the managers and 87% for the office female employees. This percentage is affected by the fact that the male employees have greater seniority to the female employees. The issue of diversity is subject to strict regulations in some areas like the Anglo-Saxon and Northern European countries. Accordingly, the group companies active in these areas have specific management policies. For example, Lane has a management programme that complies with US regulations with a special unit set up at its head office and adoption of two specific policies, one on equal opportunities and one on harassment in the workplace. They require management, supervisors and all workers at the work sites, plants and offices to comply with strict requirements. The Group also has an action plan including information activities 164 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 and training, the involvement of organisations representing women and minorities for vacant positions, as well as the involvement of subcontractors that have to contractually commit to developing their own action plans to encourage equal opportunities. In addition, the Group has a procedure to monitor the workforce at its facilities, to check progress and achievement of diversity targets, and a system allowing everyone (candidates, employees and subcontractors) to notify cases of non-compliance with policies. The system has an inspection plan of visits performed by a central unit to the facilities to check the degree of compliance and achievement of the goals set in the annual plan. Lane received recognition as “Employer of the Year” during the year as part of the PIECE Partnership for Inclusive Employment and Career Excellence project. The main risks to which the Company is exposed arise from the potential violation of the above-mentioned human rights by subcontractors and suppliers. The Company mitigates these risks through special contractual clauses. It asks its suppliers and subcontractors to accept the principles in its Code of Ethics and to commit to working in a loyal and transparent manner with the Group to monitor and check the correct application of the code. With respect to security, the Company carries out specific risk analyses during calls to tender and/or the start-up of contract work in accordance with specific internal guidelines. When local requirements require specific monitoring, the work site is given a security unit that develops tailored action plans and hires the personnel needed to ensure the safety of the Company’s employees and assets, as well as the continuity of operations and information. Specifically, security personnel may be employees or personnel provided by third parties, who are usually unarmed, or by personnel supplied by the army or local police departments. The security personnel at the operating units receive initial training and periodic refresher courses from the local managers based on training programmes that reflect the applicable standards and regulations and 165 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement include information on respect for the individual and the Code of Ethics. The training of personnel supplied by public safety forces complies with local regulations and standards. When personnel of private companies are used, the related contract includes service clauses for specific training about respect for human rights and the Code of Ethics. Depending on the nature of the project, the security unit and local management define the best way of involving the local stakeholders, mostly through formal meetings, informal meetings and discussions, training and official events. No significant issues related to security management were raised by the stakeholders in 2017. The Corporate Security Department coordinates the local security units, defines internal standards and guidelines, prepares reports on significant events and carries out regular audits of the operating units. The Corporate Social Responsibility Department provides specialist assistance with human rights issues at centralised level. As required by the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights, the Company mapped the impacts on human rights that could potentially derive from its activities in 2016. This procedure was continued in 2017 with a risk assessment of the group employees’ human rights, which covered all the geographical areas where the Group operates and the findings of which are described herein. 166 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ENVIRONMENT Internal policies Protection of the environment is a priority for the Group which formalised a specific Environmental Policy in 2002, one of the first European companies to do so. In 2007, it introduced an Environmental Management System which is ISO 14001 certified. During 2017, the certification was upgraded to the 2015 version, which puts greater emphasis on the life cycle perspective, the sustainable supply chain and environmental performance. Salini Impregilo’s environmental policy is designed to ensure: • compliance with applicable legal requirements and any other agreedto requirements; • identification and assessment of environmental aspects tied to the Company’s operations and evaluation of the related significant impacts; • development, implementation and ongoing improvement of the environmental management system; • identification of all the technical and organisational measures designed for the rational use of natural resources (e.g., raw materials, energy and water) and the mitigation of pollution, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, waste generation and inconvenience to the local communities as well as the effective restoration of work sites upon completion of projects; • involvement and participation of all employees or people who work for the Company through actions to make them aware of the issue, the dissemination of information and training courses. During the realization of the awarded projects, the Group ensures compliance with the above-mentioned principles in accordance with the commitments taken on with its customers. More information about Salini Impregilo’s role and responsibilities during the infrastructure project development stage is available in the section entitled “The infrastructure sector and Salini Impregilo’s role”. 167 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement Main risks and management methods The main environmental risks arising from the Company’s activities relate to non-compliance with applicable environmental legislation, compromising one or more environmental components (e.g., the soil, water or air) due to a mistaken assessment of the risk or ineffective management/mitigation activities, inefficient use of natural resources and the failure to obtain/maintain environmental certifications and ratings. The main environmental risks facing the Company (generated by external factors) arise from changes in the applicable environmental legislation, the inconsistent interpretation of applicable legislation by the competent local authorities, incomplete and/or insufficient environmental impact assessments for projects (which should be performed by the client) or adverse environmental or geological conditions (e.g., extreme weather events, actual conditions differing from those anticipated during the tender procedure). To monitor these risks, Salini Impregilo has an environmental management system, which complies with the ISO 14001 standard and has been certified by an independent certification body. To ensure that the significant environmental impacts are properly identified, managed and mitigated, the system incorporates a number of environmental management procedures that have to be implemented by the Group’s production companies, after being revised to comply with the applicable regulations or contracts. When contractually provided for, the Group’s contracts may include additional environmental management standards that require special certifications or ratings. They may be: • system standards, which involve reaching specific environmental performance targets during construction activities (e.g., lower emissions, waste recycling); • product standards, which require the completed works to meet specific environmental performance targets (e.g., use of low impact construction materials, energy-efficient buildings). In 2017, projects affected by these standards accounted for 17% of the total and the more important ones included the Red Line North Underground in Doha, Qatar, which uses the GSAS (Global Sustainability Assessment System) 168 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 system, two stations of Line 3 of the Riyadh metro in Saudi Arabia which use the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standard, the Maydan One Mall, Dubai project which uses the Green Buildings Regulations and Specifications standard, the Northwest metro in Sydney, Australia which uses the IS (Infrastructure Sustainability) system and which received the IS Leading rating for sustainable design resilient to climate change in 2015. In 2017, Salini Impregilo was awarded the Sustainability Award 2017 by the Qatar Green Building Council in the Best Green Building Contractor category for the Red Line North project in Doha. The joint venture involved in building the metro line also received the Certificate of Sustainability Excellence. The Anacostia River Tunnel Project in Washington, D.C. (USA) was given the Sustainability Initiative of the Year award by the International Tunneling and Underground Space Association (ITA), also in 2017. During the start-up of a new contract and based on the planned work, an environmental risk assessment is performed to identify significant environmental aspects, i.e., those aspects that could have a significant impact on the environment. Their identification and assessment of the significance of their impact as well as the subsequent definition of impact management and mitigation measures take place in line with specific procedures. The significance of environmental impacts is assessed using a method based on an analysis of specific critical factors, such as the existence of special regulatory or contractual requirements, assessment of the related risk, management of the impact and the area’s sensitivity to the specific environmental aspect. The assessment considers various scenarios: standard operating conditions, irregular conditions (e.g., plant start-up), emergencies (e.g., fire, spills). Once the significant environmental aspects have been identified, the main effects of the contract work and other activities on the different environmental components are analysed: • Natural resources, energy and GHG emissions; • Soil, subsoil and water environment; • Waste and use of hazardous substances/preparations; • Atmosphere; • Noise and vibrations; • Biodiversity, cultural heritage and environmental restoration. 169 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement After the environmental risk assessment, analysis of the contractual obligations and related environmental regulations, the following is prepared for each contract: • environmental plans/procedures setting out guidelines for the management/protection of each specific environmental component; • environmental monitoring plans defining the specific management and monitoring activities for the environmental components identified; • specific instructions for the different method statements applied. To ensure the correct implementation of the environmental plans, the work sites plan and provide for information/training to be given to all the employees involved in contracts with potential impacts on the environment, including the subcontractors’ employees. It regularly runs campaigns to raise employees’ awareness of specific issues (e.g., energy savings, waste, spills, use of hazardous substances/preparations, etc.). The work site environmental departments carry out the monitoring procedures provided for in the environmental plan with regular checks and audits of the activities performed directly and indirectly by subcontractors. If any instances of non-compliance are identified, special remedial actions are defined as well as plans to improve the processes and/or performance. Contract management regularly reviews environmental performances and the management system’s strengths and weaknesses. It sets objectives for the subsequent period to ensure consistently better performance. To guarantee senior management’s effective involvement, the Company set up a QHSE Committee comprising the HR, Engineering, Operation and QHSE managers. This Committee sets the policies, objectives and strategic communications to disseminate the QHSE culture and the operating guidelines. The QHSE Unit is also in charge of the environmental management system at corporate level and provides technical assistance about environmental matters. During 2017, the Unit’s reorganisation led to the setup of a Corporate Environment Unit which directs the contracts. 170 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Communications about environmental aspects are made on a hierarchical basis within the Company through the QHSE coordinators (who liaise with the Corporate and contract managers), the QHSE community (comprising all the QHSE professionals in the Group), the company intranet, the website and this Statement. Other internal communication channels (e.g., employees, subcontractors) and external channels (e.g., local communities) are set up at individual production unit level in line with the ruling legislation, contractual requirements and any recommendations in the social and environmental impact assessments approved by the authorities. Employees may use the whistleblowing system described in the section on “Anti-corruption” for environmental notifications. In addition, some work sites have additional notification systems (grievance mechanisms), which can also be used by third parties (e.g., local communities). Typical communications received locally relate to inconveniences caused by the work site equipment (traffic, dust) and construction activities (noise, vibrations) or damage to private property. Reference should be made to the section on “Main risk factors and uncertainties Litigation Environmental disputes” of the Directors’ report for ongoing environment-related disputes. The methods to manage the main environmental components are described below. The environmental data are heavily affected by the number and type of works under construction, the client’s design decisions and the stage of completion of the individual projects. Accordingly, a comparison with previous periods may not always be significant. Natural resources, energy and GHG emissions Construction of motorways, bridges, dams and railway lines requires the use of large quantities of water, aggregates, iron, cement and backfill: all raw materials which are mostly not renewable. The environmental assessments made at the start of a new contract consider these aspects and the related mitigation measures are designed to ensure the efficient management of these resources and, when possible, the use of alternative materials without reducing the quality, performance, security and functioning of the asset. 171 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement The main raw materials used are shown in the following table: MATERIALS USED Unit 2016 2017 Aggregates t 18,414,529 23,018,778 Bitumen t 320,777 245,468 Cement t 1,144,950 558,395 Concrete-reinforcing bars t 2,788,974 506,843 Ready-mixed and pre-cast concrete t 3,938,005 5,500,060 Ready-mixed asphalt t 393,524 1,083,235 Total non-renewable materials t 27,000,759 30,912,780 WATER USE Unit 2016 2017 Wells m3 1,793,658 2,399,423 Rivers m3 9,713,951 10,640,606 Lakes m3 184,384 383,197 Sea m 3 5,014 Aqueducts m3 1,610,059 2,864,234 Total m3 13,302,052 16,292,474 Where possible, the Group has adopted policies to recycle waste materials as part of the same project or use systems that allow the re-use of waste water for other specific activities such as, for example, washing vehicles and dust suppression. In 2017, the Group used recycled asphalt (1.3 million tonnes), fly ash (110.5 thousand tonnes) and water recycled and re-used in production processes (3.3 million cubic metres). Energy consumption, both in the form of fossil fuels and electric energy, has a strong impact during construction of infrastructure. Reduction of energy consumption allows a decrease in GHG emissions and mitigation of the effects of climate change. The Group’s main energy rationalisation systems include the use of highly efficient vehicles and equipment, connecting its building site plants to electricity networks rather than diesel generators, carrying out regular maintenance programmes for its vehicles and informing its employees about the importance of energy saving. The following tables show energy consumption and the related GHG emissions: 172 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ENERGY CONSUMPTION Unit 2016 2017 Non-renewable energy sources Diesel GJ 5,413,144 5,959,115 Petrol GJ 376,215 646,560 Kerosene GJ 2,560 42,945 Natural gas GJ 1,889,982 2,033,091 Electricity GJ 454,429 375,059 Total consumption from non-renewable GJ 8,136,330 9,056,769 energy sources Renewable energy sources Electricity from renewable sources GJ 322,438 254,958 Total internal energy consumption GJ 8,458,768 9,311,728 Energy consumption subcontractors GJ 1,708,122 1,964,079 Total GJ 10,166,890 11,275,807 Energy intensity GJ/€m 1,728 1,846 DIRECT AND INDIRECT GHG EMISSIONS Unit 2016 2017 Direct emissions (Scope 1) tCO2e 534,974 566,952 Indirect emissions (Scope 2) tCO2e 40,858 43,388 Other indirect emissions (Scope 3) tCO2e 129,080 137,577 Total tCO2e 704,912 747,917 Intensity of GHG emissions tCO2e/€m 120 122 Lane has a policy to increase the environmental efficiency of its asphalt production plants by using recycled asphalt in the production cycle and increasing the percentage of asphalt produced using the WMA (Warm Mix Asphalt) method, with a lower than normal temperature that generates energy consumption savings and less emissions. In addition to consumption and direct emissions, the Group is also committed to decreasing where possible the indirect emissions of its related activities, such as transportation and travel of its employees. When the goods are not available on the local market, the Group prefers to ship materials and machinery by sea as this is the means of transport with the lowest carbon footprint. 173 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement Over the last few years, the Group has equipped its offices and work sites with video conference systems that have reduced the number of business trips to those essential for operating reasons. Its travel policy favours travelling by train rather than by plane and the use of public transport rather than taxis. When possible, contracts have personnel mobility management programmes designed to optimise transfers between work areas, the canteens and employee accommodation. They include the use of collective transport methods (buses) for blue collars and car-pooling for white collars at the work site offices. Soil, subsoil and water environment The Group’s construction activities may affect the soil and water environment at different levels depending on the works in question and the surrounding environment (e.g., urban or rural environment). Contracts are managed to avoid damaging these environmental components. Specifically, containment tanks, wastewater conveying networks and waterproofing systems for risky logistic areas (e.g., workshops, fuel and chemical depots) are built during the construction site start-up stage to prevent contamination of the soil, subsoil and surrounding water bodies. Industrial waste water is channelled and collected in sedimentation tanks and treatment plants designed to comply with the applicable legal and contractual provisions as well as the waste water’s specific characteristics. Construction work also involves movement of large earth quantities to construct embankments, cuttings, tunnels or certain types of dams. The excavated earth and rocks are classified and stored on the sites for possible re-use within them, where possible and in compliance with the regulations, or transferred to third parties to be re-used externally. In 2017, re-used excavated materials amounted to 21.3 million cubic metres. In order to mitigate the risk of soil erosion due to excavations and aggravated by weather events (rain, wind), the Group takes specific soil protection measures consisting of systems to consolidate excavation fronts 174 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 and to channel rainwater, as well as covering more exposed areas (e.g., escarpments) and planting trees that mitigate erosion. The mitigation measures are defined considering the natural elements, the environment and features of the local area. In 2017, areas where measures to protect against erosion have been implemented covered 10.9 million square metres. Waste Waste generated during construction of large-scale infrastructure can be grouped into two separate categories: urban or similar waste and special waste. Urban or similar waste is generated by logistics sites where the support activities for the industrial production are carried out such as offices, accommodation for non-resident workers and canteens. Special waste is generated by the actual industrial activities, such as construction, plant operation and the workshops. Waste materials are collected and sorted, and stored in specific enclosed areas, from which they are then taken to be reused or to be sold to third parties authorised to recycle/dispose of the waste. Hazardous waste is a marginal part of the waste generated in the Group’s contracts. Normally it involves paint, additives and solvents, used oil and oil filters from vehicle maintenance, batteries, rechargeable batteries and, in some cases, earth, sludge and other materials containing hazardous substances. Salini Impregilo transfers its hazardous waste to authorised third parties. Waste produced by activity, type and destination is shown in the following table: TOTAL WASTE BY ACTIVITY Unit 2016 2017 Construction and demolition waste t 210,486 593,188 Excavation waste t 3,309,229 7,004,018 Waste from support activities t 80,210 172,499 Total non-hazardous and hazardous waste t 3,599,925 7,769,705 175 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement TOTAL WASTE BY TYPE AND DESTINATION Unit 2016 2017 Non-hazardous waste Recovery, re-use and recycling t 935,373 2,565,843 Incineration t 3,478 4,275 Landfill t 2,631,689 5,188,936 Total non-hazardous waste t 3,570,540 7,759,054 Hazardous waste Recovery, re-use and recycling t 10,091 4,057 Incineration t 2,428 679 Landfill t 16,866 5,914 Total hazardous waste t 29,385 10,650 Total non-hazardous and hazardous waste t 3,599,925 7,769,705 Almost all the waste produced is from excavations, which varies depending on the projects’ characteristics which the Group cannot influence as they are decided by the client. The increase in waste in 2017 is mainly due to the inclusion of the Group’s Rogun contract in Takijistan and that of the Fisia Alkatas consortium in Turkey in this Statement’s scope as well as the excavation activities for the Riyadh metro in Saudi Arabia and completion of the NorthWest Rail Link in Australia (IS Joint Venture), with the related dismantlement of the work site. Atmosphere Unlike other industrial sectors, the construction sector does not generate significant atmospheric pollution. The main sources of atmospheric emissions are linked to dust created by the construction activities: excavations, earthwork, movement of heavy vehicles on unpaved roads, crushing excavated rocks and demolition. Other sources of air pollution are the unloading of site equipment and plant. The methods adopted by the Group to mitigate these impacts are described 176 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 below: • Regular dampening of unpaved roads accessing work sites, aggregates wetting systems at the crushing plants, the use of filters on the cement storage silos and asphalt production plants, covering lorries transporting powdery materials and tyre washing systems at site entrance points; • Regular maintenance schedules for site plant and vehicles, ongoing replacement of the fleet with more efficient models. Noise and vibrations The aspects relating to noise and vibration are of double significance for the Group: internally, in terms of the health of workers, and externally, in terms of impacts on the environment and local communities. The Group’s management system includes specific procedures to assess and monitor these aspects, adopting the most appropriate measures to ensure protection of the health and safety of workers (use of personal protection equipment, soundproofing, etc.) and of the surrounding environment. With regard to the effects on the environment surrounding the sites, the areas most affected by noise interference are protected by noise barriers, which can be artificial dunes made of backfill material, support structures and absorption panels made of various materials. The noise barriers can also be one or more rows of trees or shrubs which both absorb the noise and reduce the visual impact. Vibration is also a feature of work on civil engineering sites. The effects of pressure waves that propagate in the soil can cause damage to buildings or other structures located in the vicinity of the works. During the works, periodic monitoring of both noise and vibration is carried out. Biodiversity, cultural heritage and environmental restorations The performance of infrastructure projects requires the implementation of special protection measures when the sites are adjacent to or within sites of special natural, cultural or archaeological interest, so that 177 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement construction activities interfere as little as possible with the existing ecosystem and heritage. The protection measures, which are usually implemented in accordance with local authorities’ provisions, are designed to protect and preserve the ecosystem, biodiversity and cultural heritage of the areas around the sites. With respect to the biodiversity issue, only 6% of the areas managed by the Group was located in protected areas and 8% in areas adjacent to protected areas in 2017. Contracts performed in areas of special natural or cultural interest require specific procedures to manage the protected species (flora and fauna) and any archaeological finds. The Group is assisted by external experts and involves the local authorities. Once construction has been completed, the areas affected by the work, access roads, plants, installations, quarries and deposits are restored to return the areas to their original conditions in line with the contractual terms and current regulations. These restoration activities facilitate natural revegetation, prevent soil erosion and improve soil stability. Any land reclamation activities, if provided for in the contract and necessary due to previous contamination, are agreed with the clients and performed in line with the competent authorities’ instructions. Environmental restoration activities may include reforestation and PROTECTION AND RESTORATION ACTIVITIES Unit 2016 2017 Reforested area m2 491,990 293,281 Trees planted no. 32,802 95,985 Areas where the topsoil was restored m2 579,787 3,304,357 indigenous species are usually used. The main restoration activities performed by the Group are shown below: In 2017, the Group carried out reforestation activities mainly for the Ethiopian Gibe III and, to a lesser extent, Koysha contracts, the Danish Cityringen project, Lane’s projects in the US and the North West Rail 178 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Link project in Australia. Topsoil was replaced in the Gerd (Ethiopia) and Ruta del Sol (Colombia) projects as well as at the other abovementioned projects. ANTI-CORRUPTION Internal policies Salini Impregilo has a zero tolerance policy for all types of corruption and is committed to complying with the anti-corruption laws ruling in all the countries where it operates. It requires all its stakeholders to act with honesty and integrity at all times. The Company never accepts behaviour intended to improperly influence the decisions taken by representatives of public or private bodies. The Company is committed to adopting preventive protocols to minimise the risk of corruption and to ensure compliance with the principles introduced by anti-corruption laws and international best practices. These principles are enshrined in its Code of Ethics and reiterated in its Anti-corruption Policy, adopted voluntarily and in compliance with international best practices. Main risks and management methods Salini Impregilo has an Anti-corruption Compliance System which meets the ISO 37001 requirements and is certified by an independent certification body. In addition to its Anti-corruption policy described earlier, the system has the following additional elements: • Preparation, updating and application of the Anti-corruption Model approved by the Board of Directors on 16 June 2014; • Issue of Guidelines and internal procedures and integration of existing ones to define the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved and the operating methods for the processes and controls defined in the above documents. 179 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement As part of its zero tolerance policy, the Company seeks to align its strategy with the Anti-corruption System, instilling a compliance culture and mitigating the potential risks of non-compliance. The Compliance Unit monitors the Anti-corruption System. It draws up an annual Compliance Plan, which sets out the Company’s goals to ensure achievement of the general objectives and ISO 37110 recertification. The Control and Risk Committee, the Board of Statutory Auditors and the Director in charge of the Internal Control System all check the Compliance Plan as does the Integrity Board for the aspects related to Legislative decree no. 231/2001. The Anti-corruption System is designed to cover the risks to which the Company could be exposed. With respect to active corruption, the main risks identified relate to interaction with representatives of the Public Administration as part of specific activities, such as, for example, those to comply with defined obligations vis-à-vis the Public Administration or the obtaining of authorisations from it (licences and permits, payment authorisations from works management or approval of design extensions/variations). Other risks may arise from participation in calls to tender by public bodies, inspections and/or checks or disputes. With respect to active corruption in the private sector, this risk is less material and mostly relates to the Group’s participation in tenders called by private bodies or management of partnerships. The main risks facing the Company arise from procurement and subcontracting activities. During the assignment stage, potential suppliers/subcontractors could attempt to corrupt a Company’s employee to obtain the contract (passive corruption). In addition, once the contract has been signed, the suppliers/subcontractors could act unlawfully to obtain approval and, hence, payment for activities they did not actually perform or the non-reporting of non-compliance of their services. The Compliance Unit performs an anti-corruption risk assessment by specific process for the Company as part of the risk assessments necessary to regularly update the 231 Model. The assessment is 180 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 performed for the other Group’s companies (subsidiaries, consortia, joint ventures, etc.) using a scope defined on the basis of the CPI (corruption perception index) assigned to the country where the Group’s companies operate and how long their compliance system has been in place. Roughly 86% of the legal entities making up Salini Impregilo Group were included in the Anti-corruption risk assessment scope in 2017. The procedures specifically designed to monitor the above risks include the Guidelines for the Assessment of Relevant Third Parties and the Management of Benefits to third parties, which define valuation procedures applicable to potential counterparties before a contract is signed. Specifically, with respect to gifts given to third parties, the Company has set price limits while it has an authorisation process in place for sponsorships and donations to monitor these initiatives and ensure their compliance with the Code of Ethics. Contracts agreed by the Company with Third Parties must include specific measures to ensure their compliance with Anti-corruption laws, the Company’s Code of Ethics and Anti-corruption Model. Salini Impregilo also has a whistleblowing system that can be accessed through an external web portal. This allows employees to make anonymous or confidential (at their own description) notifications about potential violations while being protected against any form of reprisal, discrimination or unfair treatment. The Anti-corruption Model provides that employees are obliged to report any violations of the Model and/or internal or external regulations, the ethical principles and all anti-corruption laws by the Company, a colleague, a consultant or third party. As of 2018, third parties (e.g., suppliers, subcontractors) can also use the whistleblowing system. Alternatively, notifications can be made by post or email. Violations of the Anti-corruption Model’s principles and measures are a serious breach of their contracts by employees and consultants. Salini Impregilo takes all the steps provided for by the existing laws and contracts in the case of these violations, including conservative disciplinary measures, dismissal, termination of the contractual relationship, claims for compensation, etc. 181 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement In 2017, just one notification was received notifying the Company of an attempted act of passive corruption related to officials of an external consortium. The Group commenced an internal investigation to check the circumstances in which this attempted violation took place, after which it took the necessary steps involving the HR Department. As a result of these measures, it was found that the alleged act of corruption did not take place. The Company requires that all new employees receive the mandatory Anti-corruption training as part of a wider programme about Compliance. During the year, Company’s employees attended a vast range of courses for more than 3,800 hours on Anti-corruption and the 231 Model. The Compliance Unit also prepares internal reports for the Board of Directors (every six months), which it addresses to the Control and Risk Committee, as well as ad hoc communications and reports to management, either together with or through the Internal Audit and Compliance manager, on any critical issues it identifies during its work. Reference should be made to the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report for ongoing disputes about corruption. 182 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 SUPPLY CHAIN Internal policies Each year, Salini Impregilo works with thousands of suppliers both for its contracts and internal requirements. As defined in its Code of Ethics, its conduct is hinged on principles of correctness and transparency, and it is committed to not exploiting any conditions of dependence or weakness of its suppliers. The Company selects its suppliers using proper and transparent standards and selection criteria which involve checking their quality, technical/professional qualifications, compliance with standards about human rights, labour regulations, including equal opportunities, health, safety and the environment as well as prices. Suppliers are required to formally accept the Code of Ethics and the Anti-corruption Model, which are integral parts of the contract. Salini Impregilo encourages its suppliers to apply the same criteria when selecting their subcontractors in order to encourage and promote compliance with its principles along the entire supply chain. The Company is committed to protecting the confidentiality of the corporate information and professional know-how and asks its counterparties to apply the same standards. When Salini Impregilo manages contracts directly or as the project leader, or there are specific agreements in place, the suppliers are required, to the extent of their involvement, to comply with/adopt the Company’s quality, environment, health and safety management systems. Main risks and management methods In 2017, the Group agreed contracts with more than 6000 suppliers from roughly 59 countries. The main supply categories related to subcontracts, materials, machinery and equipment and services. An inadequate functioning of the qualification process and/or 183 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement assessment of the suppliers’ performance or the possible abuse of a strong position vis-à-vis smaller suppliers could possibly expose the Group to various risks as part of its procurement process, such as compliance, reputation and commercial. The main risks arising from external factors include potential risks of non-compliance related to regulation updates that make it necessary to adopt new measures with suppliers, commercial and reputation risks due to possible issues with suppliers (e.g., inadequate performance in technical, qualitative, safety, environmental areas, etc.) after the contract has been signed. The Company has established a number of procedures to manage the procurement of goods and services and monitor these risks. They include definition of the roles, responsibilities and checks to be performed to ensure that the operating activities are performed in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, the Company’s Code of Ethics, the 231 Model and the Anti-corruption Model. The supplier qualification procedure is an important part of the procurement process. Its aim is to assess whether the potential supplier meets the Company’s criteria so that it can be included in the Vendor List. This qualification procedure also ensures that the Group’s requirements are met for all goods categories and in all relevant geographical areas. The Procurement Department manages the supplier qualification process, which involves a number of preliminary checks of the potential supplier’s reputation, its expertise and that it is not already included in the Reference Lists. Potential suppliers are required to fill in a questionnaire on areas such as: business and production category, organisation and shareholder structure, financial reporting, registration and certifications, quality, the environment and safety, social responsibility (including human rights), specific information about their goods categories (when available). Based on these questionnaires, the Procurement Department may proceed with specific analyses and detailed checks, which can include assessment visits to the supplier’s production units and offices. Other 184 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Company departments, such as the Technical and QHSE Departments, may also participate in the visits which are designed to assess the supplier’s technical and operating capabilities with special regard to the products and services of interest to the Group. They also investigate those aspects that could affect the potential partner’s ability to comply with its contractual commitments. Additional risk analyses are performed for certain suppliers that fall into the counterparty risk category using the methods and tools defined by the Risk Management Unit. Upon completion of the checks, suppliers found to be suitable for qualification are included in the suppliers’ register and the reference Vendor List. Certain contracts require adoption of a specific additional qualification system depending on the applicable regulatory and contractual requirements. For example, suppliers working on projects subject to LEED environmental certification are subjected to additional checks to verify their compliance with specific environmental parameters, while other specific requirements, such as social criteria, are checked for projects acquired in some countries. These may include checking potential suppliers whose workforce mainly consists of employees from special categories (e.g., ethnic minorities). In 2017, the Corporate Procurement Department checked 5,200 suppliers to verify their integrity, classification of their know-how and reference lists. At global level, analyses of social and environmental parameters were performed for 1,570 suppliers. Contracts with suppliers include provisions requiring them to comply with the applicable regulations, the Code of Ethics, the 231 Model and the Anti-corruption Model as well as quality, health and safety and environment requirements. The contracts have specific termination clauses if the suppliers do not comply therewith. Once the contract has been signed and is effective, the Company monitors the performance of its key suppliers using a special assessment process, involving the head office’s Procurement Department and the contract managers. It assesses suppliers once a year. In 2017, 185 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement these assessments involved 71% of the Company’s ongoing contracts, covering 83% of the procurement expenditure. The assessment process is flanked by the on-site monitoring of projects by the local QHSE departments, which mainly cover subcontractors and is designed to check that their activities comply with the Company’s quality standards and applicable requirements for the environment, health and safety. Specifically, the local QHSE departments regularly audit the subcontractors. Any non-compliance is managed in accordance with the management system procedures and include the agreement of improvement plans and follow-up checks to ensure that they are implemented. Involvement of the subcontractors in these issues also takes the form of regular coordination meetings and the participation of their employees in the classroom and on-site QHSE training courses (914,800 hours in 2017). In addition to involving and monitoring suppliers at the work sites, the Company also interacted with them at central level during the year. This includes the annual supplier meeting attended by the Group’s Italian and international employees and suppliers when the main procurement practices are presented. The Company presented, inter alia, the process to assess suppliers’ performances during the 2017 meeting to inform them about the increasing attention paid by the Company to developing long-term relationships that allow the suppliers to grow and ensure their constant improvement. The Company continued its innovation days in 2017, which are appointments with individual suppliers attended by head office employees. They are an opportunity for the supplier and the Company to discuss their experiences about new technologies, products, innovative processes and other matters of mutual interest. 186 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 SOCIAL ASPECTS Internal policies It is a well-known fact that the direct relationship between investments in infrastructure and greater domestic demand leverages economic growth. Construction companies engaged in building infrastructure may contribute to this factor by adopting suitable internal policies. Salini Impregilo is committed to contributing to the social and economic development of the areas where it works in line with its Code of Ethics and Sustainability Policy, through: • employment of workers from the area in which the projects are taking place, when available in the numbers required and that have the necessary skills; • professional training of local personnel; • procurement strategies designed to meet requirements using local supplies as far as possible, depending on the availability of the required goods and services; • initiatives to assist the local communities, after checking the integrity and respectability of the recipients and the projects’ consistency with the Code of Ethics. The Company is also committed to respecting the rights and culture of the local communities which it does by also using appropriate communication channels in line with the relevant regulatory and contractual provisions. Main risks and management methods The Group identifies the risks and defines methods to manage the social aspects described in this section (hiring of local labour and procurement, relations with the local stakeholders) during the start-up stage of its projects. 187 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement The project start-up process complies with the Project Management principles (ISO 21500) and entails the proactive involvement of the project team and the head office departments to ensure the integrated management of internal and external factors. Specifically, all the regulatory and contractual elements applicable to the project are analysed during this process and the Company defines the Mobilisation programme which includes the main activities needed to start the project. They include, in particular, definition of the work schedule, which comprises, inter alia: • the requirement plan for machinery, plant, subcontractors, third parties, materials and services; • the mobilisation plan for managers, staff and blue collars. The manner in which interaction takes place with the local stakeholders is defined in the contracts and the Group is obliged to scrupulously abide by their provisions. Employment created by the Group’s projects The creation of jobs by the Group in the countries where it operates is important as it enables local personnel to improve their skills and expertise, especially those in developing and emerging nations, and to generate additional wealth for the economy. This approach also creates the opportunity for the Group to create a pool of qualified workers who can be used for future projects. Some projects have special local personnel recruitment plans as provided for contractually, which may include employment targets. In 2017, 70% of the 31,137 direct employees were hired locally. DIRECT EMPLOYEES HIRED LOCALLY Unit 2016 2017 Africa % 95% 95% Central and South America % 93% 90% North America % 99% 100% Europe % 78% 86% Middle East, Asia and Oceania % 13% 14% Average % 75% 70% 188 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The Middle East, Asia and Oceania area has the smallest percentage of local workers. This is affected by the projects in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, where insufficient resources are available to perform the contracts making it necessary to bring in labour from other countries. Reference should be made to the section on “Human rights” for information about the management of migrant workers. In 2017, local managers made up 69% of the total, reaching 100% in North America and 87% in Europe. In addition to the direct workforce, the involvement of indirect personnel contributes significantly to the employment generated locally. Indirect workers involved in group projects numbered 32,469 in 2017. Local procurement Purchases from suppliers resident in the countries where the Group operates are a main trigger to developing ancillary industries (which is a direct contributor to GDP, public revenue and disposable income). In 2017, the Group maintained a strong relationship with its local supplier chain, with roughly 88% of its expenditure made with local suppliers.

Sponsorships and donations are managed in line with the specific guidelines and internal procedures that are part of the Anti-corruption System, which is ISO 37001 certified. This ensures that any assistance is in line with the approved budgets and is only given after the positive outcome of checks of the potential counterparties. The Group Guidelines require that assistance is given locally in five strategic macro-sectors: social, art and culture, education and research, environment, sport and entertainment. The main initiatives carried out can be classified as follows: • direct assistance to design and build infrastructure benefitting the local community such as, for example, schools, healthcare facilities, roads, etc.; • assistance with social programmes, carried out directly or through other organisations in the above macro-sectors; • free access to certain work site facilities such as, clinics, water and electricity supply networks, for local communities living in rural areas not connected to basic services. The Group carried out 198 initiatives in 2017 for €1.1 million (2016: roughly €1.6 million). INITIATIVES TO ASSIST LOCAL AREAS Unit 2016 2017 Investments in infrastructure no. 18 25 Social programmes no. 154 173 Total no. 172 198 Most of the initiatives were carried out in the US for social and education purposes. Other initiatives included free healthcare provided to local communities by work site clinics in rural areas in Ethiopia, Georgia, Tajikistan and Colombia. In 2017, 9,060 medical check-ups were given and 13,610 health interventions (roughly 13,200 in 2016). 190 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 In Italy, the Group donated a new school to the Valfornace community, one of the towns in central Italy hit by the 2016 earthquake. The roughly 500 square metre facility houses the pre-school, elementary school and secondary school for 120 students and has a canteen, a refectory, a multi-functional room and garden. As part of the GERD project in Ethiopia, the Group built an elementary school for the nearby Bamza community and organised various sports programmes for the local workers and local communities. Salini Impregilo is one of the founding members of the E4Impact Foundation, involved in training new entrepreneurs in developing nations through the MBA in Impact Entrepreneurship and assisting the internationalisation of local and international SMEs in SubSaharian Africa. The Foundation is currently active in Kenya, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Senegal and Ethiopia, where it has provided training to more than 500 new entrepreneurs. Pursuant to the principles of its Code of Ethics, the Company does not make contributions to political and trade organisations of any kind (parties, movements, committees, etc.) nor their representatives. Stakeholder engagement Given that it mainly operates as a contractor on behalf of public and private clients, the Group is required to scrupulously adhere to the contractual provisions about engagement with local stakeholders. These provisions establish the roles and responsibilities each party is obliged to comply with. In line with these provisions, the Group defines procedures to handle engagement with local stakeholders (such as, for example, the grievance mechanisms) and the communication channels to be used at work sites either physical (e.g., public relations offices) or technological (special phone numbers, websites, email addresses, etc). The clients are responsible for engagement with the local communities in most of the ongoing contracts while the Group provides technical and operating assistance to manage any issues that arise. Matters discussed by contract personnel and the local communities mostly relate to: 191 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement • employment and any inconveniences caused by the work site’s presence; • the characteristics of the work under construction and its possible social and environmental implications. As described in detail in the section “The infrastructure sector and Salini Impregilo’s role”, the Group’s clients are responsible for planning and developing projects. When required by the applicable regulations, this includes an assessment of the social and environmental impacts, the prior consultation of the stakeholders, definition of the mitigation and compensation actions and receipt of the authorisations. Therefore, the clients have sole responsibility for handling relations with the stakeholders for the second category of topics mentioned earlier, while the Group provides assistance with management of the relationships covering the first category of topics. This is a potential source of risks for the Group as, if the client does not properly and efficiently manage its responsibilities, the local community could oppose the project leading to delays in the works, an increase in costs and damage to the Group’s reputation as well. In these cases, the Group may receive requests for information or other communications from mainly non-local stakeholders, such as international non-profit organisations and SRI analysts. The Group provides the requested information to guarantee transparency about its work as a contractor engaged to build the works provided for by the relevant contract, with a clear-cut distinction between its role and responsibilities and those of its client. In 2017, the complaint filed by the non-profit organisation Survival International in 2016 to the Italian NCP of the OECD was settled. It related to the alleged non-compliance with the OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises of the construction of the Gibe III hydroelectric project in Ethiopia. The OECD Guidelines are recommendations for multinational enterprises of the OECD countries containing voluntary principles and standards for responsible business conduct consistent with international law and laws applicable in the countries where the multinationals work. 192 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Survival’s complaint alleged the violation of the rights of some communities residing approximately between 300 km and 500 km downstream from the Gibe III dam, whose natural resources would be decreased when the plant operates. The OECD Guidelines specify that human rights obligations of enterprises depend on the type of business and their role. As contractor for the building of the hydroelectric power plant (opened in December 2016) and although it strongly rejects the allegations, Salini Impregilo agreed to participate in the procedure convinced that it had acted in full compliance with the OECD Guidelines. Accordingly, it made itself fully available to the Italian NCP. In June 2017, the NCP issued the final statement closing the complaint (available on its website), stating that the Company had not violated the OECD Guidelines. 193 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement METHODOLOGY FOR REPORTING NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION Salini Impregilo was the first Italian construction company to prepare and publish an Environmental Report in 2002 and similarly it was the first to publish a sustainability report drawn up in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines in 2009. Standards applied This 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement has been prepared in accordance with Legislative decree no. 254/2016. The Company has used the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (core option), published by the GRI in 2016. This statement also constitutes the Communication on Progress (COP) to Global Compact. Materiality analysis The Company performed a materiality analysis as set out in the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards to define the individual topics to be disclosed in the Non-financial Statement pursuant to Legislative decree no. 254/2016. The main steps comprising this analysis are set out below: • internal identification of the possible non-financial topics relevant to the construction sector, by analysing peers, reports published by analysts and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) rating agencies, sector studies and the media; • internal prioritisation of the identified topics, by involving the main departments that participate in the non-financial reporting process; • external prioritisation of the identified topics, by analysing engagement with the Group’s main stakeholders over the reporting period, for example, questions most frequently asked by clients during the pre-qualification and tender stages, questions most frequently asked by analysts and SRI investors in questionnaires and specific applications and questions raised by the trade unions. 194 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 During 2017, the Group performed a survey of the list of the individual topics involving internal (employees) and external (suppliers, sustainability experts, non-profit organisations, analysts, etc.) stakeholders; • approval of the relevant aspects by management involved in nonfinancial reporting. The material aspects identified by the materiality analysis, grouped into the macro categories provided for by Legislative decree no. 254/2016 are listed below: Topics as per Leg. GRI related Materiality Materiality decree no. 254/2016 material aspects within the Group outside the Group Materials, Energy, Water, Biodiversity, Direct activities performed at Activities performed by subcontractors Environment Emissions, Waste and Environmental the offices and work sites and service providers compliance Employment, Industrial relations, Health Direct activities performed at Activities performed by subcontractors Personnel and safety, Training, Diversity and equal the offices and work sites and service providers opportunities* and Non-discrimination Freedom of association and collective bargaining, Child labour, Forced or Direct activities performed at Activities performed by subcontractors Human rights compulsory labour, Security practices and the work sites and service providers Indigenous rights Activities performed by the third Direct activities performed at Anti-corruption Anti-corruption parties defined in the Anti-corruption the offices and work sites Model Supplier environmental assessment, Supplier Direct activities performed at Activities performed by subcontractors Supply chain assessment for impacts on society the offices and work sites and service providers Market presence, Procurement practices, Direct activities performed at Activities performed by clients and Social Local communities and Indirect economic the offices and work sites subcontractors impacts * The equal opportunities topic is only material for the corporate offices as it is of little significance at the work sites given the characteristics of the construction sector, which is a predominantly male domain. Relevant stakeholders The Company regularly maps its stakeholders based on engagement with the main stakeholders in the areas where it operates. The following chart lists the stakeholders relevant to the Company, the areas of interest and the key characteristics of the engagement with the Group. 195 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement Level Area Relationship of engagement of interest length Labour practices INTEREST International Anti-corruption Environment Supply chain Long term Medium term Project life and human rights STAKEHOLDER Local Social Ad-hoc Employees & Trade unions Shareholders & Investors Clients & Potential clients Suppliers, contractors, subcontractors & partners Local communities & NGO Governments & public administrations Sector associations & media The Group adopts diversified and flexible dialogue and involvement practices depending on the stakeholders’ characteristics and needs. At corporate level, key stakeholders include investors, clients, current and potential employees, national and international trade unions, partners, public administrations, the media and the general public. Dialogue with them mainly relates to development objectives and strategies, results, the acquisition of new contracts, the shareholder structure, career paths and professional development. At operating level, the main involvement activities depend on the individual project’s characteristics. The key stakeholders are partners, employees, local communities, suppliers, contractors and subcontractors, clients, local authorities and organisations like local trade unions and non-governmental organisations. Scope of the Statement As established by article 4 of Legislative decree no. 254/2016, this Consolidated Non-financial Statement includes the figures of the parent (Salini Impregilo S.p.A.) and its fully-consolidated subsidiaries. The parent comprises its head offices in Italy (corporate), the directly run work sites, 196 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 branches and joint operations of which it is leader. The Company has an internal procedure in place to define and regularly review the scope of the Statement based on its consolidation scope for financial reporting purposes. Specifically, it performs a materiality analysis on the list of entities making up the parent and fully-comprised subsidiaries considering the level of operations of the individual entities, which are classified as: • operational (e.g., ongoing contracts); • limited operations (e.g., contracts being completed); • non-operational (e.g., entity in liquidation). This Statement’s scope includes entities classified as “operational” and “limited operations”. A list of the entities included in the 2017 Statement’s scope for which a non-financial reporting system was implemented is given below: Name Country Name Country Salini Impregilo S.p.A.* Italy Impregilo-Sk E&C-Galfar Al Misnad JV* Qatar Brennero Galleriacque S.c.r.l.

The other entities have been included in the reporting scope of this Statement for the first time. More information on the in-scope entities is available in the section on the “List of companies included in the consolidation scope” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The information in this Statement refer to the above scope, except for the figures about the direct workforce which relate to the consolidation scope for financial reporting purposes. The data for the joint operations led by the Group are shown at 100%. The environmental data does not include the offices as they are not material. The data in the “Supply chain” section does not include Lane. Any specific limitations to the scope are specified in the text or in the GRI Content Index. The 2016 corresponding information relates to the scope of the Group’s 2016 Sustainability Report, to which reference should be made. The figures about water consumption, energy consumption, the injury rate, waste, training hours, GHG Scope 3 emissions and intensity of GHG emissions for 2016 were restated compared to the figures given in the 2016 Sustainability Report due to adoption of a more accurate calculation method (for water consumption), the restatement of the data (energy consumption, injury rate and intensity of GHG emissions), calculation adjustments (waste and training) and the standardisation with energy consumption (GHG emissions Scope 3). Calculation method The data and information in this Statement are taken from the Group’s information systems and a special non-financial reporting system introduced to meet the requirements of Legislative decree no. 254/2016 and the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards. The data was processed using accurate calculations and, if specified, estimates. The methods used to calculate the main indicators are set out below. 198 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Injury rates The injury rates are calculated using the methods established by standard UNI 7249:2007 “Statistics on occupational injuries”. They show the number of injuries (FR) and the related number of days lost (LDR) for every million hours worked. Specifically, the FR is calculated as the ratio of total number of injuries leading to absence from work in the period (including death) and the total number of hours worked, multiplied by 1,000,000. The LDR is calculated as the ratio of total days lost (calculated using calendar days) to total hours worked, multiplied by 1,000. Any commuting injuries during the period are not considered. Energy consumption and GHG emissions The calculation of direct energy consumption is based on the conversion factors provided by the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy – BEIS (2016 Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting). Internal energy consumption refers to the in-scope entities’ direct activities. Indirect energy consumption, like Scope 3 emissions, refer to activities performed by subcontractors. The Group monitors its emissions data using an operating control approach. Calculations of the Group’s GHG emissions are based on: • the emission factors defined by the standard parameters of the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy – BEIS (2016 Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting) for fuel consumption – the calculation includes CO2, CH4 and N2O gases; • the emission factors provided by the International Energy Agency (CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, 2013 edition, 2011 data) for electric energy consumption; • the emission factors provided by the IPCC (Fourth Assessment Report AR4 100yr) to convert CH4 and N2O into CO2 equivalent. 199 2017 Consolidated Non-financial Statement The energy intensity rates and the GHG emission rates are calculated by comparing the total data (energy consumption and GHG emissions) to revenue for the period. Specifically, the intensity rate for GHG emissions includes the sum of Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. Water use Data about water not taken from aqueducts, not obtained from other sources (e.g., water tanks) and not measured using meters are calculated considering the withdrawal systems’ capacity (pump capacity in the average number of working hours) or production activity performed in the period. Waste The data refers to waste generated by the in-scope contracts in line with the locally-applicable regulations. When the data is expressed as a volume, the related weight is calculated using specific conversion factors.

The format and content of these consolidated financial statements comply with the disclosure requirements of article 154-ter of the Consolidated Finance Act. The accounting policies adopted to draw up these consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017 are consistent with those used to prepare the 2016 annual consolidated financial statements, to which reference should be made, except for the changes summarised in note 2. 2. Changes in standards The following amendments became applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017: • Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes – Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses; • Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of cash flows – Disclosure initiative; • Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities. Adoption of the above amendments did not significantly affect the Group’s consolidated financial statements. This section lists the standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IFRS and endorsed by the European Union but which became applicable after 31 December 2017. 221 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Standard/Interpretation IASB application date Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial instruments with 1 January 2018 IFRS 4 Insurance contracts IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers (and Clarification 1 January 2018 to IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers) IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based payment Classification and 1 January 2018 measurement of share-based payment transactions Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle 1 January 2018 Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of investment property 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2018 The Group has not adopted the above standards in advance. The standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IASB and the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRS-IC) but not yet endorsed by the competent EU bodies at the reporting date are set out below: Standard/Interpretation IASB application date IFRS 17 Insurance contracts 1 January 2021 IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 1 January 2018 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatment 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment features with negative 1 January 2019 compensation Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term interests in associates and joint 1 January 2019 ventures Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 cycle 1 January 2019 (amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23) Adoption of the above standards will not significantly affect the Group’s consolidated financial statements. The Group has commenced a specific adoption project for IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. Information thereon is provided below. 222 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 IFRS 9 Financial instruments The IASB published the final version of IFRS 9 Financial instruments in July 2014. The standard is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is allowed. IFRS 9 introduces new rules for the classification and measurement of financial instruments, especially financial assets, based on the business model under which they are held and their cash flow characteristics. The standard classifies financial assets into three main categories based on the measurement method: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss. The categories envisaged by IAS 39, i.e., heldto-maturity, loans and receivables and available-for-sale have been eliminated. The standard introduces the measurement of impairment losses using the expected credit loss model rather than the incurred loss model provided for under IAS 39. The new model entails development of judgement about the impact of changes in economic factors on the expected credit losses, which are weighted by probability. IFRS 9 also introduces a new hedge accounting model aligned to the entity’s risk management policies. The exemption from application of the fair value measurement to unlisted equity investments has been eliminated. The standard also requires new and more detailed disclosures about hedge accounting, credit risk and expected credit losses. The standard is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and shall be applied retrospectively, with the possibility to use some simplifications. Given the characteristics of its business sector, the introduction of new methods to estimate impairment losses on financial assets should not significantly affect the Group’s current measurement methods. This is based on the fact that the indicators used to quantify credit risk currently used under IAS 39, such as client risk, country risk and the assessment of relevant macroeconomic information already reflects a valuation method based on expected risk. 223 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers The IASB issued the new standard in May 2014 to unify in one standard the rules for revenue recognition previously included in several standards and interpretations (including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes). IFRS 15 provides that revenue is to be recognised using a five-step model as set out below: 1. Identify the contract with a customer; 2. Identify the performance obligations (distinct elements that are part of a single contract but are separated for accounting purposes) in the contract; 3. Determine the transaction price; 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; 5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. IFRS 15 also covers contract costs, contract modifications and financial statements disclosures. The Group has decided to apply IFRS 15 retroactively, recognising the cumulative effects on opening equity at the first application date (1 January 2017 as this is the opening date of the comparative figures). It has opted to use certain simplifications provided for in the new standard to recalculate the opening balances. As part of the ongoing IFRS 15 project, the Group has performed a preliminary estimate of the effects of applying IFRS 15 for the first time on its consolidated financial statements as required by IAS 8. It has estimated the effects on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 considering the valuations made to date and summarised below. The actual effects of adoption of IFRS 15 at 1 January and 31 December 2017 may be different as, inter alia: the procedure to implement IFRS 15 is ongoing; specifically, the 224 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Group is finalising implementation of the necessary changes in the contract revenue and cost estimation process to comply with the standard. Group revenue is directly affected by this process as it measures contract work in progress using the percentage of completion method. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that additional effects on equity may be identified upon completion of this implementation project compared to those set out below; the Group has not yet completed the testing and assessment of its controls over the new contract revenue and cost estimation systems; the new measurement criteria may undergo interpretation changes up until presentation of the first set of consolidated financial statements after the application date of IFRS 15; the Group’s initial estimate of the impact of IFRS 15 on its equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 is based on the current structure and nature of its ongoing contracts and the economic and political situations of the countries where it operates on first-time adoption. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that events may take place after the date of publication of this report that would have different effects on equity compared to those set out below. The ongoing implementation project has led to identification of the following key differences compared to the provisions of IAS 11 and IAS 18 currently applied by the Group, based on the five-step model set out above: 1. Identify the contract with a customer. The contract is usually easily identifiable as being the tender contract. In addition to the guidance for identifying the contract, IFRS 15 establishes rules for the combination of two or more contracts agreed concurrently or nearly concurrently with the same customer (or related parties of the customer). Some related services mostly concerning relationships with partners of SPEs set up to carry out contracts are being assessed in detail and, at present, the Group does not expect them to have a significant effect on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017. The initially estimated effect on equity at 1 January and 225 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 31 December 2017 due to the different method of combining contracts is a decrease of €2,682 thousand and €1,189 thousand, respectively. 2. Identify the performance obligations (distinct elements that are part of a single contract but are separated for accounting purposes) in the contract. The performance obligation is usually the entire project, as provided for in the contract, given that the different services are strongly inter-dependent and integrated and are aimed at transferring the project as a whole. However, some transactions with customers include additional services that are directly or indirectly related to the contract. The main performance obligations considered by the Group as distinct and that led to a change in the revenue recognition criteria are: a) maintenance services provided after the work has been completed; b) additional or different contract warranties compared to those provided for by law or normal sector practices. The initially estimated effect on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 due to the identification of distinct performance obligations is a decrease of €297 thousand and €286 thousand, respectively. 3. Determine the transaction price. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the infrastructure to the customer. To determine this amount, the Group considers various factors including: variable consideration; significant financing components; consideration payable to a customer; and non-cash consideration. 226 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The Group specifically analysed the variable consideration which, together with that provided for by IFRS 15 about contract modifications, includes the issue of additional consideration. Under IAS 11, the Group currently recognises additional consideration if it has been substantially approved by the customer or, if not yet approved, when supported by valuations made by external consultants and/or documentation presented by contractual bodies. IFRS 15 provides that revenue recognition is tied to enforceable rights and that it must be highly probable that the revenue shall not be reversed in the future. The main variable consideration elements that generate impacts on opening equity are: a) claims; b) consideration for optional works and provisional sums. The Group has performed a preliminary estimate of the effect on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 of the different measurement of contract modifications and variable consideration, which is a decrease of €95,405 thousand and €92,518 thousand, respectively, including claims of €91,248 thousand and €91,856 thousand, respectively, that the Group does not deem highly probable will be agreed. 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations. Further to that set out in point 2, this will not give rise to particularly significant issues. 5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In the Group’s case, revenue shall be recognised over time as it satisfies the performance obligations given that: the customer controls the contract work as it is being built; and the construction work creates an asset (infrastructure) for which an alternative use to that for which it is being constructed does not exist and the Group has the right to collect the consideration for the services over the contract term. 227 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 The Group currently recognises revenue in accordance with IAS 11 using the percentage of completion approach and the cost-tocost method. It does not believe this method needs to be changed following introduction of IFRS 15 as it is one of the input-based methods envisaged by the new standard. The Group currently deems that this is the most appropriate method as it best reflects the transfer of control of the work under construction to the customer. However, it has revised the cost-to-cost calculation method to better align the costs considered (input) with the transfer of control of the work under construction to the customer, as required by IFRS 15. The initially estimated effect on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 due to the review of the input data calculation method is a decrease of €10,382 thousand and €11,331 thousand, respectively. Furthermore, IFRS 15 has introduced new guidance for the recognition of contract costs, distinguishing between the cost to obtain the contract and the cost to fulfil the contract. The new standard requires a different accounting treatment of some contract cost categories with the capitalisation of incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the costs incurred to fulfil the contract that generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future (“pre-operating costs”). The Group has performed a preliminary estimate of the effect on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 of the different accounting treatment of contract costs, which is a decrease of €25,878 thousand and €26,058 thousand, respectively. The following table shows the Group’s estimate of the possible effect on opening equity at 1 January 2017 of application of IFRS 15, net of the tax effect: 228 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Equity Equity Total attributable to attributable to the owners of non-controlling (€’000) the parent interests Equity at 31 December 2016 1,205,005 156,326 1,361,331 Estimate of IFRS 15 effect (134,644) (6,135) (140,779) Equity at 1 January 2017 1,070,361 150,191 1,220,552 The following table shows the Group’s preliminary estimate of equity at 31 December 2017, net of the tax effect: Equity Equity Total attributable to attributable to the owners of non-controlling (€’000) the parent interests Equity at 31 December 2017 951,386 133,898 1,085,284 Estimate of IFRS 15 effect (131,382) (2,111) (133,493) Equity at 1 January 2018 820,004 131,787 951,791 IFRS 16 Leases The IASB issued this standard in January 2016. It introduces a single method to account for leases in the financial statements of the lessee, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases, so that the lessee recognises an asset for the right to use an underlying asset and a lease liability. The standard includes exemptions when the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. IFRS 16 replaces the current standards on leases, including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC 15 Operating leases Incentives and SIC 27 Evaluating the substance of transactions in the legal form of a lease. IFRS 16 is applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted if IFRS 15 has also been applied, but the Group does not currently plan to avail of this option. 229 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 3. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations USW Campania At 31 December 2017 and as already noted in previous years, the Group decided that the conditions for application of IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations continued to exist for the USW Campania projects. Therefore, it has recognised the USW Campania project net assets and operations separately in the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss. Due to reasons outside the Group’s control, the period for completion of the sale has extended beyond the year allowed by IFRS 5. Despite this, the Group’s commitment to finalising the sale remains unchanged. Therefore, the directors have not deemed it necessary to change the accounting treatment of the assets in question as provided for in IFRS 5.9. Reference should be made to the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report for more information. 4. Basis of presentation The Group’s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent, Salini Impregilo, and the Italian and foreign operating companies controlled directly or indirectly by Salini Impregilo. The financial statements at 31 December 2017 approved by the internal bodies of the consolidated companies, where applicable, have been used for consolidation purposes. The financial statements are prepared by adopting the parent’s accounting policies. Where necessary, consolidation adjustments are made to make the items affected by different accounting policies consistent. A list of the companies and other Salini Impregilo Group entities included in the consolidation scope is set out in the annexes with the schedules showing changes therein during the year. 230 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Consolidated financial statements The Group opted to present its consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017 in line with previous years as follows: • Current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities are presented separately in the statement of financial position. Current assets and liabilities are those expected to be realised, sold, used or settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle, which usually exceeds 12 months. Non-current assets and liabilities include non-current assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefits, deferred tax liabilities and other balances expected to be realised, sold, used or settled after the Group’s normal operating cycle, i.e., more than twelve months after the reporting date. • The statement of profit or loss gives a classification of costs by nature and shows the profit or loss before “Financing income (costs) and gains (losses) on equity investments” and income taxes. The profit or loss from continuing operations, the profit or loss from discontinued operations and the profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests and that attributable to the owners of the parent are also presented. • The statement of comprehensive income shows all non-owner changes in equity. • The statement of cash flows presents the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities separately. The indirect method is used. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by consolidating the financial statements at 31 December 2017 of Salini Impregilo, the parent, and the Italian and foreign companies which the parent directly or indirectly controls. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern, directly or indirectly, the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Generally speaking, control is 231 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 presumed to exist when the Group holds more than half of the voting rights either directly or indirectly. Entities or companies over which Salini Impregilo has joint control, by virtue of an investment therein or specific contractual arrangements, are consolidated as follows pursuant to IFRS 11: • on a line-by-line basis according to the investment percentage, if they are joint operations; • at equity, if they are joint ventures. Investments in associates are measured using the equity method. The financial statements used for consolidation are modified (made consistent) and reclassified to comply with the Group’s accounting policies in line with the currently applicable IFRS. The financial statements used are expressed in the functional currency, being the local currency or another currency in which most of the economic transactions and assets and liabilities are denominated. Financial statements expressed in currencies other than the Euro are translated into Euros by applying the closing rates to the statement of financial position items and the average annual rates to the statement of profit or loss items, as these approximate the spot rates. Differences arising from the translation of the opening equity using the closing rates and from the translation of assets and liabilities at the spot rate and the statement of profit or loss items at the average annual rate are taken to the translation reserve. The exchange rates used to translate the foreign currency financial statements into Euros are as follows: 232 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Currency Closing rate 2016 average Closing rate 2017 average 31 December 2016 rate 31 December 2017 rate ZAR South Africa Rand 14.457 16.264484 14.8054 15.049 BRL Brazilian Real 3.4305 3.856143 3.9729 3.6054 COP Colombian Peso 3,169.492188 3,376.933171 3,580.19 3,336.1675 PEN Nuevo Sol 3.540195 3.735626 3.8854 3.68329 AED United Arab Emirates Dirham 3.869601 4.063441 4.4044 4.14753 ARS Argentine Peso 16.748806 16.342012 22.931 18.7408 AUD Australian Dollar 1.4596 1.488282 1.5346 1.4732 BGN Bulgarian New Lev 1.9558 1.9558 1.9558 1.9558 DZD Algerian Dinar 116.378965 121.09718 137.8343 125.3194 INR Indian Rupee 71.5935 74.371691 76.6055 73.5324 LYD Libyan Dinar 1.515532 1.530435 1.6313 1.57368 MYR Malaysian Ringgit 4.7287 4.583548 4.8536 4.8527 NGN Nigerian Naira 332.305025 285.446874 367.0458 350.9375 PES Chilean Peso 704.945187 748.476663 737.29 732.607 PLN Polish Zloty 4.4103 4.363207 4.177 4.257 RUB Russian Ruble 64.3 74.144565 69.392 65.9383 SAR Saudi Riyal 3.954456 4.151666 4.4974 4.23664 SGD Singapore Dollar 1.5234 1.527539 1.6024 1.5588 TRY Turkish Lira (new) 3.7072 3.343253 4.5464 4.1206 USD US Dollar 1.0541 1.106903 1.1993 1.1297 NAM Namibian Dollar 14.457 16.264484 14.8054 15.049 CHF Swiss Franc 1.0739 1.090155 1.1702 1.1117 GBP British Pound 0.85618 0.819483 0.88723 0.87667 DOP Dominican Peso 49.185993 50.897019 57.7931 53.6286 PKR Pakistani Rupee 110.46968 115.915499 132.7211 118.9911 QAR Qatari Riyal 3.836924 4.029127 4.3655 4.11204 DICOM Venezuela 709.605822 709.605822 4,014 4,014 233 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 When an investment in a consolidated entity is sold, the accumulated gain or loss recognised in equity is released to profit or loss. The consolidation criteria used to prepare these consolidated financial statements may be summarised as follows: subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis, whereby: • assets and liabilities, costs and revenue shown in the subsidiaries’ financial statements are fully recognised, regardless of the size of the investment therein; • the carrying amount of the investment is eliminated against the Group’s share of its equity; • the main transactions between consolidated entities, including dividends distributed among group companies, are eliminated; • non-controlling interests are shown separately under equity and their share of the profit or loss for the year is similarly shown separately in the statement of profit or loss; Investments in associates and joint ventures are measured using the equity method whereby the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to consider: • standardisation to comply with with the group accounting policies, where necessary; • the parent’s share of the profits or losses of the investee realised after the acquisition date; • modifications arising from changes in equity of the investee that are not taken to profit or loss as per the relevant IFRS; • dividends distributed by the investees; • any greater value paid at acquisition (measured using the same criteria set out in the section on “Business combinations”) and managed pursuant to the relevant standard; • the share of the profit or loss deriving from application of the equity method, which is taken to profit or loss; 234 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Interests in joint ventures that qualify as joint operations are recognised by the investor to the extent of its share of the rights and obligations held. Dividends, reversals of impairment losses and impairment losses on investments in consolidated companies, gains and losses on the intragroup exchange of investments in consolidated entities and the related tax effects are eliminated. Gains and losses arising from transactions between consolidated companies, which are not realised directly or indirectly through transactions with third parties, are eliminated. Unrealised intragroup losses are recognised when the transaction shows an impairment of the transferred asset. Business combinations Business combinations are recognised using the acquisition method set out in IFRS 3 (revised in 2008). Accordingly, the consideration for a business combination is measured at fair value, being the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed or incurred by the Group at the acquisition date and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquired entity. Transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred. The contingent consideration, included as part of the transfer price, is measured at acquisition-date fair value. Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition-date fair value. Goodwill is measured as the difference between the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests (NCI) and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previouslyheld equity interest in the acquiree and the net fair value of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If the difference is negative, the resulting gain is recognised as a bargain purchase in profit or loss. 235 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 NCI can be measured at fair value or at its proportionate share of the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date. The measurement method is decided on a transaction by transaction basis. Business combination achieved in stages (step acquisition) In the case of step acquisitions, the Group’s existing investment in the acquiree is measured at fair value on the date that control is obtained. Any resulting adjustments to previously recognised assets and liabilities are recognised in profit or loss. Therefore, the previously held investment is treated as if it had been sold and reacquired on the date that control is obtained. Transactions involving NCI Changes to the investment percentage of a subsidiary that does not entail loss of control are treated as equity transactions. Therefore, any differences between the acquisition price and the related share of equity in subsequent acquisitions of investments in entities already controlled by the Group are recognised directly in equity. With respect to partial disposals of an investment in a subsidiary while control is retained, any gain or loss is recognised in equity. Basis of preparation The accounting policies adopted to draw up the Group’s consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017 comply with the IFRS and are consistent with those used to prepare the 2016 consolidated financial statements, except for the amendments enacted after 1 January 2017, summarised in the section on the “Changes in standards”. 236 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Property, plant Accounting policies and equipment Salini Impregilo Group has opted to recognise property, plant and equipment at purchase or production cost net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis using rates determined based on the assets’ residual possible use. The annual rates are as follows: Category Depreciation rate Land Buildings 3% Plant and machinery from 10% to 20% Industrial and commercial equipment from 25% to 40% Other assets from 12% to 25% Land and buildings, plant and machinery with a carrying amount to be recovered mainly through their sale (rather than the asset’s continuing use) are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale shall be available for immediate sale and their sale shall be highly probable (i.e., the related commitments already exist). Their price shall be reasonable compared to their fair value. Assets acquired as a result of business combinations are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and remeasured within a year. Such amount reflects their purchase cost. After their initial recognition, they are measured at cost, depreciated over their estimated useful lives and shown net of any impairment losses. When an asset consists of different significant components with different useful lives, the significant components are recognised and subsequently measured separately. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is tested for 237 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances take place indicating that the carrying amount may not be recovered. Reference should be made to the section on “Impairment of non-financial assets” for details on impairment testing. Borrowing costs directly related to the acquisition or construction of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset, to the extent of its recoverable amount. As established by IAS 23 Borrowing costs, the Group has applied this method to all qualifying assets. Borrowing costs are capitalised when the costs of the acquisition of the asset and borrowing costs are incurred, and the activities necessary to bring the asset to a condition for its use have been started. The costs provided for but not yet paid related to qualifying assets are excluded from the amount to be capitalised. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended during extended periods in which active development is interrupted. Moreover, capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are complete. Subsequent expenditure is only capitalised if it increases the future economic benefits of the related asset. All other expenditure is expensed when incurred. Ordinary maintenance costs are fully expensed when incurred. Costs that increase the carrying amount of assets are allocated thereto and depreciated over their residual economic lives. Dismantlement and restoration costs of assets used for contract work in progress are added to the cost of the related asset and depreciated in line with the depreciation pattern of the asset to which they refer when they are foreseeable and objectively determinable. Leasehold improvements are classified in the different items of property, plant and equipment on the basis of their nature. They are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the relevant asset and the residual term of the lease. 238 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Leased property, Assets held under finance leases whereby all the risks and rewards of plant and ownership are substantially transferred to the Group are recognised as equipment group assets and classified as property, plant and equipment. The related liability to the lessor is shown under financial liabilities. The lease payment is split into the interest expense, taken to the statement of profit or loss, and the principal repayment, offset against the financial liability. The carrying amount of the leased asset is determined considering its fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum future lease payments. The depreciation method and subsequent measurement are consistent with those applied to non-leased assets. Leases where the lessor retains all the risks and rewards of ownership are treated as operating leases. The initial negotiation costs incurred for this type of lease increase the value of the related lease and are recognised over the lease term in order to match the revenue generated by the leased asset. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rights to These rights are covered by IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements, infrastructure under issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee concession (IFRIC), which regulates the recognition and measurement of concession arrangements between public sector entities and private sector operators. It was endorsed by the European Commission with EC regulation 254/2009 dated 25 March 2009 and its application is mandatory for financial statements drawn up under IFRS beginning from the year after which it was endorsed. Therefore, the Group has applied IFRIC 12 since 2010. The criteria adopted by the Group to apply the interpretation to its concessions are set out below. Scope Scope: IFRIC 12 is applicable to service concession arrangements when and measurement the grantor is a public body and the operator is a private entity, when the following conditions are met: 239 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 • the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and • the grantor controls – through ownership, beneficial entitlement or otherwise any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement. Measurement of the revenue arising from the concession arrangement: the operator acts as the service provider (construction and management of the work) and recognises the revenue for the construction and upgrade services in accordance with IAS 11 Construction contracts and the revenue from management of the infrastructure in line with IAS 18 Revenue. The grantor pays the operator a consideration for the construction/upgrade services, to be recognised at fair value, which may consist of rights to: • a financial asset (financial asset model); • an intangible asset (intangible asset model); • both (“mixed” model). The first model is applicable when the operator has an unconditional contractual right to receive a specified or determinable amount of cash. The second is applicable when the operator acquires the right to charge for use of a public sector asset that it constructs or upgrades. The amounts are contingent on the extent to which the public uses the service (demand risk). Finally, the third model is applicable when both of the above situations are present. In this case, the intangible asset is determined as the difference between the fair value of the investment made and the present value of the financial asset obtained by discounting the cash flows from the minimum specified amount. The Group’s concession arrangements (via the operators consolidated on a line-by-line or proportionate basis) fall under the intangible asset model except for two immaterial concessions held by the subsidiaries of HCE Costruzioni Generali S.p.A., wholly owned by the parent, which fall under the “mixed model”. The financial asset model is applicable to certain equity-accounted associates. 240 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Recognition of the intangible asset: the intangible asset is recognised during construction of the infrastructure. The main identified cases are as follows: • Arrangements that cover the construction of a new infrastructure: the operator recognises the intangible asset in line with the stage of completion of the construction project. During construction, the operator recognises revenue and costs in line with IAS 11 Construction contracts. • Arrangements that cover management of an existing infrastructure and its extension or upgrading against which the operator acquires specific additional financial benefits: the operator recognises an increase in the intangible asset as the construction services are provided for these construction and/or upgrade services to be recognised under IAS 11 Construction contracts. • Arrangements that cover management of an existing infrastructure and specific obligations to extend or upgrade it against which the operator does not acquire additional specific financial benefits: at initial recognition, the operator recognises a liability equal to the present value of the forecast outlay for the construction services to be provided in the future with, as a balancing item, an additional component of the intangible asset for the contract consideration, which begins to be amortised. Contractual obligations for the infrastructure’s efficiency levels: given that the operator does not meet the requirements for recognition of the infrastructure as “Property, plant and equipment”, the accounting treatment differs depending on the nature of the work carried out and can be spit into two categories: (i) work related to normal maintenance of the infrastructure; (ii) replacement and scheduled maintenance at a future date. The first category relates to normal ordinary maintenance of the infrastructure, the cost of which is recognised in profit or loss when incurred, also under IFRIC 12. Given that the interpretation does not provide for the recognition of the physical asset but of a right, the second category is recognised in line with IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, which requires: (i) recognition of an accrual to a 241 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 provision in profit or loss; and (ii) recognition of a provision for charges in the statement of financial position. Amortisation of the intangible asset: amortisation of the intangible asset recognised for the rights acquired under the concession arrangement is calculated in line with paragraph 97 of IAS 38 Intangible assets: “The amortisation method used shall reflect the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity. If that pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method shall be used”. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are recognised at Goodwill and cost net of impairment losses. intangible assets with Goodwill acquired as part of a business combination is measured as the indefinite lives difference between the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration considered, the amount of any NCI and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously-held equity interest in the acquiree, and the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill deriving from acquisitions is not amortised. It is tested annually for impairment or whenever conditions arise that presume impairment as per IAS 36 Impairment of assets. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill acquired as part of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date to each of the cashgenerating units (or groups of cash-generating units CGU) that will benefit from the acquisition. The carrying amount of goodwill is monitored at cashgenerating unit level for internal management purposes. Impairment is determined by defining the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) to which the goodwill is allocated. When the recoverable amount of the CGU (or group of CGUs) is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. When goodwill is allocated to a CGU (or group of CGUs), the asset of which has been partly disposed of, the goodwill allocated to the disposed of asset is considered to determine any gain or loss deriving 242 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 from the transaction. In this case, the transferred goodwill is measured using the amounts related to the disposed of asset compared to the asset still held by the unit. Other intangible Other intangible assets acquired or generated internally are assets recognised under assets in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible assets when it is probable that the use of the asset will generate future economic benefits and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Those assets with finite useful lives are measured at acquisition or development cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Recoverability of their carrying amount is checked by using the criteria set out in the section on “Impairment of non-financial assets”. Other non-current Other non-current assets mainly consist of loans and receivables assets (recognised and claims related to completed or nearly completed contracts and in Other assets) companies in liquidation when their liquidation plan provides for the realisation of the assets after twelve months from the reporting date. These assets are measured at their estimated realisable value, by recognising allowances to adjust their carrying amount accordingly. Claims are only recognised for the amounts matured and that part which is held to be reasonably recoverable. The estimated realisable value is discounted if the time value of money is material depending on when settlement is expected to take place. Impairment of If there is any indication that an intangible asset or an item of property, non-financial assets plant and equipment is impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If a binding sales agreement does not exist, fair value is estimated using 243 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 the observable prices of an active market, recent transactions or the best information available to reflect the amount the entity could obtain by disposing of the asset. Value in use is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset, net of taxes, and, if reasonably determinable, from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Discounting is applied by using a post-tax discount rate which reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The assessment is made for individual assets or the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets from its continuing use (cash-generating unit). An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. If the reasons for the impairment loss are no longer valid, the impairment loss (except in the case of goodwill) is reversed and the adjustment is taken to profit or loss as a reversal of impairment losses. A reversal of impairment losses is recognised to the extent of the lower of the recoverable amount and original carrying amount less depreciation/amortisation that would have been recognised had the impairment loss not been recognised. Inventories of goods are measured at the lower of average purchase cost Inventories and net realisable value. of goods Cost includes the directly related costs and estimated realisable value is determined using the replacement cost of the asset or similar assets. Any write-downs are eliminated in subsequent years when the reasons therefor are no longer valid. Contract work in progress consists of work performed net of progress Contract work billings issued to customers. When final payment of the consideration is in progress made, the related progress billings and advances are recognised under and revenue from “Operating revenue” in the statement of profit or loss, with the related construction contracts variation in inventories. The provision for contractual risks directly offsets 244 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 inventories and is set up to cover possible charges and losses on contracts performed either directly by the Group or as part of a joint venture. Contract work in progress is measured considering the consideration agreed with the customer and the stage of completion of the work. Revenue related to contract work in progress is recognised using the stage of completion method. The stage of completion is determined using the cost to cost method whereby the percentage of completion (the ratio between costs incurred and total estimated costs) is applied to the total estimated revenue. Given the engineering and operating complexity, size and length of time involved in completing contracts, the additional considerations are measured before an agreement is reached with the customer. The measurement of contract work in progress is based on estimates about contract revenue and costs. These estimates include claims for additional considerations if they have been substantially approved by the customer, or, if not yet approved by the customer, are supported by appraisals made by third party consultants and/or documentation prepared by contractual bodies (arbitration tribunals, dispute review boards, dispute adjudication boards, etc.). In the case of events that take place after the reporting date but before the consolidated financial statements are approved, which provide additional information about expected profits or losses on the contract, this additional information is considered when determining the contract revenue or costs to be incurred to complete the contract and for the recognition of any profits or losses. When total contract costs exceed total contract revenue, the loss to complete the contract is recognised as an expense immediately. The contract costs, included in the cost to cost calculation, may be classified as: • pre-operating costs, which include costs incurred during the start-up stage of the contract, before construction starts, such as the costs of design and specific studies carried out for the contract; organisation and production start-up costs and building site start-up costs. These pre-operating costs are included in the stage of completion calculation and in the cost to cost 245 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 calculation once they have been incurred. During the initial stage of the contract, they are included in the carrying amount of contract work in progress, if recoverable, without recognising any contract output when the contract profit or loss cannot be reliably estimated; • contract operating costs, which include those directly attributable to the contract (e.g., materials, subcontracting, labour, amortisation and depreciation, compulsory purchases, any directly attributable borrowing costs, etc.). They are recognised on an accruals basis and included in the calculation of the stage of completion; • post-operating costs, which include site dismantlement costs generally incurred after the contract has been closed to remove the installations (or entire sites) and to return the machinery or plant to the Group’s premises or transfer them to another site. This category also includes losses on abandoned materials and the cost of transporting unused materials. They are included in the contract estimate and, therefore, if incurred during the contract term, they are comprised in the calculation of the progress billings. Therefore, no specific accruals are made to the statement of profit or loss; • costs for services to be rendered after completion of the contract, which mainly relate to services rendered after the contract has been completed. They may include assistance and supervision provided in the early stages of use of the plant or scheduled maintenance. If the contract does not include specific additional considerations for these services and the contract may be “closed” for accounting purposes (contracts are usually closed once work is completed and the customer has accepted the end result), the costs to be incurred to render these services when the contract is closed in the accounting records should be estimated and provided for in the specific items. These costs are included in the calculation to determine the contract revenue. Closing inventories of real estate projects are those real estate areas Real estate developed with a view to selling them. They are measured at the projects lower of cost and estimated realisable value. Costs incurred consist of the consideration paid for purchasing the areas and related charges, 246 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 construction costs and borrowing costs related to the project up to and not exceeding its completion. Financial assets Measurement and presentation of financial instruments are covered by IAS 39 and and liabilities IAS 32, respectively, while the disclosure is presented in accordance with IFRS 7. The financial instruments used by the Group are classified as follows: financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets. Financial assets This category includes derivatives that do not meet hedge accounting or financial requirements. liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Fair value gains or losses on derivatives in this category are recognised as “Financing income (costs)” in profit or loss when they arise. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market. They are measured at amortised cost, as detailed further on, and any gains or losses arising therefrom are recognised as “Financing income (costs)” in profit or loss. This category includes the following items: • Trade receivables and payables and other assets and liabilities Trade receivables and other assets are recognised at amortised cost, net of impairment losses determined on the basis of their estimated recoverable amount calculated by analysing each position and the total non-collection risk, considering counterparty risk and the risk profile of some countries. If the collection date is postponed and exceeds normal collection times for the sector, these receivables are discounted. All factored receivables that do not meet the requirements for derecognition under IAS 39 continue to be recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements even when they have been legally transferred. They are thus included as assets and a financial liability of the same amount is recognised. 247 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Trade payables and other liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, allocating interest to the statement of profit or loss based on the effective interest rate, being the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through to the carrying amount of the related asset. • Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments with a term of less than three months. This item is shown in the statement of cash flows net of bank borrowings at the reporting date. • Loans and borrowings and bonds Loans and borrowings and bonds are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received less transaction costs. After initial recognition, loans are measured at amortised cost, whereby repayments are determined using the effective interest method with a rate which matches, at initial recognition, the expected cash flows with the initial carrying amount. Loan transaction costs are classified under liabilities decreasing the loan; amortised cost is calculated considering these costs and any discounts or premiums expected at settlement. The effects arising from the recognition at amortised cost are taken to “Financing income (costs)”. • Held-to-maturity investments Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. They are recognised at amortised cost and interest accrued thereon is taken to profit or loss under “Financial income” using the effective interest method. • Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial instruments that are not classified in the other categories. They include the following items: 248 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 • Equity investments Investments in entities other than subsidiaries, associates, joint operations and joint ventures (reference for which should be made to the section on “Consolidation scope”) are classified as “Equity investments” at the time of their acquisition and are included in the available-for-sale financial assets category required by IAS 39. Since they mainly relate to consortia and consortium companies of which the Group holds less than 20%, in accordance with IAS 39, such investments are stated as non-current assets measured at cost, adjusted for impairment, since their fair value cannot be determined. Investments in listed companies belonging to this category are measured at fair value and the related fair value gains or losses are recognised in equity. Material or prolonged decreases in their fair value that are evidence of impairment are, therefore, transferred from equity to profit or loss and offset against the relevant reserve. Dividend income from such financial instruments is recognised in profit or loss under financial income when the group companies holding the investments are given the right to such dividend. Fair value of financial The fair value of financial instruments has been estimated as follows: instruments The fair value of financial instruments traded on an active market is based on the market price at the reporting date. This method has been applied especially to listed financial instruments classified as “Availablefor-sale financial assets” and financial instruments classified as “Heldto-maturity investments”. The fair value of the derivatives classified as “Hedging derivatives” and “Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” is measured using the Discounted Cash Flow Model. With respect to interest rate swaps, future cash flows are estimated using the implicit forward rate of the market Euro curve at 31 December 2017 and 2016, while the forward exchange rate market prices at the relevant reporting date are used for currency forward transactions. 249 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 The fair value of loans and receivables is determined, for disclosure purposes in the notes, on the basis of the present value of their future cash flows discounted at a rate equal to the current interest rates applicable in the relevant markets and the average spread agreed by the Group. The fair value measurement of loans takes account of the Group’s credit risk and uses the rate curves in the different currencies with reference to the reporting date. (a) Financial assets Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset (or, where applicable, part of a financial asset or parts of a and liabilities group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when: • the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; • the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in full and immediately; • the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset and has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset and the related control. When the Group has transferred the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards or has retained control, it continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of guaranteeing the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the initial carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of the consideration that the Group could be required to pay. (b) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are derecognised when the underlying obligation is extinguished, cancelled or settled. When an existing financial liability is exchanged with another by the same lender at substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 250 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 liability are substantially modified, this exchange or modification is treated as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment of financial assets If there is any indication that a financial asset is impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Derivatives and hedging transactions Salini Impregilo Group has derivatives recognised at fair value when the related agreement is signed and for subsequent fair value changes. The treatment of the related fair value gains or losses changes depending on whether the conditions for hedge accounting are met, as described below. Salini Impregilo Group has derivatives to hedge currency and financial risks. At the inception of the transaction, it documents the hedging relationship, its risk management and strategy objectives in entering into the transaction, the hedging instrument and hedged item or transaction and the nature of the hedged risk. Moreover, at the inception of the transaction and thereafter on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether or not the hedge meets the effectiveness requirements to offset its exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Based on the above-mentioned documentation, derivatives used for specific hedging purposes are classified and recognised as follows: (a) Fair value hedge If a derivative is designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability due to a specific risk that may affect profit or loss, the gain or loss deriving from the subsequent measurement of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss. The gain or loss on the hedged item, related to the hedged risk, changes the carrying amount of this item and is recognised in profit or loss. 251 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 (b) Cash flow hedge If a derivative is designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in cash flows of an asset or liability or a highly probable transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective part of the gains or losses on the financial instrument is recognised in equity. The cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from equity to profit or loss in the same period in which the hedged transaction is recognised. The gain or loss related to a hedge or part of a hedge which has become ineffective is taken to profit or loss immediately. If a hedging instrument or a hedging relationship is closed, but the hedged transaction has not yet taken place, the cumulative gains and losses, recognised in equity up to then, are reclassified to profit or loss when the transaction takes place. If it is unlikely the hedged transaction will take place, the unrealised gains and losses recognised in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. “Hedging purposes” are assessed in strategic terms. When they do not meet the requirements of IAS 39 for hedge accounting, the derivatives are classified as “Financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss”. • Defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans Employee benefits The Group has pension plans for its employees that are classified either as defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans depending on their characteristics. Defined benefit plans include the benefits the employees will receive when they retire and which are usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and remuneration. The Group recognises a liability for these defined benefits equal to the present value of its obligation at year end, including any adjustments for unrecognised costs related to past service less the fair value of the plan assets. The Group calculates its liability once a year using the projected unit credit method. Present value is calculated by discounting the future outlays using the interest rate applied to high quality corporate bonds with a currency and term consistent with the currency and estimated term of the postemployment benefit obligations. Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans arising from changes in the underlying assumptions 252 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 or in the plan conditions are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service cost is expensed immediately. The Group pays benefits to public and private pension funds on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis for the defined contribution plans. The contributions are recognised as personnel expense. The Group contributes to multi-employer pension plans via its US subsidiaries. These plans pool the assets contributed by the various entities to provide benefits to the employees of more than one entity determining the contribution and benefit levels without regard to the identity of the entity that employs the employees concerned. The Group recognises these plans as defined contribution plans. • Short-term and long-term benefits Short-term employee benefits, that is, payable within twelve months of the end of the year in which the employees rendered the service, are recognised as a cost and as a liability for the undiscounted amount of benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service. Long-term benefits, such as remuneration to be paid after twelve months of the end of the year in which the employees rendered the service, are recognised as liabilities for an amount equal to the present value of the benefits at the reporting date. • Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefits are recognised at the present value of the Group’s liability determined in line with ruling legislation and national and in-house labour agreements. The valuation, based on demographic, financial and turnover assumptions, is carried out by independent actuaries. The gains and losses resulting from the actuarial calculation are recognised in profit or loss if related to service costs and interest expense or in comprehensive income if relating to assets and liabilities. The 2007 Finance Act and related implementing decrees introduced significant changes to legislation governing Italian post-employment benefits, effective as from 1 January 2007. These include the option given to employees, to be exercised before 30 June 2007, of where 253 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 to allocate their future benefits. Specifically, employees can opt to allocate them to selected pension funds or maintain them with the company, in which case, the latter shall pay the contributions to the treasury fund of INPS (the Italian social security institution). Following these changes, the Italian post-employment benefits accruing after the date of the employees’ decision and, in any case, after 30 June 2007, are considered part of a defined contribution plan and treated like all other social security contributions. • Share-based payments Share-based payments are measured at fair value of the option at the grant date. This amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. This treatment is based on an assessment of the stock options that will effectively vest in favour of the qualifying employees. Fair value is determined using the share price at the grant date. Current taxes are provided for using the enacted tax rates and laws Income taxes ruling in Italy and other countries in which the Group operates, based on the best estimate of the taxable profit for the year. Group companies net tax assets and liabilities when this is legally allowed. The parent set up the national tax consolidation system pursuant to article 117 and subsequent articles of Presidential decree no. 917/86 on 1 January 2004. In 2017, Salini Impregilo and 12 of its Italian subsidiaries joined the system, which is regulated by the specific consolidation mechanisms. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the basis of the temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount. Deferred tax assets are recognised when the Group holds their recovery to be probable. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and, to the extent necessary, is decreased when it is no 254 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to use all or part of the related benefit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities, respectively, and are netted at company level if related to taxes that may be offset. If the balance is positive, it is recognised as “Deferred tax assets”, if not, as “Deferred tax liabilities”. Taxes that could arise from the transfer of undistributed profits by subsidiaries are only calculated when the subsidiary has the positive intention to transfer such profits. In the case of transactions recognised directly in equity, the related deferred tax asset or liability also affects equity. Provisions for risks In accordance with IAS 37, the Group makes accruals to provisions for risks and charges and charges when the following conditions exist: • the Group or a group company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) at the reporting date as a result of a past event where an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; • it is probable that the obligation (through an outflow of resources) will have to be settled; • a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the time value is material and the obligation payment dates can be estimated reliably, the amount recognised as the provision equals the pre-tax future cash flows (i.e., forecast outflows) discounted at a rate that reflects the present market value and risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to discounting is recognised as a financial expense. 255 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 When the expected cash flows are included in an estimate range with the same probability of occurrence, the median value is discounted to measure the liability. Provision for restructuring costs is recognised when the parent or relevant group company has approved a detailed formal plan that has been implemented and communicated to the third parties involved. The translation criteria for foreign currency items adopted by the Translation Group are as follows: criteria for foreign currency items • foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at and translation the closing spot rate with any exchange rate gains or losses taken to of financial the statement of profit or loss; statements of consolidated • non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised at historical companies cost denominated in the foreign currency and translated using the or companies historical exchange rate; measured using the equity method • revenue and costs related to foreign currency transactions are expressed in recognised in profit or loss at the exchange rate ruling on the date currencies other of the transaction; than the Euro • any material effects deriving from changes in exchange rates after the reporting date are disclosed in the notes. With respect to the translation of financial statements of consolidated companies or companies measured using the equity method and expressed in currencies other than the presentation currency (functional currency), reference should be made to the section on the “Basis of consolidation”. The Group has applied IAS 29 Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies for its subsidiaries and associates that prepare their financial statements in a functional currency of a hyperinflationary economy. This standard requires that the financial statements of an entity, whose functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy, be translated at the closing spot rate. The statement of financial position items not yet translated into Euros at 256 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 the reporting date are redetermined using a general price index. All the statement of profit or loss items are translated into Euros at the exchange rate ruling on the date the revenue and costs were initially recognised. Non-current assets Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if held for sale their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather and discontinued than through continuing use. operations Assets held for sale are recognised as such when the following events take place: • signing of a binding sales agreement; • approval and communication of a formal sales plan by directors. In order to be correctly measured, the assets shall be: • available for immediate sale in their present condition; • subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets, and • the sale must be highly probable and expected to take place within twelve months. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or classified as held for sale and that meets any of the following criteria: i) it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; ii) it is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or iii) it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a plan to resell. The profit or loss from discontinued operations is disclosed separately in the statement of profit or loss. As required by paragraph 34 of IFRS 5 Noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the corresponding prior year figures are reclassified accordingly. 257 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 • Operating and other revenue Revenue recognition Revenue is measured to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the related amount can be determined reliably. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has shipped the goods and has transferred all the material risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer. Revenue from construction contracts is recognised as provided for in the related Standard, described below. When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the reporting date based on the ratio of the costs incurred up to the reporting date to the total estimated contract costs, unless this is held to not represent the stage of completion of the contract. Changes in the contract and price revisions are recognised to the extent that they are reasonably certain. Revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recovered. Contract costs are recognised as an expense in the year in which they are incurred. • Interest income Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis, considering the principal and applicable effective interest rate, i.e., the rate that discounts the estimated future inflows over the expected life of the financial asset to return it to its carrying amount. • Dividends Dividends are recognised when the investors’ right to receive payment arises in line with local ruling legislation. 258 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated as the ratio of the profit or loss for the year attributable to the holders of the ordinary shares of the parent to the weighted number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated considering the potential diluting effect of exercise of their rights by the holders of rights that potentially have a diluting effect on shares when calculating the number of outstanding shares. Operating segments The operating segments comply with the reporting system provided to group management which is in charge of allocating the resources and assessing the results obtained by the segments. The Group’s management and organisational structure presents the segments according to a geographic breakdown in macro-areas, on the basis of the Italian, foreign and Lane Group segments. The intrasegment transfer prices related to the exchange of goods and services are agreed at normal market conditions. Significant Preparation of financial statements and the related notes in accordance accounting with the IFRS requires the directors to make judgements and estimates that estimates affect the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and financial statements disclosures. The estimates are used to: • recognise goodwill (see section 5 “Business combinations”); • determine amortisation and depreciation (see the “Property, plant and machinery”, “Leased property, plant and equipment”, “Rights to infrastructure under concession” and “Other intangible assets” paragraphs of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise impairment losses (see the “Impairment of non-financial assets” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise employee benefits (see the “Employee benefits” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise taxes (see the “Income taxes” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); 259 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 • recognise provisions for risks and charges (see the “Provisions for risks and charges” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • determine contract revenue, including claims for additional consideration, total contract costs and the related stage of completion (see the “Contract work in progress and revenue from construction contracts” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section). A significant part of the Group’s activities is typically performed on the basis of contracts which provide that a specific consideration is agreed when the contract is awarded. This implies that the profits on these contracts may undergo change compared to the original estimates depending on the recoverability of greater expenses and/or costs the Group may incur during performance of such contracts. Recognition of additional consideration by associates may entail adjustment of their equity due to standardisation with the Group’s accounting policies. The actual results may differ from those estimated due to uncertainties underlying the assumptions and the conditions on which the estimates are based. Fundamental assumptions about the future and other reasons for uncertainty when making the estimates at the reporting date that may lead to material adjustments to the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities are described in the specific section of the Directors’ report on the main risk factors and uncertainties. The Group estimated the impairment losses on the Venezuelan assets in Impairment line with the guidance given in IAS 39 Financial assets: recognition and Venezuela measurement. Independent experts assisted management to prepare a discounted cash flow model based on the following inputs: a) expected reduction in the assets’ nominal amount; b) expected duration of the restructuring process; c) expected repayment period after completion of the restructuring process; d) expected reimbursement method. 260 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Management estimated the above inputs, including the expected reduction in the assets’ nominal amount, using information obtained from public sources, whose validity is confirmed by their use in many academic papers and international organisations’ studies. Specifically, it used the analyses of Professor Trebesch’s analysis (June 201), “Sovereign Default and Crisis Resolution” for the expected reduction in the assets’ nominal amount. The sample used is based on 180 cases of sovereign default from 1970 to 2010. With respect to the expected duration of the restructuring process, the assumptions are based on empirical data in Professor Trebesch’s analysis, which considers a sample of 90 cases from 1980 to 2007 and divides the timing into stages (start, negotiation and implementation, where the last stage consists of either announcement of an agreement with the creditors or the renegotiation of bonds on the regulated market). Assumptions about the expected repayment period after the crisis has been resolved were based on Moody’s recent study “Sovereign Default and Recovery Rates, 1983-2016” as well as that of M. Tomz and M. L. J. Wright (2012), “Empirical Research on Sovereign Debt and Default”. With respect to the fourth input, the expected reimbursement method, the model assumes that repayment will either take place (i) in equal instalments or (ii) in increasing instalments. Management used the assumptions to prepare a cash flow discount model based on the original effective rate of return of 9.7%. Given the high level of uncertainty implicit in this type of valuation, the Group engaged a second independent expert to assess the reasonableness of the results obtained from the use of the above model and its reasonableness was confirmed. 5. Business combinations The PPA procedure for the acquisitions of Lane Industries Incorporated and Asphalt Roads and Material Company Inc. (Virginia Beach) was completed in 2017. 261 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Reference should be made to the 2016 Annual Report for detailed information about this procedure. Other changes in the consolidation scope No significant changes in the consolidation scope took place during the year. 6. Segment reporting Segment reporting is presented according to macro geographical regions, based on the management review approach adopted by senior management, for the ‘“Italy”, “Abroad” and “Lane Group” geographical segments. Costs relating to activities which are carried out by the parent, Salini Impregilo, called “Corporate” costs, are attributed to the Italy segment and relate to: • planning of human and financial resources; • coordination and assistance with the group companies’ administrative, tax, legal/corporate and institutional and business communications requirements. These costs amounted to €155.4 million in 2017 compared to €158.4 million for the previous year. Management measures the segments’ results by considering their operating profit. It measures their equity structure using their net invested capital. Disclosures on the Group’s performance by business segment are set out in the Directors’ report. The consolidated financial statements figures are summarised below by business segment. 262 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT 2016 (€’000) Italy (*) Abroad Lane Group Total Revenue 455,685 4,007,094 1,297,579 5,760,358 Other income 83,895 33,624 5,932 123,451 Total revenue 539,580 4,040,718 1,303,511 5,883,809 Operating expenses Production costs (385,963) (2,939,307) (897,200) (4,222,470) Personnel expenses (187,147) (352,469) (346,621) (886,237) Other operating expenses (61,996) (150,545) (9,724) (222,265) Total operating expenses (635,106) (3,442,321) (1,253,545) (5,330,972) Gross operating profit (loss) (95,526) 598,397 49,966 552,837 Gross operating profit margin % -17.7% 14.8% 3.8% 9.4% Amortisation, depreciation, provisions and impairment (64,891) (176,609) (35,824) (277,324) losses Operating profit (loss) (160,418) 421,788 14,143 275,513 Return on Sales 4.7% Financing income (costs) and gains (losses) on equity (77,384) investments Profit before tax 198,129 Income tax expense (77,952) Profit from continuing operations 120,177 Loss from discontinued operations (20,662) Profit for the year 99,514 (*) The operating profit includes the costs of the central units and other general costs of €158.4 million. 263 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT 2017 (€’000) Italy (*) Abroad Lane Group Total Revenue 457,252 3,974,012 1,508,711 5,939,976 Other income 42,899 117,029 7,337 167,265 Total revenue 500,152 4,091,041 1,516,048 6,107,241 Operating expenses Production costs (330,477) (2,975,125) (1,050,702) (4,356,305) Personnel expenses (178,597) (405,322) (412,235) (996,154) Other operating expenses (48,323) (104,818) (21,489) (174,630) Total operating expenses (557,398) (3,485,265) (1,484,427) (5,527,089) Gross operating profit (loss) (57,246) 605,776 31,621 580,152 Gross operating profit margin % -11.4% 14.8% 2.1% 9.5% Amortisation, depreciation, provisions and impairment (64,604) (457,972) (32,394) (554,972) losses Operating profit (loss) (121,850) 147,804 (773) 25,180 Return on Sales 0.4% Financing income (costs) and gains (losses) on equity (92,793) investments Loss before tax (67,613) Income tax expense (14,534) Loss from continuing operations (82,147) Loss from discontinued operations (1,908) Loss for the year (84,055) (*) The operating profit includes the costs of the central units and other general costs of €155.4 million.

Disposals relate to the sale of the investment in Parking Glasgow finalised on 14 July 2017. No indications of impairment were identified during the year and, therefore, the Group did not perform the impairment test. Contract acquisition costs include considerations paid to purchase stakes in projects/contracts representing intangible assets with a finite useful life, which are amortised in line with the stage of completion of the related contracts.

The Group has adopted the discount rate calculated based on the market cost of money and the asset sector’s specific risk (Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC). Specifically, the Group considered the return rate on long-term government bonds and the average capital structure of a basket of comparable companies. The CGU’s recoverable amount has been calculated using the cash flow projections set out in the 2018-2021 four-year plan prepared and approved by management. The terminal value is based on a sustainable profit assumption, from which stable long-term operating cash flows have been estimated, on a going concern basis. The Group also performed sensitivity analyses of the recoverable amount (a +/-0.5% increase/decrease in the growth and discount rates), considering the possible effect of changes in the reference parameters of the discount rate and terminal value. The Group tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting date, which showed that the CGU’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount (net invested capital). 273 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 10.

The Group’s share of profit of equity-accounted investees totals €94.8 million and mainly relates to the Argentine operator Autopistas del Sol (€90.1 million). The balance principally comprises the gain on equity invesments for the compensation of approximately €83 million provided for in the renegotiation contract agreed by the operator with the Argentine government. Reference should be made to the section on “Autopistas del 274 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Sol” for further details. The overall effect on profit or loss is analysed in note 37 and includes the changes in the provision for risks on equity investments set out in note 27. Dividends from equity-accounted investees mainly refer to the nonconsolidated joint ventures of Lane Group. The item “Change in consolidation scope” relates to the Group’s investment in the Turkish operator Gaziantemp Hastane Saglik. The carrying amount of the investment in Ochre Solutions Holdings Ltd was tested for impairment using the English operator’s 2018-2039 business plan. Its cash flows were discounted using a rate of 5.3% (2016: 5.3%) to calculate the investment’s recoverable amount. The Group also performed sensitivity analyses considering the potential effect of a change in the reference parameters. The resulting recoverable amount was higher than the investment’s carrying amount and, therefore, it was not necessary to recognise an impairment loss. The Group also performed a specific impairment test for Consorcio Agua Azul S.A. based on the Peruvian operator’s 2018-2028 business plan. Its cash flows were discounted using a rate of 6.9% (2016: 8.4%) in order to determine its recoverable amount. The Group again also performed sensitivity analyses considering the potential effect of a change in the reference parameters. The resulting recoverable amount was higher than the investment’s carrying amount, showing that it was not impaired. 275 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Investments in equity-accounted investees and other companies Investments in equity-accounted investees and other companies increased to €317.3 million by €115.9 million compared to 31 December 2016.

Group entities were only classified as subsidiaries when the Group has substantial rights over the investee’s relevant activities, in exchange for the Group’s exposure to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the Group can use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the variable returns. These requirements are met when the Group holds sufficient voting rights to obtain the majority required in decisions for the governance bodies of the group entities in question. (ii) Reference was made to paragraphs 4 and 5 of IFRS 11 to assess the existence of joint control. Joint control exists if the majorities required for decision-taking by the governance bodies of the group entities in question require the unanimous vote or qualified majorities that can only be reached with the consent of a specific group of investors. (iii) With reference to the type of joint arrangements, in view of the fact that all joint arrangements in which the Group participates are structured through separate vehicles, reference was made to paragraph B15 of IFRS 11, analysing in particular the legal form of the separate vehicle and the terms of the contractual agreement. With reference to the situation at 31 December 2017 and 2016, only those entities not incorporated into legal entities and structured as separate vehicles that guarantee transparency of the rights and obligations of the parties are classified as joint operations. Salini Impregilo Group’s activities involve its participation in numerous SPEs that, especially in Italy, use the consortium structure, which works using a cost recharging system. Under IFRS 10 and IFRS 11, these entities have been classified as subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, according to the guidelines set out above. Although the investments in the associated consortium entities and entities subject to joint control are measured using the equity method, 277 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 their revenues are nonetheless presented in the consolidated financial statements as the parent recognises the contract work in progress while the costs incurred by the entities are recharged to the parent and shown in a single cost item (classified among service costs). Therefore, in view of the fact that the relevant effects concerning consortium entities are already shown in the tables below, the details are not provided here. The group associates at 31 December 2017 that management considers Financial significant for the Group are presented below. Their share capital consists highlights solely of ordinary shares, which the Group holds directly.

A description of the nature of Salini Impregilo Group’s relationship with the above companies is provided below: (1) the company is held directly by the parent and has a concession contract for the “Metro de Lima 2” project (Peru) for the concession, construction and operation of the infrastructure during the 35-year concession expiring in 2049. The governance system requires majority resolutions and Salini Impregilo’s investment percentage means it can be classified as an associate. (2) the company is held by the sub holding company Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. and has a 30-year concession contract for the operation of the Buenos Aires Norte access infrastructure expiring in 2020. 278 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The financial information relating to individually significant associates accounted for using the equity method is shown below.

Autopistas del Sol S.A. (“Ausol”) is an Argentine company in which Salini Impregilo S.p.A. has voting rights of 24% and the right to appoint a director. It holds this investment through its Dutch subsidiary Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V., which holds a stake of 19.818%. Given these rights, Ausol is classified as an associate for consolidation purposes. It was incorporated to construct and operate a motorway section in Argentina, based on a government concession agreement signed in 1994. The concession’s original term was until 31 December 2020. In 2002, following the economic crisis that hit Argentina, its government promulgated Law no. 25,561 (the “law”) which nullified the provisions of the agreement with Ausol that established the value of the motorway fees in US dollars with a regular update based on the US consumer price index. Specifically, the US fees were converted into Argentine pesos at a 1:1 exchange rate. This law provision caused a significant imbalance in the financial plan provided for by the agreement originally prepared on the basis of USD fees. Under the same law, the Argentine government commenced a public contract renegotiation process, which included the Ausol concession. Therefore, in 2004, the company signed a letter of intent with the Argentine government, followed by the renegotiation agreement signed on 16 December 2005, whereby the concession terms were to be amended in order to restore the original financial balance provided for in the 1994 agreement. However, the Argentine government has never met its obligations to amend the concession taken on with the 2005 agreement. Therefore, in 2015, Ausol filed a formal claim requesting that the Argentine government meet its obligation to restore the financial balance provided for in the 1994 original concession. Further to the formal claim filed in 2015, in February 2016, the Argentine government issued a decree containing the instructions for the relevant ministries for reaching an agreement with Ausol. Ausol and the Argentinian government subsequently agreed on the motorway concession renegotiation agreement wording, which, inter alia, provides for: 282 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 • Ausol’s consent to limit its claims for the recovery of its investments to USD499,000,000 plus interest accrued from the effective date of the new concession up to the actual payment; • an investment plan to improve and expand the current motorway infrastructure; • the concession’s extension up to 2030, with an early termination option exercisable should the Argentine government repay USD499,000,000 plus interest accrued up to the payment date; • the concession’s fee mechanism whereby the inflows from the motorway operation shall be used to: i) cover the operating expenses for the motorway section operation, ii) pay the USD499,000,000 compensation in half yearly instalments and iii) use any remaining amount to make new investments. Supported by the opinions of legal and accounting experts, Salini Impregilo Group believes, inter alia, that: the renegotiation agreement puts an end to the revision of the concession’s financial terms, on the basis of the obligations to restore the original financial balance taken on by the Argentine government in 2005; the USD499,000,000 compensation granted by the Argentine government covers the damage incurred by Ausol following the enactment of Law no. 25,561 of 2002. It is in no way affected by the quality of the motorway operation service that Ausol will provide up to the end of the concession term (extended); the USD499,000,000 payment has a compensation nature and it is not to be considered as the consideration for the motorway’s operation up to the end of the new concession term and, as such, it is compensation for damage; based on information available at the reporting date, the Argentine government is clearly willing to proceed with the definitive approval of the new concession; 283 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 the substance of the renegotiation agreement process had been completed at the reporting date and the acts still to be completed for the definitive approval of the new concession are mostly formal. Accordingly, the execution of the agreement with the Argentine government is almost certain; in December 2017, the Argentine government obtained a favourable opinion on the execution of the renegotiation agreement with Ausol from the Federal Executive Branch; in February 2018, the Argentine government stated that the agreement reached with Ausol was a goal attained by the current government; the agreement is expected to be signed by the Argentine state in 2018. Therefore, the agreement reached with the Argentine government and executed through the renegotiation agreement provides for the payment of USD499,000,000 to Ausol to compensate for the damage incurred by the latter due to the enforcement of the law. The payment has a compensation nature and, hence, it is not the consideration for the motorway’s operation up to the end of the new concession term. It is, therefore, compensation of damage. Based on the above, attesting to the positive outcome of the negotiation, and considering that the compensation refers to damage incurred and not to future concession services, the Group believes that the portion pertaining to the year (€83 million) of the compensation can be recognised in profit or loss. Significant restrictions At the date of preparation of this Report, there were no restrictions on the associates’ ability to transfer dividends, repay loans or make advances to the parent. Contingent liabilities At the date of preparation of this Report, there were no significant contingent liabilities related to the Group’s investments in associates. 284 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Any related risk areas are described in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report.

Risks associated with the Group’s investments in associates and joint ventures Commitments The Group has the following commitments vis-à-vis its associates and joint ventures: (€’000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Commitments 1,727,707 1,913,886 186,179 The increase is mainly due to guarantees issued on behalf of the nonconsolidated joint ventures of Lane Group (€219.4 million) and of the Iricav 2 consortium, which is constructing the high speed/capacity Verona Padua railway section, and Isarco, which is constructing the Brenner tunnel (total of €21.3 million), partially offset by the decrease in the guarantees issued on behalf Grupo Unido por el Canal (€105.9 million). Joint operations The Group is involved in the following main joint operations: Civil Work Group (Saudi Arabia), South Al Mutlaa (Kuwait), and Arge Tulfes Pfons (Austria). 293 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 The Group is involved in the following main joint operations: Civil Work Group (Saudi Arabia), South Al Mutlaa (Kuwait), and Arge Tulfes Pfons (Austria). Salini Impregilo has a direct 52% interest in Civil Work Group (Saudi Arabia) and an indirect 14% interest through Salini Saudi Arabia (the Group’s investment in the latter is 51%). Civil Work Group is engaged in the civil works for the Riyadh metro. South Al Mutlaa (Kuwait) is 55% held directly by Salini Impregilo. It is constructing primary urbanisation works to build a new residential area in a 12 thousand hectares site in Kuwait as part of the South Al Mutlaa Housing Project. Arge Tulfes Pfons (Austria) is 49% held directly by Salini Impregilo and is engaged in the construction of the last section of the Brenner-Innsbruck tunnel.

The increase was partly offset by the use of advances made in previous years for the contract for the construction of the Riyadh metro line in Saudi Arabia, the new hydroelectric project in Tajikistan, the Lima metro line in Peru, as well as for works in Turkey (healthcare facility) and Colombia (motorways). Other unconsolidated group companies and other related parties increased by €3.7 million to €39.3 million, as a result of an increase in the amount due from the US investees engaged in the projects in California.

(**) This item shows the Group's net amounts due from/to unconsolidated consortia and/or consortium companies (SPEs) operating under a cost recharging system. The balance reflects the Group's share of cash and cash equivalents or debt of the SPEs. The items making up these balances are presented under trade receivables and trade payables, respectively, in the consolidated financial statements. At 31 December 2017, the Group has net financial indebtedness from continuing operations of €702.6 million (indebtedness of €350.8 million at 31 December 2016). The increase is mainly due to the reduction in cash and cash equivalents due to the exchange difference effect on foreign currency items. Gross indebtedness decreased by €28.0 million over 31 December 2016 to €2,304.3 million at the reporting date. The debt/equity ratio (based on the net financial indebtedness from continuing operations) is 0.65 at group level at the reporting date. 333 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 23.

(now part of Salini Impegilo S.p.A.) issued senior unsecured bonds for a nominal amount of €400 million to be redeemed on 1 August 2018, intended for international institutional investors. The bonds, which have a minimum denomination of €100,000 and an annual gross coupon of 6.125%, were placed with primary international institutional investors at a price of €99.477. On 24 June 2016, the parent announced the placement of bonds with a nominal amount of €428.3 million reserved for institutional investors. They have a fixed rate coupon of 3.75%. The bonds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange in Dublin with a redemption date of 24 June 2021. 334 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Part of the bonds, with a nominal amount of €128.3 million, was assigned to the holders of the senior unsecured bonds that adhered to the parent’s offer. The exchange rate applied to the existing bonds was 109.75%. After the exchange, the outstanding senior unsecured bonds amounted to €283 million. The parent used the proceeds of €300 million from the new issue, not used for the bond exchange, to repay part of the bridge financing taken out to acquire Lane Group. The Group assessed the continuity of the previous bonds (exchanged) with the bonds placed on 24 June 2016. On 11 July 2016, the parent placed more bonds with institutional investors for a total nominal amount of roughly €172 million. The new bonds are part of a single series with the previous €428 million issued on 24 June 2016 and redeemable on 24 June 2021, bringing the total bond issue to €600 million. The transaction has strengthened the Group’s debt profile, extended its average debt repayment dates by more than one year and increased its fixed rate debt component. In the second half of 2017, the parent announced it will issue bonds for €500 million with a fixed rate coupon of 1.75% reserved for qualified investors, excluding their placement in the US and other selected countries. It listed the bonds on the Irish Stock Exchange for redemption on 26 October 2024. Their issue was part of the Group's long-term corporate debt refinancing transaction of more than €1 billion. More information is available in note 22 on bank loans. The bonds are backed by covenants that require the parent to maintain certain financial and equity ratios, which at the date of this Annual Report are fully respected. The fair value of the bonds at the reporting date, measured as set out in the “Accounting policies” section, is €1,399.2 million. 335 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 24.

Post-employment benefits and employee benefits At 31 December 2017, the Group’s liability due to its employees determined using the criteria set out in IAS 19 is €85.7 million. The liability for post-employment benefits is the outstanding amount at the reform effective date, net of benefits paid up to the reporting date. The liability is considered part of a defined benefit plan under IAS 19 and has, therefore, been subjected to actuarial valuation. The valuation, performed with the assistance of an independent expert, was based on the following rates: • turnover rate: 7.25%; • advance payment rate: 3%; • inflation rate: 1.5%. The Group has used the Iboxx AA Corporate index for the Eurozone, which has an average financial duration in line with the fund being valued, to calculate the discount rate. 338 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The balance mainly consists of the liability for Lane Group’s defined benefit plan for its full-time employees. This liability is calculated on the basis of the employees’ years of service and remuneration and is subjected to an actuarial valuation. Lane Group also provides healthcare cover to retired employees, hired before 31 December 1992 with at least 20 years of service. The item also includes the Italian post-employment benefits related to Salini Impregilo and its Italian subsidiaries. The liability is the outstanding amount at the reform effective date, net of benefits paid up to the reporting dates. The liability is considered part of a defined benefit plan under IAS 19 and has, therefore, been subjected to actuarial valuation. Changes in the item are as follows: 31 December Accruals Payments Net Change in Contributions 31 2015 actuarial consolidation paid to INPS December (€’000) gains scope and other treasury and 2016 changes other funds Post-employment benefits 25,412 13,813 (30,663) (4,364) 90,945 (3,213) 91,930 and employee benefits 31 December Accruals Payments Net Change in Contributions 31 2016 actuarial consolidation paid to INPS December (€’000) losses scope and other treasury and 2017 changes other funds Post-employment benefits 91,930 18,742 (17,261) 4,323 (9,636) (2,374) 85,723 and employee benefits “Net actuarial losses” include the actuarial gains and losses recognised in the actuarial reserve as per the revised IAS 19 while the “Change in consolidation scope and other changes” mainly relate to Lane as well as exchange gains and losses. 339 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Lane Construction Corporation Defined Benefit Pension Plan Through its US subsidiary Lane Industries Inc., the Group contributes to a pension plan that qualifies as a defined benefit plan, The Lane Construction Corporation Defined Benefit Pension Plan, which pays benefits to employees or former employees who met the related vesting conditions when they retire. The subsidiary also pays benefits to a supplementary pension plan for some senior executives. In addition, it provides employees who have reached retirement age with healthcare benefits. These employees were hired before 31 December 1992 and reached retirement age after at least 20 years’ service and are also beneficiaries of The Lane Construction Corporation Defined Benefit Pension Plan.

The risks of participating in these plans, which involve more than one employer, vary depending on the plan and are borne by each employer as follows: • the assets contributed by an employer to a multi-employer pension plan may be used to provide benefits to the employees of the other employers involved in the plan; • if an employer stops contributing to a multi-employer pension plan, its unmet obligations are covered by the other employers participating in the plan; • if an employer decides to withdraw from a multi-employer pension plan, it may be required to pay the plan an amount calculated considering its possible undercapitalisation at the withdrawal date. 343 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Zone Status (Pension Contributions (Eur/000) Plan end date; Protection Act)1 Presence of MFA”2 Pension plan Number 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2016 2017 2016 2017 IUOE Local 4 04-6013863; 001 Green Green 838 805 31/5/2018; No Pension Fund IUOE Local 98 04-6127765; 001 Green Green 832 929 31/5/2020; No Benefits Funds Operating Engineers’ Constr. 25-6135579; 001 Green Green 711 737 31/12/2019; No Ind. and Misc.

Provisions for risks These provisions amount to €101.5 million at the reporting date, as follows: (€'000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Provisions for risks on equity investments 2,526 4,122 1,596 Other provisions 103,239 97,409 (5,830) Total 105,765 101,531 (4,234) The provision for risks on equity investments relates to expected impairment losses on the carrying amount of the Group’s investments in associates for the part that exceeds their carrying amounts. 344 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Changes in this provision are detailed below: (€'000) 2017 Share of loss of equity-accounted investees (2,059) Dividends from equity-accounted investees 73 Other changes including change in the (190) translation reserve Reclassifications 3,772 Total 1,596 Other provisions comprise: (€'000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 USW Campania projects 32,760 31,160 (1,600) Provisions set up by Imprepar and its subsidiaries 36,327 39,927 3,600 Other 34,152 26,322 (7,830) Total 103,239 97,409 (5,830) The provision for the USW Campania projects mainly consists of the estimated potential costs for the environmental clean-up. The “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report includes a description of the litigation and risks related to the USW Campania projects. The provisions set up by Imprepar and its subsidiaries include accruals made for probable future charges related to the closing of contracts and potential developments in ongoing litigation. Other mainly comprises amounts accrued in 2016 for certain foreign contracts completed in previous years for which disputes are ongoing with the customers. Relationships with these customers are difficult and, therefore, the Group is unable to estimate exactly when the related receivables will be collected. 345 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Changes during 2016 are shown in the following table: 31 December Accruals Utilisations Reclassifications Exchange 31 December (€'000) 2015 gains and 2016 other changes Other Provisions 104,171 11,046 (15,952) 3,974 103,239 Changes in the item in the year are summarised below: 31 December Accruals Utilisations/ Reclassifications Exchange 31 December (€'000) 2016 Releases gains and 2017 other changes Other Provisions 103,239 14,865 (18,319) (2,376) 97,409 Changes of the year comprise: accruals of €14.9 million, mainly related to the subsidiary Imprepar (€10.5 million), HCE Group for future costs to dismantle work sites (€1.3 million) and Salini Impregilo’s headquarters (€0.7 million); utilisations of €18.3 million, mostly related to the subsidiary Imprepar, and HCE Group due to the occurrence of the events for which the provision had been set up. Reference should be made to the Main risk factors and uncertainties section of the Directors' report for more information on litigation. 346 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 28. Progress payments and advances on contract work in progress This item, included in “Current liabilities”, amounts to €2,518.6 million, up €62.9 million on the figure at 31 December 2016. It comprises: (€'000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Contract work in progress (5,384,910) (5,155,863) 229,047 Progress payments and advances received (on 5,976,936 5,769,034 (207,902) approved work) Negative work in progress 592,026 613,171 21,145 Contractual advances 1,863,606 1,905,386 41,780 Total 2,455,632 2,518,557 62,925 Work in progress recognised under liabilities (negative WIP) of €613.2 million is the negative net balance, for each contract, of work performed to date and progress payments and advances.

The most significant contractual advances, which total €1,905.4 million, relate to the following contracts: the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Gerd), Gibe II and the Koysha dam in Ethiopia (€362.7 million), the hydroelectric project in Tajikistan (€266.6 million), the Copenhagen Cityringen Metro in Denmark (€190.8 million), contracts in Libya (€178.2 million), the Riyadh Metro Line 3 in Saudi Arabia (€169.4 million), projects in Nigeria (€87.9 million) and the metro line in Australia (€71.7 million). The Directors' report provides more information about the performance of these contracts and their progress. The Main risk factors and uncertainties section in the Directors' report provides information on pending disputes and assets exposed to country risk. 29. Trade payables Trade payables amount to €2,163.4 million at the reporting date, a decrease of €181.3 million on 31 December 2016. They are made up as follows: (€'000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Third parties 2,233,611 2,046,292 (187,319) Unconsolidated group companies and other 111,162 117,140 5,978 related parties Total 2,344,773 2,163,432 (181,341) The decrease is the result of the settlement of payables for the Gibe III and Koysha projects (Ethiopian branch, €143.2 million) and the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway section contract (€42.6 million). 348 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Trade payables to unconsolidated group companies and other related parties increased by €6.0 million to €117.1 million at the reporting date. The item mostly consists of payables to unconsolidated SPEs accrued on work performed by them for contracts with Italian and foreign public administrations. The increase in the item mostly relates to the consortium company Metro Blu S.c.r.l. for the Milan metro Line 4 project and Arge Haupttunnel Eyholz for construction of the Eyholz tunnel. The balance includes €18.6 million (€7.4 million) and includes the Group’s liabilities with consortia and consortium companies (SPEs) that operate by recharging costs and are not included in the consolidation scope. The balance is equal to the Group's share of the SPEs’ cash and cash equivalents. 30. Current tax liabilities and other current tax liabilities Current tax liabilities amount to €96.8 million as follows: (€'000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 IRES 7,838 3,537 (4,301) IRAP 2,118 1,808 (310) Foreign taxes 100,035 91,494 (8,541) Total 109,991 96,839 (13,152) Foreign taxes include €7.5 million related to a tax dispute involving Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. (see note 32 for more information). 349 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Other current tax liabilities of €44.8 million decreased by €22.8 million over 31 December 2016. They may be analysed as follows: (€'000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 VAT 48,062 25,938 (22,124) Other indirect taxes 19,527 18,873 (654) Total 67,589 44,811 (22,778) 31. Other current liabilities Other current liabilities of €330.3 million (€356.3 million) comprise: (€'000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 State bodies 115,588 115,588 Other liabilities 94,180 87,984 (6,196) Employees 82,206 67,529 (14,677) Social security institutions 23,271 22,880 (391) Unconsolidated group companies and other 13,747 13,956 209 related parties Compensation and compulsory purchases 5,739 5,785 46 Accrued expenses and deferred income 21,584 16,567 (5,017) Total 356,315 330,289 (26,026) “State bodies” (€115.6 million) entirely relate to the transactions with the commissioner, the provincial authorities and municipalities of Campania in connection with the USW Campania projects. Reference should be made to the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report for more information about the complicated situation surrounding the USW Campania projects. “Other liabilities” of €88.0 million decreased by roughly €6.2 million on the 31 December 2016 balance of €94.2 million. Such reduction is mainly attributable to the decrease in the liabilities for the Red Line project 350 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 in Doha, Qatar (€8.1 million), the road works in Tunisia performed by HCE Group (€6.9 million) and the Bologna Florence section of the high speed/capacity project (€3.2 million), as well as the decrease in liabilities for contracts completed or nearing completion, such as the Ingula hydroelectric project in South Africa (€8.2 million) as work on these projects continued regularly. The reduction is offset by the increase in liabilities for the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway section contract following commencement of Lot 4 and the Saudi Arabian metro contract. “Employees” relate to accrued unpaid remuneration. The large decrease in this item during the year mainly refers to the parent and the US Lane Group following payment of the remuneration and a reduction in the workforce for contracts that are nearing completion. The balance of “Compensation and compulsory purchases” is in line with the previous year end and relates to the high speed/capacity railway contracts and principally the Milan Genoa and Bologna Florence sections. Accrued expenses and deferred income decreased by €5.0 million to €16.6 million at the reporting date and the decrease is mostly due to the Salerno Reggio di Calabria motorway works and the Sydney metro in Australia as shown in the following table: (€'000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Accrued expenses: Commissions on sureties 4,267 3,920 (347) Other 11,138 10,525 (613) Total accrued expenses 15,405 14,445 (960) Deferred income: Provision of services 6,179 2,122 (4,057) Total deferred income 6,179 2,122 (4,057) Total 21,584 16,567 (5,017) 351 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 32. Guarantees, commitments, risks and contingent liabilities Guarantees and commitments The key guarantees given by the Group are set out below: • contractual sureties: these total €12,830.4 million and are given to customers as performance bonds, to guarantee advances, withholdings and involvement in tenders for all ongoing contracts. In turn, the group companies have guarantees given by its subcontractors. The balance includes sureties of €5,369.0 million given directly by Lane Group; • sureties for credit: they amount to €262.4 million; • sureties granted for export credit: €157.2 million; • other guarantees: they amount to €1,453.6 million and comprise guarantees related to customs and tax obligations (€53.2 million) and other commitments (such as environmental clean-ups and export credit) (€1,400.4 million); • collateral related to a lien on the shares of the SPE M4 (€4.7 million). 352 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Tax disputes Salini Impregilo With respect to the principal dispute with the tax authorities: • as described in detail in previous reports, the dispute about the assessment notice challenging the tax treatment of impairment losses and losses on the sale of assets recognised by the parent in 2003 is currently before the Supreme Court, following the tax authorities’ appeal. The main issue about the sale by Impregilo S.p.A. of its investment in the Chilean operator Costanera Norte SA to Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. was cancelled by the Milan Regional Tax Commission on 11 September 2009 (higher assessed tax base of €70 million); • the parent's appeal about reimbursement of tax assets with a nominal amount of €12.3 million acquired from third parties as part of previous non-recurring transactions is still pending before the Supreme Court; • a dispute related to 2005 about the technique used to realign the carrying amount of equity investments as per article 128 of Presidential decree no. 917/86 (greater assessed tax base of €4.2 million) is still pending before the first level court; • with respect to another dispute again related to 2005 and the costs of a joint venture set up in Venezuela for which the greater assessed tax base is €6.6 million, the Regional Tax Commission filed its ruling entirely in the parent’s favour on 19 May 2015; the tax authorities appealed to the Supreme Court on 28 December 2015 challenging the procedure while stating that the findings do not relate to the appeal. The parent has filed its defence brief; • the parent was notified of: (i) a payment order from the tax authorities for Icelandic taxes of €4.6 million, which was cancelled after the first and second level sentences in its favour; the tax authorities appealed to the Supreme Court on 11 May 2017 and the parent presented its defence brief, and (ii) a payment bill for the same taxes which the parent appealed. It won again both at first and second level. On 18 January 2016, the tax authorities presented their appeal to the Supreme Court and the parent filed its defence brief; 353 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 • as already commented on in previous reports, on 29 December 2016, the parent received two assessment reports for IRES and IRAP purposes covering 2011 and alleging unpaid IRES taxes of €21.2 million and IRAP taxes of €2.9 million. Both these reports were based on a preliminary assessment report issued by the tax police and notified to the parent on 27 September 2016. They refer to: (i) for a minimum part, the alleged applicability of the “transfer price” regulations to sureties given free of charge on behalf of foreign subsidiaries, for which the tax police asserted that the normal commission income would have been €0.7 million; (ii) the non-deductibility of costs of €36.4 million incurred to purchase goods and services to perform works for the Abu Dhabi and Panama contracts, both of which countries have a preferential tax regime, due to the alleged insufficient evidence that the suppliers carried out commercial activities in those countries and that the related purchases were in Salini Impregilo’s effective interest. During the mutually-agreed settlement procedure, the tax authorities revised their position and, after the discussions, the related agreements were signed on 5 June 2017 settling the dispute with payment of €300 thousand by the parent. Moreover, the Milan unit of the tax police completed its tax audit of the IRES, IRAP and VAT paid in 2012 on 27 March 2017 and the inspectors reported the same findings as 2011. The tax authorities again firstly sent a questionnaire followed by assessment notices for IRES and IRAP audits, which did not include all the assessments proposed by the inspectors. The parent did not challenge the notices and paid the related amount (€300 thousand); • on 12 December 2017, the parent received an adjustment notice from the tax authorities requesting payment of registration tax of approximately €1.3 million in addition to a fine of the same amount on the sale of a business unit to Imprepar (which also received an identical adjustment notice). This business unit had no future profits and held investments in consortium companies in liquidation or inactive and the related assets and liabilities related to contracts that have been completed or are nearing completion due to Imprepar's know how in managing this type of business. The parent deems that the tax authorities' allegations are ungrounded and has promptly appealed against the notices to the competent tax commission. 354 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its advisors, the parent believes that it has acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. After the tax audit into 2011, 2012 and 2013 for the Ethiopian branch, the inspectors reported findings about the measurement of revenue from contract work in progress and the deduction of some costs. During the audit, the branch negotiated a significant decrease in these findings and the settlement of the findings for all three years. Icelandic branch With respect to the completed contract for the construction of a hydroelectric plant in Karanjukar (Iceland), a dispute arose with the Icelandic tax authorities in 2004 about the party required to act as the withholding agent for the remuneration of foreign temporary workers at the building site. Salini Impregilo was firstly wrongly held responsible for the payment of the withholdings on this remuneration, which it therefore paid. Following the definitive ruling of the first level court, the parent’s claims were fully satisfied. Nevertheless, the local authorities subsequently commenced a new proceeding for exactly the same issue. The Supreme Court rejected the parent’s claims in its ruling handed down in February 2010, which is blatantly contrary to the previous ruling issued in 2007 on the same matter by the same judiciary authority. The parent had expected to be refunded the unduly paid withholdings of €6.9 million (at the original exchange rate). After the last ruling, the parent took legal action at international level (appeal presented to the EFTA Surveillance Authority on 22 June 2010) and, as far as possible, again at local level as it deems that the last ruling issued by the Icelandic Supreme Court is unlawful both in respect of local legislative and international agreements regulating trade relations between the EFTA countries and international conventions which do not allow application of discriminatory treatments to foreign parties (individuals and companies) working in other EFTA countries. On 8 February 2012, the EFTA Surveillance Authority sent the Icelandic government a communication notifying the infraction of the free exchange of services and requested the government to provide its observations about this. 355 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 In April 2013, the EFTA Surveillance Authority issued its documented opinion finding the Icelandic legislation to be inconsistent with the regulations covering trade relations between the member countries with respect to the regulations for the above dispute. It asked that Iceland take steps to comply with these regulations. Imprepar The Milan Regional Tax Commission filed a ruling on the IRES assessment notices for 2006/2007/2008 received by the subsidiary Imprepar at the end of March 2015 cancelling all the main findings notified by the tax authorities on the assessment notices for 2006, 2007 and 2008 for a higher taxable amount of €12 million. In November 2015, the tax authorities appealed against the Milan Regional Tax Commission before the Supreme Court and the company filed its defence brief in December. After consulting its legal advisors, the subsidiary did not set up a provision for this tax dispute as it deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. On 12 December 2017, Imprepar received an adjustment notice from the tax authorities requesting payment of registration tax of approximately €1.3 million in addition to a fine of the same amount on the parent's sale of a business unit to it (which also received an identical adjustment notice). This business unit had no future profits and held investments in consortium companies in liquidation or inactive and the related assets and liabilities related to contracts that have been completed or are nearing completion transferred due to Imprepar's know how in managing this type of company. The parent deems that the tax authorities' are ungrounded and has promptly appealed to the competent tax court. Fibe As disclosed in previous reports, Fibe has a pending dispute about the local property tax (ICI) on the Acerra waste-to-energy plant. In January 2013, the subsidiary received tax assessment notices from the Acerra municipality with respect to the waste-to-energy plant, which requested payment of local property tax and related penalties 356 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 for approximately €14.3 million for the years 2009-2011. The amount requested by the Municipality and challenged by Fibe was confirmed as far as its applicability but reduced in terms of its amount and penalties by the Naples Regional Tax Commission. The subsidiary appealed against the second level ruling with the Supreme Court and the case is still pending. However, in 2015, the subsidiary set aside a provision for an amount equal to the tax plus accrued interest on a prudent basis. HCE The second level hearing about the tax claims for the years from 2014 to 2016 about the assessed taxability of transferred funds used to cover costs incurred for the works tendered in Ukraine is pending. As these claims are clearly groundless, the parent has challenged the claims and obtained a first level ruling in its favour. 357 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 33.

Reference should be made to the section on the accounting policies for information on the fair value measurement of these items. Specifically, the fair value of the items is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Risk management The Group is exposed to financial risks which encompass all the risks related to capital availability, affected by credit and liquidity management and/or the volatility of market factors such as interest and exchange rates. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises currency risk and interest rate risk. Currency risk The Group’s international presence entails its exposure to currency risk arising from fluctuations in the value of trade and financial transactions in currencies other than the individual group companies' functional currencies. The Group has adopted a currency risk management strategy to mitigate this risk based on the guidelines described in the Risk management system section of the Directors’ report to which reference is made. Currency risk at 31 December 2017 mainly related to the following currencies: • US dollar (USD) • Ethopian birr (BIRR) • Tajikistani somoni (TJS) • United Arab Emirates dirham (AED) • Qatari riyal (QAR) • South African rand (ZAR) 360 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The Group considers each group company’s monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than its functional currency, net of derivatives agreed to hedge the above trade and financial transactions, when assessing the potential effects of fluctuations in the above currencies. The following table shows the results of the sensitivity analysis, which considers a 5% increase or decrease in the exchange rates compared to the actual exchange rates at 31 December 2017 and 2016 to reflect the potential effects on profit (loss) and equity. (€m) 2016 2017 -5% +5% -5% +5% US dollar 21.31 (21.31) 18.42 (18.42) Riyal 1.01 (1.01) 0.65 (0.65) Birr 6.47 (6.47) 10.12 (10.12) Somoni 1.18 (1.18) 0.81 (0.81) Rand (0.87) 0.87 (0.89) 0.89 Interest rate risk Salini Impregilo group has adopted a combined strategy of streamlining group operations by disposing of non-strategic assets, containing debt and hedging interest rate risks on a portion of the non-current structured loans through interest rate swaps (IRSs). The financial risks arising from market interest rate fluctuations to which the Group is potentially exposed and which are monitored by the relevant company personnel relate to non-current floating rate loans. Such risk is mitigated by interest accrued on short-term investments of liquidity available at the Italian-based consortia and consortium companies and foreign subsidiaries, which are used to support the Group’s operations. The Group revised its debt structure in 2017, increasing its fixed rate exposure. Had interest rates increased or decreased by an average 75 basis points in 2017, the loss before tax would have been respectively smaller or greater by a maximum of €4.3 million (2016: €8.0 million), assuming that all other variables remained constant and without considering cash and cash equivalents. 361 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Credit risk Credit risk is that deriving from the Group’s exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ (which are mostly governments or state bodies) non-compliance with their obligations. Management of this risk is complex, starting as early as the assessment of offers, through a careful analysis of the characteristics of the countries in which the Group's activities should be carried out and the customers, which are usually state or similar bodies, requesting an offer. Therefore, this risk can be essentially assimilated to the country risk. An analysis of this risk based on the age of the outstanding amounts is not very meaningful, since the receivables should be assessed together with the related working capital items, especially those reflecting the net exposure to customers (positive and negative work in progress, advances and payments on account) in relation to contract work in progress as a whole.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk derives from the risk that the financial resources necessary to meet obligations may not be available to the Group at the agreed terms and deadlines. The Group’s strategy aims at ensuring that each ongoing contract is financially independent, considering the structure of the consortia and SPEs, which may limit the availability of financial resources to achievement of the related projects. Liquidity management also considers 363 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 the existence of constraints to the transfer of currency imposed by certain countries. This strategy is strictly monitored centrally.

In addition, the parent has unused credit facilities of €500 million at the reporting date. Fair value measurement hierarchy IFRS 7 requires that the fair value of financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position be classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair value. There are three different levels: • Level 1 Fair values measured using quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2 Fair values measured using valuation techniques for which inputs significant to the fair value measurement are based on observable market data; • Level 3 Fair values measured using valuation techniques for which inputs significant to the fair value measurement are based on unobservable market data. Financial instruments recognised by the Group at fair value are classified at the following levels: (€'000) Note Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Derivative assets 11 226 Derivative liabilities 25 (1,480) Total (1,254) There were no movements from Level 1 to Level 2 during the year or vice versa. 365 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Change in assets and liabilities from financing activities The following table shows changes in assets and liabilities from financing activities as required by IAS 7.44: Changes in Change in Change in Changes in fair Other Total changes cash flows consolidation exchange value changes (€'000) from financing scope rates activities Non-current financial assets (22,354) 665 18,625 (123,016) (126,080) Derivatives and other current 49,474 8 179,603 229,085 financial assets Non-current derivatives (3,955) (474) (4,429) Financial liabilities related parties and other (2,173) (35,934) (38,107) unconsolidated group companies Derivatives and other current 1,397 (2,668) (1,271) financial liabilities Total 24,947 (3,282) 18,625 923 17,985 59,198 366 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS 34.

In addition, some smaller variations due to continuation of work on certain large foreign contracts and the completion of other contracts also contributed to the increase. A breakdown of revenue is given in the following table: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Works invoiced to customers 5,404,920 5,558,840 153,920 Services 226,886 237,903 11,017 Sales 128,552 143,233 14,681 Total 5,760,358 5,939,976 179,618 Services include revenue of €106.8 million for costs recharged to third party partners of consolidated consortia and consortium companies. 367 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 A breakdown of other income is given in the following table: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Recharged costs 68,855 85,024 16,169 Prior year income 28,862 27,265 (1,597) Gains on the disposal of non-current assets 7,582 20,542 12,960 Other income 18,151 34,434 16,283 Total 123,451 167,265 43,814 35. Operating expenses Operating expenses for the year amount to €6,082.1 million compared to €5,608.3 million for 2016. The item may be broken down as follows: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Purchases 1,161,046 1,117,594 (43,452) Subcontracts 1,505,428 1,715,581 210,153 Services 1,555,996 1,523,130 (32,866) Personnel expenses 886,237 996,154 109,917 Other operating expenses 222,265 174,630 (47,635) Amortisation, depreciation, provisions 277,324 554,972 277,648 and impairment losses Total 5,608,296 6,082,061 473,765 The variations in the individual items compared to 2016 are due to the different cost structures that vary from contract to contract and may, in some cases, entail changes in the industrial operating model from one year to another. Moreover, as these are large-scale infrastructural works that take several years to complete, resort to normal production factors depends on the stage of completion of each contract in any given year. These changes may generate significant variations in the percentage of the related cost categories depending on the contract and the year, while not affecting the total percentage of operating costs of total revenue. 368 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 35.1 Purchases The cost of raw materials and consumables incurred in 2017 decreased by €43.5 million to €1,117.6 million compared to the previous year: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Purchases of raw materials and consumables 1,120,190 1,094,875 (25,315) Change in raw materials and consumables 40,856 22,719 (18,137) Total 1,161,046 1,117,594 (43,452) The decrease in the cost of raw materials and consumables is mainly related to the Red Line North Underground, Doha Metro System – IGL-SKGALFAR contract in Qatar (€51.6 million), which is nearing completion. The decrease is partly offset by the rise in costs incurred for the D1 Motorway Lietavska Lucka Visnove DubnaSkala lot contract in Slovakia (€10.8 million). 35.2 Subcontracts Costs of subcontracts increased to €1,715.6 million, up €210.2 million on the previous year as shown in the following table: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Subcontracts 1,505,428 1,715,581 210,153 Total 1,505,428 1,715,581 210,153 The €210.2 million increase is mainly due to Lane (€136.7 million) and the Galfar Salimp Cimolai JV project in Al-Khor, Qatar (€117.2 million). 369 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 35.3 Services This item decreased to €1,523.1 million, down €32.9 million on the previous year, as shown in the following table: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Consultancy and technical services 599,639 649,552 49,913 Rent and leases 233,911 247,562 13,651 Recharging of costs by consortia 206,942 219,239 12,297 Transport and customs 121,093 100,975 (20,118) Insurance 54,946 58,892 3,946 Maintenance 32,717 37,084 4,367 Fees to directors, statutory auditors and 13,321 11,997 (1,324) independent auditors Other 293,427 197,829 (95,598) Total 1,555,996 1,523,130 (32,866) “Other” decreased by €95.6 million over 2016 principally due to the smaller volumes of activities carried out for the civil works of CMT IS’ Danish contract (Cityringen project) and the renegotiation of some contracts for the same project leading to the related reclassification of the costs from “Other” to “Subcontracts”. “Consultancy and technical services” increased by €49.9 million and mainly consist of the design and construction costs incurred by the SPEs and legal and administrative consultancy fees. A breakdown of this item is as follows: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Design and engineering services 399,060 407,138 8,078 Legal, administrative and other services 79,014 94,805 15,791 Testing 1,368 1,425 57 Construction 120,197 146,184 25,987 Total 599,639 649,552 49,913 370 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 35.4 Personnel expenses Personnel expenses for the year amount to €996.2 million, up by €109.9 million on 2016.The item is made up as follows: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Wages and salaries 671.272 757.990 86.718 Social security and pension contributions 147.536 173.346 25.810 Post-employment benefits and employee benefits 13.878 18.819 4.941 Other 53.551 45.999 (7.552) Total 886.237 996.154 109.917 The increase mostly relates to Lane, progress on the contracts in Saudi Arabia and the Australian work site for the construction of the Forrestfield-Airport Link in Perth, which is now fully operational. “Other” mainly relates to termination benefits and reimbursements of travel expenses. 35.5 Other operating expenses Other operating expenses amount to €174.6 million, down €47.6 million on 2017. This item is made up as follows: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Other operating costs 117,521 68,889 (48,632) Commissions on sureties 44,896 56,804 11,908 Bank charges 15,456 9,743 (5,713) Losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment 9,459 16,836 7,377 Other non-recurring costs 9 1,948 1,939 Other prior year expense 34,924 20,410 (14,514) Total 222,265 174,630 (47,635) This item’s decrease is chiefly due to the reduction in other operating costs and other prior year expense, which is mainly due to non-recurring prior year expense. 371 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Specifically, it relates to assessed fines, other charges and higher bank charges recorded by Salini Impregilo in 2016, the latter were also incurred in 2017. Moreover, in 2016, the Group paid customs duties on the new Koysha contract, which is now fully operational. Prior year expense includes the out-of-court settlement between the customer and Empresa Constructora Metro 6 ltda in Chile, with respect to which reference was made to the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the 2016 Directors’ report. The 2017 balance includes the effect of the negative outcome for HCE Group of the Keiff Eddir award in Tunisia (€3.5 million). The decrease for 2017 is offset by increases in commissions on sureties of Lane Group. 35.6 Amortisation, depreciation, provisions and impairment losses This item of €555.0 million shows an increase of €277.6 million on the previous year. It may be analysed as follows: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Provisions and impairment losses 16,502 336,360 319,858 Amortisation of intangible assets 1,545 1,466 (79) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 226,812 194,707 (32,105) Amortisation of rights to infrastructure under 1,344 891 (453) concession Amortisation of contract acquisition costs 31,121 21,548 (9,573) Total amortisation and depreciation 260,822 218,612 (42,210) Total 277,324 554,972 277,648 “Provisions and impairment losses” increased by €319.9 million in 2017. 372 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 This item mainly refers to provisions and impairment losses of €336.4 million recognised for the Venezuelan projects considering that described in the “Venezuela” paragraph of the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report and section 4 “Impairment Venezuela” of these notes. In addition, it includes impairment losses of €25.2 million on receivables deemed non-recoverable related to the Cetin Dam contract in Turkey described in the “Turkey” paragraph of the same section of the Directors’ report. Amortisation and depreciation of €218.6 million decreased by €42.2 million compared to the previous year and are in line with the progress made on the related contracts. The decreases refer to contracts nearing completion, principally related to work in Denmark, Qatar and Ethiopia (Gibe III), while the increases refer to contracts for which production is now at 100%. These include the Milan Genoa section of the high speed/high capacity railway project and the Perth Metro project in Australia. 36. Net financing costs Net financing costs amount to €192.9 million compared to €86.5 million for 2016. The item may be broken down as follows: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Financial income 44,499 64,822 20,323 Financial expense (146,542) (134,886) 11,656 Net exchange gains (losses) 15,537 (122,838) (138,375) Net financing costs (86,506) (192,902) (106,396) 373 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 36.1 Financial income Financial income totals €64.8 million (2016: €44.5 million) and is made up as follows: (€'000) Variation 2016 2017 Interest income on loans and receivables 2,106 (2,106) Gains on securities 10,315 5,115 (5,200) Interest and other income from unconsolidated group companies and other 9,645 10,706 1,061 related parties Interest income 9,620 10,706 1,086 Financial income 25 (25) Interest and other financial income 22,433 49,001 26,568 Interest on receivables 5,959 30,097 24,138 Bank interest 6,203 11,610 5,407 Other 10,271 7,294 (2,977) Total 44,499 64,822 20,323 The €20.3 million increase is mainly attributable to the recognition of interest on the parent’s receivables from mostly foreign customers. 36.2 Financial expense 374 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Financial expense totals €134.9 million compared to €146.5 million for 2016 and is made up as follows: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Intragroup interest and other expense (361) (727) (366) Interest expense (361) (727) (366) Interest and other financial expense (146,181) (134,159) 12,022 Bank interest on accounts and financing (74,711) (50,083) 24,628 Interest on bonds (35,863) (45,564) (9,701) Interest on tax liabilities (1,589) (15,359) (13,770) Bank fees (4,832) (3,472) 1,360 Factoring and leases (6,116) (5,392) 724 Other (23,070) (14,289) 8,781 Total (146,542) (134,886) 11,656 Financial expense decreased by €11.7 million, mainly due to the net increase of €14.9 million of bank interest on accounts and financing and interest on bonds after renegotiation of the corporate debt. This was partially offset by the increase in interest relating to a tax bill received by the Ethiopian branch during the year, which was settled on 7 July 2017. The decrease of €8.6 million in “Other” reflects the reduction in interest expense due to other financial backers on the factoring of tax and trade receivables, mostly for the Milan Genoa section of the high speed/capacity railway project (€1.4 million) and the smaller loss on the securities of the Colombian company Yuma Concessionaria S.A. (€3.1 million). 375 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 In addition: • interest on bank accounts and financing of €50.1 million includes €14.7 million arising from the application of the “amortised cost” method, which did not entail cash outlays during the year as it was paid in full in previous years; • interest on bonds of €45.6 million includes the effect of the amortised cost method for €4.1 million. 36.3 Net exchange gains (losses) The net exchange losses amount to €122.8 million (2016: net exchange gains of €15.5 million). The decrease of €138.3 million is due to the changes in exchange rates with certain foreign currencies, especially the Birr, recognised by the Ethiopian branch, and the US dollar, which mainly affected the parent and the Venezuelan branch. 37. Net gains on equity investments Net gains on equity investments totals €100.1 million, up €91.0 million on 2016. The increase is mainly due to the the effect of recognising the profit for the year of the equity-accounted investees (€100.4 million), which increased by €95.0 million mainly for the Argentine associate Autopista del Sol S.A. and the Lane Group’s US joint ventures. 376 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The following table provides a breakdown of this item: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Share of profit of investees 5,409 100,385 94,976 Dividends 234 223 (11) Loss on the disposal of equity investments (365) (1,446) (1.081) Other income 3,844 947 (2,897) Total 9,122 100,109 90,987 The following table provides a breakdown of this item “Share of profit of investees”: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Share of profit (loss) of investees Autopista del Sol 90,082 90,082 Gupc (18,440) 7,220 25,660 Yacilec (241) 1,305 1,546 Metro de Lima Linea 2 S.A. 787 1,011 224 Agua Azul 1,053 1,001 (52) Gaziantep Hastane Saglik (247) (5,423) (5,176) Other (1,875) 1,005 2,880 Sub-total (18,963) 96,201 115,164 Lane Group companies: Purple Line 4,685 4,985 300 Fluor Lane South Caroline 475 1,391 916 Skanska Granite Lane JV 9,516 1,364 (8,152) Fluor Lane I-495 387 387 Unionport 257 257 SGL Leasing 252 228 (24) Gemma Lane Liberty 2,116 176 (1,940) Interstate Healy JV (33) 160 193 Gemma Lane Patriot 5,185 155 (5,030) Fluor Lane I-95 2,194 4 (2,190) Flatiron Lane JV 1 (1) Agl Constructor JV (19) (4,923) (4,904) Total Lane Group joint ventures 24,372 4,184 (20,188) Total 5,409 100,385 94,976 377 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 38.

Earnings (loss) per share Earnings (loss) per share are disclosed at the foot of the statement of comprehensive income. Basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the profit (loss) for the year attributable to the owners of the parent by the weighted average of the shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated considering the weighted average of the outstanding shares adjusted by assuming the conversion of all the shares with potentially diluting effects. The following table summarises the calculation. Following the merger resolution of 12 September 2013, 44,974,754 new ordinary Salini Impregilo S.p.A. shares were issued to Salini Costruttori S.p.A. to service the merger. On 20 June 2014, the board of directors approved a capital increase with the related issue of 44,740,000 new shares. This took place on 25 June 2014 and the parent’s share capital comprises 492,172,691 ordinary shares and 1,615,491 savings shares. In October 2014, the parent repurchased 3,104,377 own shares. No shares have been subsequently issued or repurchased. 384 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 (€'000) 2016 2017 Profit (loss) from continuing operations 120,178 (82,147) Non-controlling interests (39,593) (22,862) Profit (loss) from continuing operations attributable to the owners of the parent 80,585 (105,009) Profit (loss) from continuing and discontinued operations 99,515 (84,055) Non-controlling interests (39,594) (22,863) Profit (loss) from continuing and discontinued operations attributable to the owners of the parent 59,921 (106,918) Profit earmarked for holders of savings shares 588 588 Average outstanding ordinary shares 489,069 489,069 Average outstanding savings shares 1,615 1,615 Average number of shares 490,684 490,684 Dilutive effect 2,329 Average number of diluted shares 490,684 493,013 Basic earnings (loss) per share (from continuing operations) 0.16 (0.22) Basic earnings (loss) per share (from continuing and discontinued operations) 0.12 (0.22) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (from continuing operations) 0.16 (0.21) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (from continuing and discontinued operations) 0.12 (0.22) 385 Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 41.

Basis of preparation Salini Impregilo S.p.A. (the “company” or “Salini Impregilo”) has prepared its separate 2017 financial statements on a going concern basis. As required by Regulation no. 1606/2002 issued by the European Parliament and Council, implemented in Italy by Legislative decree no. 38/2005, these separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union at 31 December 2017. They comprise a statement of financial position, a statement of profit or loss, a statement of comprehensive income, a statement of cash flows, a statement of changes in equity and these notes. The separate financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost principle, except for those items which are recognised at fair value in accordance with IFRS, as described in the section on Accounting policies . The statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss are presented in Euros, whereas the amounts in the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of cash flows, the statement of changes in equity and these notes are shown in thousands of Euros, unless stated otherwise. 2. Changes in standards The following amendments became applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017: • Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes – Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses; • Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of cash flows – Disclosure initiative; • Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities. Adoption of the above amendments did not significantly affect the company's separate financial statements. This section lists the standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IFRS and endorsed by the European Union but which became applicable after 31 December 2017. 451 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Standard/Interpretation IASB application date Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial instruments with 1 January 2018 IFRS 4 Insurance contracts IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers (and Clarification 1 January 2018 to IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers) IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based payment Classification and 1 January 2018 measurement of share-based payment transactions Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle 1 January 2018 Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of investment property 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 The company has not adopted the above standards in advance. The standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IASB and the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRS-IC) but not yet endorsed by the competent EU bodies at the reporting date are set out below: Standard/Interpretation IASB application date IFRS 17 Insurance contracts 1 January 2021 IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 1 January 2018 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatment 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment features with negative 1 January 2019 compensation Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term interests in associates and joint 1 January 2019 ventures Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 cycle 1 January 2019 (amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23) Adoption of the above standards will not significantly affect the company's separate financial statements. Salini Impregilo has commenced a specific adoption project for IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. Information thereon is provided below. 452 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 IFRS 9 Financial instruments The IASB published the final version of IFRS 9 Financial instruments in July 2014. The standard is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is allowed. IFRS 9 introduces new rules for the classification and measurement of financial instruments, especially financial assets, based on the business model under which they are held and their cash flow characteristics. The standard classifies financial assets into three main categories based on the measurement method: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss. The categories envisaged by IAS 39, i.e., heldto-maturity, loans and receivables and available-for-sale have been eliminated. The standard introduces the measurement of impairment losses using the expected credit loss model rather than the incurred loss model provided for under IAS 39. The new model entails development of judgement about the impact of changes in economic factors on the expected credit losses, which are weighted by probability. IFRS 9 also introduces a new hedge accounting model aligned to the entity's risk management policies. The exemption from application of the fair value measurement to unlisted equity investments has been eliminated. The standard also requires new and more detailed disclosures about hedge accounting, credit risk and expected credit losses. The standard is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and shall be applied retrospectively, with the possibility to use some simplifications. Given the characteristics of its business sector, the introduction of new methods to estimate impairment losses on financial assets should not significantly affect the company's current measurement methods. This is based on the fact that the indicators used to quantify credit risk currently used under IAS 39, such as client risk, country risk and the assessment of relevant macroeconomic information already reflects a valuation method based on expected risk. 453 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers The IASB issued the new standard in May 2014 to unify in one standard the rules for revenue recognition previously included in several standards and interpretations (including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes). IFRS 15 provides that revenue is to be recognised using a five-step model as set out below: 1. Identify the contract with a customer; 2. Identify the performance obligations (distinct elements that are part of a single contract but are separated for accounting purposes) in the contract; 3. Determine the transaction price; 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; 5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. IFRS 15 also covers contract costs, contract modifications and financial statements disclosures. Salini Impregilo has decided to apply IFRS 15 retroactively, recognising the cumulative effects on opening equity at the first application date (1 January 2017 as this is the opening date of the comparative figures). It has opted to use certain simplifications provided for in the new standard to recalculate the opening balances. As part of the ongoing IFRS 15 project, the company has performed a preliminary estimate of the effects of applying IFRS 15 for the first time on its consolidated financial statements as required by IAS 8. It has estimated the effects on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 considering the valuations made to date and summarised below. The actual effects of adoption of IFRS 15 at 1 January and 31 December 2017 may be different as, inter alia: the procedure to implement IFRS 15 is ongoing; specifically, the 454 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 company is finalising implementation of the necessary changes in the contract revenue and cost estimation process to comply with the standard. Company revenue is directly affected by this process as it measures contract work in progress using the percentage of completion method. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that additional effects on equity may be identified upon completion of this implementation project compared to those set out below; the company has not yet completed the testing and assessment of its controls over the new contract revenue and cost estimation systems; the new measurement criteria may undergo interpretation changes up until presentation of the first set of separate financial statements after the application date of IFRS 15; the company's initial estimate of the impact of IFRS 15 on its equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 is based on the current structure and nature of its ongoing contracts and the economic and political situations of the countries where it operates on first-time adoption. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that events may take place after the date of publication of this report that would have different effects on equity compared to those set out below. The ongoing implementation project has led to identification of the following key differences compared to the provisions of IAS 11 and IAS 18 currently applied by the company, based on the five-step model set out above: 1. Identify the contract with a customer. The contract is usually easily identifiable as being the tender contract. In addition to the guidance for identifying the contract, IFRS 15 establishes rules for the combination of two or more contracts agreed concurrently or nearly concurrently with the same customer (or related parties of the customer). Some related services mostly concerning relationships with partners of SPEs set up to carry out contracts are being assessed in detail and, at present, the company does not expect them to have a significant effect on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017. 455 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 The initially estimated effect on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 due to the different method of combining contracts is a decrease of €2,682 thousand and €1,189 thousand, respectively. 2. Identify the performance obligations (distinct elements that are part of a single contract but are separated for accounting purposes) in the contract. The performance obligation is usually the entire project, as provided for in the contract, given that the different services are strongly inter-dependent and integrated and are aimed at transferring the project as a whole. However, some transactions with customers include additional services that are directly or indirectly related to the contract. The main performance obligations considered by the company as distinct and that led to a change in the revenue recognition criteria are: a) maintenance services provided after the work has been completed; b) additional or different contract warranties compared to those provided for by law or normal sector practices. No effect on the company's equity is expected. 3. Determine the transaction price. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the infrastructure to the customer. To determine this amount, the company considers various factors including: variable consideration; significant financing components; consideration payable to a customer; and non-cash consideration. The company specifically analysed the variable consideration which, together with that provided for by IFRS 15 about contract modifications, includes the issue of additional consideration. Under 456 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 IAS 11, the company currently recognises additional consideration if it has been substantially approved by the customer or, if not yet approved, when supported by valuations made by external consultants and/or documentation presented by contractual bodies. IFRS 15 provides that revenue recognition is tied to enforceable rights and that it must be highly probable that the revenue shall not be reversed in the future. The main variable consideration elements that generate impacts on opening equity are: a) claims; b) consideration for optional works and provisional sums. The company has performed a preliminary estimate of the effect on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 of the different measurement of contract modifications and variable consideration, which is a decrease of €92,269 thousand and €91,936 thousand, respectively, including claims of €91,248 thousand and €91,856 thousand, respectively, that the company does not deem highly probable will be agreed. 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations. Further to that set out in point 2, this will not give rise to particularly significant issues. 5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In the company's case, revenue shall be recognised over time as it satisfies the performance obligations given that: the customer controls the contract work as it is being built; and the construction work creates an asset (infrastructure) for which an alternative use to that for which it is being constructed does not exist and the company has the right to collect the consideration for the services over the contract term. The company currently recognises revenue in accordance with IAS 11 using the percentage of completion approach and the cost-to457 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 cost method. It does not believe this method needs to be changed following introduction of IFRS 15 as it is one of the input-based methods envisaged by the new standard. The company currently deems that this is the most appropriate method as it best reflects the transfer of control of the work under construction to the customer. However, it has revised the cost-to-cost calculation method to better align the costs considered (input) with the transfer of control of the work under construction to the customer, as required by IFRS 15. The initially estimated effect on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 due to the review of the input data calculation method is a decrease of €5,953 thousand and €7,772 thousand, respectively. Furthermore, IFRS 15 has introduced new guidance for the recognition of contract costs, distinguishing between the cost to obtain the contract and the cost to fulfil the contract. The new standard requires a different accounting treatment of some contract cost categories with the capitalisation of incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the costs incurred to fulfil the contract that generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future (“pre-operating costs”). The company has performed a preliminary estimate of the effect on equity at 1 January and 31 December 2017 of the different accounting treatment of contract costs, which is a decrease of €23,877 thousand and €21,648 thousand, respectively. The following table shows the company's estimate of the possible effect on opening equity at 1 January 2017 of application of IFRS 15, net of the tax effect: 458 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 (€'000) Equity Equity at 31 December 2016 1,007,428 Estimate of IFRS 15 effect (123,881) Equity at 1 January 2017 883,547 The following table shows the company's preliminary estimate of equity at 31 December 2017, net of the tax effect: (€'000) Equity Equity at 31 December 2017 878,945 Estimate of IFRS 15 effect (122,545) Equity at 1 January 2018 756,400 IFRS 16 Leases The IASB issued this standard in January 2016. It introduces a single method to account for leases in the financial statements of the lessee, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases, so that the lessee recognises an asset for the right to use an underlying asset and a lease liability. The standard includes exemptions when the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. IFRS 16 replaces the current standards on leases, including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC 15 Operating leases Incentives and SIC 27 Evaluating the substance of transactions in the legal form of a lease. IFRS 16 is applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted if IFRS 15 has also been applied, but the company does not currently plan to avail of this option. 3. Basis of presentation Separate financial statements Salini Impregilo opted to present its separate financial statements at 31 December 2017 as follows: 459 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 • Current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities are presented separately in the statement of financial position. Current assets and liabilities are those expected to be realised, sold, used or settled in the company's normal operating cycle, which usually exceeds 12 months. Non-current assets and liabilities include non-current assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefits, deferred tax liabilities and other balances expected to be realised, sold, used or settled after the company's normal operating cycle, i.e., more than twelve months after the reporting date. • The statement of profit or loss gives a classification of costs by nature and shows the profit or loss before “Financing income (costs) and gains (losses) on investments” and income taxes. The statement of comprehensive income shows all non-owner changes in equity. • The statement of cash flows presents the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities separately. The indirect method is used. Accounting policies The accounting policies adopted to draw up the company's separate financial statements at 31 December 2017 comply with the IFRS and are consistent with those used to prepare the 2016 separate financial statements, except for the amendments enacted after 1 January 2017, summarised in the section on the Changes in standards . Property, plant and equipment are recognised at purchase or Property, plant production cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment and equipment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis using rates determined based on the assets' residual possible use. The annual rates are as follows: 460 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Category Depreciation rate Land Buildings 3% Plant and machinery from 10% to 20% Industrial and commercial equipment from 25% to 40% Other assets from 12% to 25% Land and buildings, plant and machinery with a carrying amount to be recovered mainly through their sale (rather than the asset’s continuing use) are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale shall be available for immediate sale and their sale shall be highly probable (i.e., the related commitments already exist). Their price shall be reasonable compared to their fair value. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances take place indicating that the carrying amount may not be recovered. Reference should be made to the section on Impairment of non-financial assets for details on impairment testing. Borrowing costs directly related to the acquisition or construction of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset, to the extent of its recoverable amount. As established by IAS 23 Borrowing costs, the company has applied this method to all qualifying assets. Borrowing costs are capitalised when the costs of the acquisition of the asset and borrowing costs are incurred, and the activities necessary to bring the asset into a condition for its use have been started. The costs provided for but not yet paid related to qualifying assets are excluded from the amount to be capitalised. 461 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended during extended periods in which active development is interrupted. Subsequent expenditure is only capitalised if it increases the future economic benefits of the related asset. All other expenditure is expensed when incurred. Ordinary maintenance costs are fully expensed when incurred. Costs that increase the carrying amount of assets are allocated thereto and depreciated over their residual economic lives. Dismantlement and restoration costs of assets used for contract work in progress are added to the cost of the related asset and depreciated in line with the depreciation pattern of the asset to which they refer when they are foreseeable and objectively determinable. Leasehold improvements are classified in the different items of property, plant and equipment on the basis of their nature. They are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the relevant asset and the residual term of the lease. Assets held under finance leases whereby all the risks and rewards of Leased property, ownership are substantially transferred to the company are recognised plant and as company assets and classified as property, plant and equipment. The equipment related liability to the lessor is shown under financial liabilities. The lease payment is split into the interest expense, taken to the income statement, and the principal repayment, offset against the financial liability. The carrying amount of the leased asset is determined considering its fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum future lease payments. The depreciation method and subsequent measurement are consistent with those applied to non-leased assets. Leases where the lessor retains all the risks and rewards of ownership are treated as operating leases. The initial negotiation costs incurred for this type of lease increase the value of the related lease and are recognised over the lease term in order to match the revenue generated by the leased asset. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 462 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Other Other intangible assets acquired or generated internally are intangible recognised under assets in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible assets assets when it is probable that the use of the asset will generate future economic benefits and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Those assets with finite useful lives are measured at acquisition or development cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Recoverability of their carrying amount is checked by using the criteria set out in the section on “Impairment of non-financial assets”. Equity Investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures investments are measured at cost and tested regularly for impairment. This test is carried out whenever there is an indication that the investment may be impaired. The method used is described in the section on “Impairment of non-financial assets”. When an impairment loss is required, this is recognised immediately in profit or loss. When the reasons for a previous impairment loss no longer exist, the carrying amount of the investment is restated to the extent of its original cost. Reversals of impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment If there is any indication that an intangible asset or an item of property, of non-financial plant and equipment is impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset assets is estimated to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested at least annually for impairment. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If a binding sales agreement does not exist, fair value is estimated using the observable prices of an active market, recent transactions or the best information available to reflect the amount the entity could obtain by disposing of the asset. Value in use is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset, net of taxes, 463 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 and, if reasonably determinable, from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Discounting is applied by using a post-tax discount rate which reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The assessment is made for individual assets or the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets from its continuing use (cash-generating unit). An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. If the reasons for the impairment loss are no longer valid, the impairment loss (except in the case of goodwill) is reversed and the adjustment is taken to profit or loss as a reversal of impairment losses. A reversal of impairment losses is recognised to the extent of the lower of the recoverable amount and original carrying amount less depreciation/ amortisation that would have been recognised had the impairment loss not been recognised. Inventories of goods are measured at the lower of average purchase cost and Inventories net realisable value. Cost includes the directly related costs and estimated of goods realisable value is determined using the replacement cost of the assets or similar assets. Any write-downs are eliminated in subsequent years when the reasons therefor are no longer valid. Contract work in progress consists of work performed net of progress Contract work billings issued to customers. When final payment of the consideration in progress and is made, the related progress billings and advances are recognised revenue from under “Operating revenue” in the statement of profit or loss, with the construction related variation in inventories. The provision for contractual risks contracts directly offsets inventories and is set up to cover possible charges and losses on contracts performed either directly by the company or as part of a joint venture. Contract work in progress is measured considering the consideration agreed with the customer and the stage of completion of the work. 464 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Revenue related to contract work in progress is recognised using the stage of completion method. The stage of completion is determined using the cost to cost method whereby the percentage of completion (the ratio between costs incurred and total estimated costs) is applied to the total estimated revenue. Given the technical complexity, size and length of time involved in completing contracts, the additional considerations are measured before an agreement is reached with the customer. Claims for additional considerations are considered when measuring contract work in progress if they have been substantially approved by the customer, or, if not yet approved by the customer, are supported by appraisals made by third party consultants and/or documentation prepared by contractual bodies (arbitration tribunals, dispute review boards, dispute adjudication boards, etc.). In the case of events that take place after the reporting date but before the separate financial statements are approved, which provide additional information about expected profits or losses on the contract, this additional information is considered when determining the contract revenue or costs to be incurred to complete the contract and for the recognition of any profits or losses. When total contract costs exceed total contract revenue, the loss to complete the contract is recognised as an expense immediately. The contract costs, included in the cost to cost calculation, may be classified as: • pre-operating costs, which include costs incurred during the startup stage of the contract, before construction starts, such as the costs of design and specific studies carried out for the contract; organisation and production start-up costs and building site startup costs. These pre-operating costs are included in the stage of completion calculation and in the cost to cost calculation once they have been incurred. During the initial stage of the contract, they are included in the carrying amount of contract work in progress, 465 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 if recoverable, without recognising any contract output when the contract profit or loss cannot be reliably estimated; • contract operating costs, which include those directly attributable to the contract (e.g., materials, subcontracting, labour, amortisation and depreciation, compulsory purchases, any directly attributable borrowing costs, etc.). They are recognised on an accruals basis and included in the calculation of the stage of completion; • post-operating costs, which include site dismantlement costs generally incurred after the contract has been closed to remove the installations (or entire sites) and to return the machinery or plant to the company's premises or transfer them to another site. This category also includes losses on materials no longer usable and the related transport costs. They are included in the contract estimate and, therefore, if incurred during the contract term, they are comprised in the calculation of the progress billings. Therefore, no specific accruals are made to the statement of profit or loss; • costs for services to be rendered after completion of the contract, which mainly relate to services rendered after the contract has been completed. They may include assistance and supervision provided in the early stages of use of the plant or scheduled maintenance, etc.. If the contract does not include specific additional considerations for these services and the contract may be “closed” for accounting purposes (contracts are usually closed once work is completed and the customer has accepted the end result), the costs to be incurred to render these services when the contract is closed in the accounting records should be estimated and provided for in the specific items. These costs are included in the calculation to determine the contract revenue. Closing inventories of real estate projects are those real estate areas Real estate developed with a view to selling them. They are measured at the projects lower of cost and estimated realisable value. Costs incurred consist of the consideration paid for purchasing the areas and related charges, construction costs and borrowing costs related to the project up to and not exceeding its completion. 466 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Financial assets Measurement and presentation of financial instruments are covered by IAS and liabilities 39 and IAS 32, respectively, while the disclosure is presented in accordance with IFRS 7. The financial instruments used by the company are classified as follows: financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets. Financial assets This category includes derivatives that do not meet hedge accounting or financial liabilities requirements. at fair value through profit or loss Fair value gains or losses on derivatives in this category are recognised as Financing income (costs) in profit or loss when they arise. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market. They are measured at amortised cost, as detailed further on, and any gains or losses arising therefrom are recognised as “Financing income (costs)” in profit or loss. This category includes the following items • Trade receivables and payables and other assets and liabilities Trade receivables and other assets are recognised at amortised cost, net of impairment losses determined on the basis of their estimated recoverable amount calculated by analysing each position and the total non-collection risk. If the collection date is postponed and exceeds normal collection times for the sector, these receivables are discounted. All factored receivables that do not meet the requirements for derecognition under IAS 39 continue to be recognised in the company's separate financial statements even when they have been legally transferred. They are thus included as assets and a financial liability of the same amount is recognised. 467 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Trade payables and other liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, allocating interest to the statement of profit or loss based on the effective interest rate, being the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through to the carrying amount of the related asset. • Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments with a term of less than three months. This item is shown in the statement of cash flows net of bank borrowings at the reporting date. • Loans and borrowings and bonds Loans and borrowings and bonds are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received less transaction costs. After initial recognition, loans are measured at amortised cost, whereby repayments are determined using the effective interest method with a rate which matches, at initial recognition, the expected cash flows with the initial carrying amount. Loan transaction costs are classified under liabilities decreasing the loan; amortised cost is calculated considering these costs and any discounts or premiums expected at settlement. The effects arising from the recognition at amortised cost are taken to “Financing income (costs)”. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with Held-to-maturity fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that the company investments has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. They are recognised at amortised cost and interest accrued thereon is taken to profit or loss under “Financial income” using the effective interest method. 468 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Available-for-sale Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial financial assets instruments that are not classified in the other categories. They mainly relate to consortia and consortium companies of which the company holds less than 20%. In accordance with IAS 39, such investments are stated as non-current assets measured at cost, adjusted for impairment, since their fair value cannot be determined. Dividend income from such financial instruments is recognised in profit or loss under financial income when the company is given the right to such dividend. Fair value The fair value of financial instruments has been estimated as follows: of financial instruments • The fair value of financial instruments traded on an active market is based on the market price at the reporting date. This method has been applied especially to listed financial instruments classified as “Available-for-sale financial assets” and financial instruments classified as “Held-to-maturity investments”. • The fair value of the derivatives classified as “Hedging derivatives” and “Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” is measured using the Discounted Cash Flow Model. With respect to interest rate swaps, future cash flows are estimated using the implicit forward rate of the market Euro curve at 31 December 2017 and 2016, while the forward exchange rate market prices at the relevant reporting date are used for currency forward transactions. • The fair value of loans and receivables is determined, for disclosure purposes in the notes, on the basis of the present value of their future cash flows discounted at a rate equal to the current interest rates applicable in the relevant markets and the average spread agreed by the company. 469 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 (a) Financial assets Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset (or, where applicable, part of a financial asset or parts of a and liabilities group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when: (i) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; (ii) the company retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in full and immediately; (iii) the company transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset and has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset and the related control. When the company has transferred the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards or has retained control, it continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of guaranteeing the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the initial carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of the consideration that the company could be required to pay. (b) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are derecognised when the underlying obligation is extinguished, cancelled or settled. When an existing financial liability is exchanged with another by the same lender at substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, this exchange or modification is treated as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss. If there is any indication that a financial asset is impaired, the Impairment recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the amount of financial of the impairment loss. assets 470 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Derivatives and Salini Impregilo has derivatives recognised at fair value when the hedging transactions related agreement is signed and for subsequent fair value changes. The treatment of the related fair value gains or losses changes depending on whether the conditions for hedge accounting are met, as described below. The company has derivatives to hedge currency and financial risks. At the inception of the transaction, it documents the hedging relationship, its risk management and strategy objectives in entering into the transaction, the hedging instrument and hedged item or transaction and the nature of the hedged risk. Moreover, at the inception of the transaction, and thereafter on an ongoing basis, the company documents whether or not the hedge meets the effectiveness requirements to offset its exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Based on the above-mentioned documentation, derivatives used for specific hedging purposes are classified and recognised as follows: (a) Fair value hedge If a derivative is designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability due to a specific risk that may affect profit or loss, the gain or loss deriving from the subsequent measurement of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss. The gain or loss on the hedged item, related to the hedged risk, changes the carrying amount of this item and is recognised in profit or loss. (b) Cash flow hedge If a derivative is designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in cash flows of an asset or liability or a highly probable transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective part of the gains or losses on the financial instrument is recognised in equity. The cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from equity to profit or loss in the same period in which the hedged transaction is recognised. The gain or loss related to a hedge or part of a hedge which has become ineffective is taken to profit or loss immediately. If a hedging instrument or a hedging relationship is closed, but the hedged transaction has not yet taken place, the cumulative gains and losses, recognised in equity up to then, are reclassified to profit or loss when the transaction takes place. 471 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 If it is unlikely the hedged transaction will take place, the unrealised gains and losses recognised in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. “Hedging purposes” are assessed in strategic terms. When they do not meet the requirements of IAS 39 for hedge accounting, the derivatives are classified as “Financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss”. • Post-employment benefits Employee benefits Post-employment benefits are recognised at the present value of the company's liability determined in line with ruling legislation and national and in-house labour agreements. The valuation, based on demographic, financial and turnover assumptions, is carried out by independent actuaries. The gains and losses resulting from the actuarial calculation are recognised in profit or loss if related to service costs and interest expense or in comprehensive income if relating to assets and liabilities. The 2007 Finance Act and related implementing decrees introduced significant changes to legislation governing Italian post-employment benefits, effective as from 1 January 2007. These include the option given to employees, to be exercised before 30 June 2007, of where to allocate their future benefits. Specifically, employees can opt to allocate them to selected pension funds or maintain them with the company, in which case, the latter shall pay the contributions to the treasury fund of INPS (the Italian social security institution). Following these changes, the Italian post-employment benefits accruing after the date of the employees’ decision and, in any case, after 30 June 2007, are considered part of a defined contribution plan and treated like all other social security contributions. 472 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 • Share-based payments Share-based payments are measured at fair value of the option at the grant date. This amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. This treatment is based on an assessment of the stock options that will effectively vest in favour of the qualifying employees. Fair value is determined using the share price at the grant date. Income taxes Current taxes are provided for using the enacted tax rates and laws ruling in Italy and other countries in which the company operates, including through its branches, based on the best estimate of the taxable profit for the year. Beginning from 2004, the company has joined the national tax consolidation system, as the consolidating party, which is regulated by the conditions set out in agreements drawn up by the participating companies. The agreements provide that tax losses transferred by the subsidiaries give rise to a benefit for them to the extent to which they would have been able to offset them even if the national tax consolidation system had not existed. Otherwise, the parent benefits, except for a partial payment to the companies transferring the losses, in proportion to the effective use in the national tax consolidation system. Moreover, the smaller taxes paid by Salini Impregilo as a result of its participation in the national tax consolidation system are prudently provided for when it is probable that a benefit for the used tax losses will be paid in the future to the subsidiaries that transferred them. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the basis of the temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and their carrying amount in the statement of financial position. Deferred tax assets are recognised when the company holds their recovery to be probable. 473 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and, to the extent necessary, is decreased when it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to use all or part of the related benefit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities, respectively. In the case of transactions recognised directly in equity, the related deferred tax asset or liability also affects equity. In accordance with IAS 37, the company makes accruals to provisions for Provisions for risks and charges when the following conditions exist: risks and charges • the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) at the reporting date as a result of a past event where an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; • it is probable that the obligation (through an outflow of resources) will have to be settled; • a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the time value is material and the obligation payment dates can be estimated reliably, the amount recognised as the provision equals the pre-tax future cash flows (i.e., forecast outflows) discounted at a rate that reflects the present market value and risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to discounting is recognised as a financial expense. When the expected cash flows are included in an estimate range with the same probability of occurrence, the median value is discounted to measure the liability. Provision for restructuring costs is recognised when the company has approved a detailed formal plan that has been implemented and communicated to the third parties involved. 474 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Translation criteria The translation criteria for foreign currency items adopted by the company for foreign currency are as follows: items • foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, excluding property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and equity investments measured at cost, are translated at the closing spot rate with any exchange gains or losses taken to the statement of profit or loss; • non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are recognised at historical cost denominated in the foreign currency and translated using the historical exchange rate; • revenue and costs related to foreign currency transactions are recognised in profit or loss at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction; • any material effects deriving from changes in exchange rates after the reporting date are disclosed in the notes. The foreign branches’ functional currency is the Euro, as it is the primary currency they use in their operations. Non-current assets Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if held for sale and their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather discontinued than through continuing use. operations Assets held for sale are recognised as such when the following events take place: • signing of a binding sales agreement; • approval and communication of a formal sales plan by directors. In order to be correctly measured, the assets shall be: • available for immediate sale in their present condition, • subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets, and • the sale must be highly probable and expected to take place within twelve months. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 475 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or classified as held for sale and that meets any of the following criteria: i) it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; ii) it is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or iii) it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a plan to resell. The profit or loss from discontinued operations is disclosed separately in the statement of profit or loss. As required by paragraph 34 of IFRS 5 Noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the corresponding prior year figures are reclassified accordingly. Revenue is measured to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits Revenue will flow to the company and the related amount can be determined recognition reliably. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the company has shipped the goods and has transferred all the material risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer. Revenue from construction contracts is recognised as provided for in the related Standard, described below. When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the reporting date based on the ratio of the costs incurred up to the reporting date to the total estimated contract costs, unless this is held to not represent the stage of completion of the contract. Changes in the contract and price revisions are recognised to the extent that they are reasonably certain. Revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recovered. Contract costs are recognised as an expense in the year in which they are incurred. Interest income Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis, considering the principal and applicable effective interest rate, i.e., the rate that discounts the estimated future inflows over the expected life of the financial asset to return it to its carrying amount. 476 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Dividends Dividends are recognised when the investors' right to receive payment arises in line with local ruling legislation. Significant accounting estimates Preparation of financial statements and the related notes in accordance with the IFRS requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and financial statements disclosures. The estimates are used to: • determine amortisation and depreciation (see the “Property, plant and machinery”, “Leased property, plant and equipment”, and “Other intangible assets” paragraphs of the “ Accounting policies” section); • recognise impairment losses (see the “Impairment of non-financial assets” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise employee benefits (see the “Employee benefits” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise taxes (see the “Income taxes” paragraph of the “ Accounting policies” section); • recognise provisions for risks and charges (see the “Provisions for risks and charges” paragraph of the “ Accounting policies” section); • determine total contract costs and the related stage of completion (see the “Contract work in progress and revenue from construction contracts” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section). A significant part of the company's activities is typically performed on the basis of contracts which provide that a specific consideration is agreed when the contract is awarded. This implies that the profits on these contracts may undergo change compared to the original estimates depending on the recoverability of greater expenses and/or costs the company may incur during performance of such contracts. The actual results may differ from those estimated due to uncertainties underlying the assumptions and the conditions on which the estimates are based. 477 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Fundamental assumptions about the future and other reasons for uncertainty when making the estimates at the reporting date that may lead to material adjustments to the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities are described in the specific section of the directors’ report on the main risk factors and uncertainties. The company estimated the impairment losses on the Venezuelan assets Impairment in line with the guidance given in IAS 39 Financial assets: recognition and Venezuela measurement. Independent experts assisted management to prepare a discounted cash flow model based on the following inputs: a) expected reduction in the assets’ nominal amount; b) expected duration of the restructuring process; c) expected repayment period after completion of the restructuring process; d) expected reimbursement method. Management estimated the above inputs, including the expected reduction in the assets’ nominal amount, using information obtained from public sources, whose validity is confirmed by their use in many academic papers and international organisations’ studies. Specifically, it used the analyses of Professor Trebesch’s analysis (June 2011), “Sovereign Default and Crisis Resolution” for the expected reduction in the assets’ nominal amount. The sample used is based on 180 cases of sovereign default from 1970 to 2010. With respect to the expected duration of the restructuring process, the assumptions are based on empirical data in Professor Trebesch’s analysis, which considers a sample of 90 cases from 1980 to 2007 and divides the timing into stages (start, negotiation and implementation, where the last stage consists of either announcement of an agreement with the creditors or the renegotiation of bonds on the regulated market). Assumptions about the expected repayment period after the crisis has been resolved were based on Moody's recent study Sovereign Default and Recovery Rates, 1983-2016” as well as that of M. Tomz and M. L. J. Wright (2012), “Empirical Research on Sovereign Debt and Default”. 478 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 With respect to the fourth input, the expected reimbursement method, the model assumes that repayment will either take place (i) in equal instalments or (ii) in increasing instalments. Management used the assumptions to prepare a cash flow discount model based on the original effective rate of return of 9.7%. Given the high level of uncertainty implicit in this type of valuation, the company engaged a second independent expert to assess the reasonableness of the results obtained from the use of the above model and its reasonableness was confirmed. Scope of the Joint Operation separate financial The company is involved in the following main joint operations: Civil statements Work Group (Saudi Arabia), Arge Tulfes Pfons (Austria) and South Al Mutlaa (Kuwait). Salini Impregilo has a 52% interest in the first joint operation, which is engaged in the civil works for the Riyadh metro. The second joint operation is 49% held by the company and is engaged in the construction of the last section of the Brenner-Innsbruck tunnel. South Al Mutlaa was incorporated in 2016 and is 55% held by Salini Impregilo. It is constructing primary urbanisation works to build a new residential area in a 12 thousand hectares site located 40 km northwest of Kuwait City as part of the South Al Mutlaa Housing Project. The above operations are governed by joint control arrangements as resolutions of the governing bodies require a unanimous vote. They are structured as separate vehicles, guaranteeing transparency of their rights and obligations with respect to Salini Impregilo S.p.A.. 479 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT 2016 (€'000) Italy Abroad Total Revenue 359,576 2,614,572 2,974,148 Other income 28,167 74,345 102,512 Total revenue 387,743 2,688,917 3,076,660 STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT 2017 (€'000) Italy Abroad Total Revenue 320,080 2,462,047 2,782,127 Other income 27,572 77,239 104,811 Total revenue 347,652 2,539,286 2,886,938 480 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2016 BY BUSINESS SEGMENT (€'000) Italy Abroad Total Net non-current assets 500,003 932,780 1,432,783 Provision for risks (65,177) (6,899) (72,076) Post-employment benefits and employee benefits (8,675) (4,127) (12,802) Net tax assets (liabilities) 132,908 (23,999) 108,909 Working capital 119,322 263,012 382,334 Net invested capital 678,381 1,160,767 1,839,148 Equity 1,007,428 Net financial position (indebtedness) 831,720 Total financial resources 1,839,148 STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2017 BY BUSINESS SEGMENT (€'000) Italy Abroad Total Net non-current assets 459,750 933,341 1,393,091 Provision for risks (28,909) (29,993) (58,902) Post-employment benefits and employee benefits (7,647) (3,785) (11,432) Net tax assets (liabilities) 237,956 (30,312) 207,644 Working capital 261,080 (140,540) 120,540 Net invested capital 922,230 728,711 1,650,941 Equity 878,945 Net financial position (indebtedness) 771,996 Total financial resources 1,650,941 481 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION 4.

The latter results from the offsetting of the provision relating to the investment in Grupo Unido por el Canal with the injections for the same company made during the year. “Acquisitions and capital injections” show the injections made for the joint venture Salini Impregilo Healy of €1.2 million. “Disinvestments and liquidations” mainly relate to the winding up of Italian consortia and the related reimbursement of the company’s share of their consortium funds. 487 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 The item “Reclassifications” principally refers to the offsetting of the provision relating to certain investees classified under liabilities. “Impairment losses/reversals of impairment losses” mainly include the impairment losses on the investments in HCE (€15.5 million), CSC Impresa Costruzioni S.A. (€7.5 million), the subsidiary Fibe S.p.A. (€2.4 million) and Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. (€1.3 million). These impairment losses have been offset by the reversals of impairment losses, mainly on the investment in Grupo Unidos por el Canal (€32.8 million). The impairment test of the item “Equity investments”, carried out also to assess the need for any reversals of previously recognised impairment losses, has been performed on an individual basis, considering each investee’s specific operating objectives. Based on such approach, the item can be analysed as follows: (€’000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Investments in SPEs 201,396 227,222 25,826 Other investments 928,449 915,283 (13,166) Total 1,129,845 1,142,505 12,660 Special purpose entities (SPEs) are legal entities set up specifically and solely to carry out long term construction contracts that Salini Impregilo is not expected to carry out directly and in which it has an interest equal to its share of the tender. These entities have a corporate structure compliant with the customers’ requirements as communicated during the tender procedure and considering the specific legal context of the country in which the contract will be performed. They are classified depending on whether they are: (i) SPEs, the profit or loss of which are allocated to their venturers in line with their interests as provided for by law (i.e., Italian-based consortia and consortium companies which operate on a “recharges of costs” basis), and (ii) other SPEs for which this allocation is not provided for by law. Due to the periodic allocation of the contract profit or loss to the venturers, the SPEs in item (i) always substantially reach breakeven 488 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 point. Any losses recorded in the contracts performed by these entities are recognised by the venturers upon allocation of the contract profits and losses. For the SPEs in item (ii), the existence of any losses should be considered in the separate financial statements of Salini Impregilo as their contract profit or loss is included in the consolidated financial statements only. The contracts performed by these SPEs are therefore considered when testing the company’s investment for impairment. Specifically, the SPEs’ financial statements, which include the estimated contract profit or loss and are prepared in accordance with the IFRS as interpreted by the Group’s accounting policies, are considered as they show the entity’s estimated cash flows. The impairment losses recognised in 2017 in the provision for risks on equity investments adjusted the existing provisions referred to the SPEs performing the Constructora Ariguani (Colombia) contract (€5.2 million) and Cigla Constructora (Brazil) contract (€0.7 million). The company also partially reversed the impairment losses previously recognised on the investments in the SPEs working on the GUPC (Panama) contract (€32.8 million) and Salini Impregilo Salini Insaat Jv (Turkey) contract (€1.0 million). Moreover, an additional impairment loss was recognised on the investment in the newco HCE Costruzioni S.p.A. (€15.5 million, including its 2017 loss). Fisia Italimpianti substantially broke even in 2017, with equity of €3.2 million, compared to the investment’s carrying amount of €40.2 million. Its order backlog approximated €100 million at the reporting date and principally relates to two contracts, namely the reverse osmosis desalination plant in Saudi Arabia and the water treatment plant in Turkey. Supported by independent experts who carried out an independent business review, the company tested its investment in Fisia Italimpianti for impairment on the basis of the 2018-2022 business plan approved by the subsidiary’s board of directors. No indicators of impairment were found. 489 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Salini Impregilo used the unlevered version of the discounted cash flow method to calculate the investment’s value in use. The main valuation parameters used were: • long-term growth rate: 0% (0% in 2016); • discount rate (WACC): 10.5% (11.5% in 2016). The company also performed sensitivity analyses considering the possible effect of changes in the discount rate (+/-1%). It did not identify any elements that would have required recognition of an impairment loss. The directors adopted the following hypothetical assumptions in the 2018-2022 business plan, used to extrapolate the expected future cash flows assumed for impairment testing purposes: assumption about development of demand for projects: the subsidiary’s main market is the Middle East, where investments are expected to pick up after the strong contraction seen in recent years. Oil prices drive the local economy and the recent reversal in these prices should facilitate an upturn in business. Moreover, throughout the Middle East and especially in Saudi Arabia, projects no longer postponable are being launched; thanks to its global sales network, Salini Impregilo Group helped Fisia to identify its targets, especially in South America, where the Group historically carries out its operations. Moreover, it may also support Fisia financially, providing suitable guarantees where necessary. It cannot be excluded that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that would require changes to the valuations made. The subsidiary Fibe recorded a loss of €2.1 million for 2017, while its equity was €37.5 million at the reporting date. Given that the subsidiary is inactive and only manages the outstanding disputes related to the USW Campania projects, its assets and liabilities are the main drivers of the value generation process. Accordingly, its carrying amount is in line with its equity at the reporting date, including the loss of €2.4 million. 490 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The subsidiary Salini Impregilo US Holding INC recorded a loss of €0.8 million for 2017 and equity of €371.6 million at the reporting date, while the investment’s carrying amount is €468.4 million. The investment’s recoverable amount has been calculated using the cash flow projections set out in the 2018-2021 four-year plan prepared and approved by the subsidiary’s management. The main valuation parameters used were: long-term growth rate: 1.9%; post-tax discount rate: 7.9%. The company has adopted the discount rate calculated based on the market cost of money and the asset sector’s specific risk (Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC). Specifically, the company considered the return rate on long-term government bonds and the average capital structure of a basket of comparable companies. The CGU’s recoverable amount has been calculated using the cash flow projections set out in the 2018-2021 four-year plan prepared and approved by management. The terminal value is based on a sustainable profit assumption, from which stable long-term operating cash flows have been estimated, on a going concern basis. The company tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting date, which showed that the CGU’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount (net invested capital). The company also performed sensitivity analyses considering the possible effect of changes in the parameters used to calculate the recoverable amount (a 0.5% increase or decrease in the growth rate and in the discount rate, respectively), which would not lead to a significantly different outcome. The test did not show any indicators of impairment. The subsidiary Impregilo International Infrastructures NV showed equity of €145.9 million at the reporting date, while the investment’s carrying amount is €170 million. The company tested certain equity investments and related loan assets recognised in the subsidiary’s 491 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 separate financial statements at 31 December 2017 for impairment, as they make up the subsidiary’s actual investment in the tested companies, in order to test the subsidiary’s carrying amount in Salini Impregilo’s separate financial statements. The investment’s recoverable amount was €168.7 million, €1.3 million smaller than its carrying amount. Accordingly, Salini Impregilo recognised an impairment loss of €1.3 million to align the investment’s carrying amount with its recoverable amount. As regards the other investments in smaller companies, their carrying amount has been adjusted to Salini Impregilo’s share of the investees’ net assets as recognised in their financial statements at 31 December 2017. These impairment losses, totalling €14.4 million, specifically affected CSC Impresa Costruzioni Sa (€7.5 million) and Salini Polska SP Zoo Ltd (€6.5 million), the latter recognised in the provision for risks on equity investments. 492 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 7. Non-current financial assets This item and related changes may be broken down as follows: (€’000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Other financial assets 15,848 12,899 (2,949) Loans and receivables group companies 67,141 67,141 Loans and receivables third parties 3,952 450 (3,502) Total 19,800 80,490 60,690 The other financial assets decreased by €2.9 million to €12.9 million at the reporting date. They are made up of unlisted guaranteed-return securities which mature after one year. They comprise units in the fund financing Yuma (Colombia). The decrease is a result of fair value and exchange losses recognised during the year. Loans and receivables group companies increased by €67.1 million due to: • the reclassification of the €10.5 million loan disbursed to the SPE M4 S.p.A to non-current assets. The company is constructing Line 4 of the Milan metro; • the reclassification of €56.6 million due from the Venezuelan branch (€113.3 million gross of a €56.6 million allowance for impairment at the reporting date) to non-current assets. The “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report and section 3 “Impairment Venezuela” of these notes provide more information. Loans and receivables third parties decreased from €4.0 million by €3.5 million, principally due to the reclassification to the amount due from Prime System KZ Ltd to current assets (currently duly collected). 493 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 8. Deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities amount to €125.7 million and €19.3 million, respectively.

Deferred tax liabilities of €19.3 million include €19.0 million relating to the provision for the national tax consolidation scheme. The provision represents the company’s liability with its subsidiaries that have transferred their losses as part of the IRES national tax consolidation scheme as per article 117 and subsequent articles of the Consolidated Income Tax Act as per the regulations signed when they joined the scheme.

They relate to the real estate project (net of the related allowance of €7.8 million) for the construction of a trade point in Lombardy for which a dispute is pending about the zoning provisions of the area on which the property stands. Based on its legal advisors’ and consultants’ opinion, the company deems that the carrying amount can be recovered through the real estate project or, alternatively, through compensation for the damage incurred due to non-authorisation of the zoning of the area by the competent authorities. Finished products and goods and Raw materials, consumables and supplies The carrying amount of these items totals €152.5 million (31 December 2016: €169.2 million) and mainly relates to goods to be used for foreign contracts, including those in Ethiopia (€114.1 million), Sierra Leone (€6.3 million), Venezuela (€15.7 million) and Kuwait for the construction of primary urbanisation works to build a new residential area (€3.3 million). 10. Contract work in progress Contract work in progress amounts to €1,125.8 million at year end, up on the previous year-end figure of €1,010.2 million.

The increase mainly relates to continuation of the industrial operations carried out for the new contracts for the construction of a hydroelectric power plant in Tajikistan, the Meydan investments in infrastruture project in the United Arab Emirates, the “Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam” (GERD) project in Ethiopia and the high speed/capacity contracts in Italy. The increase is only partially offset by the impairment losses recognised on some assets related to the construction of infrastructure in Venezuela in the second half of 2017. The “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report and section 3 “Impairment Venezuela” of these notes provide more information.

The balance includes amounts due from customers for invoices issued and for work performed and approved by customers but still to be invoiced. The decrease is principally due to the impairment losses recognised on receivables from Venezuelan customers and the reduction in receivables relating to contracts in Ethiopia. The €127.5 million increase in the allowance for impairment includes impairment losses on receivables from Venezuelan customers.

This item includes: • €30.6 million due from the Argentine Republic as compensation for damage following the favourable award previously issued and confirmed by the Buenos Aires Arbitration Tribunal on 24 January 2014. This award settled the proceedings commenced by the shareholders of the investee Aguas del Gran Buenos Aires S.A. in liquidation (operator) against the Argentine Republic. The company expects to collect the compensation in 2018 as a result of the negotiations; • €39.6 million due from some of the company’s partners of joint ventures, mainly for the works for the housing project in South Al Mutlaa (Kuwait). Advances to suppliers decreased by a net €4.0 million to €60.9 million, mainly due to absorption of advances made in previous years for the contracts in Saudi Arabia and Uganda, partly offset by advances made for the hydroelectric plants in Tajikistan and Georgia. 503 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 “Other group companies and other related parties” increased by €6.7 million to €74.0 million at the reporting date, mainly as a result of the rise in amounts due from the Argentine entity and the US entity engaged in the environmental restoration in the Buenos Aires area and the construction of the Gerald Desmond Bridge, respectively, offset by the decrease in the amount due from the entities operating in Qatar. Prepayments and accrued income amount to €27.0 million, slightly up on the prior year-end balance, principally relating to the Rogun hydroelectric plant in Tajikistan, offset by the decrease mainly recorded in relation to the Line 3 of the Riyadh metro contract in Saudi Arabia.

Liquidity management is designed to ensure the financial independence of ongoing contracts, considering the structure of the consortia and SPEs, which may limit the availability of financial resources to achievement of the related projects.

Disclosures about the individual items are set out below. 506 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Share capital At 31 December 2017, the company's fully paid-up share capital amounts to €544,740,000. It comprises 493,788,182 shares, including 492,172,691 ordinary shares and 1,615,491 savings shares, all without a nominal amount. Savings shares issued pursuant to the law do not carry voting rights, have preference dividend and capital repayment rights and can be bearer shares, subject to the provisions of article 2354.2 of the Italian Civil Code. Upon the shareholder’s requests and at their own expense, they can be converted into registered shares and vice versa. Savings shares held by directors, statutory auditors and CEOs are registered. Except when the company’s by-laws or relevant legislation provide for otherwise, savings shares give the holders the same rights as those of ordinary shares. Holders of savings shares do not have the right to attend the company’s shareholders’ meetings or to request that they are called. The special savings shareholders’ meeting is regulated by law. When reserves are distributed, the savings shares have the same rights as ordinary shares. Upon dissolution of the company, savings shares bear preference rights to capital repayment, up to €5.2 per share. When shares are grouped or split (as well as when capital transactions are carried out and as necessary in order to protect the savings shareholders’ rights in the case the shares have a nominal amount), the above fixed amount is adjusted accordingly. Profit for the year as per the financial statements is allocated as follows: a) 5% to the legal reserve, up to the legally-required amount; b) to savings shares, to the extent of 5% of €5.2 per share (i.e., €0.26 per share). If a dividend lower than 5% of €5.2 per share (i.e., €0.26 per share) is paid one year, the difference is taken as an increase in the preferred dividend of the following two years; c) the residual amount, to all shareholders in such a way as to allocate to savings shares a total dividend which is 2% of €5.2 per share (i.e., €0.104 per share) greater than that distributed to ordinary shares, except when the shareholders decide to allocate an amount to the extraordinary reserves or for other uses. 507 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Details on the possible use of equity items and uses in prior years are summarised below: Summary of use in the previous three years (€’000) Amount Possible use Available To cover Other (A, B, C) portion losses Share capital 544,740 Equity-related reserves: Share premium reserve 120,798 A, B 120,798 Other reserves: Legal reserve 106,551 B 106,551 Reserve for treasury shares (7,677) Share capital increase related charges (3,970) Unavailable actuarial reserve (352) Unavailable LTI reserve 6,344 Translation reserve (3,189) Negative goodwill 146,813 A, B, C 146,813 Total other reserves 244,520 Retained earnings 60,075 A, B, C 60,075 Total 970,133 434,237 Non-distributable portion 255,862 Residual distributable portion 178,374 A: capital increase B: to cover losses C: dividends The share premium reserve cannot be distributed until the legal reserve reaches 20% of the share capital. 508 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Other reserves This item is broken down as follows: (€’000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Legal reserve 103,321 106,551 3,230 Negative goodwill 146,813 146,813 Reserve for treasury shares (7,677) (7,677) LTI reserve 4,241 6,344 2,103 Reserve for share capital increase related (3,970) (3,970) charges Total other reserves 242,728 248,061 5,333 Legal reserve This reserve underwent the following changes: (€’000) 31 December 2015 101,534 Allocation of profit 1,787 31 December 2016 103,321 (€’000) 31 December 2016 103,321 Allocation of profit 3,230 31 December 2017 106,551 Reserve for treasury shares The reserve for treasury shares is unchanged from 31 December 2016.

(now part of Salini Impregilo S.p.A.) issued senior unsecured bonds for a nominal amount of €400 million to be redeemed on 1 August 2018, intended for international institutional investors. The bonds, which have a minimum denomination of €100,000 and an annual gross coupon of 6.125%, were placed with primary international institutional investors at a price of €99.477. The issue is secured by covenants that establish the requirement for the borrower to maintain certain financial and equity ratios which, at the date of this Annual Report, are fully respected. On 24 June 2016, the company announced the placement of bonds with a nominal amount of €428.3 million reserved for institutional investors. They have a fixed rate coupon of 3.75%. The bonds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange in Dublin with a redemption date of 24 June 2021. Part of the bonds, with a nominal amount of €128.3 million, was assigned to the holders of the senior unsecured bonds that adhered to the company’s offer. The exchange ratio applied to the existing bonds was 109.75%. After the exchange, the outstanding senior unsecured bonds amounted to €283 million. The company used the proceeds of €300 million from the new issue, not used for the bond exchange, to repay part of the bridge financing taken out to acquire Lane Group. The company assessed the continuity of the previous bonds (exchanged) with the bonds placed on 24 June 2016.

The new bonds are part of a single series with the previous €428 million issued on 24 June 2016 and redeemable on 24 June 2021, bringing the total bond issue to €600 million. The transaction has strengthened the company’s debt profile, extended its average debt repayment dates by more than one year and increased its fixed rate debt component.

It listed the bonds on the Irish Stock Exchange for redemption on 26 October 2024.

Post-employment benefits and employee benefits At 31 December 2017, the company's liability due to all its employees determined using the criteria set out in IAS 19 is €11.4 million. The balance mainly consists of the Italian post-employment benefits (TFR). At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the liability for post-employment benefits is the outstanding amount at the reform effective date, net of benefits paid up to the reporting dates. The liability is considered part of a defined benefit plan under IAS 19 and has, therefore, been subjected to actuarial valuation. The valuation, performed with the assistance of an independent expert, was based on the following rates: turnover rate: 7.25%; advance payment rate: 3%; inflation rate: 1.5%. The company has used the Iboxx AA Corporate index for the Eurozone, which has an average financial duration in line with the fund being valued, to calculate the discount rate. Changes in the item are as follows: 31 December Accruals Payments Contributions Net Other changes 31 2015 paid to INPS actuarial and change in December (€'000) treasury and losses scope 2016 other funds Post-employment benefits 12,090 6,404 (5,808) (2,972) 144 2,944 12,802 and employee benefits 31 December Accruals Payments Contributions Net Other changes 31 2016 paid to INPS actuarial and change in December (€'000) treasury and gains scope 2017 other funds Post-employment benefits 12,802 7,873 (8,022) (2,155) (146) 1,080 11,432 and employee benefits 523 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 The net decrease in post-employment benefits in 2017 is due to both payments made during the year and contributions transferred to the INPS treasury and other funds, as well as the accrual for the year and the actuarial gains and losses recognised in the specific equity reserve, as required by IAS 19. Other changes are mainly due to exchange differences. An increase or decrease of 0.25% in the discount rate used to calculate the liability at 31 December 2017 would have had a negative or positive effect of around €39 thousand or approximately €40 thousand, respectively. A similar increase or decrease at 31 December 2016 would have had a negative or positive effect of approximately €58 thousand, respectively. 22. Provisions for risks At 31 December 2017, these provisions amount to €58.9 million.

Changes are due to: capital transactions of €16.9 million, mainly related to Salini Australia Pty Ltd (€12.0 million); impairment losses of €19.7 million, mostly related to Salini Polska L.t.d. Liability Co (€6.5 million) and Constructora Ariguani Sas (€5.2 million). 525 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 The €1.1 million decrease in other provisions is mostly a result of: (i) accruals of €1.3 million for legal and labour disputes; (ii) utilisations/releases of €1.7 million, as the events for which the accruals were made took place; (iii) the change in the scope due to the merger of SGF INC during the year. Other provisions include the following: (€'000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Ongoing litigation 9,479 9,642 163 Building segment litigation 795 795 Tax and social security litigation 1,500 1,500 Other 2,439 1,185 (1,254) Total 14,213 13,122 (1,091) The provision for ongoing litigation mainly relates to foreign contracts completed in previous years. The provision for building segment litigation was originally set up by Impregilo Edilizia e Servizi, merged into Salini Impregilo S.p.A. (then Impregilo S.p.A.) in previous years. More information about the main disputes is available in the Main risk factors and uncertainties section in the Directors' report. 526 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 23. Progress payments and advances on contract work in progress This item, included in “Current liabilities” amounts to €1,444.5 million, up €197.9 million on the figure at 31 December 2016.

The most significant contracts contributing to the negative WIP are those for the Koysha dam in Ethiopia, the Riyadh metro Line 3 in Saudi Arabia, Lima M2 in Peru and the Brenner twin railway tunnels between Tulfes and Innsbruck in Austria. The most significant contractual advances at the reporting date related to the Rogun dam in Tajikistan (€266.6 million) the Koysha dam in Ethiopia (€194.3 million), the Riyadh Metro Line 3 in Saudia Arabia (€137.8 million), the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Gerd) in Ethiopia (€118.3 million) and the head office (mostly for the COCIV contract and IRICAV). The Directors' report provides more information about the performance of these contracts and their progress. 528 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The following table shows the contribution by geographical segment of negative WIP and contractual advances: (€’000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Italy 108,045 141,078 33,033 EU (excluding Italy) 23,228 28,968 5,740 Non-EU 15,979 17,260 1,281 Asia 92,478 266,573 174,095 Middle East 316,574 266,918 (49,656) Africa 653,664 681,100 27,436 South America 36,580 42,584 6,004 Total 1,246,548 1,444,481 197,933 24.

Trade payables to group companies and other related parties decreased by €130.2 million to €549.1 million. The most significant variations are due to: a decrease of €110.1 million in the payable to COCIV, due to offsetting with trade receivables and new invoices issued during the year; a decrease of €11.9 million in the payable to Metro B1, as a result of payments. 529 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 25.

The decrease mainly relates to the payment of the remuneration and a reduction in the workforce for contracts that are nearing completion; • liabilities with group companies and related parties of €25.7 million, which decreased by €4.2 million, mainly as a result of the reduction in the liability to the investee Metro B engaged in the construction of the Rome metro, offset by the increase in liabilities with joint venturers in Argentina and Venezuela; • “Other” of €24.8 million (31 December 2016: €39.1 million); the €14.3 million decrease is mainly due to the settlement of liabilities with the company’s partners of the joint venture set up to build the hydroelectric power plant in South Africa (€8.2 million) following the normal continuation of activities and other liabilities related to the head office; • accrued expenses and deferred income of €6.9 million, as follows: (€'000) 31 December 31 December Variation 2016 2017 Accrued expenses: Other 5,879 1,590 (4,289) Total accrued expenses 5,879 1,590 (4,289) Deferred income: Provision of services 8,277 5,351 (2,926) Total deferred income 8,277 5,351 (2,926) Total 14,156 6,941 (7,215) 531 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Accrued expenses and deferred income mostly consist of portions of costs not yet paid for contract work in progress. The €7.2 million decrease is principally attributable to the Salerno Reggio Calabria project and the hydroelectric project in Namibia. 27. Guarantees, commitments, risks and contingent liabilities Guarantees and commitments The key guarantees given by the company are set out below: • contractual sureties: these total €7,449.3 million and are given to customers as performance bonds, to guarantee advances, withholdings and involvement in tenders for all ongoing contracts. In turn, the company has guarantees given by its subcontractors; • sureties for credit: they amount to €771.2 million and relate to subsidiaries (€454.4 million), associates (€247.0 million) and other group companies (€15.3 million). The residual amount of €54.5 million relates to sureties granted on behalf of Salini Impregilo; • sureties granted for export credit: €157.2 million; • other personal guarantees: they amount to €45.9 million and comprise guarantees related to customs and tax obligations and other commitments (€1,385.8 million); • collateral related to a lien on the remaining shares of the SPE M4 (€4.8 million). Litigation and contingent liabilities The company is involved in civil and administrative proceedings that are not expected to have a significant negative effect on its separate financial statements, based on the information currently available and the existing provisions for risks. The “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report provides information about the main disputes. 532 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Tax disputes With respect to the principal dispute with the tax authorities: • as described in detail in previous reports, the dispute about the assessment notice challenging the tax treatment of impairment losses and losses on the sale of assets recognised by the company in 2003 is currently before the Supreme Court, following the tax authorities' appeal. The main issue about the sale by Impregilo S.p.A. of its investment in the Chilean operator Costanera Norte SA to Impregilo International Infrastructures NV was cancelled by the Milan Regional Tax Commission on 11 September 2009 (higher assessed tax base of €70 million); • the company's appeal about reimbursement of tax assets with a nominal amount of €12.3 million acquired from third parties as part of previous non-recurring transactions is still pending before the Supreme Court; • a dispute related to 2005 about the technique used to realign the carrying amount of equity investments as per article 128 of Presidential decree no. 917/86 (greater assessed tax base of €4.2 million) is still pending before the first level court; • with respect to another dispute again related to 2005 and the costs of a joint venture set up in Venezuela for which the greater assessed tax base is €6.6 million, the Regional Tax Commission filed its ruling entirely in the company's favour on 19 May 2015; the tax authorities appealed to the Supreme Court on 28 December 2015 challenging the procedure while stating that the findings do not relate to the appeal. The company has filed its defence brief; • the company was notified of: (i) a payment order from the tax authorities for Icelandic taxes of €4.6 million, which was cancelled after the first and second level sentences in its favour; the tax authorities appealed to the Supreme Court on 11 May 2017 and the company presented its defence brief, and (ii) a payment bill for the same taxes which the company appealed. It won again both at first and second level. On 18 January 2016, the tax authorities presented their appeal to the Supreme Court and the company filed its defence brief; 533 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 • as already commented on in previous reports, on 29 December 2016, the company received two assessment reports for IRES and IRAP purposes covering 2011 and alleging unpaid IRES taxes of €21.2 million and IRAP taxes of €2.9 million. Both these reports were based on a preliminary assessment report issued by the tax police and notified to the company on 27 September 2016. They refer to: (i) for a minimum part, the alleged applicability of the “transfer price” regulations to sureties given free of charge on behalf of foreign subsidiaries, for which the tax police asserted that the normal commission income would have been €0.7 million; (ii) the non-deductibility of costs of €36.4 million incurred to purchase goods and services to perform works for the Abu Dhabi and Panama contracts, both of which countries have a preferential tax regime, due to the alleged insufficient evidence that the suppliers carried out commercial activities in those countries and that the related purchases were in Salini Impregilo’s effective interest. During the mutually-agreed settlement procedure, the tax authorities revised their position and, after the discussions, the related agreements were signed on 5 June 2017 settling the dispute with payment of €300 thousand by the company. Moreover, the Milan unit of the tax police completed its tax audit of the IRES, IRAP and VAT paid in 2012 on 27 March 2017 and the inspectors reported the same findings as 2011. The tax authorities again firstly sent a questionnaire followed by assessment notices for IRES and IRAP audits, which did not include all the assessments proposed by the inspectors. The company did not challenge the notices and paid the related amount (€300 thousand); • on 12 December 2017, the company received an adjustment notice from the tax authorities requesting payment of registration tax of approximately €1.3 million in addition to a fine of the same amount on the sale of a business unit to Imprepar (which also received an identical adjustment notice). This business unit had no future profits and held investments in consortium companies in liquidation or inactive and the related assets and liabilities related to contracts that have been completed or are nearing completion due to Imprepar's know how in managing this type of business. 534 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 The company deems that the tax authorities' allegations are ungrounded and has promptly appealed against the notices to the competent tax commission. With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its legal advisors, the company believes that it has acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. After the tax audit into 2011, 2012 and 2013 for the Ethiopian branch, the inspectors reported findings about the measurement of revenue from contract work in progress and the deduction of some costs. During the audit, the branch negotiated a significant decrease in these findings and the settlement of the findings for all three years. Icelandic branch With respect to the completed contract for the construction of a hydroelectric plant in Karanjukar (Iceland), a dispute arose with the Icelandic tax authorities in 2004 about the party required to act as the withholding agent for the remuneration of foreign temporary workers at the building site. Salini Impregilo was firstly wrongly held responsible for the payment of the withholdings on this remuneration, which it therefore paid. Following the definitive ruling of the first level court, the company's claims were fully satisfied. Nevertheless, the local authorities subsequently commenced a new proceeding for exactly the same issue. The Supreme Court rejected the company's claims in its ruling handed down in February 2010, which is blatantly contrary to the previous ruling issued in 2007 on the same matter by the same judiciary authority. The company had expected to be refunded the unduly paid withholdings of €6.9 million (at the original exchange rate). After the last ruling, the company took legal action at international level (appeal presented to the EFTA Surveillance Authority on 22 June 2010) and, as far as possible, again at local level as it deems that the last ruling issued by the Icelandic Supreme Court is unlawful both in respect of local legislative and international agreements regulating trade relations between the EFTA countries and international 535 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 conventions which do not allow application of discriminatory treatments to foreign parties (individuals and companies) working in other EFTA countries. On 8 February 2012, the EFTA Surveillance Authority sent the Icelandic government a communication notifying the infraction of the free exchange of services and requested the government to provide its observations about this. In April 2013, the EFTA Surveillance Authority issued its documented opinion finding the Icelandic legislation to be inconsistent with the regulations covering trade relations between the member countries with respect to the regulations for the above dispute. It asked that Iceland take steps to comply with these regulations. 536 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 28.

Reference should be made to the section on accounting policies for information on the fair value measurement of these items. Specifically, the fair value of the items is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Risk management Salini Impregilo is exposed to financial risks, including the following: • market risk deriving from the company’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate fluctuations; • credit risk deriving from the company’s exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ non-compliance with their obligations; • liquidity risk deriving from the risk that the financial resources necessary to meet obligations may not be available at the agreed terms and deadlines. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises currency risk and interest rate risk. Currency risk Salini Impregilo's international presence entails its exposure to currency risk arising from fluctuations in the value of trade and financial transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of the individual companies, branches or joint operations. The company has adopted a currency risk management strategy to mitigate this risk based on the guidelines described in the Risk management system section of the Directors’ report to which reference is made. 539 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Currency risk at 31 December 2017 mainly related to the following currencies: • US dollar (USD) • Ethiopian birr (BIRR) • Tajikistani somoni (TJS) • United Arab Emirates dirham (AED) • Qatari riyal (QAR) The company considers monetary assets and liabilities of the companies, branches or joint operations in currencies other than its functional currency, net of derivatives agreed to hedge the above trade and financial transactions, when assessing the potential effects of fluctuations in the above currencies. The following table shows the results of the sensitivity analysis, which considers a 5% increase or decrease in the exchange rates compared to the actual exchange rates at 31 December 2017 and 2016 to reflect the potential effects on profit (loss) and equity. 2016 2017 (€m) -5% +5% -5% +5% US dollar 17.96 (17.96) 13.75 (13.75) Dirham 0.96 (0.96) Riyal 1.06 (1.06) 0.68 (0.68) Birr 6.47 (6.47) 10.12 (10.12) Somoni 1.18 (1.18) 0.81 (0.81) 540 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Interest rate risk Salini Impregilo has adopted a combined strategy of streamlining operations by disposing of non-strategic assets, containing debt and hedging interest rate risks on a portion of the non-current structured loans through interest rate swaps (IRSs). The financial risks arising from market interest rate fluctuations to which the company is potentially exposed and which are monitored by the relevant company personnel relate to floating rate non-current loans. Such risk is mitigated by interest accrued on short-term investments of liquidity available at the Italian-based consortia and consortium companies and foreign subsidiaries, which are used to support the company's operations. The company has revised its debt structure significantly, increasing its fixed rate exposure. For this reason, had interest rates increased or decreased by an average 75 basis points in 2017, the loss before tax for the year would have been respectively smaller or greater by €3.0 million (€4.8 million for 2016), assuming that all other variables remained constant. Credit risk Credit risk is that deriving from the company’s exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ (which are mostly governments or state bodies) non-compliance with their obligations. Management of this risk is complex, starting as early as the assessment of offers, through a careful analysis of the characteristics of the countries in which the company's activities should be carried out and the customers, which are usually state or similar bodies, requesting an offer. Therefore, this risk can be essentially assimilated to the country risk. An analysis of this risk based on the age of the outstanding amounts is not very meaningful, since the receivables (mostly due from state bodies) should be assessed together with the related working capital items, especially those reflecting the net exposure to customers (positive and negative work in progress, advances and payments on account) in relation to contract work in progress as a whole. 541 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 A breakdown of working capital by geographical segment is set out below: (€'000) 31 December 31 December WORKING CAPITAL ANALYSIS BY GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENT 2016 2017 Italy 119,324 261,079 Other EU countries 95,104 144,314 Other non-EU countries 14,818 10,177 America 532,337 211,633 Asia/Middle East (387,889) (378,284) Africa (36,035) (129,023) Australia 44,675 644 Total 382,334 120,540 The reconciliation of the reclassified statement of financial position details the items included in working capital.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk derives from the risk that the financial resources necessary to meet obligations may not be available to the company at the agreed terms and deadlines. The company’s strategy aims at ensuring that each ongoing contract is financially independent. This strategy is strictly monitored centrally. A breakdown of financial liabilities by composition and due date (based on undiscounted future cash flows) is set out below. Future interest has been estimated based on the market interest rates at the date of preparation of these separate financial statements, summarised in the notes. 31 December 31 December 2018 31 December After Total (€'000) 2017 2021 Current account facilities 1,230 1,230 Bonds 39,835 322,861 667,562 1,030,258 Bank and other loans and borrowings 678,570 117,267 643,851 1,439,688 Finance lease liabilities 32,324 10,106 38,457 80,887 Interest rate derivatives 2,751 2,751 Gross financial liabilities 754,710 450,234 1,349,870 2,554,814 Trade payables 1,415,800 1,415,800 Total 2,170,510 450,234 1,349,870 3,970,614 31 December 31 December 2019 31 December After Total (€'000) 2018 2021 Current account facilities 8,869 8,869 Bonds 331,611 31,250 662,586 526,274 1,551,721 Bank and other loans and borrowings 75,134 146,630 157,377 190,784 569,925 Finance lease liabilities 23,258 15,646 11,965 2,019 52,896 Interest rate derivatives 1,481 1,481 Gross financial liabilities 440,353 193,526 831,928 719,077 2,184,892 Trade payables 1,217,598 1,217,598 Total 1,658,051 193,526 831,928 719,077 3,402,582 543 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 Liquidity risk management is mainly based on containing debt and maintaining a balanced financial position. The “After” balance for bonds relates to the new bonds issued in the second half of 2017 for redemption in 2024 (see note 18). Loans and borrowings (principal) and trade payables, net of advances, falling due before 31 March 2018 are compared with the cash and cash equivalents that can be used to meet such obligations in the table below: (€'000) Trade payables and financial liabilities: due before 31 March 2018 (*) 392,557 Cash and cash equivalents (**) 659,345 Difference 266,788 (*) Excluding amounts due to group companies. (**) Net of tied-up liquidity. In addition, the company has unused credit facilities of €500 million at the reporting date. Fair value measurement hierarchy IFRS 7 requires that the fair value of financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position be classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair value. There are three different levels: • Level 1 Fair values measured using quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2 Fair values measured using valuation techniques for which inputs significant to the fair value measurement are based on directly or indireclty observable market data; • Level 3 Fair values measured using valuation techniques for which inputs significant to the fair value measurement are based on unobservable market data. Financial instruments recognised by the company at fair value are classified as follows: (€'000) Nota Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Derivative liabilities 20 (1,481) Total (1,481) There were no movements from Level 1 to Level 2 during the year or vice versa. 544 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS 29. Revenue Revenue for 2017 amounts to €2,886.9 million, down by 6.2% on the previous year as follows: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Revenue 2,974,148 2,782,127 (192,021) Other income 102,512 104,811 2,299 Total 3,076,660 2,886,938 (189,722) The decrease in revenue is mainly due to the project to build Line 3 of the Riyadh metro in Saudi Arabia and works carried out in Ethiopia. It has been partially offset by the greater revenue generated by certain large foreign contracts, including works carried out to construct the Rogun dam in Tajikstan and works in progress in the United Arab Emirates.

Moreover, as these are large-scale infrastructural works that take several years to complete, resort to normal production factors depends on the stage of completion of each contract in any given year. These changes may generate significant variations in the percentage of the related cost categories depending on the contract and the year, while not affecting the total percentage of operating costs of total revenue. 30.1 Purchases The cost of raw materials and consumables incurred in 2017 decreased by €18.3 million to €353.9 million compared to the previous year: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Purchases of raw materials and consumables 356,484 336,409 (20,075) Change in raw materials and consumables 15,798 17,540 1,742 Total 372,282 353,949 (18,333) The decrease is due to some large foreign contracts (mainly in Ethiopia), partly offset by the rise in costs for the Polish branch. 30.2 Subcontracts Costs of subcontracts decreased to €384.3 million, down €48.6 million on 2016 as summarised in the following table: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Subcontracts 432,877 384,311 (48,566) Total 432,877 384,311 (48,566) 547 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 The decrease is due mostly due to some large foreign contracts (mainly in Ethiopia), partly offset by the rise in costs for the South Al Mutlaa and Arge Tulfes Pfons joint operations. 30.3 Services This item decreased to €1,413.0 million, down €69.9 million on the previous year, as shown in the following table: (€'000) 2016 2017 Variation Recharging of costs by consortia 944,471 895,028 (49,443) Consultancy and technical services 293,411 309,631 16,220 Rent and leases 85,706 89,283 3,577 Transport and customs 64,034 47,094 (16,940) Insurance 27,620 21,767 (5,853) Fees to directors, statutory auditors and 9,504 8,946 (558) independent auditors Maintenance 4,754 6,658 1,904 Other 53,367 34,553 (18,814) Total 1,482,867 1,412,960 (69,907) “Recharging of costs by consortia” decreased by €49.4 million, mainly due to the variation in costs recharged by consortia and joint ventures.

Amortisation and depreciation of €93.2 million mostly comprises depreciation of €78.5 million, down by €23.3 million compared to the previous year, and amortisation of contract and acquisition costs of €14.3 million. They are in line with the progress made on the related contracts. The decreases mainly refer to contracts in Ethiopia (GIBE III), Australia (Sydney metro) and Saudi Arabia (Riyadh Metro Line 3). 551 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 31.

The increase is principally due to the increase in interest on tax liabilities (€13.7 million, following the settlement of a tax bill received by the Ethiopian branch during the year), offset by the decrease in bank interest on accounts and financing and interest on bonds (€6.2 million), mainly due to the debt refinancing transaction carried out during the year, which led to a reduction in bank loans and borrowings and the issue of bonds at more favourable rates. The increase in financial expense has also been offset by the reduction in “Other” (€5.8 million) and in “Factoring and leases” (€1.5 million). In addition: bank interest on accounts and financing of €37.6 million includes the effect of the amortised cost method of €14.7 million (2016: €21.7 million), including €18.3 million, which did not entail cash outlays during the year as it had already been in paid in previous years, and €0.5 million which was paid in 2017 and immediately recognised in profit or loss; 554 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 interest on bonds of €45.6 million comprises €4.1 million (2016: €3.7 million) arising from the application of the amortised cost method that did give rise to cash outflows. “Other” includes €1.3 million arising from application of the amortised cost method to securities related to the operator Yuma in Colombia.

The SPEs carry out the related contracts on behalf of its partners. The other transactions refer to costs for design and similar activities, incurred when presenting bids and for recently started contracts. They are also governed by specific agreements and carried out on an arm’s length basis and, where applicable, in line with the contract terms. Their effects on the statements of financial position and profit or loss are shown together with the related contract, when appropriate. 560 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Transactions with directors, statutory auditors and key management personnel are shown below: 2016 2017 ( €’000) Fees and Termination Total Fees and Termination Total remuneration benefits remuneration benefits and postand postemployment employment benefits benefits Directors and statutory auditors 6,311 6,311 7,192 7,192 Key management personnel 5,402 5,402 8,016 8,016 Total 11,713 11,713 15,208 15,208 The company’s production is carried out mainly through special purpose entities, which, depending on Salini Impregilo’s share in their contracts, qualify as subsidiaries or associates. In many cases, they have corporate structures that directly and continuously allocate the profits and losses on contracts to their investors, including by “reallocating costs and fees”. They can be considered to be “transparent” considering the original contractual relationship whereby Salini Impregilo, together with the other investors, depending on the type of organisation selected during the tender stage, is the direct counterparty of the customer and the SPE acts in its own name but on behalf of its investors, including vis-à-vis third party suppliers. Accordingly, transactions between Salini Impregilo and the SPEs, in which it has an investment, are not presented in this section but are summarised with other transactions with subsidiaries and associates in the annex “–Separate financial statements of Salini Impregilo – Intragroup transactions”. 561 Separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 The next table shows the impact of transactions with the above companies on the statement of financial position and the profit or loss (including as a percentage), while their effect on cash flows is shown in the statement of cash flows, when material: Non-current Current loans Current Revenue Expenses Financial Financial (€’000) loans and and receivables liabilities income expense 31 December 2016 receivables (1) (2) (3) Total group companies 1,375,519 1,150,644 273,605 580,113 17,068 5,467 Total financial statements item 1,491,476 4,837,273 3,539,957 3,076,660 2,831,811 39,408 115,494 % of financial statements item 0.00% 28.4% 32.5% 8.9% 20.5% 43.3% 4.7% Non-current Current loans Current Revenue Expenses Financial Financial (€’000) loans and and receivables liabilities income expense 31 December 2017 receivables (1) (2) (3) Total group companies 67,141 1,197,949 759,465 237,636 644,222 21,440 6,734 Total financial statements item 1,599,304 4,360,427 3,495,951 2,886,938 2,915,708 67,599 115,865 % of financial statements item 4.20% 27.5% 21.7% 8.2% 22.1% 31.7% 5.8% (1) The percentage of non-current loans and receivables is calculated considering total non-current assets.

IN THEIR MEETING OF 30 APRIL 2018 Dear shareholders, The current board of statutory auditors was appointed by the shareholders of Salini Impregilo S.p.A. (the “company”) on 27 April 2017. Its term of office ends with the shareholders’ meeting called to approve the separate financial statements as at and for the year ending 31 December 2019. Pursuant to article 153.1 of Legislative decree no. 58 of 24 February 1998 (the “Consolidated Finance Act” or the “TUF”), we note that we performed our supervisory and control duties prescribed by the current regulations during the year, with specific reference to the Italian Civil Code, article 148 and subsequent articles of the TUF, Legislative decree no. 39 of 27 January 2010 as amended by Legislative decree no. 135 of 17 July 2016 and Legislative decree no. 254/2016. We also considered the guidelines set out in the Consob (the Italian Commission for Listed Companies and the Stock Exchange) communications about the duties of statutory auditors, the guidance of the Code of Conduct for Listed Companies and the ethical standards recommended by the Italian Accounting Profession (Consiglio Nazionale dei Dottori Commercialisti e degli Esperti Contabili). We have prepared this report for the shareholders’ meeting called to meet on 30 April 2018 on single call to approve the separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017. We note that, with approval of these separate financial statements, the board of directors’ term of office ends (appointed by the shareholders on 30 April 2015 and renewed on 28 April 2016). *** That being said, we describe below our activities performed during the year and up to the date of preparation of this report, including as required by Consob communication no. DEM/1025564 of 6 April 2001 as subsequently amended. The content of this report is based on the related documental evidence of our activities. 1 628 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 1. Significant financial or capital transactions We note the following key events and transactions which took place in 2017: refinancing of the company’s long-term corporate debt for over €1 billion, including through the issue of bonds with a nominal amount of €500 million reserved for institutional investors. These bonds were placed on the Irish Stock Exchange in Dublin. The aim of this refinancing transaction was to strengthen the Group’s financial structure; streamlining of the Group’s structure which included, in particular, the merger of the wholly owned subsidiary SGF INC S.p.A. into Salini Impregilo. The directors informed us periodically about the operations and key transactions undertaken by the company and its subsidiaries. They also described such operations and transactions in their report, to which reference is made, with details of their characteristics and effects. We obtained adequate information about them in order to be in a position to reasonably believe that they comply with the law, the by-laws and principles of correct administration and that they are not imprudent, risky or contrary to the resolutions taken by the shareholders or such that would compromise the company’s assets. Transactions in which the directors or other related parties have an interest are subjected to the transparency procedures required by the ruling legislation. 2. Atypical and/or unusual transactions carried out with third parties, intragroup transactions or related party transactions We did not identify nor were we informed by the directors, independent auditors or internal audit supervisor about any atypical and/or unusual transactions (as per the definition in Consob communication no. DEM/6064293 of 28 July 2006) carried out with third parties, related parties or other group companies. The directors described the day-to-day transactions carried out during the year with group companies and related parties in the notes to the separate financial statements to which reference should be made, also for details about their characteristics and financial effects. They did not identify any critical issues with respect to their suitability and compliance with the company’s interests. 2 629 Reports We checked that the procedure for related party transactions adopted by the company is applied, including the regular reporting by the board of directors on any such transactions. 3. Comments on and proposals about the findings and disclosures in the independent auditors’ report On 5 April 2018, the independent auditors, KPMG S.p.A., issued its report pursuant to article 14 of Legislative decree no. 39 of 27 January 2010 and article 10 of Regulation (EU) no. 537 of 16 April 2014. KPMG S.p.A. states that, in its opinion: the separate and consolidated financial statements of Salini Impregilo S.p.A. give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company and the Group as at 31 December 2017 and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (the “IFRS”) endorsed by the European Union and the Italian regulations implementing article 9 of Legislative decree no. 38/05. On 5 April 2018, KPMG S.p.A. also issued its additional report pursuant to article 11 of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014; the directors’ report and specific information presented in the report on corporate governance and the ownership structure are consistent with the separate and consolidated financial statements of the company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 and have been prepared in compliance with the law; there is nothing to report with reference to the statement required by article 14.2.e) of Legislative decree no. 39/10 based on KPMG S.p.A.’s knowledge and understanding of the entity and its environment obtained through its audit. On 5 April 2018, KPMG S.p.A. also issued its additional report pursuant to article 11 of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014 confirming, inter alia, that based on the procedures performed, no significant deficiencies in internal control were identified. KPMG S.p.A.’s reports detail the key audit matters with respect to which reference should be made thereto. 3 630 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 4. Complaints as per article 2408 of the Italian Civil Code, actions taken by the board of statutory auditors and related outcome During the year, one communication was received from a non-controlling shareholder. After investigating it, assisted by the internal audit department, we did not identify information that needed to be reported to the shareholders. The one director who expressed an unfavourable vote on a resolution approved with the favourable vote of all the other directors present has challenged the resolution. A ruling for this issue is pending and the first hearing should be held in September 2018. We performed the necessary checks and did not identify any information that needed to be reported to the shareholders. 5.

Frequency of attendance at company body meetings The chairperson or another board member attended all 13 meetings of the board of directors during which we were informed about the operations and key transactions performed by the company and its subsidiaries. We also received information about the exercise of his powers from the chief executive officer. We met 18 times during 2017 and during our meetings we exchanged information with the independent auditors to ensure that no transactions took place that were imprudent or risky, could give rise to potential conflicts of interest, are not compliant with the law or the company’s by-laws or the shareholders’ resolutions or that could prejudice the company’s assets. 6 633 Reports The board’s chairperson or another member attended 13 meetings of the risk and control committee, nine meetings of the compensation and nominating committee and one meeting of the committee for related-party transactions, obtaining information of the work they performed during the year.

We checked that the directors are aware of the riskiness and effects of the transactions performed. 9. Adequacy of the organisational structure We obtained information about the company’s organisational structure and any modifications thereto on a regular basis, including through meetings with the competent company managers. As a result, we believe that the company’s organisational structure, procedures, duties and responsibilities are adequate given its size and type of activities. We also checked the adequacy of the organisation structure of the company’s key subsidiaries, focusing on their internal controls and risk management. 10. Adequacy of internal controls and risk management We supervised the adequacy of the internal controls and risk management as follows: a. we regularly obtained information about the activities carried out during the meetings of the risk and control committee, meetings with the internal audit supervisor, the compliance supervisor, the group risk officer and the heads of the other departments involved from time to time; we also obtained the related documentation about risks related to ongoing activities, test programmes and projects to implement internal controls; 7 634 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 b. we participated regularly in the activities of the risk and control committee set up in line with the Code of Conduct for Listed Companies; c. we reviewed the risk and control committee’s regular reports; d. we reviewed the internal audit reports on the internal units of both the branches and head office and the working of the Group’s internal controls and risk management; we also monitored the implementation of remedial actions identified as a result of the internal audit; e. we reviewed the internal audit report prepared every six months by the internal audit supervisor on the activities performed during the period, the methods applied to manage risks inside the company, compliance with risk containment plans, the strategic containment and efficiency objectives and the internal audit supervisor’s positive assessment of the internal controls and risk management given the company’s characteristics and risk profile. Specifically, we expressed our favourable opinion on (i) the adequacy, efficiency and effective working of the internal controls and risk management system considering its characteristics and risk profile; (ii) the organisational, administrative and accounting structure of the company and its key subsidiaries with particular attention to their internal controls and risk management; f. we reviewed the reports of the compliance department on the prevention, monitoring and management of the risk of non-compliance with the law and anti-corruption regulations. We also: checked that the company has an organisational, management and control model which complies with the provisions of Legislative decree no. 231/01 and the guidelines issued by the sector associations, most recently updated by the board of directors on 13 September 2017 to reflect changes in the company’s organisational structure and related procedures, recent legislative modifications about illicit intermediation and work exploitation (Law no. 199/16, the “gangmasters” law) and redesign of the private sector crime with introduction of the crime of instigation to corruption (Legislative decree no. 38/2017) as well as the review of the system used to transmit information to the supervisory body, including about reference best practices; checked that the company has an anti-corruption model; examined the supervisory body’s regular reports (at 30 June and 31 December 2017) as required by Legislative decree no. 231/2001, which summarise its activities of the year; we also met with the body’s members; 8 635 Reports met the statutory auditors of the wholly-controlled subsidiaries Fisia Italimpianti S.p.A. and Imprepar S.p.A. to exchange information about, inter alia, the subsidiaries’ operations and compliance with instructions received from the company, their internal controls and organisation, the composition and activities performed by the supervisory bodies, committees and internal audit department. During our work, we: a) did not identify any critical situations or facts that would have led us to believe that the company’s internal controls or risk management were inadequate during the year; b) to the extent of our duties, we deem that the above models are suitable to prevent the crimes covered by the aforesaid regulations, based also on the information provided by the chairperson of the supervisory body and the reports referred to above which stated that no censurable events or violations or the model took place in 2017; c) acknowledged the board of directors’ positive assessment of the adequacy and effective working of internal controls and risk management in 2017. 11. Adequacy of the administrative-accounting system and its reliability To the extent of our duties, we monitored the adequacy of the administrative and accounting system and its ability to correctly show the company’s operations and the activities undertaken as coordinated by the manager in charge of financial reporting to comply with Law no. 262/05 on guidelines for the protection of savings and regulation of financial markets as subsequently amended and integrated by: a) obtaining information from the manager in charge of financial reporting and the different department heads, including through participation in the activities carried out by the risk and control committee; b) obtaining information about the procedures adopted and instructions issued by the company for the preparation of the 2017 Annual Report and the 2017 Interim Financial Report; c) obtaining information about the existence of the conditions required by article 36 of the Market Regulation adopted with Consob resolution no. 16191 of 29 October 2007 (now article 15 of the Market Regulation adopted with Consob resolution no. 20249 of 28 December 2017) for significant subsidiaries 9 636 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 set up in and regulated by laws of non-EU states.

We did not identify any critical situations or facts during the above activities that would have led us to believe that the company’s administrative and accounting system was inadequate and/or unreliable during the year. 12.
