This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France. For the year ended December 31, 2017 In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Imerys SA, (the “Company”), appointed as independent third party and certified by COFRAC under number(s) 3-1048,(1) we hereby report to you on the consolidated human resources, environmental and social information for the year ended December 31st, 2017 included in the management report (hereinafter named CSR Information ), pursuant to article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Company’s responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing a company's management report including the CSR Information required by article R.225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code in accordance with the reporting protocol used by the Company (hereinafter the Guidelines ), summarised in the management report and available on request from the company's head office. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory texts, the French Code of ethics (Code de déontologie) of our profession and the requirements of article L.822-11 of the French Commercial Code. In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with the ethical requirements, French professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Statutory Auditor’s responsibility On the basis of our work, our responsibility is to: yyattest that the required CSR Information is included in the management report or, in the event of non-disclosure of a part or all of the CSR Information, that an explanation is provided in accordance with the third paragraph of article R.225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information); yyexpress a limited assurance conclusion that the CSR Information taken as a whole is, in all material respects, fairly presented in accordance with the Guidelines (Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information). It is not our responsibility to provide any conclusion on the compliance with other applicable legal expectations, in particular those concerning article L.225-102-4 of the French code of commerce (duty of care) or the French law 2016-1691 (anti-corruption law). Our work involved six persons and was conducted between October 2017 and March 2018 during a seven-week period. We were assisted in our work by our sustainability experts. We performed our work in accordance with the order dated 13 May 2013 defining the conditions under which the independent third party performs its engagement and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of statutory auditors (Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement and with ISAE 3000 concerning our conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information.

Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information Nature and scope of our work On the basis of interviews with the individuals in charge of the relevant departments, we obtained an understanding of the Company’s sustainability strategy regarding human resources and environmental impacts of its activities and its social commitments and, where applicable, any actions or programmes arising from them. We compared the CSR Information presented in the management report with the list provided in article R.225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code. For any consolidated information that is not disclosed, we verified that explanations were provided in accordance with article R.225-105, paragraph 3 of the French Commercial Code. We verified that the CSR Information covers the scope of consolidation, i.e., the Company, its subsidiaries as defined by article L.233-1 and the controlled entities as defined by article L.233-3 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the methodological note, presented in ‘5.8 Reporting Methodologies’ section of the management report. Conclusion Based on the work performed and given the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information has been disclosed in the management report. 2. Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information Nature and scope of our work yyWe conducted around twenty interviews with the persons responsible for preparing the CSR Information in the departments in charge of collecting the information and, where appropriate, responsible for internal control and risk management procedures, in order to: yyassess the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, and taking into account industry best practices where appropriate ; 5 yyverify the implementation of data-collection, compilation, processing and control process to reach completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and obtain an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures used to prepare the CSR Information. We determined the nature and scope of our tests and procedures based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information with respect to the characteristics of the Company, the human resources and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainability strategy and industry best practices. Imerys 2017 Registration Document 155 5 C orporate social responsibility Attestation and Correlation Table Regarding the CSR Information that we considered to be the most important:(3) : yyat parent entity level, we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organisation, policies, actions), performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the consolidation of the data. We also verified that the information was consistent and in agreement with the other information in the management report; yyat the level of a representative sample of entities selected(4) by us on the basis of their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify that procedures are properly applied, and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. The selected sample represents on average 15% of headcount and between 24% and 31% of quantitative environmental data disclosed. For the remaining consolidated CSR Information, we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the company. We also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in part. We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used, based on our professional judgement, are sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR information cannot be totally eliminated. Conclusion Based on the work performed, no material misstatement has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines.
