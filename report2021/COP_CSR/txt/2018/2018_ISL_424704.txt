Page 3 ESG Highlights 2017 Eimskip was established in Reykjavik in 1914 and has since then connected Iceland and the rest of the world with its transportation services. The Company has played an important role in Iceland s history and the fight for its independence. Eimskip realizes its responsibility and is committed to maintaining its presence and services. The Company operates an efficient and responsible transportation system in the North Atlantic and offers worldwide forwarding services. Its mission is to be a leading transportation company in the North Atlantic with connections to international markets and to be specialized in worldwide freight forwarding services. Eimskip s vision is excellence in transportation solutions and services. To attain this, Eimskip strives to provide its customers with the most efficient and sustainable transportation solutions combined with outstanding services, while securing a good return for its shareholders and being responsible towards its employees and the society, including the environment. The Company transports large volumes of foods and various consumer goods and by securing safe transport with the focus on lowering damage, it creates shared value with smaller waste generation for the benefit of the environment. Eimskip defines the society as one Of its stakeholders. The others are the Company s shareholders, customers and employees. Corporate social responsibility plays a large role in its operations, of which the environmental matters are important. Eimskip s values are Achievement, Cooperation and Trust. These are the employees guiding principles in the Company s endeavor to work for a better society, preserve and protect the environment and to be a role model when it comes to responsibility and trust. Eimskip signed the Reykjavik Declaration on Climate Issues in November 2015 regarding measures to tackle climate change. In January 2017, Eimskip was one of many companies that signed a joint declaration on responsible tourism, but the Company currently operates three ferries in Iceland. Eimskip wants to contribute to a better and safer society wherever it operates and sees it as an integral part of its corporate responsibility, values and goals to be a responsible player in the community. In this spirit, it supported a variety of community projects and non-governmental organizations in 2017. When choosing the projects, the Company gave priority to enhancing safety at sea, supporting environmental projects, charities, sporting activities, culture and innovations and, last but not least, projects centered on youth and children. The Company is especially proud of its bicycle helmet project, which began in 2004. In cooperation with Kiwanis, the Company has given all six-year-old children in Iceland bicycle helmets and safety reflectors to contribute to youth safety. During this period, Eimskip has given about 65,000 helmets to children who are now aged between 6 and 20. The project is symbolic for Eimskip s values and commitment to a better and safer society. In 2017, Eimskip continued aligning the Company s corporate social responsibility with its business effort and the focus of the year was on a new CSR Policy and reduced ecological footprint, according to one of its Strategic Priorities for the year 2017, which was CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT. Eimskip is a registered participant of the UN Global Compact, the United Nation s initiative for social responsibility with respect to human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. With its participation, the Company has committed to manage its business operations so that the UN Global Compact and its Ten Principles become a part of the Company s strategy, culture and day-to-day operations. The Company has also committed to advocate the UN Global Compact and its Ten Principles through available communication channels and communicate annually on implementation efforts.
