STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT CSR LEBANON is a different company today than it was since its establishment. When we embarked on our sustainability journey, we did not foresee the profound impact this commitment would have on who we are as a small consultancy agency. Today more than ever, a sustainable approach is simply the way we do things and this is evident in our 2017 Communication on Progress report. Our values guide and distinguish us. While we are proud of our position as a sustainability leader, we do so by continuing to uphold businesses’ responsibility to their communities and look forward to a time when sustainability is no longer a point of differentiation, but rather the norm. For CSR LEBANON, corporate responsibility is about creating sustainable value for clients, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. The SDGs have created a focus of impact that’s widely understood by investors, NGOs, academics and governments. As the SDGs are based on a participatory process, responsibility for achieving them will be shared amongst everyone. Our COP will demonstrate our efforts to encourage a constructive dialogue that helped to identify activities and services that have contributed to the realization of several of these goals – individually or in collaboration with selected partners. Our continued commitment to promoting and implementing the GC Principles is based on: First, by proving our support for the Global Compact. The UNGC continues to represent the most widely accepted set of international business standards in relation to CSR and human rights. Second, by demonstrating the positive impact of the ten principles achieved so far, despite our small size and the country’s dramatic situation, and mainly through our awareness-raising activities which we have been relentlessly working on. In 2017, through the 7th CSR LEBANON FORUMTM, titled ‘‘What is the Purpose of Business’’ (October 26, 2017) which was held under the patronage of the Governor of Banque du Liban, H.E. Mr. Riad Salamé, who continues to encourage and conserve a culture of proper CSR and engage banks to enrich their environmental, social and governance profiles towards a more sustainable and impactful banking philosophy. 4 9 A special addition to the Forum was the SDG Debate session that took place at the end of the event, where three international SDG experts debated the localization and implementation of the SDGs and their impact on a sustainable economy. In addition, CSR LEBANON held its second annual “CSR LEBANON SPRING WEEK” under the title “Collaborating for Social Impact” from April 18-21, 2017 which we believe brought us one step close to reaching our goal of successfully working “Towards a National CSR Strategy” (details on pages 26-27). We also continued our efforts to publish the Responsible Business Quarterly Review despite difficulty in the publishing world (details on pages 30-31). Third, by ensuring that as our business grows, it does so in a socially responsible way. Using the Global Compact self-assessment procedure has enabled us to identify areas where further improvements are needed to ensure that the business grows sustainably and continues to have a positive impact in society. We will continue to use it as a tool for evaluation and improvement. We also have aligned these social outcome objectives to relevant Sustainable Development Goals. We believe our strategy and performance in these focus areas will assist us in realizing these specific global goals. By considering sustainability risks in every business operation and offering services and events that give clients access to key sustainability knowledge and issues, CSR LEBANON effectively contributes to the realization of the SDGs by supporting sustainable economic development. It’s no longer enough to deliver positive impacts in select areas of the business. Businesses must transform their culture, strategy and operations so that responsible, long-term impacts are at the core. To create real change, businesses must work together on the difficult common issues. Only then will their operations and industry deliver truly responsible and positive impacts.

Despite substantial initiatives by the public, private, and non-profit sectors, there is still a genuine need for a sustainable group effort to address the socio-economic issues facing the country. There is a significant lack of awareness about CSR in Lebanese corporations and their role in the development of the country. Contrary to the fast-growing CSR trend across the global business world, the implementation of CSR strategies in Lebanon and the region is still very limited, and is only undertaken by a few corporations in specific fields. This fact negatively affects companies’ competitiveness, profitability, and sustainable growth. CSR LEBANON plays an essential role in tackling these challenges through the following strategic goals: • Spreading the culture of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in Lebanon and the region. • Empowering the Lebanese private sector to implement CSR. • Helping banks and other corporations meet universal CSR and sustainability standards. • Presenting new CSR programs adapted to the Lebanese communities’ needs. • Developing CSR ties between businesses, civil society, governmental entities, and the media. • Establishing a regional CSR media platform based in Lebanon. 10 9 Our Challenges 1. Lack of funding because of the inexistence of an adequate legal status in Lebanon for operating as a social enterprise, rather than a for-profit company. This resulted in CSR LEBANON’s inability to approach local and international institutional donors. 2. Operating within an economy that is based on family-owned businesses where integrating a new culture inside the organization remains challenging and difficult. 3. Time constraints: Expenditures growing at a faster rate than income is generated. This prevents quick reinvestment into new initiatives and risks losing some of the positive momentum created. 4. Security and economic constraints as well as weak infrastructure and local and regional political instability. 5. The weak back-up from the public sector which keeps the sphere of collaboration small and hinders the proper adoption of CSR since the corporate sector remains free in the way it approaches CSR (although CSR is voluntary in nature) and has the capacity to manipulate public expectations because of the absence of relevant regulations and supervision. 6. As a new trend in the region, many parties, mainly event organizers and some consultants, deal with CSR as a commercial opportunity rather than a business approach. CSR LEBANON is then expected to invest further efforts to adjust the misconceptions created by similar unprofessional practices. 7. Lack of local and regional expertise which obligates CSR LEBANON to partner with international experts thus increasing its costs. 11 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE CSR LEBANON was established in 2009 with the aim of raising awareness about Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability in Lebanon and the region. The company follows a multi-year strategic program towards enhancing corporate engagement in surrounding communities by integrating responsible practices in their workplaces, marketplaces, environment, and society. With many impressive achievements so far ranging from hosting high caliber events, four international level CSR Forums with global reach, banking workshops, CSR strategies, project consultancies, media campaigns, a specialized magazine, and publications, CSR LEBANON has already succeeded in creating a great momentum and raising the bar in the strategic perception of the concept among corporations and stakeholders. The social enterprise uses a communications mix aimed at reaching all of our stakeholders. CSR LEBANON Website Our website (www.csrlebanon.com) educates businesses, corporations and the public on CSR and provides expert opinions and analysis on the subject. The website also includes a news portal highlighting selective local, regional, and international CSR news and updates. 14 9 CSR LEBANON Social Media CSR LEBANON has increasingly made use of social media for various purposes. This is because social media has become an indispensable element in the communication mix. In the field of CSR and sustainability, social media are regarded as beneficial purveyors of CSR messages and communicating these beyond the traditional channels has shown great potential for discussing sustainability issues and engaging stakeholders. 15 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE CSR LEBANON Events More than ever, purpose-driven business is finding itself high on the corporate agenda. Increasing numbers of CEOs across the globe are committing to social impact beyond making profit. In a rapidly shifting marketplace, coalescing around a powerful purpose helps an organization to adapt, innovate and transform. Building corporate purpose has the potential to unlock even greater social impact. Under the patronage of the Governor of Banque du Liban, H.E. Mr. Riad Salamé, The 7th CSR LEBANON FORUM examined how 16 9 businesses should not only focus on making profit, but rather look at the larger environmental, social and governance issues – especially since managing these risks and opportunities appropriately generates better returns down the road. As the dialogue about purpose continues to expand, there is increasing recognition that while purpose is currently underleveraged, the 7th Forum debated: why do businesses exist? To make a profit or to serve a purpose? Starting and surviving in today’s economy is a difficult endeavor, but the companies that understand it have something in common: the pursuit of purpose, alongside the pursuit of profit. A purpose mobilizes people in a way that pursuing profits alone never will. For a company to thrive, it needs to infuse its purpose in all that it does. It is without doubt that an organization without purpose manages people and resources, while an organization with purpose mobilizes people and resources. Purpose is a key ingredient for a strong, sustainable, scalable organizational culture: it is an invisible yet existing element that drives an organization. 17 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE It can be a strategic starting point, a product differentiator, and a natural attractor of users and customers. Building, maintaining and reinforcing a culture of purpose is a perpetual challenge for leaders, with today’s pressures posing even greater challenges especially if they are subject to intense public scrutiny concerning their business principles and their relationship with the community. As such, the 7th CSR LEBANON FORUM served as an opportunity to hear from corporate leaders and engage in discussions on today’s top issues and how they have impacted businesses. One of the sessions looked at how today’s changemakers were using new innovative tools to redesign their business products and service offers to tackle more complex and social problems. Social entrepreneurs and innovators have embraced this new approach with breakthrough business models, encouraging more youth, women, businesses and government to join together to think differently about solving the world’s biggest problems. There is no escaping the fact that many of the most successful companies today have a predominant social purpose that transcends the operations of CSR, which, when fully integrated, can have profound business and social results. Another session examined sustainability leaders’ awareness of emerging environmental and social trends, and the risks and opportunities they create for business. From SDGs to other developmental economic plans, businesses need to pursue social and environmental sustainability as avidly as they pursue market share and shareholder value. With this recognition, business leaders are now using their ability to set roadmaps that move towards sustainable businesses. To better examine the rise of purpose-driven social brands, another session was dedicated to understanding what good is pursuing purpose and sustainability if it does not become embedded in brand positioning and communications? These days, not only are brands expected to improve the lives of their consumers, they also need to do their part to better society. A reputation has to be earned and 18 9 brands recognize that they need to work harder to win the loyalty of their customers, while at the same time projecting and marketing the kind of image that might attract future employees. In addition, the final session looked at how digital and technology innovations are providing companies with the opportunity to overcome barriers and drive sustainability agendas towards the ultimate goal of social purpose. Ultimately, investing in technologies that increase the sustainability of operations is a smart business move. It serves as a combination of risk mitigation and opportunity creation and provides focus on how to proactively apply sustainable thinking to technological endeavors. The 7th CSR LEBANON Forum would not have been possible without the continuous patronage and support of Governor Salamé who continues to encourage and conserve a culture of proper CSR and engage banks to enrich their environmental, social and governance profiles towards a more sustainable and impactful banking philosophy. 19 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE 20 9 “Congratulations on the very considerable success of the conference. Having organized various events myself, I know just how much hard work has to go into such conferences. You did exceptionally well to get so many speakers from outside Lebanon. CSR LEBANON achieved an international level event in Beirut, one which we only see in annual conferences organized by global sustainability leaders like the UNGC, GRI, and the BITC.” Professor David Grayson Director of the Doughty Centre for Corporate Responsibility, Cranfield University UK, London 21 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE SDGs: The Great Debate For the 7th CSR LEBANON FORUM, and in line with CSR LEBANON’s commitment to communicate the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to businesses and the community in Lebanon, a debate was hosted after the panel sessions set on looking at the many sides of the SDGs, and the need to drive national responses to implement the 2030 Agenda. Has enough been done to identify gaps in policy and capacity? What about the availability of tools and reporting requirements? How has this affected multi-stakeholder partnerships and has it fostered engagement, investment and accountability? Debating these points were Mr. Mallen Baker, Founder and MD of Daisywheel Interactive (UK) and Mr. David Connor, Regional Voice Lead for Impact 2030 (UK). Both Baker and Connor spoke extensively about the implementation of the SDGs in their respective fields and both explored the challenges and the promises that came with the SDGs and how this has shaped the sustainability discourse. They also examined the ways in which the SDGs have been applied and whether or not the UN has succeeded in becoming a standing support base for organizations that endeavor to spearhead innovative solutions to further these Goals. Mr. Nazareth Seferian, Founder and CEO of CSR Armenia, was the moderator of this debate. 22 9 Some of the points discussed during this debate looked at developing a national evaluation policy, setting up institutional processes, partner engagement and evaluation. It was found that effectively, the challenges affect both the supply of sound evaluations for development plans and also the demand for their relevant and useful evidence, which in turn informs national policy development. This debate highlighted areas to consider when developing a national plan and supports an effective evaluation for the SDGs. 23 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE 24 9 CSR and Sustainability Exhibition As every year, the CSR LEBANON Forum hosted a unique exhibition that engaged hundreds of decision-makers in a highly professional environment. The theme for this year’s exhibition was dedicated to exploring “how digitalization drives sustainability and social purpose”, providing an opportunity for exhibitors to demonstrate various applications for the Internet of Things (IoT) for sustainability in several sectors and how they can contribute towards the greater common good to drive social purpose. The CSR & Sustainability Exhibition provided the perfect platform for startups and other small businesses with access to top-level IoT and sustainability professionals, who can benefit from this event to launch a new product or service and gain quality time with prospective clients and potential customers. The trend of NGOs working in cooperation with business has developed considerably. The global community – including leaders of international governmental institutions and of the non-profit sector as well as some business leaders – has recognized the importance of including business in the process of international development. NGOs, on the other hand, have become instrumental in development work locally and internationally, but they generally do not have the means and resources to carry out their projects efficiently in a sustainable manner. This is why engaging business with the public and non-profit sectors to find common solutions to problems has been an increasing trend and why the CSR LEBANON FORUM was a great platform to demonstrate the benefits of partnerships to both corporations and NGOs, the practical difficulties they present, and the elements necessary to establishing a healthy collaboration between both actors. 25 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE 26 9 Supporting Students and Universities In 2017, more than 150 students and professors from more than 12 leading universities in Lebanon were invited by CSR LEBANON to attend and participate at the CSR LEBANON Forum, training courses and workshops. Students were mainly introduced to the concept of CSR, the role of the academic sector in the field, as well as to social entrepreneurship and offered opportunities. CSR LEBANON is also continuously and voluntarily assisting senior education students from various universities in successfully completing their MBA thesis tackling the topic of CSR, dedicating time and providing advice, contacts, resources, and mentorship. 27 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE 28 9 CSR LEBANON SPRING WEEK CSR LEBANON held its 2nd Annual CSR LEBANON Spring Week #CSRLBSW2 from April 18-21, which engaged different stakeholders and trained CSR novices and executives, actively engaged CSR professionals as well NGOs and specialists on CSR insights. The goal was that by continuing to bring together experts and apprentices, we would be one step closer to reaching our slogan of over a decade and successfully work “Towards a National CSR Strategy”. One of the most efficient ways to ensure employee engagement and business success is to raise awareness about CSR and Sustainability internally to every single employee, regardless of their position. As such, the aim for the 2nd CSR LEBANON Spring Week was to ensure that every CSR practitioners who took part in this week would be made aware that the sustainability agenda is no longer in the hands of only one person or committee. CSR LEBANON has always positioned youth at the forefront and believes in the starring role youth have in making a difference in this world. The success from the previous year’s Spring Week called to organize another Basketball tournament on 19 April that brought together students from different universities and play against one another in a friendly basketball game where they would defend a special social cause that they found dear to them. The Spring Week also hosted a private lunch held for nearly 15 key figures in the media sector on 20 April at Bristol Hotel in Beirut, to instil a proper definition about what is CSR to help influence a more thorough understanding of CSR, sustainability and social entrepreneurship. Through the transmission of stimulating ideas such as “Social Impact”, “Social Entrepreneurship”, and “Responsible Business” CSR LEBANON fulfilled its role in communicating the importance of striving for tangible impact in the social sphere as well as sustainability. The Spring Week also organized a one-day “Start-Up CSR” intensive training course on 21 April, intended to enable participants to acquire the skills and competencies needed to prepare a CSR strategy and learn how to communicate its results. Some of the topics covered in this training course were related to embedding CSR and providing a general understanding of the term; identification of stakeholders; CSR reporting standards; and the role of SDGs to ensure a sustainable economy. 29 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE Responsible Business Quarterly ReviewTM Magazine The first and only specialized CSR Magazine in the Middle East Responsible BusinessTM Quarterly Review is a unique media platform covering the latest CSR and sustainability trends, initiatives, stories, case studies, reports and expert viewpoints. The magazine aims to broaden and deepen the understanding of CSR and provide road maps for improved adoption and implementation of the concept within a local and regional cultural context. Responsible BusinessTM magazine is now in its 21st edition and has received positive stakeholder feedback locally and internationally from the CSR, media and corporate sectors. The quarterly magazine provides readers with an overview of CSR developments in the region and internationally as well as in-depth features. It is the first and only publication in the Middle East specialized in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and has fast become one of the top 3 business magazines in Lebanon. Responsible BusinessTM is an authoritative reference on CSR and builds the business case for corporations committed to improving their practices by offering accurate information and guidelines.

Areas of coverage Mainly Lebanon, the UAE, Qatar, KSA, Jordan and the United Kingdom 30 Six Years of Responsible Business Your Ultimate Source for Corporate Social Responsibility Knowledge COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE CSR LEBANON Consulting Services CSR LEBANON provides leading consultancy services in the CSR field, helping corporations do business in a responsible and sustainable way. Our consultancy services include: • Setting CSR frameworks, policies and strategies. • Developing innovative CSR projects closely related to the company’s core business • In-house training • Establishing CSR departments and providing the necessary education and training • CSR preliminary assessment • Encouraging stakeholder engagement, including stakeholder mapping and dialogue planning • Developing and communicating CSR reports and providing quality assurance Consultancy services are still at a very early stage due to the weak market readiness to integrate strategic CSR into businesses especially in Lebanon. Due to the instability of the political and economic environment in the country, businesses mostly operate within a short term spectrum and restrain from investing in long-term strategies and programs. CSR LEBANON expects to be more active in the consultancy area within the next five years. This will be mainly due to the fulfillment of our National Program for raising awareness about CSR which includes intensive conferences and educational workshops in collaboration with business schools and aimed at eliminating misconceptions heavily existing in this field. Philanthropic and marketing perceptions of CSR as well as the disengagement of senior leadership are among the main challenges encountered in driving integrated CSR forward. 32 CSR LEBANON, under the guidance of Mr. Khaled Kassar, is building momentum for sustainable business practices in Lebanon and the region. Mr. Georg Kell, Former Executive Director of the UNGC 33 COMMITTING TO THE 10 PRINCIPLES OF THE UNGC 9 The following section outlines our approach to the UNGC and summarizes how we are seeking to support the ten principles. Method CSR LEBANON undertook a self-assessment at the end of the reporting period using the UNGC Self-Assessment Tool to evaluate our progress to date. This was undertaken with input from the editorial and management team. Included in our evaluation was an analysis of our supply chainwhich is described below. Follow-up actions were identified which will be implemented in 2018 and are listed at the end of this section. Our Supply Chain In assessing our supply chain, we identified the magazine as the main product we produce therefore having the most significant impact. Where other suppliers opt for single purchases such as stationery items, we have long-term extensive relationships with the companies procuring them. Our utility requirements (water, electricity and sewage) are met by the government and/or the management of our building and are largely outside of our control. Production of the magazine is undertaken by Salim Dabbous Printing Company Sarl, a Lebanese printing press. The paper used in the magazine is 100% recycled Oikos (FSC certified) and is sourced by CSR LEBANON directly from Nahhal Paper Co. in Lebanon. Such paper quality is unfortunately not available locally nor through regional suppliers. Following production, distribution is undertaken by Messageries du Moyen-Orient de la Presse et du Livre S.A.L. The magazine is also distributed in other Middle Eastern countries, especially in the United Arab Emirates, again using a distribution agent (Abu Dhabi Media Company – Tawzea, in the UAE). Using distribution agents allows the magazine to be distributed alongside other publications to the same vendors, which reduces the carbon footprint of the magazine as well as the cost. Courier delivery is used for smaller magazine distributions, for example to particular companies, and is undertaken by Aramex (www. aramex.com), a large distribution company in the Middle East with an established track record in CSR and sustainability. 35 COMMITTING TO THE 10 PRINCIPLES THE 10 PRINCIPLES HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES Principle 1: Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2: Business should ensure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses • CSR LEBANON supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and seeks to ensure that its principles are embedded in its organizational practices. • CSR LEBANON seeks to provide a safe and healthy workplace environment for its employees. • CSR LEBANON seeks to ensure that wages, hours and leave allowances meet international and national standards.

The generally poor reputation of many national NGOs in the country. 2. Inexistence of a relevant legal status in the Lebanese laws for social enterprises.

With such a shared vision, the SDGs will provide ways for Lebanese people to work together for a better and more equal future for themselves and the future Lebanese generation. We believe CSR LEBANON is in a position to contribute directly to eight of the goals aligned to our current 2020 targets, in a meaningful way. Our Strategy CSR LEBANON demonstrated its commitment to the Global Goals through a series of actions that it undertook throughout 2017. It primarily aimed at guiding companies to advance the SDGs by operating responsibly in alignment with universal principles and finding opportunities to innovate to address societal challenges. For the 7th CSR LEBANON FORUM, and in line with CSR LEBANON’s commitment to communicate the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to businesses and the community in Lebanon, a debate was hosted after the panel sessions set on looking at the many sides of the SDGs, and the need to drive national responses to implement the 2030 Agenda. Some of the points discussed during this debate looked at developing a national evaluation policy, setting up institutional processes, partner engagement and evaluation. It was found that effectively, the challenges affect both the supply of sound evaluations for development plans and also the demand for their relevant and useful evidence, which in turn informs national policy development. This debate highlighted areas to consider when developing a national plan and supports an effective evaluation for the SDGs. 45 COMMITTING TO THE SDGs SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS HUMAN AND LABOR RIGHTS Within CSR LEBANON • Creating an exceptional experience for its employees • Upholding professional values and behaviors to adopt sustainable practices • Empowering and promoting an inclusive and diverse culture • Listening to, and recognizing its people • Developing purpose-driven leaders who contribute to society’s welfare Community Investment • Driving inclusing growth • Working with others to instill positive change • Supporting the next generation • Aligning action through global coordination and collaboration • Investing over 500 hours of professional services and skilled volunteering for capacity building of social enterprises Supply Chain • Driving responsibility in its supply chain • Increasing supplier diversity The above demonstrate CSR LEBANON’s contribution to the following Goals: 46 9 ANTI-CORRUPTION OBLIGATION Our Business • CSR LEBANON supports its clients and profession by living by its values • Upholding the highest professional standards • Engaging with stakeholders in a clear and transparent way • Reinforcing its commitment to quality Serving Public Interest • Tackling corruption in all its forms • Helping businesses to innovate with purpose • Building confidence and trust in all markets The above demonstrate CSR LEBANON’s contribution to the following Goals: ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Acting with Integrity • CSR LEBANON supports environmental sustainability by positively influencing change • Managing our own impact • Engaging with responsibly and sustainability-conscious suppliers • Helping our clients and people become more sustainable The above demonstrate CSR LEBANON’s contribution to the following Goals: 47
