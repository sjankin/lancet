In addition, we participate in sectoral unions and organizations and we cooperate with other companies of our industry. We consider this approach as of strategic importance as we are able to develop partnerships that promote the common wealth. In this section, we present our commitments and actions for each theme for the period covered for this Communication on Progress. 5.1.Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 5.1.1.

We believe that the implementation and the commitment to our “Labour Practices & Human Rights Policy” is essential part of our culture and responsible operations and it supports a working environment of mutual trust and respect. Taking into consideration the United Nation Global Compact on human rights as well as the International Labour Organization (ILO) we commit to: • “be against any type of discrimination.” • “provide equal opportunities for all regardless gender, age, political or religious believes, nationality or sexual preferences.” P a g e 11 | 23 Communication on Progress Report • “respect, protect and put in practice the fundamental and internationally recognized human and labour rights.” • “provide personal development and career opportunities through continuous training.” • “be against any type of child and/or forced labour.” • “protect employees’ Health & Safety” by forming a suitable working environment.” • “promote a culture of balanced working-personal life.” This policy covers all our operations and we seek its implementation from our partners and employees. 5.1.2.

Under the “Health for All” program, AFEA offered support to primary health care and social care systems with local public services for the benefit of local, socially vulnerable populations. In efforts to raise awareness towards the need for equal participation of vulnerable social groups in health information exchange, health care, support and rehabilitation, and strengthen the participation of these groups in health issues, AFEA sponsored the “Health for All” program in the municipality of Naxos and the Small Cyclades, where volunteers offered health services to the mountain area villages of Naxos including Apeiranthos, Koronida, Koronos, Filoti, and on the Small Cyclades: Schoinousa, Iraklia, Donousa, Koufonisia over the March 28-April 1 period.

We therefore, ensure that all our employees are aware of their rights and responsibilities in the workplace. P a g e 16 | 23 Communication on Progress Report 5.2.2. Our actions Working environment We ensure and we provide a working environment that promotes respect and equal opportunities for all such as the participation of women in leadership roles and in the decision-making process. Specifically, 50% of the board of directors is comprised by women, whereas the 90% of the management team are women. This way, AFEA empowers women which is pivotal to the health and social development of families, communities and nations. We also acknowledge the fact that companies which focus on women’s empowerment experience greater business success showing an increase in productivity, organizational effectiveness, return on investment and higher consumer satisfaction. At AFEA, we ensure responsible, inclusive, participatory and representative decisionmaking processes at all levels of the company, through consultation with our employees. Moreover, we respect, protect and put in practice the fundamental and internationally recognized principles for the human rights and labour practices including a safe and healthy workplace free of any type of harassment, including physical, verbal, sexual or psychological harassment, abuse or threats. We are against any type of child and/or forced labour and we expect our partners and suppliers to act likewise.

Additionally, all employees receive bonuses in the form of cash checks to be used for grocery shopping. P a g e 17 | 23 Communication on Progress Report 5.3. Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 5.3.1. Our commitment Code of conduct and environmental policy It is clear now more than ever that regardless the business sector all companies should act against climate change. We are dedicated to positively contributing to the protection of the environment. We are able to foresee that addressing climate challenge creates new opportunities for societies to grow and prosper. Hence, we seek to reduce all negative environmental impacts in our daily operations and to increase the positive ones. Our vision for the future is, as a result of our operation that the natural environment will be on a better state than before. In this context, through our Environmental Policy and Code of Conduct, we commit to saving energy and reducing GHG emissions, to minimize the use of materials (natural resources) in our daily operations and to implement recycling practices aiming to the reduction of the waste generated by our operations. Moreover, we understand that it is essential for companies to contribute to the development of a sustainable supply chain, and for this reason we commit to applying environmental criteria to procurement practices and raising awareness among our partners and suppliers, regarding environmentally friendly practices and precautionary measures. Finally, we commit to continue developing and promoting services that take into consideration the protection of the environment. P a g e 18 | 23 Communication on Progress Report 5.3.2. Our actions Energy We keep track of our energy consumption and we take appropriate measures to reduce it by setting targets on improved energy efficiency for the consumption in our offices. For example, in 2017, in order to improve the energy efficiency in our offices, we installed Energy Class A equipment and LED lamps. Waste At our offices, we recycle the paper we use on a daily basis and we are constantly trying to reduce the amount of paper needed for our operations. In particular, during the reporting period we estimated that we recycled 500kg paper and 100kg plastic and aluminum. In addition, we recycle tonners and other chemicals deriving from our printers. In addition, in 2017, we offered our employees a training on environmental awareness and protection. Eight employees of the management team participated in this training. Good Practice: Offering new service to enhance sustainability: Sustainable events Events, small or large, have significant impacts on the environment as usually they are related to extensive resource (materials, energy, water, etc.) use and therefore waste generation. Using less of everything by increasing efficiency and choosing products, suppliers and processes with an improved environmental profile, benefits the environment, trains attendees, inculcates environmentally friendly behavior and builds credibility for the organizations involved. A responsible or sustainable event, is the event which is designed in a way that potential negative impacts are managed and minimized, while it leaves a beneficial legacy for the host local community and all parties involved, including raising awareness and maximizing positive experience for all. P a g e 19 | 23 Communication on Progress Report AFEA, launched its new service: Sustainable Events, with the aim to support its clients on the organization of their future sustainable event, conference or corporate meeting. This new service promotes the respect to the environment and practices of responsible behavior and consumption. More information regarding the service can be found here. P a g e 20 | 23 Communication on Progress Report 5.4. Anti-corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 5.4.1. Our commitment AFEA provides a range of services of high quality, reliability and professionalism. For us it is a nonnegotiable commitment to conduct ethical business and to respect national and international laws and regulations in every case. Corruption is considered to be a serious obstacle to economic and social development around the world. It has negative impacts on sustainable development and particularly affects business growth, escalates costs and poses serious legal and reputational risks. It also undermines fair competition, impedes long-term foreign and domestic investment, and distorts development priorities. For this reason, AFEA adopts robust anti-corruption measures and practices to protect both its reputation and its stakeholders’ interests. In particular, bribery, of any form, is a negative practice and completely opposite to AFEA’s business ethics as it does not reflect, at any form, Company’s culture and policies. On this basis, AFEA operates in alignment to its Code of Conduct which has been communicated to all stakeholders including employees, partners, suppliers, third parties such as lawyers etc. with the aim to operate on these guidelines and principles. 5.4.2. Our actions Anti-corruption measures AFEA assesses the risk of corruption on its daily business practices. We have developed a specific mechanism to prevent illegal actions in all forms. As part of our strategy, we evaluate the possibility of corruption and we take measures to prevent any incident. For this reason, we pay special attention on the transparency of the contracts and transactions we made as well as in the selection of our partners. In case of any suspicion of involvement in incorruption or fraudulent activities, the Board of Directors is responsible to P a g e 21 | 23 Communication on Progress Report resolve the issue. AFEA has endorsed the EU General Data Protection regulation and maintains a system of internal accounting controls and record keeping for all transactions. Training on business integrity In 2017, AFEA employees participated in the New Third Party Intermediary HCBI AntiCorruption TPI training and received the corresponding certificate. AFEA continuously demonstrates good governance practices by integrating corporate sustainability principles into its operations and relationships with others, providing this way greater transparency, accountability and inclusiveness. Is also contributes to the development and implementation of international norms and standards, for instance, by committing to the UN Global Compact. It operates ethically, respects the laws and regulations in every case. As a result, incident of corruption has been reported to the company during the reference period of this report.
