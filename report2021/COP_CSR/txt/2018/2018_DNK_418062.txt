As we enter into 2018 the global supply of oil continues to outpace demand which combined with complex geopolitical topics continue to fuel volatility and uncertainty across markets. As a result of the volatile market back drop and the challenging industry environment, Welltec is currently not able to offer qualified guidance for the full year 2018. However, Welltec will continue to evaluate forward looking reference points and commence on outlook guidance again once visibility has improved. 9 WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2017 / MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY Another challenging year for the industry is in the outlook, but also in 2018 we will be looking forward . . . 10 WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2017 / MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY RISKS Risks Related to Our Business Supply Chain Business and Industry Related Risks Welltec may experience constraints, anomalies or interruptions in our While we believe our business to be relatively unaffected by macrosupply chain, ultimately restricting Welltec’s ability to meet customer economic factors, it is ultimately affected by the level of expenditures expectations.

The determination of local tax liability is 11 WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2017 / MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY always subject to review or examination by authorities in operating jurisdictions. If a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews filed tax returns and based on filing proposes an adjustment, including adjustments of transfer prices and terms applied, such an adjustment could have a negative impact on Welltec’s net profit. Liquidity Risk Welltec’s ability to make payments, refinance indebtedness, fund planned capital expenditures and other strategic investments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is, to a certain extent subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Welltec expects to continue making capital investments in order to develop and purchase additional equipment to expand our services, increase our capacity and replace existing equipment. Such capital investments require cash that could otherwise be applied to other business needs. However, if Welltec does not incur these expenditures our competitive strength may decline and our business may be adversely affected. Legal Risks Regulatory Welltec conducts business in multiple jurisdictions in a highly regulated industry. As such, Welltec is, directly or indirectly, subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws, regulations and guidelines, in all such jurisdictions, including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations including business ethics and trade compliance, taxation, the protection of the environment and the manufacture, management, transportation and disposal of certain materials used in operations. Accordingly, Welltec could become subject to liabilities relating to the violation of such regulations in multiple jurisdictions, with an adverse effect on profits. Technology Welltec is a technology company, constantly challenging the operational boundaries in the industry. However, third parties may assert that our products, services, solutions and other intellectual property may infringe, on their proprietary rights. Any such potential future claims, regardless of merit, could result in multi-jurisdictional litigation, which could result in substantial expenses, causes significant delays and materially disrupt the conduct of business and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

For purposes of assessing the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets of USD 327,122 thousand at December 31, 2017, compared to USD 342,419 thousand at December 31, 2016, Management prepared its annual impairment test. In performing the impairment test Management makes an assessment of whether the Welltec International ApS Group will be able to generate positive net cash flows sufficient to support the value of the goodwill, intangible assets and other net assets of the entity. This assessment is based on estimates of expected future cash flows (value-in-use) made on the basis of financial budgets and long-term forecasts until the end of 2022. In addition to these the key assumptions used to estimate expected future cash flows are discount rates and growth rates. In 2016 the sudden decline in oil prices has left the industry under pressure to reduce spending which generally has increased the estimation uncertainty and reduced the market value of Welltec. The measurement of goodwill may be significantly impacted by changes in the estimates made when calculating the value in use of the entity in connection with impairment test. For a further description of goodwill, the cash-generating unit, the impairment test and related key assumptions (being expectations about future earnings, growth rate and discount rate), refer to note 11.

As a result of the dividend distribution in 2012, the exercise prices of outstanding warrant schemes from 2011 and before, were adjusted in 2012 to avoid a dilution of the fair values of those warrants. The new exercise prices were adjusted to ensure that the fair values before and after the dividend pay-out were the same.

The group’s services are provided to a variety of contractual counter parties and are therefore subject to the risk of non payment for services or non reimbursement of costs. Receivables consist of a relatively small number of customers, but the customers are large corporations in the oil industry. Companies with high credit ratings and the group’s loss on trade receivables are historically immaterial. There is an ongoing centralized follow-up on out-standing trade receivables in accordance with the group’s dunning procedures. If there is uncertainty of a customer’s ability or will to pay, and if the management assess that the receivables is doubtful, the receivables will be written down to avoid this risk. The maximum credit risk related to financial assets corresponds to the carrying amount. In case where there may be a risk of loss, a write-down will be made based on individual assessment. 16.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 24.1 General capital structure The group is financed partly through equity and partly through long-term debt. Management assesses on a regular basis whether the group’s capital structure is in accordance with the group’s and shareholders’ interests. The overall objective is to ensure a capital structure that supports long-term growth and also maximizes returns to the shareholders of the group by optimizing the debt to equity ratio. The group’s overall objective remains the same. 24.2 Market risk Due to the group’s foreign activities and credit facilities in foreign currencies, its profit/loss, cash flows and equity are affected by changes in exchange rates and interest rates for a number of currencies. A significant part of this change in exchange rates has been eliminated by changing functional currency for the Danish companies to US Dollar from 2012. 24.2.1 Foreign currency risk management The reporting currency of the group is US dollars. The functional currency of the Danish companies is considered to be US dollars, and the rest of the group’s subsidiaries have the functional currency of the country in which the subsidiary is domiciled. A proportion of the group’s revenues, expenses and other liabilities are denominated in currencies other than US dollars, in particular Danish kroner, Norwegian kroner and British pounds. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters. The carrying amounts of the group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting period are as follows stated in the material currencies affecting the group: Assets Liabilities (USD in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 DKK 190,693 235,915 (182,545) (210,091) GBP 15,262 14,759 (9,671) (9,900) NOK 3,696 6,484 (456) (3,791) 71 WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2017 / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24.2.2 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The following table details the group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in DKK, GBP and NOK against the relevant foreign currencies. The percentage used is the sensitivity rate and is representing Management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and equity where the currency strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. For a 10% weakening of the currency against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative. Currency DKK impact Currency GBP impact Currency NOK impact (USD in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Profit/(Loss) 815 366 28 41 240 261 Equity 0 0 (327) (273) 623 597 24.2.3 Interest rate risk management From the beginning of 2012 the group’s interest rate risk mainly relates to the group’s interest bearing debt to bondholders. The interest is fixed at an effective rate of 8.5%. In November 2017 the interest bearing debt was refinanced with a new bond loan. The interest is fixed at an effecitive rate af 9,75%. As the interest rate is fixed the group does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments. Thus any changes in fair value are recognized directly in statement of comprehensive income as financial income or financial expenses. 24.2.5 Interest rate sensitivity analysis The group’s interest-bearing debt for 2017 and until the refinancing in November 2017 is primarily fixed to 8.5% due to the bond loan, however the EIB loan has a variable interest of 2.2% + 6 months EURIBOR. Both loans were refinanced by end of 2017 and the new bond loan is fixed to an interest rate of 9.5%. A 250 basis point increase or decrease represents Management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. If interest rates had been 250 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the group’s: Profit for the year and equity as of December 31, 2017 would be affected with USD 675 thousand (2016: 675 thousand). 72 WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2017 / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24.3 Liquidity risk management It is the group’s policy that capital raising and distribution of cash are managed centrally by the group’s finance department to the extent it is deemed appropriate. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. The group is adjusting centrally the cash outflow in investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in Denmark. For general corporate and working capital purpose the Group holds a USD 40 million Revolving Credit Facility. The RCF contains requrements for mandatory prepayments upon certain events, also the RCF contains financial covenant. Please see note 19.2.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of accounting The annual report for 2017 of the parent company Welltec International ApS is presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of reporting class C (large) enterprises. Please see the Danish Executive Order on IFRS adoption issued in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act. The annual report is presented in thousands of US dollar (USD), which also is the functional currency of the parent company. The accounting policies are unchanged compared to 2016. Differences compared to the group’s accounting policies The parent company’s accounting policies for recognition and measurement are in accordance with the group’s policies with the exceptions stated below: Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost in the parent company’s financial statements. Where the recoverable amount of the investments is lower than cost, the investments are written down to this lower value. Dividend from investments in subsidiaries is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the year it is declared. 2. USE OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS The determination of carrying values and preparation of the annual report build upon estimates made by Management of the likely effect of future events on the value of investments and receivables in/from subsidiaries. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers that the following accounting estimates and assumptions are critical in the parent financial statements. Impairment of investment in subsidiaries Investment in subsidiaries represents USD 291,616 thousand equalizing 97 % of total assets in the parent company. The impairment test reveaveld a need for impairment of USD 100,960 thousand. When considering impairment indicators, Management makes an assessment of whether the Welltec International ApS Group wil be able to generate positive net cash flows sufficient to support the value of the investments. Regarding this estimate and the assumptions made by Management, please see note 2.3 in the consolidated financial statements. The estimates used build upon assumptions which, in the opinion of Management, are valid albeit inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
