It will not enter into collaboration with new suppliers unless they have passed an acceptable audit. FINANCIAL Social responsibility audits of suppliers in high-risk countries Kesko is a member of amfori, a leading global association dedicated to promoting open and sustainable trade. Kesko takes part in amfori BSCI and recommends the use of amfori BSCI audits in STATEMENTS the assessment of social responsibility of suppliers in high-risk countries. Kesko also accepts other assessment systems of social responsibility if their criteria correspond to those of amfori BSCI auditing and if the audit is conducted by an independent party. As part of the sourcing cooperation between Kesko’s grocery trade and ICA Global Sourcing, Kesko also accepts the ICA Social Audit. In that case, however, suppliers are required to adopt a third-party auditing approved by Kesko after a maximum of two ICA audits. CORPORATE The social responsibility auditing systems accepted by Kesko are listed in the section Monitoring and control systems. Some of Kesko’s suppliers are themselves amfori members and thus promote amfori BSCI audits in their own supply chains.

If a factory SUSTAINABILITY receives an audit result of C, D or E, a follow-up audit within 12 months must be arranged to assess the deficiencies identified in the full audit and the corrective measures implemented to address them. Kesko does not terminate cooperation with a supplier that undertakes to resolve the grievances specified in the audit report.

Kesko Group leases store sites for use in its business operations in all of its operating countries. The store site network is a strategic competitive factor for the Group. At the end of 2017, Kesko Group had over 1,500 leased properties, the lease liability for which was €2,892 million, in addition to which the Group had other lease liabilities of €21 million. The Group has initiated an assessment regarding the impact of IFRS 16 on its financial FINANCIAL statements. Management estimates that the new lease standard will have a significant impact on the Company’s income statement, balance sheet and performance indicators. Kesko has a significant number of lease agreements that according to the standard STATEMENTS currently in force are categorised as operating leases and have been recognised as lease expenditure in the income statement on a time apportionment basis. According to the new standard, assets and liabilities corresponding to the present value of minimum lease payments shall be recognised in the balance sheet at the commencement of the leases, meaning assets and liabilities will increase significantly in the balance sheet. The new standard will increase the Group’s operating profit as the current lease expenditure will be replaced by depreciation of a fixed asset item. In addition, interest expenses for liability will also be recognised and presented under finance costs in the income statement. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 182 2.2. 2.2.
