Despite this, profits from the Mitsumi business, with which Minebea implemented a business integration in January of last year, increased substantially, and overall, the Group achieved higher sales and profit. In FY2017, we posted consolidated net sales of 879,139 million yen, an increase of 37.6% over the previous year, consolidated operating income of 79,162 million yen, an increase of 61.5%, and consolidated net income of 59,382 million yen, up 44.3%. Consolidated net sales, operating income, ordinary income, and net income all reached record highs. I believe that we were able to achieve these results by developing business while responding accurately to social needs at all times. The machined component business Yoshihisa Kainuma posted strong results by responding to needs such as Representative Director CEO and COO pursuing energy savings and safety in automobiles and MinebeaMitsumi Inc. the growing demand for electric vehicles.
