E4: GAS FLARING Gas flaring in exploration and production activities is mainly due to limitations in the infrastructure to achieve the full utilization of nitrogen as pneumatic pumping gas and the operation of safety systems to relieve the pressure on wells in -57.9% volume of gas normal operations. Non-routinely flaring is caused by preventive or corrective sent to vent in exploration and production activities maintenance and by unscheduled idle time caused by incidents or failure in compression equipment (O3). As a general practice, vented gases are sent to flares (O5).

This consistently affects the environmental services that ecosystems provide and that are required not only in towns and urban centers, but also in the industry that operates in the area. The conservation of vegetation patches, as well as the connectivity between them, enables the continuity of ecological processes and consequently the environmental services that these provide. Aware of the importance of mitigating this situation, a design of a socio-environmental corridor called the JATUSA Ecological Corridor was proposed. It consists of an area of approximately 2,400 hectares that includes the Jaguaroundi and Tuzandépetl ecological parks and the Santa Alejandrina wet lands, in the Coatzacoalcos region, at Veracruz. 2 Lander, A.

In addition, Pemex is subject to other international laws and regulations related to the fight against corruption, bribery and money laundering, including the UK Bribery Act 2010. The company is also subject to several national laws and regulations related to the fight against corruption, bribery and money laundering. The Federal Criminal Code penalizes certain corrupt practices, including bribery, embezzlement and abuse of authority. 81 The Federal Anticorruption Law on Public Contracting sanctions companies and individuals who incur in infractions due to their participation in public procurement processes or international commercial transactions. This law is comparable in many aspects to FCPA.

The total number of finished wells decreased by 47.0%, from 149 to 79 wells, due to a lower completion of wells development. Importantly, 24 exploration wells were drilled, increasing by three as compared to 2016. However, the finished development wells decreased by 57%, going from 128 to 55 wells. In 2017, Pemex managed to strengthen its deep-water potential through successful drilling of wells Nobilis-101 and Exploratus-2DL, both oil and gas producers. At the same time, it expanded gas and condensate resources with the discovery of Ixachi onshore field. This finding confirms the productive potential in Veracruz Basin.
