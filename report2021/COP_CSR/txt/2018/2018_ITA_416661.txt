CATTANEO ZANETTO & CO. POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE ● LOBBYING ● PUBLIC AFFAIRS To our stakeholders Rome, April 9 , 2018.th Re: Annual Communication on Progress Dear Friends, as a market leader and a bearer of a culture of professional approach we feel on us the strong responsibility to educate the market, demonstrating how our business is far from any gray area and is indeed socially important, bringing quality and value to the policy debate. This was the rationale behind our innovations: being an audited company, have a supervisory board overseeing the money flows, adopting an organizational anti-bribery model pursuant to the Italian Legislative decree no. 231/2001, having an independent body to oversee the real application of such model, training our staff and our professionals on the issues of legal compliance and anti-bribery. Our commitment is continuously renewed through our special tool: the Transparency Report of Cattaneo Zanetto & Co. On our dedicated website (transparency.cattaneozanetto.it) you may find an entire section, in both Italian and English, with all the detailed information about us. This will allow any interested party – institution, client, journalist, watchdog, NGO – to get to know easily who we are and how we work. We are proud of it, while we look forward to a comprehensive lobbying transparency register to be finally set up in Italy. To give an even louder signal effective today we will provide a link to our Transparency Report in the signatures of all our email messages. Every recipient will be just one click away from getting to know all about our firm. By doing so, I am pleased to confirm that Cattaneo Zanetto & Co. reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Our Transparency Report is also our Annual Communication on Progress – we will keep it up to date. We do this with great professional pride and with true commitment. Kind regards.
