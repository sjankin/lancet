To achieve this, we have provided you with information on: ›› our strategy designed to achieve More than mining (page 6) ›› our leadership team (pages 16 to 21) ›› how we apply our business model to create long-term value by employing our stock of resources and relationships in certain capitals to increase the stock of resources and relationships in other capitals (pages 22 to 23) ›› our management of risk, opportunities and the material issues on which our reporting is based (pages 35 to 41) ›› our performance against our strategic pillars (pages 42 to 130) ›› our approach to governance throughout the report and in intellectual capital (pages 84 to 99) Our sustainability reporting forms part of this report. We do not publish a separate sustainability report. We have also identified throughout the report where King IV principles are being applied in the day-to-day governing of our business and the outcomes achieved. ABOUT THIS REPORT Reporting scope and boundary This report provides information relating to RBPlat’s strategy and business model, operating context, material risks and opportunities, governance and operational performance for the period 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. It covers RBPlat’s mining operations and projects in the North West province of South Africa, our corporate office in Fourways and the key functions over which we exercise control. In addition, we have published annual financial statements (AFS) and a mineral resources and reserves statement. The reporting process for all our reports has been guided by the principles and/or requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the International Integrated Reporting Council’s (IIRC) International <IR> Framework, the GRI Standards, the King Code on Corporate Governance 2016 (King IV), the JSE Listings Requirements and the Companies Act 71 of 2008. In terms of human rights, labour, the environment and our anti-corruption efforts we apply the Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) of which we are a signatory. We have incorporated the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), defined by the UN for the 2015 to 2030 period, into our sustainability and stakeholder engagement framework, have prioritised the various SDGs based on our focus and have defined our three levels of contribution, which are: our main focus, direct contribution and indirect contribution. Our progress in this regard is included in this report. INTRODUCTION FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT Certain statements in this report constitute forward looking statements.

As can be seen in the graphs on this page the demand for platinum is diverse, with both the jewellery market and industrial use of platinum forecast to grow in 2018. The use of PGMs in autocatalysts still accounts for most of the annual demand for PGMs (see the graphs below and the market review on pages 13 and 14 of the Chief Executive Officer’s review). However, the urgent need to address climate change by reducing the impact of transportation on GHG emission levels is likely to result in vehicles powered by internal combustion engines being replaced by hybrid, electric or fuel cell-powered vehicles. Some major cities have announced the introduction of legislation banning petrol and diesel cars, but mostly well beyond 2030. However, despite the hype, the combustion engine is likely to be around for a long time, especially in heavy duty vehicles. The introduction globally of increasingly demanding emissions legislation will require the increased use of PGMs in more efficient autocatalysts. Also, the phasing out of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines will not mean the end of the use of PGMs in automotive powertrains. They will still be required in the autocatalysts of hybrid cars and, while battery-powered electric vehicles will not make use of PGMs, hydrogen fuel cell technology, which makes use of platinum and other PGMs, is regarded as an increasingly important technology for use in automotive powertrains. Furthermore, there is significant upside for platinum demand from increased tailpipe emissions standards for commercial vehicles for which full electrification is more difficult and where diesel will more than likely remain the dominant power source.

However, the production of diesel passenger cars in cars every year out of a total market of 7.5Moz (see graph Europe has been falling since 2015. As a result, European demand below) a year. This highlights the diversity of platinum for platinum is also on a steady slide, with an estimated 1.56Moz demand, which is not wholly reliant on the fortunes of (including non-road) employed in 2017. diesel car sales in Europe.

Greater car sales decline. A further tightening of tailpipe standards to demand for heavier SUVs and more gasoline-powered real driving emissions (RDE) limits over the next few years does cars, which produce more CO2 relative to diesel cars, not guarantee stronger demand for platinum as there is a makes achieving the fleet average limit of 95g/km CO2 cocktail of options available to automakers, some of which do by 2021 increasingly difficult for the majority of car not necessarily need additional PGMs. companies leaving them potentially exposed to major financial penalties. With palladium at record prices, the threat of substitution with other PGMs grows. As the world moves increasingly towards electrification, palladium-dominated autocatalysts are set to benefit The rapid rise in rhodium prices over the last year and high from a growing use of gasoline hybrid vehicles. lending rates for the metal indicate genuine tightness for consumers. Rhodium, as well as platinum, could act as a buffer to ever-increasing demand for palladium through increased use in gasoline three-way autocatalysts. Our response: RBPlat’s ramp-up of Styldrift I to 150ktpm in the fourth quarter of 2018 will allow us to increase our production, not only of high grade platinum ore, but also of palladium and rhodium at a time when palladium in particular is in short supply. 30 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 OUR BUSINESS OUR CHANGING BUSINESS CONTEXT continued Known issues PGM DEMAND FOR: Jewellery Challenges/risks: Opportunities: Jewellery demand for platinum has been problematic over Green shoots are starting to appear.

Further liquidation of palladium ETFs is possible as investors look to profit at peak prices. Should investors start to rebuild physical holdings of palladium there may be a difficulty in acquiring good delivery bars, which may push prices up further. Lease rates are already at elevated levels, indicating a physical shortage of palladium bars. Our response: We will continue to support the efforts of the WPIC to promote investment in platinum. 32 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 OUR BUSINESS OUR CHANGING BUSINESS CONTEXT continued Known issues PGM DEMAND FOR: Industrial Challenges/risks: Opportunities: In Japan net demand dropped by 41% to just 54koz as oil The use of platinum for industrial purposes is on the refinery closures to comply with a government deadline increase. impacted market needs.

Cars that are palladium over the medium term. Meanwhile larger powered purely by batteries contain no PGM-based after and heavy-duty diesel vehicles are difficult to fully treatment systems. electrify, indicating that demand for platinum has the potential to grow, particularly in emerging markets. Hybrids use two forms of propulsion, for example, a combustion engine and an electric motor, to power the vehicle. Electrified vehicles can be any vehicle that contains an electric form of propulsion, which includes hybrids and pure battery electric vehicles. Our response: Our response as an industry is to make every effort to develop the hydrogen economy and fuel cell technology, which require platinum and other PGMs, to ensure it becomes competitive with battery technology. 34 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 OUR BUSINESS OUR CHANGING BUSINESS CONTEXT continued Known issues PGM prices Challenges/risks: Opportunities: A strengthening South African rand, and a limited Based on the cost of production the floor to the corresponding response in dollar prices for platinum, meant platinum dollar price is set firmly at above US$850/oz. that over the year local prices fell by R865/oz to just Current prices are still arguably oversold with a R12 324/oz.

During 2017 we reviewed our risk universe and key risk indicators to ensure they remain relevant in our ever-changing business context and the achievement of our business strategy. Our materiality determination process is also an integral part of our efforts to embed integrated thinking in RBPlat and to identify the issues that form the basis of our internal and external reporting. Our risks and opportunities are identified through our proactive ERM process, which is an integral part of the second line of defence in the three lines of defence model applied in our business. This year, to further improve our materiality determination process, which is both retrospective and forward-looking, we introduced an additional level of engagement with our employees and changed our approach. Instead of starting with a review of previously identified material issues we started afresh, which meant that those with whom we engaged, both internally and externally, were not influenced in any way by being presented with previously identified issues, but started from scratch. We then compared the issues identified through this process with those we had previously identified.

By 30 June 2017 the headline loss in the business reflected the results of a constrained average revenue basket price (R17 745 per platinum ounce) combined with the impact of the restructuring costs prior to the restructuring delivering any meaningful cost-saving benefits. During the second half the fruits of the restructuring, together with a much improved average revenue basket price (R19 156 per platinum ounce for the full year) helped the business to achieve a remarkable recovery into solid headline earnings for the full year. From a financial capital point of view, 2017 was characterised by enhanced levels of activity and reaching closure on a number of key fronts: >>conclusion of the R1.2 billion convertible bond >>negotiation and conclusion of R2 billion in debt facilities >>completion of the organisational redesign and restructuring resulting in a 1.4% reduction in year-on-year unit costs and a 2.6% reduction in fixed cash costs >>negotiation and conclusion of the value-enhancing Maseve acquisition.

Key features OUR PERFORMANCE We finished 2017 without having a fatal accident. We are, however, concerned about the worsening of our SIFR and LTIFR. There was a period during 2017 when there was movement of people and labour reductions took place. These changes caused instability and resulted in people losing focus, which in turn led to a spike in injuries. We did, however, put controls in place to minimise the effect of the changes. During the last two months of 2017 there was a marked reduction in injuries as labour movement stabilised.

She is delighted with her home, but was rather surprised when her son Kamogolo, a 16-year-old, complained that he misses the friends he left behind in Phokeng. He raises an important point. Both the Mining Charter and RBPlat’s agreement with the trade union required that we build homes for our employees near a town or city, not near our mine. This requirement is intended to avoid mine employees owning homes that could become worthless when a mine closes down. While our employees’ homes near Rustenburg are more likely to increase in value over time than they might have had they been built near BRPM, it does mean people are moving away from friends and family and community members are losing rental income. Miriam previously worked at BRPM as a chair lift operator. She is now working at Styldrift I as an onsetter on night shift, transporting people and material underground and back up to surface in a 27m2 cage.

It also includes our processes, approach to remuneration, risk management, the systems that support and facilitate integrated thinking in RBPlat, our ability to deliver on our business strategy and our all-important relationships. Our economic value depends on how we manage and use these assets to extract value and make the best possible use of them. The execution of our strategy is more important than the strategy itself and leveraging our intellectual capital allows us to implement it in the most effective and efficient way possible.

King IV presents us with an opportunity to assess whether our approach to corporate governance, an essential element of our intellectual capital, is facilitating: >>ethical and effective leadership and establishing an ethical culture (see page 9 of the leadership review and page 86 of this section of the report) >>responsible corporate citizenship >>accountability and effective control >>the governance of risk >>transparency that ensures stakeholders are provided with the information they need to make an informed assessment of our performance >>value creation for all our stakeholders. TOWARDS ACHIEVING AN ETHICAL CULTURE By our application of: For more information on our application of these principles Principle 1 The governing body should lead ethically and effectively 9 Principle 2 The governing body should govern the ethics of the organisation in a way that 9 supports the establishment of an ethical culture Principle 3 The governing body should ensure that the organisation is and is seen to be a 8 responsible corporate citizen The contribution establishing an ethical culture makes to our stock of intellectual capital RBPlat’s commitment to ensuring that the governance of ethics in our organisation supports an ethical culture including commissioning an independent survey by Nkonki to assess the effectiveness of our efforts to establish an ethical culture and establish a roadmap for the way forward. The approach taken in the survey was in line with the King IV Report on Corporate Governance principles regarding the management of ethics, and was further aligned to the practice notes of the King III Report with specific reference to ethics risks assessments. Assessing the effectiveness of our efforts to establish an ethical culture We sought to establish: >>are our employees aligned with leadership? >>is our ethics management programme working? >>what is not working and likely to cause problems in the future? To gain a broad view of our ethical climate, individual interviews were conducted under the conditions of protected anonymity, with specifically selected members of the executive and randomly selected members of management at our operations. The aim of these interviews was to gain insight in the level of ethical leadership at RBPlat and to guide the formulation of Company-specific survey questions, which were used to design an anonymous online survey. The seven dimensions of an ethical climate tested were: >>Clarity of ethical expectation: Is it clear to employees exactly what is expected of them in terms of ethical behaviour? >>Consistency of ethical expectations: Is what RBPlat expects of employees in line with what employees experience in terms of the expectations that their seniors and colleagues have of them? >>Achievability of ethical expectations: Do employees feel that RBPlat’s ethical expectations are reasonable, realistic and achievable? Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 87 >>Supportability of a healthy ethical climate: Does the environment support a healthy ethical climate through trust, fairness and good leadership example? >>Visibility of misconduct: Perceptions about the ease of hiding misconduct and awareness of current misconduct >>Two-way discussion of ethics and misconduct: Adequacy of two-way communication and ease of reporting misconduct >>Corrective action: How is ethical behaviour rewarded and how is unethical behaviour treated? The survey also asked employees to rate how well they thought RBPlat is living its values. Regarding: >>Being transparent, responsible and accountable: 63% rank RBPlat’s performance as very well or well and 33% rate our performance as fair >>Putting safety first: 84% believe we perform very well or well and 15% rate our performance as fair, with only 1% rating our performance as poor or very poor >>Achieving mutual goals and interests: 60% believe we perform very well or well in this regard and 33% rate our performance as fair, leaving 7% rating our performance as poor or very poor >>Diversity and inclusion: 60% believe we perform very well or well in this regard and 28% rate our performance as fair, leaving 11% who believe our performance in this regard is poor or very poor. Ninety-five percent of those surveyed said that they believed that behaving in line with the organisation’s code of ethics has a positive effect on the organisation and its stakeholders. OUR PERFORMANCE Our plans to improve the ethical culture in RBPlat The survey established that the general health of RBPlat’s ethical climate and organisational culture is positive and there was no indication of pervasive systemic issues that required immediate intervention. There are, however, certain issues that do require attention in our operations, with Consistency of ethical expectations being identified as a high-risk area needing special focus. To address the issues requiring attention we will be: 1. Sharing the results of the survey with leadership in our operations and working with leadership to ensure we achieve an improvement in RBPlat’s ethical climate and culture 2. Increasing awareness of our code of ethics and our commitment to an ethical culture to achieve a unifying vision for RBPlat and ensuring the code becomes a living document for the organisation 3. Ensuring management communication: a. makes it clear that contravening RBPlat’s values and rules will not be tolerated b. encourages employees to report any instances of values and rules being contravened c. informs employees of the consequences of victimisation d. manages fears about job security that may discourage employees from reporting the contravention of the rules 4. Highlighting the channels employees can use to report unethical behaviour or to check their understanding of what is and what is not ethical behaviour 5. Sharing information on hotline statistics and the outcome of disciplinary procedures with employees with the aim of being transparent, responsible and accountable and ensuring employees see that while misconduct does not go unpunished employees are treated fairly 6. Taking decisive corrective action against any employees found guilty of contravening values and rules. 88 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 OUR PERFORMANCE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL continued ACHIEVING GOOD PERFORMANCE By our application of: For more information on our application of these principles Principle 4 The governing body should appreciate that the organisation’s core purpose, its 6—7 8—9 risks and opportunities, strategy, business model, performance and sustainable 11 — 12 22 development are all inseparable elements of the value creation process 24 — 25 41 Principle 5 The governing body should ensure that reports issued by the organisation 1 enable stakeholders to make informed assessments of the organisation’s performance and custodian of corporate governance in the organisation Our application of Principle 4 RBPlat recognises that its activities and outputs can have both positive and negative impacts on the triple context (the economy, society and the environment) in which we operate and the capitals we employ in our business to create value for our stakeholders by achieving a good performance. When we set our strategic objectives (see page 35) we assess the risks and opportunities they present in relation to our risk appetite and risk tolerance, which considers the triple context, establish our key performance indicators (KPIs), the key risk indicators (KRIs) for each KPI, and measure our performance against these KRIs (see our performance in terms of our corporate risk appetite dashboard on pages 36 and 37). The business model we use to create economic value (see pages 22 to 23) also incorporates the triple context and explains how we use our stock of the six capitals to create value (for details of our performance in terms of our financial, manufactured, human, intellectual, social and relationship and natural capital, see pages 42 to 51, 52 to 69, 70 to 83, 84 to 99, 100 to 113 and 114 to 130). Our commitment to creating social value resulted in the establishment of a home ownership scheme for our employees, which for many provided them with the first opportunity they have had to own an asset, which is likely to appreciate over time (see pages 81 to 83). RBPlat employees returning to their homes after work Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 89 Our investment in the Styldrift I project has provided us with an opportunity to achieve profitable organic growth, create employment, ensure the future sustainability of our business and create value for our stakeholders (see pages 50 and 51). Our acquisition of Maseve will further increase stakeholder value by providing the concentrator capacity that will allow us to ramp up Styldrift I to 230ktpm (see pages 64 and 69). OUR PERFORMANCE Digitalisation is key to improved underground surveying Towards operational excellence In order to further develop our ability to efficiently and effectively manage projects, a key area of expertise for our business, we are establishing a project support function, supported by a project management framework, which will use digitalisation to assist with the identification of the interdependencies/links between projects to ensure project integration and communication, standardisation and the elimination of the duplication of resources and processes. The framework will also have the requisite assurance and auditing capabilities. The technologies we selected have been implemented, part of which was the earned value management (EVM) system which was implemented using Prism software and we are currently in the support phase. We will be recruiting the human capital resources to support the implemented technologies in 2018. Our application of Principle 5 We engage with our stakeholders throughout the year to provide them with information on our performance, any challenges we are facing and our view of the future. We do this through both our quarterly, interim and annual reporting, presentations, one-on-one conversations and face-to-face meetings. We also make every effort through our engagement to address stakeholder concerns and their requests for information as transparently as possible. The rigorous materiality process we follow (see the section on our risks, opportunities and material issues on pages 38 to 41) helps us to identify and address the matters material to our stakeholders in our reporting. Our efforts to achieve integrated reporting, which provides our management with an integrated view of our business throughout the year and allows for integrated thinking, are ongoing. Our combined assurance model, which includes both internal and external assurance services, provides our Board and our stakeholders with the comfort that they can rely on the integrity of the economic, social and environmental information in our reports. The Board of RBPlat also assumes responsibility for the integrity of our integrated reports (see page 1 of this report) and plays an important role in its preparation. We would refer you to the relationship capital section of this report for information on the process we follow to identify our stakeholders and the matters of concern to them (see pages 106 and 113). 90 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 OUR PERFORMANCE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL continued ACHIEVING EFFECTIVE CONTROL AND LEGITIMACY By our application of: For more information on our application of these principles Principle 6 The governing body should serve as the focal point and custodian of corporate 92 governance in the organisation Principle 7 The governing body should comprise the appropriate balance of knowledge, 16 — 21 skills, experience, diversity and independence for it to discharge its governance role and responsibilities objectively and effectively Principle 8 The governing body should ensure that its arrangements for delegation within 92 its own structures promote independent judgement and assist with the balance of power and the effective discharge of its duties Principle 9 The governing body should ensure that the evaluation of its own performance 9 and that of its committees, its chair and its individual members, support continued improvement in its performance and effectiveness Principle 10 The governing body should ensure that the appointment of and delegation to 93 management contributed to role clarity and the effective exercise of authority and responsibilities Our application of Principles 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 Through the appointment of strong independent directors and the separation and clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, RBPlat has established a clear balance of power and authority at Board level. Our Board performs its duties within a framework of policies and controls, which provide for effective risk assessment and management of our economic, environmental and social performance. The RBPlat Board Charter, which is closely aligned with the recommendations of King IV, details the responsibilities of the Board, while our Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) also addresses certain of the directors’ responsibilities and powers. The Board’s MOI sets out the shareholders’ delegation of authority to the Board, which has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its consideration and decision. Its delegation of certain matters to its committees and subsidiary companies is described in the terms of reference of these committees, which can be found in the governance section of our website. In addition, the Board delegates authority to the Executive Committee, which in turn delegates authority to heads of department, who in turn delegate authority to members of their leadership team.

Executive responsibility for technology and information governance lies with the Financial Director who heads up the Information Management Steering Committee (a subcommittee of the Executive Committee), which oversees the implementation of the information governance framework and the management of related risks, and reports to the Audit and Risk Committee through the Executive Committee. The technology and information governance focus for 2017 was on the reorganisation and repositioning of RBPlat’s information technology support, developing and implementing new policies and procedures and formalising the architectural process. A re-evaluation of our network and systems with the aim of improving performance was also undertaken. Key initiatives that RBPlat will be focusing on in 2018, some of which are already in progress, include: >>ongoing development and implementation of formal policies and procedures for key processes OUR PERFORMANCE >>information technology organisational restructure to ensure effective management of key information technology infrastructure (ITIL) processes >>a review of our IT tools to ensure the proactive monitoring and evaluation of the IT environment >>reorganising and repositioning the RBPlat IT support function. Doing what we do better by applying technology, digitalisation and organisational knowledge The mechanisation of Styldrift I presents us with a number of opportunities to make innovative use of technology and digitalisation. Our aim is to ensure we have access to quality data in real time to support rapid and accurate decision-making. The installation of a collision avoidance system on our underground low profile (LP) haul trucks and load haul dump (LHD) vehicles, that takes control of the vehicle by automatically retarding and stopping the vehicle if the operator does not respond to an alert, is one of the uses of technology being employed to achieve safe, efficient production. Infrared cameras also record driver behaviour. The integration of this system with the high-speed underground data network installed at Styldrift I enables the convergence of these technologies with software-based maintenance and fleet management systems, which have not previously been implemented in underground low profile mines such as Styldrift I. All electrically driven fixed machinery installations at Styldrift I are operated by localised programmable logic controller-based software and connected to an integrated monitoring system via the high-speed underground network. Access to a high-speed fibre network allows mine management at Styldrift I to observe operations in real time and take immediate action when required. 96 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 OUR PERFORMANCE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL continued The diagram below illustrates some of the technologies in use at Styldrift I.

Our regulatory compliance framework, compliance risk policy and our regulatory risk management process ensure that the effectiveness of the key internal controls in place to mitigate our compliance risks is continually monitored and that risk management plans are in place to ensure compliance with new legislation or amendments to current legislation. RBPlat compliance during 2017 RBPlat has complied with the JSE Listings Requirements during the year under review including being in the process of obtaining a BEE compliance certificate in accordance with section 13G(2) of the BEE Act. RBPlat’s regulatory compliance universe outlines a list of over 81 pieces of legislation and regulations in relation to minerals, land, environment, geology, human resources, engineering, safety and health, financial, information technology, the Companies Act, JSE Listings Requirements, etc. which we monitor to ensure compliance. Our regulatory compliance universe categorises each item, the seriousness of its legislative impact and the probability of non-compliance. It also allocates a priority ranking to the core legislation which are likely to have a material impact on RBPlat should we not comply with them. Compliance with these pieces of legislation is continually monitored. Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 97 ACHIEVING LEGITIMACY continued By our application of: For more information on our application of these principles Principle 14 The governing body should ensure that the organisation remunerates fairly, S ee the remuneration responsibly and transparently so as to promote the achievement or strategic review on pages 132 objectives and positive outcomes in the short, medium and long term to 137. Principle 15 The governing body should ensure that assurance services and functions S ee below and see the enable an effective control environment and that these support the integrity report of the Audit of information for internal decision-making and of the organisation’s external and Risk Committee reports on page 3 of the annual financial statements. See pages 139 to 141. Principle 16 In the execution of its governance role and responsibilities, the governing body should adopt a stakeholder-inclusive approach that balances the needs, interests and expectations of material stakeholders in the best interests of the organisation over time Application of Principle 14 RBPlat understands that it is essential that our strategy, risks, performance and rewards are aligned if we are to create shareholder value. The Remuneration and Nomination Committee is charged with ensuring that executive OUR PERFORMANCE directors and senior management are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Company’s overall performance and for ensuring that RBPlat’s remuneration policies and practices are designed to align performance with reward and to attract and retain the right talent, while having regard to the interests of stakeholders and the financial condition of the Group. The individual performance of executives is measured against key performance indicators linked to our strategic objectives (see page 133 of this report for these measures). The remuneration review on pages 132 to 137 sets out our remuneration philosophy and structure and how we measure executive performance. Application of Principle 15 Combined assurance To ensure we have adequate assurance across the RBPlat Group, and to prevent gaps or duplication in assurance efforts, we have adopted a combined assurance approach. Our Risk and Assurance unit is responsible for maintaining the combined assurance plan in consultation with functional and operational management and our outsourced internal audit service provider. Progress on assurance activities is tracked monthly and reported on to the Audit and Risk Committee and/or the Social and Ethics Committee every quarter, depending on the nature of the area assured. The Audit and Risk Committee obtained assurance on the financial statements, internal controls and sustainability information included in RBPlat’s integrated report and carried out its statutory duties set out in section 90 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008. It satisfied itself as to the expertise and experience of the Financial Director and the financial function and assessed the independence and performance of the internal and external audit functions. (See the Audit and Risk Committee report on page 3 of the annual financial statements available online at www.bafokengplatinum.co.za.) The Social and Ethics Committee advises and provides guidance to the Board on the effectiveness of management’s efforts in respect of social, ethics and sustainable development-related matters. It also carries out its duties as prescribed in the Companies Act 71 of 2008 and reports on its discharge of its duties in this regard to the Board and stakeholders (see its report on page 138 of this report). 98 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 OUR PERFORMANCE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL continued COMBINED ASSURANCE PLAN First line of Second line of defence Third line defence Internal assurance providers of defence Governance Value drivers and Independent structure reported associated key Risk and assurance to Board and its Framework/ Frequency of threats Management SHE compliance Sustainability providers committees standard Outcome assurance Safe operating Other > Executive > Safety legal Annual conditions external > Audit and Risk compliance audit assurance > Social and Ethics providers Environmentally KPMG internal > Executive > ISO 14001 (2015) BRPM and Annual responsible audit on > S ocial and Ethics environmental Styldrift I operations sustainability management recertified information system Other > Executive > ISO 9001 BRPM and Biennial external > Social and Ethics standards Styldrift I assurance relating to recertified providers quality Environmental > Executive > OHSAS 18001 BRPM and Biennial legal > S ocial and Ethics occupational Styldrift I compliance health and safety recertified audit assessment certification Achieve growth External > Executive > Business plan Ongoing monitoring Quarterly and objectives audit > Audit and Risk through annually implementation of risk action plans as per risk registers Achieve KPMG internal > Executive > Business plan Ongoing monitoring Quarterly and operational, audit on ore > A udit and Risk through annually profitability and accounting > Social and Ethics implementation of liquidity risk action plans as objectives per risk registers Achieve company KPMG internal > Executive Ongoing monitoring Quarterly strategy audit > A udit and Risk through > Social and Ethics implementation of risk action plans as per risk registers Motivated Other > Executive Monitored through Quarterly and workforce external > Audit and Risk risk registers annually assurance > Social and Ethics providers Mining operations Other > Executive Biennial external > Audit and Risk assurance providers Accurate and External audit > Executive Annual timely reporting (PwC) > A udit and Risk KPMG internal > Social and ethics audit of > R emuneration compliance to and Nomination income tax and VAT acts Legend ■ Management providing assurance ■ Safety, health and environment assurance ■ Risk and compliance ■ Sustainability ■ Internal audit ■ External audit (PwC) ■ Other external assurance providers Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 99 Application of Principle 16 Our approach to stakeholder relations Balancing the needs, interests and expectations of RBPlat’s stakeholders has been identified as being one of RBPlat’s material issues. Information on how we have approached our stakeholder relations can be found in the social and relationship capital section of this report (pages 105 to 113). The Board also identified stakeholder relations in terms of its role regarding investors as being a material corporate governance issue. To address this issue RBPlat engaged with the investor community, both locally and internationally, during 2017 to keep them informed regarding RBPlat and to obtain feedback.

If we exclude 10 progressed learners who, despite not passing maths since Grade 10, were promoted to Grade 12 in accordance with Department: Education policy. There was a 27% increase in the numbers of learners who wrote maths for matric (75 learners wrote maths for matric this year). Three of these learners achieved distinctions and 21 passed maths at 50% and above. One learner achieved a distinction in science. In 2012, before our project started, only 20 learners wrote maths, of whom only 10 passed at 50% and above. The school’s maths and science learners made up 65.7% of its learners who achieved passes that qualified them to study bachelor’s degrees at university or college. Challenges The lack of competent teachers in the lower grades at the school is impacting negatively on achieving a sustained good performance from the project. There is also a high teacher attrition rate at the school, which results in the skills transfer achieved by the project teachers being lost to Charora.

One of its Plan 35 goals is healthy individuals with access to preventative and reactive medical care. In 2014, RBPlat invested R7.4 million in health support, which included the cost of constructing and equipping a desperately needed new forensic pathology facility in Phokeng. This facility serves all the communities in the area, not only the RBN community. 104 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 OUR PERFORMANCE SOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL continued ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES Portable skills development During 2017 we were able to offer 315 learners from our doorstep communities the opportunity to acquire portable skills through a Mining Qualifications Authority (MQA) sponsored training programme. Each village put forward the names of young people from their community who first of all completed a baseline assessment of their skills. Following the assessment some members of the group were put on adult education and training (AET) programmes and others began their electrical, welding, plumbing and carpentry training. The training for each skill included a month of theory and two months of practical training. The learners were tested at the end of each set of training and those who passed were presented with certificates. The portable skills these learners have acquired give them an opportunity to obtain employment or become self-employed service providers. A group of young learners from our doorstep communities was able to help wire some of the houses in our employee home ownership scheme while completing their practical electrical training as part of the MQA-sponsored training provided to 315 young people from our doorstep communities. It was good to see that there were young women in the group.

Three farms make up the areas of mining, namely Boschkoppie 104 JQ, Frischgewaagd 96 JQ and Styldrift 90 JQ. Mineral rights The Styldrift I and Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum mines are operated by means of mining rights registered at the and legal Mineral and Petroleum Titles Registration Office. The rights are valid until 2038 and 2040, respectively, and are tenure renewable. BRPM minerals: Platinum, platinum group metals and associated minerals. Styldrift minerals: Platinum group metals, gold ore, silver ore, nickel ore, copper ore, cobalt and chrome ore, stone aggregate and sand manufactured from waste dump. Access to land is managed through two lease agreements, concluded with the Royal Bafokeng Nation (RBN), as well as through the BRPM Joint Venture agreements. Deposit The Bushveld Complex, formed approximated 2.04 billion years ago, comprises three main suites, namely the Rooiberg Group, Lebowa Granite Suite and the Rustenburg Layered Suite. The Rustenburg Layered Suite contains four main zones (upper, main, critical and lower zones) with each zone characterised by signature igneous intrusive layering, known as stratigraphy. The critical zone hosts the PGE-bearing reef (economically important layer) types of the Merensky reef and the Upper Group 2 reef (UG2). Both the Merensky reef and UG2 reef are mined at RBPlat. The PGMs (platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), iridium (Ir), rhodium (Rh), osmium (Os) and ruthenium (Ru) and gold (Au)) are found within the sulphide minerals of the reefs and include varieties of copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) as accompanying metals. The average depth of the Merensky reef is 505 metres below surface (mbs), with BRPM having the advantage of being a Merensky reef dominant shallow mine.

The Merensky mineral reserves have increased marginally in 2017 as a result of an increase in the reserve from the Impala 20 shaft tribute mining area. This increase in reserves outweighs the annual depletion and the increase in geological losses due to structural reinterpretation at North shaft. Merensky mineral reserves increased by 1% from 51.09Mt to 51.49Mt and 4E ounce content from 7.41Mt to 7.51Moz, with the average grade remaining relatively unchanged. The UG2 at BRPM was converted to a reserve of 4.24Moz at a 4E grade of 3.81g/t. Total UG2 mineral reserve tonnage decreased by 1.4% from 35.09Mt to 34.62Mt after depletion.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 18. Special resolution number 2 Conversion of shares “It is resolved as a special resolution that, in accordance with Regulation 31(6) of the Companies Regulations, 2011 (the Regulations) published in terms of the Companies Act, 2008 (the Act), the authorised and issued ordinary shares of the Company be and are hereby converted from ordinary shares having a nominal or par value of R0.01 to ordinary shares having no nominal or par value. “For the purposes of the conversion of the ordinary shares of the Company from shares having a nominal or par value to ordinary shares having no nominal or par value, the Board has prepared a report, in terms of Regulation 31(7) of the Regulations, regarding the effect and implications of the conversion. “A copy of these resolutions, together with the report, will be filed with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission and the South African Revenue Service simultaneously with the delivery of these resolutions to shareholders of the Company, in accordance with Regulation 31(8)(b) of the Regulations.” Reason for and effect of special resolution number 2 The Regulations provide that, in the case of companies which have par value shares, it is not permissible to create new par value shares and where directors wish to increase the authorised share capital, the share capital of the Company must first be changed to no par value shares. The reason for and effect of special resolution number 2 is therefore to covert the existing ordinary share capital from shares having a par value to shares having no nominal or par value. 156 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING continued 19. Special resolution number 3 Increase of authorised share capital Subject to the passing of special resolution number 2, “it is resolved as a special resolution that the authorised ordinary share capital of the Company be and is hereby increased from 250 000 000 (two hundred and fifty million] ordinary no par value shares to [1 000 000 000 (one billion)] ordinary no par value shares.” Reason for and effect of special resolution number 3 As noted above, following the issue of shares pursuant to the acquisition of Maseve Investments 11 Proprietary Limited as approved by shareholders at the meeting dated 30 November 2017, the Company will only have authorised but unissued share capital of 12 292 200 shares. Accordingly, in order to facilitate future issues of shares pursuant to, inter alia, the Company’s existing employee share/option schemes, the conversion of the convertible bonds issued by the Company on 15 March 2017, and any other issues of shares which may arise from time to time, the Company wishes to increase its authorised share capital. The effect of special resolution number 2 is therefore to increase the authorised share capital of the Company from 250 000 000 (two hundred and fifty million) ordinary shares to [1 000 000 000 (one billion ordinary shares)] ordinary no par value shares and the reason for special resolution number 2 is to create additional headroom for further share issues, as contemplated above. 20. Special resolution number 4 Adoption of the amendment to the Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) “It is resolved as a special resolution that, in accordance with section 16(1)(c) of the Act, the MOI be amended as follows: a. Subject to the passing of special resolutions number 1 and 2, Schedule 1 — authorised shares — Clause 1.1 — be amended to read: 1.1  “The Company is authorised to issue [1 000 000 000 (one billion)] shares of no par value (which includes shares already issued), each of which shall entitle the holder, subject to any preferences, rights or other share terms of any class of shares in the Company ranking prior to the ordinary shares:” with sub-clauses 1.1.1 to 1.1.4 remaining unchanged. b.

Furthermore, if their concerns have not already been addressed, the Company will engage with shareholders who voted against the tabled resolutions. 8. Approval of amended and new employee share scheme rules and revised scheme share limits (ordinary resolutions numbers 13 to 16) Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited: Amendments to existing share plan and introduction of new plans Introduction Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited (the Company) embarked on the process to review and simplify its long-term incentive plans. Going forward, the Company will be utilising three long-term incentive plans, namely: >>Employee Incentive Scheme 2016 (EIS 2016) — an existing plan comprising various instruments and which is being amended to update the operation of the limits clauses >>Share Appreciation Rights Plan 2017 (SAR Plan 2017) — a new equity-settled share appreciation rights plan >>Full Share Plan 2017 (Full Share Plan 2017) — a new full share plan comprising conditional shares and forfeitable shares to be used for performance awards, bonus awards and retention awards. The purpose of this document is to provide shareholders with an overview of the changes to the EIS 2016 and to detail the salient terms of the two new plans. Employee Incentive Scheme 2016 On approval of the two new plans, the Company will no longer be making new awards under the EIS 2016; however outstanding awards, these being bonus share awards, forfeitable share awards and options, as well as legacy plan awards, but excluding any broad-based employee share plans which are regulated under the EIS 2016 (other share plans) will continue to be administered and settled in terms of the EIS 2016. The Company is cognisant of its responsibility to ensure that the introduction of the two new share plans will not result in any further dilution to shareholders. This necessitated the following changes to the EIS 2016, which are subject to shareholder approval: Company limit On approval of the two new share plans, an aggregate limit for all the plans, being the other share plans, EIS 2016, SAR Plan 2017 and Full Share Plan 2017 will be used, namely 11 750 188 shares representing 6% of the issued share capital of the Company as at the date of the upcoming AGM. The way the limit is computed in the EIS 2016 has been amended as follows: >>Shares which are settled by way of an issue of new shares or the use of treasury shares will be included in the limit >>Shares purchased in the market and shares which have been settled ahead of the exercise date will be excluded from the limit and will revert to the EIS 2016 for reallocation. Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 163 Individual limit In computing the individual limit, shares that are settled will be used. No more than 1 958 365 shares representing 1% of the issued share capital of the Company as at the date of the upcoming AGM can be settled with any one participant of the EIS 2016 and other share plans. New share plan Purpose The SAR Plan 2017 and Full Share Plan 2017 will be used as an incentive to participants to deliver the Group’s business strategy over the long term and any new awards will be made under either of these two plans. The Full Share Plan comprises conditional shares and forfeitable shares. A conditional share is a right to receive a share at a future vesting date. Forfeitable shares on the other hand are allotted shortly after the award date, but are subject to forfeiture and disposal restrictions until the vesting date. The following awards can be made under the Full Share Plan: >>Bonus awards: Awarded as forfeitable shares. The value of the bonus awards will be determined as a percentage of the annual short-term incentive. Performance is therefore considered as an entry requirement and the further vesting of the award will be subject to continued employment (the employment condition) >>Performance awards: Awarded as conditional shares, the vesting of which is subject to the satisfaction of Company performance vesting conditions (performance conditions) and the employment condition in line with the Group’s approach of performance-related incentives >>Retention awards: Awarded as forfeitable shares, the vesting of which is subject to the satisfaction of the employment condition and will be subject to the satisfaction of strategic performance vesting conditions, in specific ad hoc instances where the Remuneration Committee recognises key talent instrumental in delivering the Group’s business strategy. Under the SAR Plan equity-settled share appreciation rights can be granted which will be subject to the employment condition and may be subject to performance conditions. SAR plans are intended to be used for appointment awards and promotion awards. The employment condition and the performance condition(s) are described more fully under the heading performance conditions and vesting. SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Participants [14.1(a)] Eligible employees will include all executive directors and selected senior management of any company in the Group. Participation in the plans is not a condition of employment and the Remuneration Committee has absolute discretion to make an award to an employee in terms of the plans. Rights of participants [14.1(e)] Participants who have been granted forfeitable shares will become owners of the shares from the settlement date, shortly after the award date, and will immediately benefit from dividends and have shareholder voting rights in respect of the forfeitable shares over the employment and vesting period subject to the JSE Listings Requirements. The forfeitable shares cannot be disposed of by the participant prior to the vesting date and will be subject to forfeiture and disposal restrictions until the vesting date. Participants who have been granted conditional shares and SAR will not have any shareholders’ rights until the settlement date, which will be after the vesting date for conditional shares and after the exercise date for SAR. Basis of annual awards and award levels [14.1(f)] In line with the requirements of King IV™ and best practice, regular annual awards will be made on a consistent basis to ensure long-term shareholder value creation. The Remuneration Committee will have the discretion to determine the number of awards, by taking into consideration the employee’s salary, grade, individual performance, relevant market benchmarks, retention and incentivisation requirements at the time and the achievement of the key performance indicators of the annual short-term incentive plan for bonus awards. The Company believes that this principle will further enhance a pay for performance culture. Notwithstanding the above, overall affordability to the Company will be considered each time an award is made. 164 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING continued Performance conditions and vesting Bonus awards will be made dependent on the quantum of annual bonus earned during the previous financial year, and will be linked to performance in this manner. Bonus awards will not be subject to future performance conditions, but will be subject to the fulfilment of the employment condition, which will be three years from the date of award. Retention awards will vest over a period determined by the Board and will be made subject to the fulfilment of strategic performance conditions. Performance awards will be subject to the fulfilment of both the predetermined performance conditions and continued employment until the vesting date, which will be either the date on which the performance conditions are measured and/or three years from the date of award. SAR may be subject to performance conditions and will be subject to the employment condition, which will be three years from the date of award for a third of the award, four years from the date of award for the next third of the award and five years from the date of the award for the remaining third of the award. The Remuneration Committee will set appropriate performance conditions, performance periods, employment conditions and employment periods, as relevant, for each award, considering the business environment at the time of making the awards. These will be agreed with the participant in terms of the award letter. No vesting will take place below threshold performance, and in line with good governance principles, linear interpolation is applied for performance between threshold and target performance levels. In line with corporate governance principles, performance conditions will not be retested if they are not met at the end of the performance period, and to the extent that they are not satisfied, awards will lapse at this time. Manner of settlement Following the making of an award of forfeitable shares, settlement shall take place within 30 (thirty) days of the award date to the participant. Settlement of conditional shares and SAR will take place within a 30-day period following vesting and exercise, respectively. The rules of the plans are flexible to allow for settlement in any of the following manners: >>By way of a market purchase of shares >>Use of treasury shares >>Issue of shares. The exact method of settlement will be determined by the Remuneration Committee from time to time. Limits and adjustments Company limit The maximum number of shares which may at any one time be settled under the other share plans, EIS 2016, SAR Plan 2017 and Full Share Plan 2017 shall not exceed 11 750 188 shares, which represents approximately 6% (six percent) of the number of issued shares as at the date of the upcoming AGM. Shares issued by the Company or shares held in treasury which are used to settle all the plans referred to above will be included in the Company limit. Shares which are forfeited will be excluded in calculating the Company limit. Similarly, any shares purchased in the market in settlement of the plans will be excluded. [14.1(b)] The committee must, where required, adjust the Company limit (without the prior approval of shareholders in a general meeting), to take account of a subdivision or consolidation of the shares of the Company.

[14.3(d), (e)] Consideration [14.1(d)(i)] The participant will give no consideration upon the settlement, vesting or exercise of any award. Termination of employment [14.1(h)] Fault terminations Participants terminating employment due to resignation or dismissal on grounds of misconduct, poor performance, dishonest behaviour or fraudulent conduct or based on abscondment will be classified as “fault terminations” and will forfeit all unvested awards.

No-fault terminations Participants terminating employment due to death, ill-health, disability, injury, retrenchment, retirement and early retirement if so determined by the committee (except to the extent that it constitutes a fault termination as set out above), or the sale of a subsidiary company will be classified as a “no-fault termination” and a portion of their unvested award(s) shall vest on the date of termination of employment or as soon as possible thereafter after the performance conditions have been reviewed. This portion will reflect the number of months served since the award date to the date of termination of employment over the total number of months in the SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION respective employment periods and, if applicable, the extent to which the performance conditions have been met.

Change of control [14.1(g)] In the event of a change of control of the Company occurring before the vesting date of any award, a portion of the award will vest. The portion of the award which shall vest will reflect the number of complete months served since the award date to the change of control date, over the total number of months in the respective employment periods. In respect of performance awards and retention awards which are subject to performance conditions, the Remuneration Committee will calculate whether and the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied by reference to the immediately preceding financial year and the number of complete months served since the award date to the change of control date, over the total number of months in the respective employment periods. 166 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING continued Variation of share capital In the event of a variation in share capital such as a capitalisation issue, subdivision of shares, consolidation of shares etc. participants shall continue to participate in the plans but the Remuneration Committee may make such adjustment to the award or take such other action to place participants in no worse a position than they were in prior to the occurrence of the relevant event and to provide that the fair value of the award immediately after the event is materially the same as the fair value of the award immediately before the event. In the event of a rights issue, a participant will be entitled to normal shareholder rights and will participate in any rights issue in respect of their forfeitable shares. The issue of shares as consideration for an acquisition, and the issue of shares or a vendor consideration placing will not be regarded as a circumstance that requires any adjustment to awards. Liquidation If the Company is placed into liquidation, other than for purposes of reorganisation, any award shall ipso facto lapse as from the liquidation date. [14.1(e)] Amendment [14.2] The Remuneration Committee may alter or vary the rules of the SAR Plan 2017 and the Full Share Plan 2017 as it sees fit, however, in the following instances the plans may not be amended without the prior approval of the JSE and a resolution by the shareholders of 75% of the voting rights: >>The category of persons who are eligible for participation >>The number of shares which may be utilised for the plans >>The individual limitations on benefits or maximum entitlements >>The basis upon which awards are made >>The amount payable upon the award, settlement or vesting of an award >>The voting, dividend, transfer and other rights attached to the awards, including those arising on a liquidation of the Company >>The adjustment of awards in the event of a variation of capital of the Company or a change of control of the Company >>The procedure to be adopted in respect of the vesting of awards in the event of termination of employment. Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 167 General The amended rules of the EIS 2016 and rules of the SAR Plan 2017 and Full Share Plan 2017 are available for inspection from Monday, 26 March 2018 to Monday, 9 April 2018 at the Company’s registered office, No 1 Monte Casino Boulevard, The Pivot, Block C, 4th Floor, Fourways, South Africa. In terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, the passing of ordinary resolutions numbers 13 to 16 requires the approval of a 75% majority of the voting rights. 9. Financial assistance to related and inter-related parties (special resolution number 1) In terms of section 45 of the Act, shareholders are required to approve, by way of a special resolution, any director or related or inter-related party loans. Given that such financial assistance exists between the companies within the Group and may be required in future, shareholders are requested to consider and grant such general authority, which shall be renewed every 2 (two) years. The purpose of this special resolution is to grant the directors of the Company the authority to authorise the Company to provide direct or indirect financial assistance as contemplated in section 45 of the Act to any one or more related or inter-related companies within the Group. 10. Increase in authorised share capital and amendment to the MOI (special resolutions numbers 2 and 3) The reason for special resolutions numbers 2 and 3 is to increase the authorised share capital of the Company to accommodate future issues of ordinary shares resulting in an amendment to the MOI of the Company to give effect to such increase in ordinary share capital as described in the resolutions tabled. The effect of special resolutions numbers 2 and 3 will be that the ordinary share capital of the Company will be increased to 500 000 000 million ordinary shares with the addition of 250 000 000 million ordinary shares of no par value. 11. Non-executive directors’ fees (special resolution number 4) In terms of King III and the Act, the shareholders of the Company are required to approve by special resolution the fees to be paid to non-executive directors. Please see the remuneration report on page 137 for additional information on non-executive director fees. SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION The Board believes that the proposed fees are competitive enough and will enable the Company to retain and attract people of the calibre required to make a meaningful contribution to the Company, having regard to the appropriate capability, skills and experience required. The Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee, recommends to shareholders that these fees be approved. 12. General authority to repurchase shares (special resolution number 5) The effect of special resolution number 5 and the reason for this resolution is to grant the Company or any of its subsidiaries a general approval in terms of the MOI, the Act and the JSE Listings Requirements, to acquire the Company’s shares, which general approval shall be valid until the earlier of such next AGM of the Company or its variation or revocation of such general authority by special resolution at any subsequent general meeting of the Company, provided that the general authority shall not extend beyond 15 (fifteen) months from the date of this AGM. The directors are of the opinion that it would be in the best interests of the Company to approve this general authority and thereby allow the Company or any of its subsidiaries to be in a position to repurchase the securities issued by the Company through the order book of the JSE, should the market conditions, tax dispensation and price justify such an action. 168 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2017 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING continued STATUTORY DISCLOSURE Proxies In terms of section 58 of the Act, a shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM is entitled to appoint a proxy or two or more proxies to attend, participate in and vote at the meeting in place of the shareholder.
