The main industry in which we operate is exposed to rapid changes in consumers’ behaviour and expectations, and the new options available to them. In this new environment, thanks to the adaptability that has characterised our company since the beginning, we have continued to bolster our leadership position with good results. We have met our targets, improved our solvency and shown once again that we are a solid company with a balanced business model and a bright future. NEINVER has a unique corporate vision that lets it compete effectively throughout Europe. Its model, developed successfully over the last 49 years, is based on five priorities: • Business diversification • Specialisation in the outlet sector over the past 20 years • Managing every phase of the property cycle • The brand’s strength in our major markets • Investing in innovation, which lets us digitally transform our industry. For example, we pioneered the outlet sector’s first omnichannel platform. In 2017, we continued to take new decisive steps in our growth plan: we obtained the final permit to develop a new outlet centre in the French Alps, we strengthened our strategic alliance with TH Real Estate by acquiring FACTORY Ursus in Warsaw, and we acquired 40,000 m² of property in Spain to develop a new logistics facility, among other highlights. Additionally, in May 2018, we and our partner The Prague Outlet opened our first outlet centre in the Czech Republic: Prague The Style Outlets. This centre, which won the trust of our brands, perfectly echoes the architectural style of Prague’s city centre and has an excellent location less than 5 minutes from the airport. Moreover, NEINVER remains committed to innovation and sustainability as defining values in everything we do. This broad effort has been reflected in two awards we won in 2017, of which I am especially proud: the joint BREEAM/GRESB award for Corporate Investment in Responsible Real Estate, and the prize for Best Business Practices in Digital Transformation, awarded by KPMG and the Spanish media outlet El Confidencial. In a fast-changing environment, it is vital to be flexible and adaptable so we can stay relevant in the sector. Our customers’ world never stops. Nor does ours. They no longer visit a centre only to shop but also to have a good time, and they expect a personalised, comfortable, entertaining experience from us. In this context, finding our way can be a real challenge, but I trust that we at NEINVER have the vision, the entrepreneurial drive and the talent to turn the achievements reflected in this Report into future successes. “NEINVER has a unique corporate vision that We thank all the clients who put their faith in us year after year, and above all, we thank all our employees in the seven European countries where we operate, for their excellent work in 2017. They continue to lets it compete effectively throughout Europe. inspire us every day. Our business model has been developed Madrid, July 2018 José María Losantos y del Campo successfully over the last 49 years.” Chairman 6 2017 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ANNUAL REPORT 7 Message from the CEO (102-14) The effort and work carried out throughout 2017 produced very positive results for the company. In the outlet sector, the brands that do business in the centres we manage in Europe saw their sales rise to €917 million, up 5% from 2016, while the number of visitors increased to a total of 41.7 million. These results continue the growth we have maintained in recent years, and they highlight the success of our management model. Aware that we work in an industry filled with challenges and opportunities, in 2017 we began renovating several centres to continue increasing their value and offering our visitors a unique shopping experience. In the course of these refurbishments, we are improving features such as the food offer, leisure areas, common spaces, and general services. Besides opening our first outlet centre in the Czech Republic in May, we have other new properties in development in Amsterdam, in the French Alps and in Werl, Germany, with which we will keep expanding our portfolio and our leadership position in Europe. One of the growth strategies defined in our strategic plan is to form alliances with top-level partners. In 2017, we strengthened our partnership with TH Real Estate through the purchase of FACTORY Ursus, in Poland, from IRUS European Retail Property Fund. Neptune, our joint venture that has grown quickly since its formation in 2014, now has a portfolio totalling 11 outlet centres and 2 retail parks in Europe. In our commitment to working with local partners, NEINVER bolstered its presence in Germany by assuming management of Fashion Outlet Montabaur, which has now joined our portfolio as Montabaur The Style Outlets. The industrial and logistics sector is an important part of NEINVER and plays a bigger role in the structure of our earnings every year. Our ongoing alliance with Colony NorthStar now has a portfolio of 37 logistics assets and 256,000 m² of gross leasable area. At NEINVER, we firmly believe that our growth as a company must be linked to sustainability and social responsibility. That has been in the DNA of our management ever since the company was founded in 1969, and is a basic commitment in all our activities. So in 2016 and 2017, we renewed the BREEAM In-Use environmental certifications of all the centres we manage in Europe, improving on our previous average score. Aware of how important it is to minimise our environmental footprint, in 2017 we reduced our energy consumption by 5.5% and greenhouse gas emissions by 13%. In 2017, we also continued the digital transformation of our business model. We are on track to leverage the opportunities that this represents and to offer an experience consistent with new shopping habits. To that end, we have been implementing innovative technologies in the centres and have expanded our e-commerce platform in Spain. Implementing our strategy and achieving our goals requires an ingredient that is decisive in any organisation: the staff. NEINVER has an experienced team with outstanding management skills. Clearly, 2018 is also a year full of opportunities, and I trust we will be able to seize them thanks to the people who work for the “Aware that we work in an industry filled Group across Europe. The people are what makes this company stand out. Thanks to their enthusiasm and dedication, we can continue to lead the way in a highly competitive industry. with challenges and opportunities, in 2017 we began renovating several centres Madrid, July 2018 Daniel Losantos Egea CEO to continue increasing their value and offering our visitors a unique shopping experience” 1 NEINVER PROFILE 10 2017 ANNUAL REPORT.

Aware of the importance of protecting the planet, assuring prosperity for all and joining forces to overcome the global challenges now facing society, NEINVER wants to support the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.

In this context, NEINVER has also continued working on a CRM system as a channel for communication with its direct clients, giving them access to all of the centres’ information in real time. CORPORATE DASHBOARD The goal of this project is to automate the principal financial and business indicators and offer a global vision of the centres, letting the company improve its clients’ experience and management. For a company-wide view of the organisation’s activities, NEINVER began work in 2017 to integrate environmental indicators into this corporate dashboard, connecting it to the Building Management Systems that measure all of a centre’s environmental parameters. GEOLOCATION NEINVER continues using three geolocation options: mobile applications, Wi-Fi and Gennion sensors. They are all integrated into the company’s OMNI-CRM system. The system’s functionality was improved in 2017, allowing real-time identification of when a user visits a shop, triggering a message or content that will interest that person. For 2018, there are plans to upgrade the information design, the timing of when the user can see it, and which channel is most appropriate for that type of customer.
