This education programme can help people to achieve the required financial understanding, which can be used to keep standards of living at a reasonable level. To SUSTAINABLE ENERGY promote this education programme, the Bank has a large number of initiatives underway. One of the them is the Qassit learning game, whereby pupils The BANK of Greenland wishes to support and in the upper school grades can learn about budgpromote development in using sustainable energy eting and managing their personal finances. sources.

The BANK of Greenland offers flexible repayment, so that after three years the entrepreneur can convert the loan to actual capital in the company. “Greenland’s best company – for the benefit of Greenland” is implemented particularly in the voluntary work undertaken by the Bank’s employees every year.The Bank assigns working hours to CSR work, as social activities for the benefit of children and young people, as well as educational and environmental, cultural Association for and sporting activities. In 2017, the Bank’s employees delivered Greenlandic drum dancers 778 hours. The figure fluctuates from year to year, depending on whether there are major events taking place which require a lot of volunteers. The Bank also cooperates more systematically with a number of organisations to which the Bank’s employees contribute working hours on a voluntary basis. There is also systematic cooperation with the NGO CSR Greenland.This cooperation has taken place since 2011, and the BANK of Greenland’s director, Martin Kviesgaard, is vice chairman of its board of directors. Besides exchanging ideas on various initiatives for the benefit of society, the annual cleaning-up day in towns and cities is a recurring project under CSR Greenland, in which the BANK of Greenland has served as coordinator in most of the towns in which it has branches.

As described, the key areas are infringements the Bank will seek to rectify this as naturally related to the SDGs in terms of focusing far as possible. This includes actions by employees, on the same areas. customers, suppliers and other business partners. CSR Report 2017 Section 3a 17 ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY In the spring of 2014, an overall environmental policy was drawn up and adopted, n i a k iki nn er s in p based on the Bank’s support for UNGC. The overall objective of the BANK of t aa Greenland’s environmental responsibility is continuous awareness of including na q sustainability and environmental considerations in our activities, on a sustainable Nu 2.90% business and economic basis. We ensure this by identifying and monitoring our key environmental impacts, initiating procedures to limit the consumption of resources, sharing our knowledge and experience, and giving employees, ån suppliers and customers the best opportunities to act on an environmentally øl responsible basis. In 2017 we continued this work of systematising our enviG rø ilj nl a nd em ronmental efforts, which helps to reduce the Bank’s costs, attract and retain s b i l l i gs t employees, customers and investors, and enhance cooperation with authorities and suppliers. The BANK of Greenland continues to focus on facilitating its customers’ sustainable investments. One element is our environmental loan product, TOTAL Nutarsaaneq, whereby customers can take loans of up to DKK 300,000 on favourable terms, on the basis of a normal credit assessment. These loans are for both private and business customers and can be used for energy improvements. Use of these loans has been increasing in recent years. At year-end 2017, a total of 394 Nutarsaaneq loans had been established, compared to 360 in 2016. 935 LOANS IN 2017 The Bank’s Minguik eco-car loan to purchase ecofriendly cars in energy class A totalled 541 loans in 2017. For comparison, 312 loans were established in 2016. In 2015, we lowered the interest rate for the two environmental loans, which is now at 2.90%.The low level of interest rates continued in 2017. TOTAL The BANK of Greenland itself also sets a good example in terms of using 672 sustainable energy sources. Since 2014, solar panels have been installed on the Bank’s buildings, and in 2017 the last panels were installed at the Sisimiut-branch. Concrete reduction statistics will thus not be available until 2018. Electricity consumption was reduced significantly in several towns up to 2016, LOANS IN 2016 but has increased a little in 2017. It is noteworthy, however, that particularly in Maniitsoq and Aasiaat, which do not have hydropower, solar panels produce 33% of electricity consumption in Maniitsoq and more than 50% in Aasiaat. In 2017, total electricity consumption increased by 7,326 kWh compared to 2016, as Qaqortoq, Ilulissat and Sisimiut have switched from oil to electricity solely generated by hydropower. In Aasiaat, electricity consumption almost doubled during some periods, due to conversion of the branch. In Maniitsoq and Aasiaat, once again in 2017 the solar panel systems even produced surplus electricity, which was sold to Nukissiorfiit for use in the rest of the town’s electricity grid.

In 2017, the Bank reduced printing by 27,606 pages, equivalent to a decrease of 5% Section 3b HUMAN RIGHTS A fundamental element of UNGC’s goals is to work for gender equality, and the BANK of Greenland has the overall goal at management level of achieving and maintaining equal ratios of men and women in its management. In 2013, the BANK of Greenland’s Board of Directors adopted “Policy and target levels” for the under-represented gender. Irrespective of gender, the BANK of Greenland’s employees must experience that they have equal opportunities for career development and management positions. As at the end of 2017, the distribution ratio was 45% women and 55% men. The Bank’s objective is for the ratio of managers of the under-represented gender to be held at minimum 40%. In 2017, the gender distribution of the BANK of Greenland’s members of the Board of Directors elected by the annual general meeting comprised 16.67% women and 83.33% men.The Board of Directors’ objective is for the ratio of female members of the Board of Directors elected by the annual general meeting to increase to 33% by 2020 at the latest. Back in 2016, the BANK of Greenland prepared a social media policy. This policy first and foremost ensures employees’ freedom of expression and protection from digital harassment. Since inappropriate conduct on the social media can have legal employment consequences, the policy must also explicitly define current guidelines and provide guidance on good conduct. Another element of the BANK of Greenland’s CSR work is that the initiative has been taken to incorporate the UN’s human rights principles in supplier contracts.This work will promote knowledge of and responsibility for observing the UN’s human rights policy. In 2016, the Bank contacted the principal subsuppliers in order to update supplier conditions in accordance with our obligation towards the UNGC. As a result, 22 subsuppliers have signed up to confirm their obligations under the UN’s human rights principles. In addition, five suppliers have so far refused to sign the declaration. The Bank still cooperates with these suppliers, as they are considered to be essential to the Bank’s operations and activities as a financial institution. The Bank will engage in ongoing dialogue with new subsuppliers in order to promote knowledge of and responsibility for observing the UN’s human rights policy.

Bastian Nystrup Financial trainee in the BANK of Greenland Section 3d ANTI-CORRUPTION The BANK of Greenland works with all aspects of anti-corruption, including preventing extortion and bribery. In 2014 the BANK of Greenland therefore adopted a gift policy which lays down rules for which gifts employees may receive (and their value). The policy also sets out guidelines for how, for example, employees should handle services for which there is an expectation of receiving something in return. In 2014 the Bank also adopted an anti-corruption policy that, among other things, stipulates zero tolerance towards conflicts of interest, bribery, extortion, fraud, embezzlement, misuse of gifts and nepotism. All of the Bank’s employees have received training in the gift and anti-corruption policies. In accordance with the BANK of Greenland’s overall CSR policy and the BANK of Greenland’s environmental policy, the BANK of Greenland’s anti-corruption policy is published at Banken.gl. The policies were not challenged in 2017. At the BANK of Greenland we also continuously register and monitor our customer complaints so that we can optimally ensure balanced and fair case handling, and improve our service and information. It is in the Bank’s own interest to handle all relevant complaints in accordance with current guidelines and so that customers understand the Bank’s reasons for refusing loans and other similar transactions. In 2017, we received 11 complaints. This is seven fewer than in 2016. Of these 11 cases, four complaints were recognised in full or in part, which is one less recognised complaint than in 2016. In 2015, we also established a separate new complaints process reserved for business customers. So far, we have not received any complaints via this channel. CSR Report 2017 25 PRIVATE BANKING DEPARTMENT 2017: 11 COMPLAINTS 2016: 18 COMPLAINTS BUSINESS DEPARTMENT 2017: 0 COMPLAINTS 2016: 0 COMPLAINTS In addition, in 2016 the Bank introduced a whistleblower scheme on an equal footing with other Danish banks, so that employees can file anonymous reports if they experience any matters at the Bank which may be in conflict with human rights or legislation.

Out of 100 possible index provement. points, the BANK of Greenland scored 75.5 index points in 2017. This is slightly below the level for 2016. This achieves the target for 2017, however, which was set lower than in 2016. The expected lower target is due to prioritisation of action areas which do not have the same CSR return as in 2016. For a number of years, the Bank’s employee satisfaction score has been high, and has exceeded the average for the financial sector.
