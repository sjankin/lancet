We must consider ­sustainability in all major decision-making in order to detect early any possible risks to our business processes, reduce our ecological footprint, and steadily grow our positive impact on society. We are aware of the responsibility we bear, not only for our economic ­performance but also for the environment, our employees, and society as a whole. Our corporate culture is based on strong values. We consider the interests of our stakeholder groups and are always examining how we can best align our actions to meet our responsibilities. This sustainability report provides an overview of the areas on which our efforts last year focused and what we accomplished. 4 Content krones compact Employee-related Respect for Social matters matters human rights Statement by the An overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37 Our attitudes and actions . . . . . . . . . . 20 An overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61 Executive Board . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9 Capable, motivated workforce Stakeholder dialogue – An overThe Executive Board . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 view of our stakeholders Recruiting the right people . . . . . 38 KRONES at a glance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 Customers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62 High level of employee Systems and Lifecycle Service – loyalty . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43 Shareholders . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63 performance matters . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 Sustainable, purposeful Employees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 64 KRONEs ag at a glance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16 training and continuing Suppliers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65 Economic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 education . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 46 Scientists and academia . . . . . . . . . . 66 Production sites . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19 Occupational safety and health Associations, NGOs, Our attitudes and actions . . . . . . . . . . 20 Effective health and policy-makers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 66 What does CSR mean management . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 The general public at KRONES? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21 Effective occupational health and the media . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 67 Report from the CSR Committee . . 22 and safety management . . . . . . . . . 53 Cultural and Krones AG’s CSR Committee . . . . . . . . 24 Goals and actions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56 social institutions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 67 Sustainability at Krones . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26 Suitable communication Our sustainability report . . . . . . . . . . . . 28 channels for all target groups . . . . . . 69 Materiality matrix . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 Goals and actions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 73 Goals and actions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32 5 Customer satisfaction Environmental matters Other About this Sustainability Report An overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 77 An overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 85 Glossary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 110 This Sustainability Report covers External assurance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 111 KRONES AG and is based on the Global Fast, individualised service Sustainability in our supply chain Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Sustainfor customers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78 Suppliers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 86 Publication credits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 112 ability Reporting Guidelines.

Since then, the range of topics on which we report has grown considerably. All content is aligned with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines. We are also glad to have our efforts compared with those of other companies in the industry – for instance by having our performance evaluated by various rating agencies. Policymakers have recently expanded the reporting requirements for listed companies. The changes, which are laid out in the CSR Directive Implementation Act, apply for the first time to the financial year 2017. To meet our obligation under the Act, we published our first-ever Non-financial Report for 2017. The new reporting requirement means certain changes for readers of our CSR Report. Fundamental information about the strategic orientation and positioning of non-­financial aspects in our business development – that is, our management approaches – is now presented in our Non-financial Report. Additional information, which we view as an important complement to the Non-financial Report, will still be covered in our CSR Report. For us, the main sustainability-related topics remain unchanged: recruiting and In an effort to minimise the impact ­developing highly competent employees, conserving resources in all of our pro­ of our business activities, we are improving material efficiency and duction activities, and ensuring that our machines and lines are designed with the optimising processes in freight for­future in mind.

With enviro, we are addressing our customers’ desire to produce as efficiently as possible – a challenge to which our research and development team dedicates great energy. Our digitalisation products and solutions are also aimed at achieving the highest possible efficiency – a topic that was the focus of ­considerable attention at the industry’s premier trade fair, the drinktec, in Munich last year. Our daily activities focus not only on machines and lines but also on people. In particular, close dialogue with our customers and the users of our products in markets around the world is very important to us. Our employees also showed incredible commitment to this goal last year. For that and for their continued dedication to all matters concerning our company, I offer my sincere thanks and that of the entire ­Executive Board.

Innovative digitalisation and intralogistics solutions round out our portfolio. KRONES’ customers include breweries, beverage producers, and companies from the food, chemical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Services are an important part of ­KRONES’ business model. The company maintains service centres and ­offices around the world. Major markets and competitive position Customers in the beverage industry account for most of KRONES’ ­revenue. The remaining revenue comes from business in non-beverage ­sectors (food, dairy, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics). KRONES is heavily export-oriented, generating almost 90% of revenue outside Germany. The regional breakdown of revenue is well balanced overall. KRONES generated around 45% of its revenue in industrialised countries and around 55% in the rapidly growing emerging markets in 2017. Apart from a few large companies that are part of a corporate group, KRONES competes with a number of smaller companies that offer only individual bottling and packaging products. Most of our main competitors are based in the euro area. Chinese manufacturers have primarily competed against KRONES for orders on their home market. As a full-service provider, KRONES is able to distinguish itself from most of its competitors. Our global service portfolio, which enables us to ­provide fast service to customers on-site, is a crucial advantage. Overall, KRONES is the world’s leading manufacturer of bottling and packaging equipment. krones compact | KRONES at a glance Systems and Lifecycle Service – performance matters 13 krones compact KRONES delivers turnkey plants to the beverage and liquid food industry. We use our unique mix of expertise to keep our customers’ investment and operating costs low. Of equal importance, we enable our customers to produce reliably and at the highest level of quality.

We also provide complete logistics systems, supply and dis­ posal systems, and custom IT and digitalisation solutions that manage and document all production processes. In addition, we support our customers with excellent, 24/7 after-sales service. That is crucial to ensuring the beverage plants deliver consistently high performance. KRONES’ Lifecycle Service (LCS) experts are not just service providers – they are partners to our customers. Together, we find the best solutions for achieving production that is efficient, secure, reliable, and cost-effective.

That means that, in our business activities, we give equal importance to economic targets, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility. Only in this way can we provide for the needs of future human rights ­generations. We joined the UN Global Compact in 2012 and are committed to its ten principles as the basis of our corporate governance. It is also important to us that we show our business partners, investors, employees, and the general public that we accept responsibility and reflect it in our business processes. KRONES’ mission statement Our customers around the world are primarily in the food and beverage (liquid food) industry. We provide them with machinery, lines, and systems, including all related services, that are the best in every respect.

Our global network enables us to provide fast, cost-effective, high-quality ­service – anytime, anywhere around the world. All strategic decisions are aimed at ensuring the company’s sustainable development. Even when optimising profits and cash flow in the short term, we still keep sustain­ ability sharply in focus. That makes KRONES a dependable partner for our customers, ­employees, shareholders, and suppliers. Our financial strength gives us independence. We use resources wisely in order to safeguard this freedom for the long term. Our sites around the world form a global value chain that serves as the very foundation of our success. Each of our core modules is built at only one site, with exceptional cost-­ effectiveness. These sites concentrate our expertise and experience in the relevant ­technology.

For that reason, we joined the UN Global Compact in 2012 and have since made its ten principles the basis of all of our actions. To ensure compliance with these principles companywide, we have integrated them into our Code of Conduct and other company guidelines and policies. An important element here is our Suppliers’ Code, with which we hope to instil the same commitment to sustainability among our vendors. We act in accordance with the Precautionary Principle as laid out in the Rio Declaration and apply this approach to our overarching corporate strategy. Other memberships in industry platforms such as ecovadis and Sedex and the ­Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) give our stakeholders several ways to obtain information about our CSR performance. Our Value strategy stands on four pillars: quality, profitability, growth, and innovaGrowth tion. Each of these pillars contains aspects that relate to doing business sustainably. Profitability Thus, CSR is integrated into our daily business practices. That is also evident in the Innovation awareness our employees at every level show in their work day by day and in the ­numerous suggestions our employees have submitted for further sustainability-­ related activities. Quality Because we have made sustainability efforts part of our daily operations and support its continued development with specific concepts and actions, we are continually improving and implementing goals step by step. The management approaches we follow are based on our overarching Value strategy. Our communications on all topics relating to CSR and sustainability are based on this fundamental principle. Many customers and investors use this information for their own business decision-making. krones compact | What does CSR mean at KRONES? 22 Report from the CSR Committee The CSR Committee consists of members from within and outside the company who support KRONES’ CSR activities with ideas and inspiration. The CSR Committee met twice in the financial year 2017 to discuss current developments and actions. The krones compact ­company’s CEO and Supervisory Board Chairman both took part in these meetings, ensuring that information was exchanged with the senior decision-makers. The new CSR reporting requirements that took effect in 2017 necessitate new processes and organisation. For that reason, the CSR Committee will not continue in its current form. In particular, changes to the resolution process and the necessity of gradually rolling out CSR activities across the group companies contributed to this decision. Thus, in coordination with the CEO and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, ­KRONES’ CSR Officer declared that the CSR Committee shall be dissolved as of the end of 2017 and thanked its members for their work. Topics of focus for the CSR Committee in 2017 Projects overview  Employee-related matters We developed a new working time model based on employees’ desire for more flexible forms of work and ways to better reconcile work with their personal lives. The “mobile work” pilot project, which was launched at the start of 2017, was ­designed as a means to test the model in practice in KRONES’ operations. If it goes well, it will become part of our regular operations.  Compliance activities The group-wide rollout of the compliance management system is nearing completion. One area of focus was internal communications at all KRONES sites. The compliance training programme and anti-corruption training are continuing.  enviro 2.0 – sustainable products We intend to take the potential for energy, media, and environmental compati­ bility into even greater account in the earliest stages of the product development process. We continue to develop and implement long-term optimisation measures aimed at reducing consumption. By establishing illustrative calculations of savings – for example, our calculation of design parameters for our EquiTherm energy recovery system in the brewhouse – we are able to generate concrete, trackable reductions. For example, the installation of 30 EquiTherm systems ­resulted in a total theoretical reduction in CO2 emissions of 111,368 metric tonnes. krones compact | Report from the CSR Committee 23 krones compact Charitable contributions and sponsoring strategy In order to achieve a higher level of efficiency and oversight of our charitable ­giving and sponsorship activities, the team responsible for CSR at Krones has ­further developed and optimised our existing strategy for goals, target groups, actions, and processes. In addition, a new CSR-related giving project was proposed and various options discussed within the CSR Committee.  Sustainability activities The CSR project coordinator gave the CSR Committee a progress report on the CSR rollout for sites outside Germany, information on actions to meet our CSR reporting obligations, and information about the assessment of our sustainability ­performance by external rating agencies. krones compact | Report from the CSR Committee 24 KRONES AG’s CSR Committee krones compact The CSR Team brings together representatives From left to right: Volker Kronseder, Chairman of the Supervisory from the various stakeholder groups and collabBoard, follows the CSR topics from the perspecProf. Dr.-Ing.

Sustainability is a company-wide responsibility and falls within the direct purview of the Chairman of the Executive Board (CEO). Clear roles and responsibilities have krones compact been defined for the individual technical areas, which carry out the work of a sustainable business strategy at the operational level. CSR Officer The CSR Officer serves as the link between the Executive Board and the CSR specialist teams. The CSR Officer coordinates and manages all CSR activities and is the point of contact for internal and external stakeholders. CSR specialist teams The CSR Officer cooperates closely Representatives from various departments make up the individual CSR specialist with the specialist teams and drives teams, which deal with topics relating to employee-related matters, environmental CSR topics there. matters, innovation, customer satisfaction, social matters, and human rights. They develop goals and actions for their respective area of responsibility and identify ­potential for continually improving our sustainability performance.

That is essential for ensuring KRONES’ long-term development. Profitability and innovative products are crucial. But responsible stewardship of resources and treating people – employees, customers, and business partners – with respect are just as important to us. KRONES AG has lived by these principles for many years. In 2007, we published our first CSR report. In the years that followed, we gradually expanded on our reporting, in order to provide more and more information on our activities relating to the environment, social standards, and corporate governance. In 2012, we joined the UN Global Compact. At the same time, we began to align our reporting with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Since then, we have provided a broad overview of the various aspects of our efforts with respect to sustainability. Our first Non-financial Report, published this year for the financial year 2017, takes our sustainability reporting to a new level. In it, we present the same topics as previously reported on but in condensed form and tie them closely to our financial reporting. Details about actions taken are still reported in our CSR Report, which supplements the contents of the Non-financial Report. As ever, we firmly believe that profitability and sustainability go hand in hand. Volker Kronseder Chairman of the Supervisory Board 28 Our sustainability report This Sustainability Report covers the year 2017 and thus continues the annual ­sequence of publication. Our sustainability reporting is based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines. krones compact We have made a number of changes to this report compared with the prior-year ­report. Most of these changes resulted from new legal requirements to integrate non-financial information into our Annual Report. Therefore, we have reviewed and updated all of our activities relating to all aspects of sustainability reporting. In particular, we revamped our materiality analysis, which resulted in some changes. Some The process we used to update our topics were renamed and all topics are now assigned to a total of seven instead of the list of the material topics is preprevious four aspects. The process of updating the material topics is presented on sented on page 30 of this report. page 30 of this year’s report. The revisions make it clearer, to which categories each ­individual activity relates and who bears responsibility. It also enables us to better present the potential for action. In addition, some topics are no longer reported on separately since they now fall within the scope of others. HR statistics presented in this report Another change relates to the scope of the report itself. Since the concepts presented relate to Krones AG. Unlike in the currently apply only at the national level, we have decided to limit the scope of this Non-financial Report, the figures in ­report to Krones AG. this report do not include employees of the BKK health insurance fund.

Where we have previously incorporated economic data and an assessment of risks and opportunities into this report, we now ­refer to the krones compact Annual Report for all such information – one exception being that we have retained the overview of key financial performance indicators. We also refer to the Non-financial Report for information on all management concepts in order to avoid duplicating information. The chapter on compliance and all data relating to our CO2 reduction target have been transferred entirely to the Non-financial Report. Besides the changes listed above, the report content has also undergone some other ­modifications. This is the last year in which we will publish a report from the CSR Committee. The Committee was dissolved as of the end of 2017. We are redesigning the way our CSR activities are integrated into our organisation. In the “Environmental matters” chapter, we have updated our calculation of CO2 emissions. The new calculation does not significantly change our emissions trend. As in the past, we are not presenting Scope 3 emissions relating to shipments sent by sea freight since our process of destination clustering and the emissions calculator of our sea freight provider entail too much imprecision. On the other hand, we have expanded the information provided in the chapter “Sustainability in our supply chain” to include our PET recycling portfolio since it enables us to help the downstream supply chain – our customers – reduce the impact of their products on the environment. The 2017 Sustainability Report has been reviewed and approved by the Chairman of the Executive Board. As in the previous year, this report has been subject to an ­external assurance review by TÜV SÜD. The criteria and standards applied are presented in the auditing organisation’s certification (see inside cover). KRONES AG has no relationship with the auditing organisation beyond the engagement to perform an assurance audit of our management system. Our Executive Board and Super­ visory Board supported the external assurance process. krones compact | Our sustainability report 30 Materiality matrix Materiality analysis The newly developed materiality matrix and its contents build on the matrix we krones compact have presented in our CSR Reports in previous years. It is based on GRI ­criteria and the definition of materiality under Section 289c (3) of the German C ­ ommercial Code (HGB). We used the items that had been deemed material in the previous years as our starting point. After examining them in a stakeholder analysis, we bundled our key stakeholders’ demands in a prioritised list. Our next step was to analyse the list with respect to business impact. Our executive management then evaluated the topics, taking into account the following: risk potential, efficiency p ­ otential, differentiation potential, and growth potential for Krones. The final ­prioritisation and positioning of the key items was based on assessment of the ­stakeholder and business impact analyses. The materiality matrix was approved by the Executive Board. 3 1 2 3 13 21 8 22 9 12 2.5 15 10 16 11 2 4 14 17 6 5 18 Business impact 20 1.5 19 1 7 0.5 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 Stakeholder impact Arbeitnehmerbelange Bekämpfung von Korruption und Bestechung Leistungsfähige und motivierte Belegschaft 12 Nachvollziehbare, klare Kundenbeziehung 1 Hohe Mitarbeiterbindung 13 Pflichtgemäßes Verhalten und Befolgen 2 Nachhaltige, zielgerichtete Ausund Weiterbildung rechtlicher Normen und Gesetze krones compact | Materiality matrix 3 Gewinnnung der richtigen Mitarbeiter 14 Dokumentation und Transparenz 31 Employee-related matters Anti-corruption and bribery matters (compliance) Capable, motivated workforce krones compact 1 High level of employee loyalty 12 Clear, transparent relationships with customers 2 Sustainable, purposeful training and 13 Dutiful conduct and compliance with regulations continuing education and laws 3 Recruiting the right people 14 Documentation and transparency Occupational safety and health 4 Effective health management Customer satisfaction 5 Effective occupational safety management 15 Fast, individual service for customers Diversity 16 Long-term, personalised customer care 6 Balanced employee structure (diversity) Environmental matters Social matters Environmental matters relating to production 7 Social commitment (corporate citizenship) 17 Reducing pollution and hazardous materials 18 Energy and media conservation in production operations 19 Making optimum use of production materials Innovation Environmental matters relating to products 8 Responding flexibly to market changes 20 Energy and media efficiency and environmental 9 Technological leadership sustainability of our products 10 Use of industry knowledge and research findings 11 Lean manufacturing (TPM) Sustainability in our supply chain 21 Sustainability in our supply chain Respect for human rights 22 Respect for human rights krones compact | Materiality matrix 32 Company – Goals and actions Goals Actions Target Sensitise and motivate our employees with respect Regular articles on CSR in the employee magazine KRONES world krones compact to sustainability and responsible action Topics integrated into editorial calendar ongoing Annual sustainability report Sustainability Report in accordance with GRI Guidelines, version G4 ongoing Update the “sustainability” section of our Intranet ongoing Include the krones Centres in our sustainability Provide information on requirements under GRI Guidelines reporting Data survey on selected indicators is being expanded and made more detailed in progress Developing concept for 2018 data collection in progress Sensitise plant managers complete Further develop CSR strategy Develop sustainability topics relevant to the company and prepare action plan Ongoing CSR Workshop series with the departments ongoing Improve our sustainability rating Communicate with analysts, investors, and customers on sustainable ­investment Participating in customer events and providing information about ­ sustainability activities ongoing Increasing communication with analysts ongoing Launch KRONES Intranet at our sites worldwide Roll out Intranet group-wide Intranet is used worldwide, also for regional topics ongoing Increase profitability, bringing EBT margin Implement “Value” strategy programme with defined programmes and up to a ­ pprox. 7% initiatives Value targets: 7/8/22 (see Annual R ­ eport) Continually improving key performance indicators (see Krones Group 7% revenue growth per year on average annual report) ongoing 8% EBT margin 22% working capital to revenue ratio Update the integrated management system (IMS) Transfer certification type from “Community” to “Matrix”.

Their itinerary included Krones’ Rosenheim plant. The plant is the KRONES Group’s second-largest production site and the biggest employer in the region. Mr. Steinmeier toured the production halls and learned about the company. At the start of the tour, CEO Christoph Klenk provided a brief overview of the company and its areas of operation, pointing out that KRONES machines and lines are in operation in 156 countries around the globe. Steinmeier appeared to be particularly ­impressed with the company’s strong presence abroad. Mr. Steinmeier viewed the assembly, module production, and final assembly halls. The visit also showcased our ­in-house training programmes. Germany’s president showed great interest in the large number of training ­opportunities that Krones offers young people. Young people in training demonstrated technology and solutions at several stops along the tour. Employees enjoyed the open, direct communication with Mr. Steinmeier and his wife and the great interest they showed in them and their work. 34 Employee-related matters Our workplace rehabilitation management (WRM) works: We reintegrated 60 employees from long-term sick leave. 60 The employee turnover rate at KRONES AG was 2.6% The rate of in 2017. accidents 2.6% per 1,000 employees was 19.8% in 2017. 19.8% 35 14% (1,262) of our employees are female. 1,262 36 High level of Employee-related matters employee loyalty Sustainable, Recruiting the purposeful training right people and continuing education Capable, motivated workforce p. 38 Effective Employeehealth management related matters Diversity Occupational safety and health p. 50 Balanced employee Effective structure occupational safety management Non-financial www.krones.com/media/ Report p. 13 downloads/180423_ NFB_2017_e_.pdf Employee-related matters Employee-related matters – An overview 37 The principles of KRONES’ human resources strategy are presented in our Non-finanOur position on the topic of divercial Report.

Our guidelines are aligned with the items ­defined in our materiality matrix. The activities reported here relate to KRONES AG. Our number one priority is to always offer the right solutions for beverage and food producers worldwide and to maintain and strengthen our position as the world’s Employee-related matters market leader. To achieve that, we must engage in intensive communication with our customers, possess a high level of expertise in finding solutions to meet our customers’ needs, and develop highly innovative concepts for turnkey solutions and connected production systems. The Human Resources activities presented here all contribute to this goal. We have focussed those efforts on the following: Capable, motivated workforce Occupational safety and health Diversity We intend to continue to grow the workforce at KRONES AG at a moderate rate.

Constitution Act (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz). Employee-related matters | An overview 38 Capable, motivated workforce Recruiting the right people In 2017, KRONES AG had 9,532 employees, 1.6% more than in the previous year. Demographic change will continue to impact our business in the years ahead. The number of employees reaching retirement age will remain a factor for us. We will recruit new employees to fill the gaps left by retirees. When it comes to recruiting qualified employees, we are in fierce competition with other companies, especially for engineers and IT specialists, whose expertise we need Employee-related matters to continually evolve our portfolio of products and services. £ We are stepping up our employer branding activities. In the past, we have used social media for this. However, social media has only limited usefulness for fostering dialogue with the labour market. To improve our communications with potential employees, we established a new Employer Branding role within our organisation in September 2017. That role covers all of our activities on all aspects of establishing and maintaining a strong presence for KRONES on the labour market. Our trainee programme provides £ In addition, our in-house training programmes help to supply the company with another pathway for university young talent. In 2017, we permanently hired 131 trainees and apprentices upon comgraduates to enter a career besides pletion of their vocational training. traditional vocational training. We currently have 11 trainees in various areas of the company. Effective succession planning In 2017, seven trainees were hired on permanently. We have been reporting in detail on our efforts to increase the share of women in our workforce for many years now. £ The share of women in our workforce across all levels of the company grew to 14% (previous year: 13.7%), so we are slowly but surely increasing that figure. Our production areas still have a low level of female representation at 8.9% (previous year: 8.7%). £ We are continuing our practice of giving equally qualified women preference in hiring. The share of women among new hires was 20% in 2017 (previous year: 17%). We were able to recruit more women than in the previous year in two highly tech­ nical job clusters. Whether that is a long-term trend remains to be seen. £ The share of women in management was 6.2% (previous year: 5.9%). £ With the election of an additional female employee representative, we met the 30% quota for women and men on our Supervisory Board in 2017. Employee-related matters | Capable, motivated workforce 39 A structured process for succession planning is essential to retain the expertise of existing employees when they retire. £ We are currently building a concept and tools to facilitate knowledge transfer from retiring employees. One such tool is the “expert debriefing”. We will continue to evolve these activities and use a professional, IT-based knowledge management tool to develop structured processes. Employee-related matters £ We continued the talent pool programme that we had launched as a pilot project and presented in last year’s report. It became apparent that the processes we had ­selected were not practical for across-the-board application. However, the ex­ periences generated from the project will be used in an IT-based talent management process. Temporary workers play an important role as they enable us to handle spikes in capacity utilisation. The share of temporary workers was 14.3% in 2017 (previous year: 12.96%). Disabled and equal status £ In order to ensure flexibility in our production operations, we need to employ employees made up 6% of KRONES AG’s workforce in 2017 temporary workers. Because we are building a new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, for (as in the previous year). manufacturing components, modules, and products of low complexity, which will go into production in early 2019, we are unable to extend a larger number of temporary work contracts. Our initial estimates put the reduction in temporary positions at around 400. We have already informed our service providers of our significantly reduced need for temporary workers – thus giving about one year advance notice. £ In 2017, KRONES AG permanently hired 162 temporary workers (previous year: 133), which is 11.9% of all temporary workers. Applications from temporary workers in ­response to internal job postings are handled in the same selection process as applications from KRONES employees. £ The terms of employment for temporary workers at KRONES AG were revised to meet the changed requirements under the German Labour Leasing Act (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz) and taken up in a new company agreement effective 1 January 2018.

Employee-related matters | Capable, motivated workforce High level of employee loyalty 43 A good working relationship with our employees is a great asset. It enables us to ­retain their expertise and knowledge, which customers in the beverage and food ­industry value highly, for the long term. That is why we work closely with our ­employee representatives on all employee-related matters. Above and beyond the measures required by law, we offer a variety of programmes that enable our ­em­ployees to adapt their working times to suit their personal circumstances. Employee-related matters Our employee turnover rate, which includes all reasons for leaving, was a low 2.6% in 2017 (previous year: 2.2%). £ Fair working conditions help ensure continuity in our workforce. Men and women receive nearly equal pay at both the employee level (1:0.99) and the management level (1:0.97). £ Our pay policy aims to prevent contracts that are unnecessarily exempt or to bring any such contracts into line with collective agreements. 76.8% of our employees are paid under collective bargaining agreements (previous year: 76.6%).

After completion of the pilot phase in 2017, all employees whose work allows it may now perform some of their work outside their regular work­ station. We have set the guidance for such off-site work at six days per month. £ The world of work is changing. That is apparent in the number of part-time employees, which has risen steadily from year to year. In 2017, the share was 5.7%, marking the fifth consecutive year of increase. The share of men working part-time rose by 24.8% year-on-year, in line with this trend. Men made up 26.4% of the total number of part-time employees in 2017 (previous year: 23.2%). £ As in the previous year, 285 employees made use of the option to transition out 218 employees took a sabbatical of work gradually through our partial retirement programmes in 2017.

In addition, we are expanding our e-learning programme, which can be used by employees of KRONES AG as well as employees at our sites around the globe.

Competency management is the cornerstone of our employees’ ongoing professional development. We use performance reviews for this purpose. £ In 2017, around 4,000 employees (previous year: 2,200) took part in our competency management programme. Of those, around 16% were female and around 84% were male. £ Implementing a state-of-the-art software solution for competency management will help us more purposefully drive professional growth to meet future needs.

Employee-related matters vice helps work out solutions in collaboration with the employee in confidential counselling sessions. Depending on the problem at hand, the counsellor will bring others into the conversation as necessary after consulting with the employee. In 2017, the counselling service documented a total of 417 cases (previous year: 361). ­ Of that total, 27.3% related to workplace rehabilitation management (WRM). £ In a defined process, the counselling service works together with the respective HR business partner, the Works Council, and the disabled employees representative as well as the employees involved to develop options for bringing them back to work ­after a prolonged illness. £ In 2017, the WRM team conducted talks with 114 employees on how they can return either to their old job or to a different, more suitable one (previous year: 103). That is a 10% increase in this purposeful collaboration with employees dealing with long-term illness. The rehabilitation process usually proceeds in stages. Last year, 60 employees were able to return to their job (previous year: 58). The long-term success of these ­activities depends first and foremost on the very close, purposeful collaboration ­between the various partners and, of course, the employee’s desire to return to work. £ In 2017, the workplace rehabilitation process began after employees had been ­unable to work for an average of 125 days (previous year: 193 days). On average, rehabilitated employees remained unable to work for 36.8 days after completion of the WRM activities (previous year: 12.8 days). If it becomes apparent during the process of rehabilitation that the employee’s health is not yet stable, the activities are immediately halted and postponed without any negative repercussions for the employee. £ The average age of employees in the WRM programme was 48 years (previous year: 50 years). We expect to see a similar level of WRM activities in the years ahead. The large share of employees over age 50 suggests that this will be the case. The other counselling topics make up roughly the same share of the counselling ­service’s activities each year. £ We run substance abuse prevention activities with apprentices on an ongoing ­basis. These activities have earned positive mention in the Caritas organisations’ ­reporting. £ We held five events with 143 apprentices at our plants, generating a high level of awareness for the risks of substance abuse.

Because members of the Works Council are also on the occupational safety committees, the employees have full representation on all topics of workplace safety. ­Safety-relevant issues are quickly identified on inspections. Individual topics are discussed in depth between the responsible safety specialists and division managers ahead of these inspections since dialogue is the best way to work out potential for improvement. Precise accident analysis is an important agenda item as it helps us develop suitable measures to reduce work-related accidents. It is crucial that we not increase productivity at the expense of safety. The same holds true for the reorganisation of work areas. The focus must always be on safety. Because one thing is clear. Our job is about people. And we cannot let up in our efforts to ensure safe working ­conditions for all.

Our occupational health and safety activities are ­certified under OHSAS standard 18001 and have been extended to cover all certified sites within the scope of our IMS certification. Regular participation of the Works Council ensures that 100% of employees are included in our occupational health and safety organisation. Employee-related matters This organisational integration and the principles we follow to achieve a high degree of occupational health and safety are presented in our Non-financial Report. The rate of reportable work-related accidents per 1,000 employees for all of our ­German plants was 19.8 in 2017 (previous year: 17.7) for accidents resulting in at least one day of lost time. £ The increase can be attributed to weather-related accidents involving black ice, Integration of the Works Council in changes in activities due to varying capacity utilisation, and structural changes. our occupational health and safety committees ensures 100% represen£ The rate was 22.4 (previous year: 20.1) among male employees and 2.9 (previous tation of Krones AG employees. year: 3.8) among female employees. We documented 22 different types of injury – a range similar to that of the previous year. There were no work-related fatalities. £ The average number of days missed following a work-related accident improved to 11.5 (previous year: 13.9). Male employees missed an average of 11.7 days (previous year: 14.1) while female employees missed an average of 4.25 per work-related ­accident (previous year: 7). £ Four new cases of occupational illnesses were added to the existing 79 cases in 2017. The rate of occupational illnesses came to 5.71 (previous year: 5.08). For data ­privacy reasons, we do not receive details on these cases from the insurance carrier. £ The average number of days missed was 0.014, more or less unchanged from the previous year. Regular inspections of conditions on site are performed in accordance with the ­requirements of the integrated management system (IMS). Need for improvement is determined and remedial actions are defined on an ongoing basis. £ We are currently working on creating a particulate map documenting e ­ mployees’ exposure to respirable dust. Because of the activities involved – including work done inside large bottle washers – exhaust systems that are standard at permanent workstations can be used only to a limited degree. These measurements serve as the basis for our compliance with the workplace limits under Germany’s Technical Rules for Hazardous Substances (TRGS), which will take effect at the end of 2018.

Besides the formally regulated occupational safety and health activities, which involve regular workplace inspections, we also assess hazards that extend across areas Employee-related matters of activity and workstations and seek to develop suitable measures for optimising work flows. £ To reduce the risk exposure on internal transports and to safely transport assembled machines, our logistics team has optimised their routing. A newly installed traffic signal between two parts of the Neutraubling plant, which are separated by a public roadway, has made moving machines between the two areas safer. Large ­machines are now mostly transported along internal pathways to a central packaging point. £ Analysis of our internal transport concept identified several points with elevated risk potential. We have developed measures to improve safety at these areas. Our ­solution package includes a concept for standards relating to the safeguards on industrial trucks and mandatory wearing of high-visibility vests in specific areas.

The campaign was launched in 2014 and has run each year since, ­making the holidays brighter for kids living in group homes and foster care by fulfilling two of their Christmas wishes. Social matters When we started four years ago, we first had to set up a framework. All of the facility directors were excited at the prospect of KRONES employees buying gifts for the children. But data privacy was a major factor. We agreed that our office would handle coordination of the “wish cards” from KRONES. We distributed the cards to the ­facilities and foster homes and then returned the completed cards to Krones. Each of the youth homes has a different way of handling how the cards are filled out. In groups with young children, the caregivers work on the cards with the kids. The children often draw pictures on the cards in addition to writing down their wishes. It’s not uncommon for us to get back beautifully decorated cards with a “Thank you” note for the gift giver.

Carina Zenger is the project lead for the “holiday wish” campaign for Regensburg’s Youth Services District ­Office. Suitable communication channels for all target groups 69 Open communication is our means of choice for sharing information about our company’s development. For our customers, that communication happens through our participation in numerous trade fairs around the world, which supports our brand recognition and increases our customers’ knowledge of our products and solutions. At the drinktec 2017 trade fair in Munich, we presented our entire portfolio as well as some future-oriented ideas. The exchange with attendees is an important customer communications tool. For our employees and their families and many other interested groups with which Our plant tours in Neutraubling we maintain regular dialogue, a tour of our Neutraubling plant offers a look at our have been very well received.

We Social matters ­attribute 22.4% of last year’s visitors (813 people) to this stakeholder group. £ Last year, we also had an excellent opportunity to present our company when Germany’s Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited our Rosenheim plant. Mr. Steinmeier was on an information-gathering tour through Germany after being sworn in as President. His visit to Rosenheim gave him a look at Krones AG’s vocational training programmes. £ Once the new construction work at our Raubling site near Rosenheim is completed in the second half of 2018, we plan to host an informational event for interested residents and companies in the Raubling and Rosenheim area. Our memberships in trade and professional associations, interest groups, and friends associations that support university-level research enable us to participate in current projects in the industry and keep our knowledge and expertise up to date. £ Our most important membership is in the German Engineering Federation ­(Verband Deutscher Maschinenund Anlagenbau e.V. – VDMA) and the VDMA’s trade association for food processing and packaging machinery (Fachverband Nahrungsmittelmaschinen und Verpackungsmaschinen). Any position statements that need to be made with respect to our industry are made through the VDMA. At present, none of our management or executives holds a position of leadership in the organisation. £ Members of our company are active in certain working groups within the trade association. For example, our CSR Officer is currently a member of the VDMA’s Corporate Responsibility working group. Because company representatives from various industries contribute to the group’s work, our involvement gives us a comprehensive overview of the strategies and approaches being applied to various issues relating to sustainability. Social matters | Suitable communication channels for all target groups 70 £ Our memberships in the UN Global Compact, Sedex, ecovadis, and CDP reinforce our activities with respect to doing business sustainably. They give us a current ­picture of many issues relating to sustainability. £ We also maintain corporate memberships in relevant professional associations related to the brewing and beverage industries, which puts us in close dialogue with the people who use our machines. Cooperation with universities is also important to us. It gives us access to the latest ­research findings and puts us in touch with promising new recruits. £ Academic work at universities is an excellent opportunity to research basic questions, for instance, in the area of process technology, completely outside the context of our company. Close relationships with universities £ Special projects at universities enable us to take an active role in projects and are important. They give us access bring our own questions into the process. One example of this is the Robofill project to current research findings and Social matters that is currently underway in the departments for food packaging technology and young talent. brewing and beverage technology at the Technical University of Munich. We presented some preliminary findings from the project at drinktec 2017. £ At the regional level, we are part of the InnovationsNetzwerk Regensburg, a ­network focussed on active experience sharing and knowledge transfer between participating universities and companies on all aspects of innovation. The discussions cover megatrends like digitalisation and sustainability, open innovation, and the growing landscape of start-ups. £ Last year, we used our participation in KRONES Innovation Lab as an information platform. We are continuing our involvement. The interdisciplinary team leverages the thought processes and methodologies of various disciplines to analyse and evolve projects from a wide range of perspectives. The Innovation Lab’s work has earned recognition not only internally but also outside the company. A study conducted across Germany reviewed and evaluated some 100 “Digital Innovation Units” on six different criteria ranging from management to methodology to networks. KRONES’ Innovation Lab scored especially highly in the Methods and Topics categories. Our collaboration with universities is also reflected in the large share of internships and the number of theses that students write at KRONES AG in a wide range of fields. £ In 2017, KRONES hosted 259 university students writing their theses (previous year: 280) and 677 students gained their first career experience in internships here (previous year: 720).

Our presentation at the VDMA’s water-techSozialbelange nology@drinktec symposium at the drinktec 2017 trade fair explored this question. In our presentation, we showed that using innovative controls in the treatment of flowing water and surface water can reduce the volume of waste water generated by 65%. That is based on the use of KRONES media and ultrafiltration (UF) technology in combination with intelligent ­control algorithms. With this technology, we are developing a ­forward-thinking solution that can help many beverage producers conserve water worldwide. The high level of interest our topic found among symposium participants shows how important it is to be present at technical conferences. Besides the contact with customers, these events also enable us to discuss the topics with experts from research institutions around the world. That keeps us in touch with a broad network of experts in the field. Dr. Jörg Zacharias is a Technical Expert for Process Technology in our Corporate Research and Development department.

That is why customer satisfaction is an integral part of our corporate strategy. We present this aspect in detail in our Annual Report. We also discuss it in our Non-financial Report. Besides our sales team’s intensive communications, we also offer a number of services that strengthen our relationships with our customers. Our focus here is not only on new machines and integrating them into plants but also on maintaining and improving the operation of already-installed machines and lines over many years. Communicating and managing issues in customers’ ongoing operations are the responsibility of our Lifecycle Service (LCS) unit. LCS covers everything that helps our customers ensure a high level of productivity and efficient operation of their machines after commissioning. We highlight two main areas in particular in this report: Fast, individual service for customers Long-term, personalised customer care We offer a broad range of services through our Lifecycle Service unit to meet those expectations. Our customers can select the right LCS products and services for their Customer satisfaction needs and thus ensure their machines’ performance for the long term. We believe that customising these services to our customer’s specific needs also contributes to customer satisfaction. Our Krones.shop makes that possible. There, customers can find and quickly and conveniently order the service packages relevant to their ­machines and lines. Customer satisfaction | An overview 78 Fast, individualised service for customers The measures we take to achieve a high level of customer satisfaction are part of our corporate strategy. Those activities are presented in our Annual Report and in our Non-financial Report. Lifecycle Service plays a particularly important role here, serving as a partner to our customers and delivering suitable solutions to ensure high performance throughout the entire life of a line. LCS service packages cover maintenance contracts, technical support, and services such as handling parts and conversions or inspection and overhaul programmes. In addition, our range of upgrades offers users the option to bring machines that have been in use for many years up to date. These measures can be important when new generations of OEM components such as controls come onto the market. In 2017, we further improved the market presence of our upgrade offerings. We currently offer 224 upgrades across all of our product groups. £ Krones.shop makes solutions available to customers online, offering targeted ­selections for their machines. Customers can order custom-configured upgrades for their machines directly from our online shop. In all, the shop contains around 120,000 possible applications for customer machines worldwide. £ The main markets for upgrades are Germany, Europe, China, and the USA. The Customer satisfaction most frequently requested upgrades are for plastics technology and labellers.

Customer satisfaction | Fast, individualised service for customers Working closely 79 with Sales Our portfolio of upgrades for extending the ­useful lives of machines has to be closely supported by our Sales team. The upgrades are designed to be used worldwide. Quotations are prepared centrally for all machines. Our Sales team receives the information about the upgrades and all other technical information for all retro­ fittable machines. That enables us to respond to Customer Kundenzufriedenheit satisfaction customer needs quickly and in a targeted manner. In 2017, we hosted a customer day on upgrades in collaboration with our office in Belgium where we worked out possible machinery updates directly with customers. It was clear there that the decision on whether to buy an upgrade is closely tied to the time it takes for an upgrade to pay for itself. To ensure that the improvements and upgrades we develop for existing machines are closely linked with the latest new machinery developments, our product managers are increasingly being ­integrated into the new machinery development process. That makes our retrofits very relevant and up to date. As a result, even m ­ achines that have been installed for some time can quickly be equipped with new options for conserving resources and media or improvements for machine operation and maintenance.

Training courses can also be tailored to specific projects to improve maintenance or line performance. In addition, individual spots in training courses can be booked through the KRONES.shop. Even after machines and lines have been in operation for many years, training courses can help customers optimise line ­performance and continually grow their employees’ knowledge. KRONES launched the Digital KRONES Academy in an effort to develop digital ­collaboration and forms of training that are in line with the times. £ The project bundles numerous services that customers need on site in the production hall and makes them available digitally. That can be machine-related documentation such as customer-specific training documentation and videos or access to KRONES.shop. The Digital KRONES Academy also offers live training with a Krones Academy trainer. Users can also expand their libraries of training videos to include their own training videos.

These topics are presented together with the associated strategic approaches, goals, and actions in our Non-financial Report. All activities relate to the material aspects that we present in our materiality matrix and pertain to Krones AG and Krones AG’s products. Environmentally friendly production is an important topic for Krones AG and our customers. We strive continually to minimise the impact of our activities on the ­environment. As in previous years, the reference figure for our environmental data is consolidated revenue. The main topics examined here with respect to environmental matters are Environmental matters relating to production Sustainability in our supply chain Environmental matters relating to products In 2015, in an effort to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, we set an emissions ­target through 2020 for our own production operations. All activities relating to this target are presented in our Non-financial Report. Our efforts to provide environmentally friendly products date back to 2008, when we established our enviro machinery programme and management system. With Environmental matters enviro, all strategies relating to all aspects of energy and resource conservation are integrated into our product development process. The processes defined within enviro are also presented in our Non-financial Report. All other aspects relating to responsible stewardship of raw materials and media are presented in this Sustainability Report for the year 2017. This report is a continuation of the past years’ reporting on the areas of greatest concern to us. It also includes several examples of the opportunities for energy savings that our customers get when they integrate enviro machines or lines into their production operations.

Any changes to our supply chain are carried out in close collaboration with Report p. 33 Strategic Purchasing, the Product Lines, and Quality Management. £ Of Krones AG‘s suppliers, 70% are based in Germany. The Central, Western, and Eastern Europe and CIS region is another further major procurement market. We buy in a combined total of 22% of our procurement volume from this region. £ The provisions of our Suppliers’ Code help us to ensure that our suppliers meet ILO requirements with respect to maximum working hours and do not exceed a maximum of 48 hours per week plus 12 overtime hours per week. We conduct ­various supplier audits to verify compliance. £ 100% of our suppliers have committed to comply with the Krones Suppliers’ Code before we established a supplier relationship. The top four materials used for manufacturing our products are stainless steel, steel, plastic, and aluminium. In 2017, we purchased 20,828 metric tonnes of these materials from 38 suppliers (previous year: 21,200 metric tonnes). £ Depending on the specifications and intended uses of the raw materials, they may also include recycled materials. We do not receive specific data on the recycled content of our materials. In the case of stainless steel, the percentage of recycled ­material may be as high as 90%. We do not produce separate documentation of that. Environmental matters £ By making sure we fully utilise our main production materials – especially ­stainless steel -– and by continually improving our production planning processes, we were able to recycle the overwhelming majority of the waste generated (98.4%) last year. Efficiency is everybody’s business: Our employees demonstrate that fact with the many proposals they have submitted over the years to improve our operating processes. We receive suggestions for improvements in five different categories through our Brainpool portal. These suggestions often contain a sustainability-related aspect. £ We received 1,060 ideas with a sustainability factor last year. Of those, we implemented 429 ideas or 40% (previous year: 1,353 ideas received, 583 implemented). In ­order to further encourage our employees to submit new ideas, we plan to improve the platform’s user-friendliness in 2018. The changes will simplify the process of ­entering new ideas and make it easy for submitters to see whether any similar ideas have already been proposed.

These regulations and other country-specific regulations worldwide – including ­China’s – are helping to encourage increased consideration of recycling solutions and plastics recycling. MetaPure, KRONES’ concept for bottle-to-bottle recycling, is a forward-thinking ­solution for beverage plants and recycling companies that helps keep PET bottles in the recycling loop and turn them into high-quality raw materials. The resulting recycled material is suitable for use in the food industry. Thus, our technology meets the highest standards of quality for recycled materials, as the United States’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have confirmed. The EFSA inspects systems installed in Europe by all solutions providers. With our PET recycling system, used PET bottles can be processed into flakes that can then be used to produce new PET containers. £ We expect new legislation to result in increased demand for MetaPure. In recent years, we have been able to place eight complete lines and a washing module with various customers in Asia, Africa, and Europe. £ Individual users’ calculations show that the investment in a MetaPure r­ ecycling system pays for itself in a very short time. £ We are currently building a system for a recycling company in California, USA. The planned production capacity is 21,000 metric tonnes per year for new products made of the recycled material. The plant is expected to go into operation in the Environmental matters ­second quarter of 2018. Our washing module is currently With the MetaPure system’s washing and decontamination modules, KRONES offers used for processing PET plastic. We two modules that can be deployed individually for the respective stages of PET bottle are working to expand its applicarecycling. tions to include polyethylene and polypropylene. £ In September 2017, we launched a partnership with Erema, an Austrian provider of recycling systems. The partnership improves our access to the recycling industry. It also enables us to tap market potential for our washing module since Erema does not have washing technology of its own. £ The partnership also enables us to complete joint turnkey projects that can ­include decontamination technology from either Krones or Erema. The high quality of the recycled material from MetaPure systems opens up numerous options for a Japanese customer. The recycled material from PET bottles will be used for food applications. £ FP Corporation uses our recycling process to convert used PET bottles into food trays in a bottle-to-tray™ process. Environmental matters | Sustainability in our supply chain PET recycling expected 89 to get a boost KRONES has had the technology for PET bottle recycling in its portfolio since 2002. With ­China’s restrictive regulation of plastics imports, which took effect in 2018, interest in ­producing high-quality recycled plastics will be much higher than it has been in the past. ­Because the Chinese market is no longer available to many countries as a buyer for plastics, completely new pathways will be needed for recyclable materials. Decisions on whether to invest in a recycling system will be greatly influenced by the price difference between virgin PET and rPET. Thus, depending on the price situation, recycling PET bottles – and producing high-quality, food-grade material as the MetaPure system does – will become increasingly appealing to preform producers and, under certain circumstances, to some beverage producers. Environmental matters We expect that beverage producers will want to ensure long-term access to valuable recycled material. In addition, the technology will meet with increased interest from recycling companies. In order to offer more options, we have designed the washing module to accommodate polyolefin plastics – polypropylene and high-density-polyethylene. Our technology delivers high-quality recycled material because our washing process produces an odourless end product.

CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) are presented in our Non-financial Report. Here, we add to that data by presenting an overview of our energy consumption over the past five years. That gives a long-term view of our activities relating to energy conservation. The five-year view gives a good picture of our energy performance in terms of specific energy consumption. It shows that we have been able to steadily improve our energy consumption and emissions figures. £ We consumed a total of 123,939 MWh (previous year: 123,391 MWh) at our plants in Germany. Per €1 million in revenue, that value is now 33.6 MWh (previous year: 36.3 MWh). In terms of the absolute figure, it is an increase of 0.4%. In terms of energy intensity (per €1 million in revenue), it is an improvement of 7.4%. £ Correspondingly, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions also show a downwards trend: The absolute figure for 2017 was 33,226 metric tonnes, which is down 3.9% from the previous year. In 2017, we used 130,324 m³ of water from the municipal water supplies at our production sites in Germany (previous year: 116,442 m³). £ Consumption was up slightly relative to consolidated revenue, to 35 m³ per €1 million in revenue (previous year: 34 m³). The absolute figure was up 11.9%. The Environmental matters ­volume discharged into the public network equals the volume withdrawn. Amounts lost to diversion, disposal, or evaporation are not taken into account. £ We use groundwater to cool some areas of our buildings in Neutraubling. In 2017, we withdrew 1,206,679 m³ (previous year: 1,186,948 m³) of groundwater for this ­purpose, all of which was fed back into the groundwater supply. Our analysis of consumption data currently focuses on the Neutraubling site, where we are identifying specific parts of buildings with increased water consumption. £ We are closely monitoring the building areas with higher consumption in order to determine the reasons for the increased consumption and to implement countermeasures. In particular, we have seen an increase on the evaporative cooling systems for production equipment as a result of new operating requirements under the 42nd Ordinance for the Implementation of the Federal Immission Protection Act (42. Bundesimmissionsschutzverordnung – 42. BImSchV). Our office building is another area with higher water consumption.

In addition, we used 269.2 kg of R365mfc (previous year: 305.5 kg), with a CO2 equivalent of 216.4 metric tonnes (previous year: 245.6 metric tonnes). Thus, ­consumption of both substances – and therefore the resulting CO2 emissions – were reduced by more than 10% year-on-year. Under the provisions of Germany’s Federal Act for the Protection against Harmful ­Environmental Effects Caused by Air Pollution, Noise, Vibration, and Similar Factors [Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz], we are required to take measurements of emissions on one combined heat and power (cogeneration) plant and on the surface treatment (electroplating) plant at our Neutraubling site as well as on the pickling plant in ­Freising. £ The latest mandatory measurement was taken in 2016, in keeping with the ­measurement cycle. These measurements are required only once every three years. Therefore, the next measurement is scheduled for 2019. The next measurement for our electroplating shop will be taken in 2018. £ In 2016, the figures for the cogeneration plant came to 0.685 kg/h for NOx, 0.0017 kg/h for SO2, 0.035 for formaldehyde, and 0.145 kg/h for CO2 for 17,283 hours operating at full capacity.

That overview covers only energy-related emissions. Freight forwarding logistics solutions are a major focus for us. We use the most ­efficient packing and forwarding concepts possible in order to get our products to our customers in a way that is compact and conserves resources. £ The overwhelming share of our products (66.3%) makes its way to customers by sea freight (previous year: 65.8%). Only 22% of our freight was forwarded to customers by road freight in 2017 (previous year: 23.6%). Air freight accounted for 0.9% (previous year: 1.2%). Five years ago, air freight made up 3.6% of our shipments. £ We are making good use of the rail connection that has been in operation at our Neutraubling plant since 2016. We have already sent 1,110 rail containers on their way from there. That is equal to 1,953 truckloads. £ In addition, we plan to have parts of our procurement logistics also be handled 89.3% of our passenger rail trips by way of our on-site rail connection.

We had stated in last year’s report that we aim to further reduce CO2 emissions from work-related travel. We planned to accomplish that by shifting some activities to our Centres worldwide and by implementing a new company travel policy that included revised rules for booking air travel. Environmental matters £ These two actions combined have had the desired effect. We reduced the number of flights taken by 11.7%. In particular, our mileage on intercontinental flights was down 14.8%. As a result, CO2 emissions from air travel decreased by approximately 11.6% to 12,444 metric tonnes (previous year: 14,072 metric tonnes). £ By contrast, emissions from car travel have risen back to the 2014 level. The number of kilometres travelled by car increased 36.8%. Nevertheless, the increase in CO2 emissions was lower. Total CO2 emissions from car travel came to 4,007 metric tonnes (previous year: 3,634 metric tonnes), which represents an increase of 10.2%. £ In all, we reduced CO2 emissions from work-related travel by 7.1%. Per €1 million in revenue, that is a reduction of 14.8%. £ Bidding and negotiations for mobility services are currently underway.

In all, we purchased 20,828 metric tonnes of the four primary materials (previous year: 21,200 metric tonnes). That is a 1.75% reduction in material consumption. £ We have experts working continually to reduce the amount of material waste at all of our sites. In our laser machining and die cutting centres, we use design programmes to ensure that we make the most of our materials. £ Our Flensburg plant has introduced a process for managing sheet metal scrap in which sheets that are not well nested in the first process step are sent back into the production process to be re-nested. We have also optimised the way we design our nesting layouts in order to increase flexibility. That has had a positive impact on nesting quality. The results can be measured in terms of material consumption. At our Flensburg plant, we used fewer steel sheets despite a 25% increase in capacity utilisation. To complement these efforts, the plant also began using special sheet sizes to ­minimise the amount of scrap generated for individual machine components. £ We expect the new laser machining centre that went into operation in the fourth quarter of 2017 in Flensburg to further increase nesting quality in the automated ­production of customer-specific parts. Insourcing more and more mass-produced parts will also help to further reduce waste. We were able to keep the volume of waste generated at all of our plants at a low level relative to the increase in revenue. Environmental matters £ At 16,997 metric tonnes, the volume of waste generated was 296 metric tonnes more than in the previous year. Waste generated per €1 million in revenue improved 6.5%.

We are always working to optimise our production processes. For example, we recently invested in a punch-laser combination machine for machining the sheet metal used to manufacture our bottle washers and pasteurisers. That purchase increased our productivity by 25% and considerably reduced make-ready times. That, of course, also had a ­positive impact on our energy performance. Another aim was to make optimum use of our materials. To accomplish it, we launched a new process for handling scrap sheet metal and improving nesting quality. As a result, we were able to reduce the number of sheets used in the fabrication of ­machine housings. We are also continually improving and streamlining processes in our production operations. We were able to increase the energy efficiency of our wareUmweltbelange Environmental matters housing systems by retrofitting the drives on that equipment. We are currently reviewing possible improvements to our logistics concept to better integrate an off-site facility that is served by a regular shuttle from our main plant in Flensburg. Integrating a larger nitrogen tank for welding gas in order to reduce delivery frequencies is another logistics topic we are addressing.

The machines are equipped with redesigned spray jets that require less pump capacity. Based on 4,000 operating hours per year, we figure the energy savings on this ­machine to be an average of 35%. £ We recorded total energy savings of 137 MWh on four LinaFlex tunnel pasteurisers running at different customers’ plants from the time of commissioning to 31 December 2017. That translates to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 72 metric tonnes (based on the conversion factor of 527g CO2/kWh specified by Germany’s Federal Environmental Agency for 2016).
