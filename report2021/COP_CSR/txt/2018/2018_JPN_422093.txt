For those of you affected by the Heavy Rain Event of July 2018 in western Japan, know that you are in our thoughts. Fiscal 2017 in Review Fiscal 2017 was not only a year of solidifying our management platform for future growth; the ANA Group set record profits for a third consecutive year. The ANA international business was a significant driver of top-line revenues. We have expanded our network over the past several years, resulting in our International Passenger Business recording fiscal 2017 revenues 1.5 times greater than fiscal 2013, the year prior to expanding our routes out of Haneda Airport. The ANA name is growing steadily as a recognized brand overseas. A full 50 percent of our 04 Management Message recent sales of passenger seats consists of overseas sales. Since adopting a policy to control capacity in our Domestic Passenger Business in fiscal 2014, the business has nevertheless grown steadily as we optimize supply to demand. As sales have grown, so has profitability. Meanwhile, in April 2017, we P.54–57 consolidated Peach Aviation into the ANA Group. Peach Aviation and Vanilla Air have been pioneers in Special Feature: building the low cost carrier (LCC) market in Japan. During fiscal 2019, we intend to merge these two LCC Business Merger companies to create the leading LCC in Asia. We have reached nearly ¥1 trillion in shareholders’ equity as of the end of fiscal 2017, adding support to our A credit rating and reflecting a solid financial platform to meet our current goals. In September 2017, we issued convertible bonds to secure funds for future growth, as well as to shift from a capital policy of capital accumulation to one of improving capital efficiency. Corporate Strategy for Sustainable Growth Indeed, fiscal 2017 was a year of success for both business strategy and financial strategy. Having connected previous strategies to results, we published the ANA Group Corporate Strategy in February 2018 to accelerate future growth. We see numerous opportunities on the horizon. More slots at Tokyo metropolitan area airports, more inbound traveler traffic, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. We will seize these opportunities to build sustainable profit growth for the future. Our new strategy consists of three strategic pillars. The first is to expand our airline revenue platform. We intend to build a stronger revenue platform and pursue an optimized business portfolio for the Group as a whole, raising basic quality for the ANA and LCC businesses. The second strategic pillar is to select and concentrate on existing businesses, while creating new business domains. Here, we will find growth through selection, concentration, and winning the challenge to build new businesses in non-airline sectors. The third pillar is to utilize open innovation and information and communications technology (ICT). The ANA Group will contribute to a super-smart society by improving P.28–43 the competitiveness of our products, by promoting work-style reform, and by incorporating the use of FY 2018–22 ANA Group artificial intelligence (AI). As we execute initiatives aligned with these strategies, we will secure our Corporate Strategy position as the world’s leading airline group. Fiscal 2018: A Year to Finish Solidifying Our Business Platform Fiscal 2018 will be our first year executing this new strategy. We will continue to invest in the safety, quality, services, and human resources initiatives launched last fiscal year, solidifying our revenue platform. Safety lies as the very core of our group management. As a group, ANA, Peach Aviation, and Vanilla Air operate nearly 1,100 flights on a daily basis. I continually emphasize to our employees that safety is our first and most important priority. At the group new-hire orientation this year, I stood before nearly 2,700 new employees, repeating the message that safety is everything. Safety is not just the responsibility of our crew, maintenance workers, and other personnel on the front lines. We must foster a corporate culture in which we build safety as a group, foremost in the minds of every single employee. The cornerstone of creating value in the future will be the trust of our customers and other stakeholders. 05 We have introduced a number of work arrangements, mainly for female and senior employees, supporting employee needs to balance child and nursing care with their jobs. As a result, the average years worked for an ANA employee in fiscal 2017 was more than 10 percent longer than five years ago. Today, Japan struggles with a shortage of labor. For our group to continue to grow, we must recruit and train a stable pool of personnel, who represent the source of our competitive ability. We are not simply looking for numbers. We must improve our basic service quality, such as our ability to handle unexpected irregularities in operations, all while building our ability to compete toe-to-toe with overseas airlines on cost. To do this will require work-style reform and AI, raising our productivity per employee. P.44–47 Once we have strengthened our revenue platform in terms of safety, quality, services, and human How We Ensure Safety and resources, and begin executing our current strategy, our next order of business is to implement policies Develop Stellar People for achieving our Management Vision for fiscal 2020. The Value Creation Cycle The ANA Group has not always voyaged through smooth seas. We have endured poor economies, risks, and other negative impacts on our earnings. We have faced our share of crises. But, having P.16–19 overcome numerous difficulties, the ANA Group has been able to create new levels of unique value Our Four Greatest Strengths and corporate culture. To continue to grow, we will execute our strategy on the wings of our four greatand Value Creation Cycle est strengths: Innovation, Quality, Scale, and Comprehensive Capabilities. At the same time, we must ensure that our Value Creation Cycle functions correctly. One testament to the success of our initiatives has been our economic value over the past several years. We have reached a level of operating income at between ¥150 and ¥160 billion, net income of ¥100 billion, and an ROE of around 10 percent. Still, we have room to strengthen our capacity for social value if we are to move forward steadily into the future. As we pursue sustainable growth, we must speed our initiatives for environmental, social, and governance (ESG). We must do this from the approach of collaborative value creation, having clearly defined the connection between the ANA Group business model and our strategy. Pursuing Sustainable Growth Through ESG Management Building ESG Management Into Corporate Strategy Over the past several years, we have seen a number of international rules and guidelines established to secure a future sustainable society. One of the most prominent of these new guidelines is the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) promulgated by the United Nations in 2015. This framework provides corporate activities for achieving certain goals by the year 2030. We believe corporate ESG initiatives help a company reduce reputation risk, raise brand value, and P.20–21 contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. To achieve these initiatives, the ANA Group has identified Creating Value Under Our matters having an impact on society, incorporating these matters into our corporate strategy. We plan Current Group Strategy to strengthen our ESG management to tie the social value created through our business activities to ANA Group economic value. 06 Management Message For example, we plan to increase our total number of aircraft (ANA and LCC) by nearly 40 planes between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2022. Expanding our network and improving in-flight products and services relate directly to improving the economic value of our businesses. At the same time, we intend to incorporate fuel-efficient aircraft into our fleet to reduce CO2 emissions per revenue passenger-kilometer (RPK). In this way and others, we will secure our standing as an environmentally friendly airline group. The ANA universal service policy ensures we achieve higher levels of convenience for our customers in every possible situation. In the future, we plan to create barrier-free environments (both soft and hard aspects) at every airport in Japan that services ANA flights. While this will require some investment on our part, we believe responding to customer diversity and providing better accessibility is part of creating a harmonious society. We have defined four material issues and incorporated them into our latest strategy: Environment, P.60–68 Human Rights, Diversity and Inclusion, and Regional Revitalization. I believe we will fulfill our ESG Material Issues management responsibilities by making real progress in these four issues. As we expand globally, our strategies must be tied to improved value for all stakeholders. Contributing to the achievement of the SDGs is a mission that we must achieve, if we are to be considered a top-tier global airline group. Stronger Governance Sustainable corporate growth requires an ongoing commitment to stronger corporate governance. In fiscal 2013, the ANA Group transitioned to a holding company structure, engaging in portfolio management aimed at growing our profit domains. ANA HOLDINGS INC. will continue to fulfill its role as holding company, only as we build a stronger structure supporting corporate governance. We have made several major business decisions recently, including our new corporate strategy and merging our LCC companies. During fiscal 2017, we provided for better discussions prior to our Group Management Committee meeting. This measure was the result of feedback received through questionnaires sent to every member of the board of directors and Audit & Supervisory Board in fiscal 2016. Through better reporting standards required in communication between the Group Management Committee and the board of directors, we have ensured sufficient deliberations at board of director meetings. We have strengthened the oversight functions of the board of directors, reflecting companywide strategies that include providing more opportunities to receive advice on various topics from P.76–79 outside directors. Board of Directors As competition intensifies with overseas airlines, we must make the right decisions on material Toward Stronger Governance issues, including our business portfolio and the allocation of management resources. Making the right decisions requires the support of a solid corporate governance structure, as we remain aware of and respond to changes in our business environment. One way in which we are improving the effectiveness of our board of directors is to hold individual interviews with board members and members of the Audit & Supervisory Board. These interviews also help us identify measures for ongoing improvement. 07 Contributing to the achievement of the SDGs is a mission that we must achieve, if we are to be considered a top-tier global airline group. Heading Into the Future The subtitle of our corporate strategy is “Strengthening the Foundations of the Business and Looking Into the Future.” The short-term opportunities of inbound travelers and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics will be a tailwind pushing ANA Group growth. We are looking even further into the future. For example, contributing to the achievement of the SDGs by the year 2030 is one of our major goals. Creating both social value and economic value at the same time is a responsibility demanded of a global business, and we will exercise ESG management to meet this duty. The ANA Group mission is to use the management platform we have created to identify our direction as a global company, leaving a legacy of flexible, adaptive thinking to the next generation. I am taking a step into the future to ensure the ANA Group creates new value and achieves sustainable growth as we become the world’s leading airline group.

We invited Professor Norichika Kanie from Keio University Graduate School of Media and Governance to talk with Shinya Katanozaka, president & CEO of ANA HOLDINGS INC, about the relationship of business activities and the SDGs, as well as expectations of the ANA Group. Prof. Kanie is one of the foremost authorities on the SDGs, participating in expert committees in Japan and around the world. He is also heavily involved in education and promotion of the SDGs. SDGs and ESG: A Changing Environment and Social Perception Katanozaka I recognize that SDGs and ESG are two significant Kanie I see that not only companies but also the general movements among Japanese companies and important issues public is more aware of the importance of sustainability these for corporate management. In addition to being expected by days. This movement will only grow faster as it becomes part of society, some investments are measured whether the corporate corporate behavior. Sometimes, a movement encounters a management concerns ESG. SDGs and ESG now represent very breakthrough event resulting in unexpected exponential growth. important factors in corporate value creation. I feel the same will happen for SDGs and ESG. 23 Although the SDGs are goals meant to be accomplished by for sustainability. I also encourage you to the year 2030, some could be achieved by the Tokyo 2020 Olympic track and disclose increases in passenger and Paralympic Games. This is particularly true for goals that numbers, and changes in customer feedenjoy a high level of public interest, including support for the back toward the ANA Group. disabled, the empowerment of women in society, and regional revitalization. A mega event such as the Olympic and Paralympic Games accelerates social change. Katanozaka The ANA Group sets numerical targets for Katanozaka Recently, I had an opportunity to talk with strategic material issues, checking our progress on an annual basis. a Paralympic athlete, and she mentioned the difficulties she For example, we monitor data related to several issues, including encounters when traveling by airplane. It was very eye-opening controlling CO2 emissions, with which every airline company to me. As we improve access through universal services, we must struggles, limiting CO2 emissions across all business locations, understand and remain aware of the standpoints of our diversifying and increasing the number of women in management roles. customer base. Kanie That’s wonderful. Due to their earnest nature, Japanese Kanie Experiencing an event like the Olympic and Paralympic companies tend to focus on setting and achieving numerical Games can change perceptions and society. I think companies targets. SDG targets are a bit more optimistic. SDG targets are set can use the SDGs as an effective tool in corporate activities. For to higher hurdles to make everyone aim together. These targets example, developing the air travel more accessible and stress-free inspire employees, motivating them to be happy and energetic in makes your contribution to SDG 10, Reduce inequality within and their work. I think setting and working to achieve goals that are a among countries, more visible. I’m confident that more people will little less binding could make the process more enjoyable. choose ANA for air travel and investment because of your efforts Creating Social and Economic Value through Contribution to the SDGs Kanie Some view the SDGs simply as a matter of ethics or Katanozaka I agree that the concept of sustainability is very good practices. But, the world will not take action if the SDGs are important. Growth and sustainability are critical elements in CSR, not connected to behavioral economics or corporate profits. the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), Higher profits attract more people, making it a sustainable activity and the 17 targets of the SDGs. Companies are meant to reward in a real sense. International agreements on sustainable their investors with growth. Ongoing profits allow for social contridevelopment so far have highlighted environmental concerns. bution, so sustainability is an extremely important key concept. I These agreements required additional costs and became a believe it is important to inform investors about our initiatives burden to the companies. The main feature of the SDGs is that related to sustainability, the environment, and other social issues. they include social value and economic value in addition to Being a component member of the Dow Jones Sustainability environmental concerns. It’s important to recognize that economic World Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index is issues have both environmental and social aspects. a great motivator, as is our selection as a Nadeshiko Brand. Ratings agencies tend to give considerable weight to ESG investment; for example, green bond is likely to become an important topic this year. 24 How We Create Value “We must link our SDG initiatives to new business opportunities and higher revenues.” Initiatives Contributing to SDGs Kanie As a customer, I am very familKanie One of the best aspects of the SDGs is that they can iar with your in-flight meals.

The process might be similar to Ensure sustainable consumption and people bringing business ideas together to share and build on. production patterns. It’s not just a matter of assigning an initiative to a particular SDG. Katanozaka The ANA Group identifies the Environment, I think you would be best served to demHuman Rights, Diversity and Inclusion, and Regional Revitalization onstrate how working toward a goal leads as four material issues. Initiatives in other areas tend to receive to achievement of an SDG over time. less attention, so we need to broaden our base. In July 2012, the ANA Group started a forest preservation project called ANA Forest * Food loss is also known as food waste.

Katanozaka Our food loss initiative was prompted by a suggestion from the ANA Singapore city / airport office about Kanie Although the SDGs are global targets, on closer unused in-flight snacks that can keep for a certain period of time. inspection, they represent issues that can be addressed locally. In October 2016, we partnered with a local catering company and Combining two or more together can even stimulate ideas for a nongovernmental organization (NGO) to donate unused in-flight potential projects, serving as a source of innovation. snacks to local childcare centers. Being overseas provides easier access to information about global trends. This insight can lead to specific programs, which contribute to progress toward the SDGs. If every one of the more than 40,000 ANA Group employees embraced the SDGs, their new ideas could do more than just contribute to SDG progress; they could also lead to valuable business opportunities. 25 Katanozaka We believe the ANA Group can contribute directly awareness and share the importance of this awareness. The SDGs to about seven of the 17 SDGs through our business activities. include room for such innovation. But, there could be other ways to contribute as well.

We are investing heavily in safety and human resources to draw out the skills of every group employee, combining the strengths of our people with ICT to build new value and sustainable growth. Case Mechanics Worldwide Utilizing Mobile Devices 1 Connecting the World and Raising Maintenance Quality Standards Through ICT The ANA Group issued mobile devices to every flight attendant in 2012. Since then, our mobile technology program has been rolled out to pilots, maintenance crew, and airport staff. This technology allows faster and more precise communication, providing timely information for passengers and better in-flight service. In addition, we have received the benefits of more efficient training and paperless manuals. Our maintenance department uses mobile devices to access manuals and tap into an expansive knowledge base of maintenance techniques. If a maintenance issue is identified during an aircraft inspection at an airport, maintenance crew and staff must Project Team Members assess the situation quickly to organize service or repairs in a way that minimizes ANA Engineering & Maintenance Center, e-TPS & Innovation Office disruption of scheduled flights.

In August 2018, the ANA Group began using a retired Boeing 737-500 aircraft as a maintenance training jet. Our aim here is to improve the education and training environment for newly hired employees, helping them develop skills as quickly as possible. Newly hired technical staff receive basic training on maintenance work (aircraft systems, maintenance procedures, etc.), followed by training using mock-ups of different sections of the aircraft. Previously, maintenance crew would work on service Project Team Members aircraft as they came into the hangar to develop practical skills, which was a very slow ANA Engineering & Maintenance Center, Education & Training Division (L to R) Takeshi Kubota, Isao Kobayashi, Morio Otomo process.

Post-flight reviews assist pilots in flying safer and polishing their technical skills. This review application immediately analyzes Big Data collected from on-board sensors and other sources, combining this data with animations of flight conditions, gauges, and ground topography for a visual reproduction of the flight. Pilots can use their own mobile devices to review their flight performance at any time. The cuttingedge technology behind the video review was created by a project team made up of some 50 experts drawn from various companies and divisions within the ANA Group, as well as consultants from outside. Conceptual Image of the Post-Flight Video Review Application The major global airlines have been emphasizing unanticipated risk as an important safety concept alongside traditional incident avoidance and the prevention of recurrence. At the same time, aircraft technology is rapidly advancing through IoT, networking, and data processing. Globalization is allowing more freedom of movement and demand for air travel, which is leading to a pilot shortage now noted even among greater society. Obviously, pilot recruiting and training is critical for future airline business growth. With an evolving aviation industry and diverse work-styles among pilots, the ANA Group is aware of the need for an environment that supports ongoing skills development for pilots. This environment must include personal mentorship and the use of data to be effective and sustainable. The post-flight review video application aids in the training of already experienced and skilled pilots. This tool also fosters a culture of communication among pilots in a new format, helping the ANA Group become even more unified behind safe flight operations.

In keeping with this safety principle, the ANA Group is committed to eliminating all forms of aircraft debris*. * Aircraft debris is defined as frozen solids or parts and/or components that have fallen to the ground (except where this occurs within the confines of an airport). We have implemented a reporting system for missing parts. 1 Background A spate of aircraft debris incidents in August and September 2017 (panel, engine fragments, etc.) caused considerable public concern about falling objects. In one incident, the exterior panel section an overseas airline flight fell and caused damage to a vehicle on the ground. The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism declared this accident a Serious Incident, causing a further increase in public concern. As new flight paths are being considered to strengthen the utility of Tokyo Boeing 767 With Missing Panel metropolitan area airports, airlines must demonstrate their commitment to the highest standards of safety, particularly with respect to aircraft debris. 2 ANA Group Aircraft Debris Initiatives Individual Division Initiatives To better recognize even the smallest warning signs of Parts Departing Airplane B777����� ������� H S TA B L O W E R S I D E S TR O B E L I GH T L E N S L E A D I N G E D GE S L A T L E A D I N G E D GE L O W E R potential aircraft debris, the ANA Group has established a P ANEL U P P E R S KI N AO A S ENS O R VANE P ANEL mechanic inspection program, while striving to make pilots and other staff working around aircraft more aware of the issue.

Operating income rose 12.4% to ¥156.8 billion. This positive performance was mainly due to our capturing strong demand within our international business for passenger and cargo service, as well as to the consolidation of Peach Aviation in our LCC Business. Our targets for fiscal 2018 operating revenues and operating income are ¥1,805 billion (4.3% increase) and ¥160 billion (2.0% increase), respectively. We expect to grow top line revenues through our international business and other operations, supported by a solidifying management platform. INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER BUSINESS Building Network Competitive Advantage Through a Deepening Dual Hub Network Strategy and Strengthening Product and Services International Passenger Business fiscal 2017 operating revenues Performance of the International Passenger Business rose 15.6% year on year to ¥597.4 billion. Passengers rose to 9.74 Revenues ASK RPK million for the year, representing a 6.8% increase. These results (Index) Fiscal 2014 = 100 reflected strong demand for higher-priced business travel out of 160 Japan, as well as active inbound tourist traffic. We expanded our 147 products and services offerings during the year, adding flights to 138 our Haneda–Jakarta route in August and to our Narita–Los 136 130 Angeles route in late October. We also pursued an ambitious schedule for adding more Boeing 787-9 aircraft into service. Our analysis suggests that these results stem from the competitive 100 advantage of our network, which we have worked to expand over 0 the past several years. 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 (FY) (Plan) Our fiscal 2018 plan calls for International Passenger Business operating revenues of ¥648 billion, an 8.5% increase over fiscal 2017. We also plan to commit further to our Dual Hub Network Strategy, taking advantage of our late-night slots at Haneda. Although we expect available seat-kilometers (ASK) to increase 4.7%, this will be the slowest growth rate since fiscal 2014. However, we will strive to capture more demand and increase yield. In June, we added flights on our Haneda–Bangkok route. We now offer five round-trip flights between Tokyo (Haneda/Narita) and Bangkok. Strengthening our presence in Asia, we plan to capture demand connecting to North American routes in the region, in addition to demand for departures and arrivals in the Tokyo metroAdding Flights on the Haneda–Jakarta Route politan area. We will begin code-sharing with Alitalia Airlines in October to expand our Europe-bound network and services. Our fleet development plans call for putting Boeing 787-9 aircraft into service on the Narita–Bangkok route and the Narita–Kuala Lumpur route. In addition to providing full-flat seats in business class, we will be offering premium economy services. We plan to introduce the Airbus A380 aircraft to our Tokyo– Honolulu route in spring 2019. We will offer entirely new services to take advantage of the A380’s roomy, full two-deck configuration, including couch seating and other amenities. We will also be offering ANA-branded lounges, which will be the only directly operated lounges in overseas airports. These new services will strengthen our engagement with leisure travelers, including our more affluent customers.

These new routes and added flights captured demand 105 dictated by the nature of the routes in question. We also added 101 the Airbus A321neo aircraft to our fleet as part of these efforts, 100 working to optimize supply to demand. 97 We plan for fiscal 2018 Domestic Passenger Business operating revenues of ¥691 billion, which will be a 0.2% increase 0 over fiscal 2017. We intend to maintain a strong revenue platform, 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 (FY) (Plan) offering the improved convenience and comfort of a full service carrier, including the addition of the Airbus A321neo (with personal monitors in all seats) and onboard free Wi-Fi. Despite a decreasing population, changes in work-style reforms are providing the Japanese people with more leisure time. At the same time, we are seeing more inbound visitors traveling within Japan. These and other factors point to solid fiscal 2018 demand for our domestic business. ANA will take advantage of our diverse fleet to promote optimization of supply to demand, as well as to boost our profitability. We opened the Fukuoka–Miyako route in June as a new fiscal 2018 initiative. Along with the year-round Chubu–Miyako route and the New Chubu–Miyako Route Launched in June 2017 Fukuoka–Ishigaki route launched in March 2018, we are expanding nonstop service from points in Japan to the Sakishima Islands (islands south-west of Okinawa) to respond to high-value leisure travel demand. Our fleet development plan calls for new narrowbody aircraft coinciding with the retirement of the Boeing 777s we have been operating on our domestic business. We will optimize our network with a focus on regional routes, while continuing to control production capacity over the medium term. In October, we will begin to reformulate our domestic fares. We will see even greater improvement in unit revenues as we exercise flexible yield management through innovations in fare New Airbus A321neo (Interior) Provides a Personal Monitor in Each Seat structure (reservations and sales up to 355 days prior to date of departure, etc.). Self-Service Baggage Check-in Machine “ANA Baggage Drop” ANA now uses the ANA Baggage Drop system at Haneda, Sapporo (New Chitose), and Fukuoka airports as part of the ANA Fast Travel program to simplify the domestic flight boarding process. We have cut average waiting time by more than half for our passengers by increasing the number of locations where passengers can drop off their checked luggage (including counters with service agents). Freed from baggage handling tasks, reallocated airport staff are able to provide even higher-level customer services in airport lobbies. We provide guidance in English, Chinese (traditional and simplified), and Korean for our passengers from overseas. We plan to deploy these services at other major airports across Japan soon.

We anticipate strong demand for cargo transportation originating in Japan during the year. Automotive parts (associated with increasingly stringent 50 environmental regulations) and semiconductors (associated with AI and IoT) are likely to be the major drivers of demand. As we 0 optimize the size of our Okinawa Cargo Hub Network, we will draw 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 (FY) (Plan) on the resources of other companies on North American routes to capture demand for cargo with higher unit prices. During fiscal 2019, we will phase in the Boeing 777F to capture more business for large-sized and other cargo. We intend to leverage our current network to improve connections, winning a larger share of the cargo demand between Asia and North America. LCC BUSINESS Merger and Network Optimization: Creating a New Air Transportation Pillar Second Only to the ANA Brand During fiscal 2017, we consolidated Peach Aviation (April 2017) LCC Business: Number of Available Seats (Domestic and International in Total) and expanded our LCC network including Vanilla Air. Vanilla Air introduced a new Fukuoka–Taipei route, while Peach Aviation (Millions) opened domestic routes for Sendai–Sapporo, Sapporo–Fukuoka, and Kansai–Niigata. Peach also launched new international routes 10.0 between Sendai–Taipei and Sapporo–Taipei. Our fiscal 2018 plan calls for LCC Business operating revenues of 7.5 ¥100 billion, representing an increase of 14.2% compared to fiscal 2017. Both Vanilla and Peach will expand their route networks 5.0 during the year, focusing mainly on regional airports within Japan. In July, Vanilla Air introduced Narita–Ishigaki and Naha–Ishigaki 2.5 routes. At the end of April, Peach Aviation launched a Naha– Kaohsiung route, followed by a new Kansai–Kushiro route in August. 0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 (FY) We intend to make Sapporo (New Chitose) Airport a new operating base this year, expanding our routes from Hokkaido and other locations.

This entity will drive the Japanese LCC market, aiming to become Asia’s leading LCC in customer satisfaction and market share. 53 Non-Air Business Future Revenue Sources Through Innovating Business Models and Creating New Profitable Domains AIRLINE RELATED BUSINESS For fiscal 2018, our Airline Related Business plans to generate Airline Related Business: Operating Revenues ¥288 billion in operating revenues and ¥11 billion in operating (¥ Billions) income, representing year-on-year increases of 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively. 284.3 288.0 264.4 As the number of visitors to Japan continues to increase, we 231.9 223.7 anticipate that foreign carriers will have more opportunities to open Japan routes. We intend to boost revenues at airports in Japan where the ANA Group has already established networks. Here, we will contract services from other airlines, primarily for passenger and cargo ground handling services and in-flight meal production. 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 (FY) (Plan) TRAVEL SERVICES Travel Services plans to generate fiscal 2018 operating revenues Travel Services: Operating Revenues of ¥164 billion and operating income of ¥1 billion. While we expect (¥ Billions) revenues to grow 3.0% year on year, operating income is budgeted to decline 73.3%.

As we execute this corporate strategy, we intend to establish in our LCC Business a revenue platform second only to the ANA brand. At present, Peach Aviation Limited and Vanilla Air Inc. operate separately as low cost carriers within the ANA Group. We have decided to merge these two companies in fiscal 2019. In this special feature, we discuss the events leading up to this decision, our objectives, and the enthusiasm that the LCC leaders have for this change. 55 From ANA HOLDINGS INC.  Peach Aviation and Vanilla Air have grown their respective businesses by creating new demand independent of the ANA brand. These companies are responsible for establishing the LCC market in Japan, and they have done much for regional revitalization in Japan. Peach began service slightly more than six years ago. In the past several years, we have seen more overseas LCCs begin servicing routes from and to Japan. At the same time, we face other challenges, including consistent hiring, training, and cost competitiveness. To beat the LCC competition in Asia and grow rapidly via narrow-body aircraft operations, we must first solidify the management infrastructure of our group LCCs. We decided a merger between Peach and Vanilla Air would be the best way to leverage the strengths of each firm, as well as to improve aircraft and crew operating efficiencies. Overseas, more than one-third of all passenger volume is serviced by LCCs in the major air travel markets of Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia. All of the main LCCs operate in each region, growing as they serve a separate consumer segment compared to the full service Toyoyuki Nagamine carriers. In Japan, we deal with several factors not present in overseas markets. These factors Senior Executive Vice President, include special airport requirements and competition with rail travel. The LCC share of total Representative Director ANA HOLDINGS INC. passenger volume in Japan languishes at around 10 percent. Further, the Japanese government has set a goal to receive 40 million inbound travelers annually by the year 2020 and 60 million by the year 2030. LCCs will have to play an important role in achieving these goals, and we must prepare for expansion beginning now, working faster than ever. We intend to leverage economies of scale to become more cost competitive, while we move into mid-distance routes. Our fiscal 2020 targets for the newly merged company will be ¥150 billion in operating revenues and ¥15 billion in operating income. The new firm will achieve these goals through innovative marketing separate and distinct from the ANA brand, as well as through unique network strategies.

Basic Approach  In response to the Paris Agreement signed at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), the government of Japan set its own targets related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emission for 2020 and beyond. Meanwhile, the aviation industry is showing an increasing awareness about controlling CO2 emissions. Based on the resolutions of the 2016 General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (composed of the member states of the ICAO), global airline companies have made an international commitment to generate carbon-neutral growth (CNG2020) in the year 2021 and beyond. The ANA Group is committed to reducing the environmental footprint of our operations. In 1998, we reorganized the ANA Group Environmental Principles. Our environmental initiatives stem from our ANA FLY ECO 2020 environmental plan covering 2012 through 2020. In June 2017, we established the ANA Group Environmental Policies. These policies demonstrate to be the world that we aim to be the leading airline group in environmental policy.

Implementation Structure  The Group CSR / Risk Management / Compliance Committee oversees two Group CSR / Risk Management / subcommittees dedicated to reducing our environmental impact: The Eco-First Compliance Committee Subcommittee (dealing with flight operations) and the Ground Energy Subcommittee (dealing with ground operations). Our main environmental concern is our aircraft, which are a major source of CO2 Eco-First Ground Energy emissions. Here, we intend to create economic value by controlling fuel costs, while Subcommittee Subcommittee creating social value by reducing our environmental footprint. Certified Eco-First Company  In 2008, ANA became the first-ever company in airline and transport industry certified by the Minister of the Environment as an Eco-First Company. We received this honor in recognition of our commitment to social responsibility. In fiscal 2017, we began sorting cabin waste (glass, cans, and PET bottles) from all inbound international flights. Further, all plastic beverage cups and salad bowls used on international flights are made from recycled PET bottles. These are two examples of how we promote appropriate recycling to reduce our environmental impact. 61 WEB See the ANA Group corporate website for more: https://www.ana.co.jp/group/en/csr/environment/ Reducing CO2 Emissions  The ANA Group has upgraded to fuel-efficient aircraft and introThe use of biojet fuel and emissions credits represent two other duced a number of other improvements to control CO2 emissions initiatives we have adopted to reduce our environmental impact. from our aircraft.

We will continue to participate actively in industry environmental initiatives, and take a leadership role in creating new rules. 27th meeting of the IATA Environment Committee in Tokyo 62 Material Issues Contributions to SDGs Human Rights The ANA Group is actively promoting efforts to respect human rights with an emphasis on stakeholder engagement. Basic Approach  The ANA Group is committed to upholding human rights in accordance with the global standards provided in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In April 2016, we established the ANA Group Policy on Human Rights. We based this policy on the International Bill of Human Rights (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and two International Covenants), the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We will encourage our contractors and suppliers to adopt similar policies. We believe that respect for human rights lies at the very foundations of the philosophy of the SDGs, which is to “leave no one behind.” The ANA Group will foster a clear understanding of this principle, as we continue to engage in initiatives that respect human rights. Implementation Structure  The Group CSR / Risk Management / Compliance Committee, led by the Chief CSR Promotion Officer, discusses human rights initiatives within the ANA Group (identified risks, response plans, progress, etc.). Also the committee works closely with CSR Promotion Leaders in each group company and department to advance initiatives related to respect for human rights.

In addition, the ANA Group has started to conduct human rights correspondence of human rights issues. impact assessments, to analyze and assess the potential negative effects our business may have on stakeholders, and to identify priority human rights issues where we should focus our activities. Now we are in the process of planning and taking some practical measures to deal with the human rights issues that we have identified. Respect for human rights is also included in the ANA Group’s Corporate Strategy for 2018-2022, published in February 2018. Respecting human rights requires a continuous approach – it is a life-long journey. We have taken our first step on this journey, and we expect to take further steps to deepen our human rights activities. Nevertheless, we recognize that we are accountable to stakeholders for our actions. This report is one step towards fulfilling that responsibility, and towards holding ourselves accountable for explaining how https://www.ana.co.jp/group/en/csr/effort/pdf/Human_Rights_Report_2018_e.pdf we see and identify risks, and how we plan to manage those risks. We would appreciate any comments and feedback on our activities, and would like to learn from you in order to further our progress.

ANA Introduces a Next-Generation Education Program Using Group Resources ANA Blue Academy Mirai Tsukuru Total of 1,827 students at 21 schools (as of June 30, 2018) Launched in October 2017, ANA Blue Academy Mirai Tsukuru is a career education program for fifth and sixth graders. ANA plans to roll out this program in all 47 prefectures by March 2019. We designed this program in accordance with new government guidelines for education. Students work with their friends in an active learning environment discussing and creating solutions to various issues. ANA Group pilots, cabin attendants, aircraft mechanics, ground staff, and ground handling staff serve as instructors, sharing the view of their work and the ANA’s Way core values. Through these experiences, we offer opportunities for children to learn the importance of having and striving to follow their dreams. School teachers experiencing the program have mentioned that it encourages children to dream and reach for the future, inspired by the words and experiences of career professionals. The ANA Group is proud to contribute to the education of future generations through the ANA Blue Academy Mirai Tsukuru. Experiencing the roles of aircraft mechanic, pilot, and cabin attendant Message From Maki Wakae, Program Development and Operation Partner When ANA Group representatives visit a class, they always tell the teachers that they have come to deliver dreams and futures to the children. All teachers are instantly fascinated to the message from the instructors in uniforms and their smiles. In today’s chaotic and ever-changing world, traditional education has reached a major crossroads in dealing with what and how to teach the children who will be taking over in future generations. What is important for career education programs is to present real-world themes that highlight a company’s internal workings. Learning in person from active professionals provides a type of Maki Wakae education that bridges the gap between learning and society. In the beginning, instructors and (President, Career Link Inc.) students look nervous. Gradually, their facial expressions turn to smiles, and the children begin to envision their own dreams and goals, inspired by the message and experiences of the instructors. Children are interested in listening to adults who work on the front lines of business talk about their core values and main concerns related to work, as well as how they approach their future. This program provides children an opportunity to learn what it means to strive toward future dreams and goals. I believe that the ANA Blue Academy Mirai Tsukuru provides learning connected to society, which is something needed in current Japanese education. 69 External Recognition Inclusion in Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Indexes • Dow Jones Sustainability World Index • Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index • FTSE4Good Index Series • FTSE Blossom Japan Index • Morningstar Socially Responsible Investment Index • MSCI Japan Empowering Women Index Management Strategy • Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry New Diversity Management Selection 100 (2016–) Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and Tokyo Stock Exchange 2018 Nadeshiko Brand 2018 Health & Productivity Stock Selection 2018 Competitive IT Strategy Company Stock • 2018 J-Win Diversity Award (ANA) • Business Travel Awards (ANA) Best Corporate Social Responsibility Programme 2018 Business Airline of the Year 2018 WINNER Best Corporate Social WINNER Business Airline of the Year Responsibility Programme Quality • SKYTRAX (ANA) World Airline Rating 5-STAR AIRLINE Categories Best Airline Staff in Asia World’s Best Airline Cabin Cleanliness • Air Transport World (ANA) Airline of the Year 2018 On-Time Performance • FlightStats (ANA) No. 2 in Asia-Pacific Major Airlines Category No. 3 in Major International Airlines Category Universal Services • Prime Minister’s Award in the Promotion of Barrier-Free and Universal Design Awards (ANA / ANA WINGS) • 10th Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Award for Barrier-Free Design Contributor (ANA / ANA WINGS) Regional Revitalization • The 3rd Japan Tourism Awards Regional Category, Field of Domestic and Inbound Travel ONSEN & Gastronomy Tourism Association* Certification of and sharing of information regarding walking courses * Secretariat: ANA Strategic Research Institute Co., Ltd. 70 Foundation Supporting Value Creation Corporate Governance System “Security and Trust” is the Group’s unwavering promise to our customers.

Through this process, the board searches for new solutions as it works toward defined ideals for board activity and governance. At least once per year, the Company analyzes, evaluates, and discusses the overall effectiveness of the board of directors, aiming to improve board effectiveness. (Method of Evaluation During Fiscal 2017) Every director and Audit & Supervisory Board members received a questionnaire to be returned no later than January 2018. The questionnaire solicited responses regarding progress and assessments related to issues identified by each director through past analyses and evaluations of board effectiveness. Outside directors and outside members of the Audit & Supervisory Board were interviewed prior to February 2018 to delve deeper into the results of the surveys. A report was presented to the board of directors in April 2018, providing a detailed analysis of survey and interview results. In response, the Company established a PDCA cycle to enhance further effectiveness of the board of directors through operational changes toward new solutions.

We will continue to pursue better quality in governance by encouraging discussions in board meetings, providing meaningful dialogue with stakeholders, and introducing other measures to implement management policies that contribute to the creation of corporate value.

Items for Review  The Japanese Corporate Governance Code was revised during fiscal 2017, while the publication of Guidelines for Investor and Company Engagement was published in June 2018. With these changes, our board of directors plans to discuss and confirm a number of matters that we will include in our corporate governance report. These matters include an examination of cross shareholdings and the allocation of management resources (revised business portfolio based on accurate understanding of cost of capital, capital investments, etc.).

Fundamental Approach to Aircraft Procurement Aircraft are major investments used over the long term (10-plus years). Decisions regarding the selection of aircraft types suited to routes and networks and the pursuit of the best fleet composition are among the most important issues for airline management. The ANA Group fleet strategy is based on three basic policies: (1) Strengthening cost competitiveness by introducing fuel-efficient aircraft, (2) Optimizing supply to demand by increasing the ratios of narrowand medium-body aircraft; and (3) Enhancing productivity by integrating aircraft types. Fundamentally, the Group purchases and owns strategic aircraft we intend to use over the medium to long term. We employ operating leases to procure aircraft for use over the short term or for capacity adjustment. The Group may also utilize sale-leaseback transactions as a means to diversify corporate financing methods. In these and other ways, the Group selects the most economical aircraft procurement method. 107 Aircraft Procured in Fiscal 2017 Based on our fleet strategy, aircraft in service totaled 292 as of the Bombardier DHC-8-400s. Meanwhile, the Group sold a total of 12 end of fiscal 2017, an increase of 24 compared to the end of the aircraft, including three Boeing 777-200s, three Boeing 767-300s, previous fiscal year. three Boeing 737-500s, and three Airbus A320-200s.

Further, the Group’s information systems are also used by its partner airlines so there is a possibility that the impact of systems failure would not be limited to the Group. 114 Financial / Data Section Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Balance Sheet ANA HOLDINGS INC. and its consolidated subsidiaries As of March 31, 2018 U.S. dollars (Thousands) Yen (Millions) (Note 2) ASSETS 2018 2017 2018 Current assets: Cash and deposits (Notes 16 and 21) ¥ 78,036 ¥ 60,835 $ 734,525 Marketable securities (Notes 5 and 16) 279,540 257,950 2,631,212 Notes and accounts receivable (Note 16) 174,211 154,668 1,639,787 Accounts receivable from and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates 3,324 4,262 31,287 Lease receivables (Note 8) 27,310 28,948 257,059 Inventories (Notes 6, 8 and 23) 62,470 64,912 588,008 Deferred income taxes (Note 11) 27,678 36,173 260,523 Prepaid expenses and other 99,081 59,332 932,614 Allowance for doubtful accounts (479) (355) (4,508) Total current assets 751,171 666,725 7,070,510 Property and equipment: Land (Note 8) 55,786 49,887 525,094 Buildings and structures (Note 8) 265,891 263,340 2,502,739 Aircraft (Note 8) 1,856,178 1,773,182 17,471,554 Machinery and equipment 107,900 107,201 1,015,625 Vehicles 29,381 28,971 276,553 Furniture and fixtures 52,952 52,144 498,418 Lease assets (Notes 8 and 13) 13,594 15,095 127,955 Construction in progress 202,328 151,889 1,904,442 Total 2,584,010 2,441,709 24,322,383 Accumulated depreciation (1,150,909) (1,081,446) (10,833,104) Net property and equipment 1,433,101 1,360,263 13,489,278 Investments and other assets: Investment securities (Notes 5 and 16) 83,871 76,387 789,448 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates (Note 7) 40,274 46,821 379,085 Lease and guaranty deposits 21,845 10,791 205,619 Deferred income taxes (Note 11) 65,698 52,759 618,392 Goodwill 55,336 1,041 520,858 Intangible assets 99,902 87,963 940,342 Other assets 11,264 11,660 106,024 Total investments and other assets 378,190 287,422 3,559,770 TOTAL (Note 18) ¥ 2,562,462 ¥ 2,314,410 $ 24,119,559 115 U.S. dollars (Thousands) Yen (Millions) (Note 2) LIABILITIES AND NET ASSETS 2018 2017 2018 Current liabilities: Short-term loans (Notes 8 and 16) ¥ 176 ¥ 70 $ 1,656 Current portion of long-term debt (Notes 8 and 16) 99,949 118,312 940,785 Accounts payable (Note 16) 225,889 181,768 2,126,214 Accounts payable to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates 4,545 4,866 42,780 Advance ticket sales 181,353 150,614 1,707,012 Accrued expenses 65,805 62,025 619,399 Income taxes payable 37,709 11,288 354,941 Other current liabilities (Note 10) 32,654 43,704 307,360 Total current liabilities 648,080 572,647 6,100,150 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt (Notes 8 and 16) 698,268 611,495 6,572,552 Liability for retirement benefits (Note 9) 156,765 156,751 1,475,574 Deferred income taxes (Note 11) 94 1,444 884 Asset retirement obligations (Note 10) 1,196 1,074 11,257 Other long-term liabilities 57,507 46,824 541,293 Total long-term liabilities 913,830 817,588 8,601,562 Contingent liabilities (Note 15) Net assets (Note 14): Common stock: Authorized – 510,000,000 shares; Issued – 348,498,361 shares in 2018 and 2017* 318,789 318,789 3,000,649 Capital surplus 268,208 283,249 2,524,548 Retained earnings 457,746 334,880 4,308,603 Treasury stock – 1  3,866,101 shares in 2018 and 1,412,231 shares in 2017* (59,015) (3,756) (555,487) Accumulated other comprehensive income: Unrealized gain on securities 24,467 20,636 230,299 Deferred loss on derivatives under hedge accounting (3,471) (11,799) (32,671) Foreign currency translation adjustments 3,201 3,364 30,129 Defined retirement benefit plans (21,264) (26,206) (200,150) Total 988,661 919,157 9,305,920 Non-controlling interests 11,891 5,018 111,925 Total net assets 1,000,552 924,175 9,417,846 TOTAL ¥2,562,462 ¥2,314,410 $24,119,559 *Shares have been restated, as appropriate, to reflect a 1-for-10 ordinary share reverse stock split effected October 1, 2017.

Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of ANA HOLDINGS INC. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, certain reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial statements of the previous fiscal year to conform to the classifications used in the current fiscal year. 2. Translation of financial statements The consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen and, solely for the convenience of readers outside of Japan, have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of ¥106.24 = US$1, the approximate exchange rate prevailing on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market on March 31, 2018. This translation should not be construed as a representation that the amounts shown could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate. Translations of U.S. dollars are rounded down to the nearest thousand and, therefore, the totals shown in tables do not necessarily agree with the sums of the individual amounts. 3. Summary of significant accounting policies (a) Consolidation The consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2018, include the accounts of the Company and its 64 (63 in 2017) significant subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”). Under the control and influence concepts, those companies in which the Company, directly or indirectly, is able to exercise control over operations are fully consolidated, and those companies over which the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in 16 (17 in 2017) unconsolidated subsidiaries and significant affiliates are accounted for by the equity method. The difference between the cost and the underlying net assets at dates of acquisition of consolidated subsidiaries and companies accounted for by the equity method is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 10 to 15 years. Investments in 91 (85 in 2017) subsidiaries and affiliates which are not consolidated or accounted for by the equity method are stated at cost. If the equity method of accounting had been applied to the investments in these companies, the effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements would not be material. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profit included in assets resulting from transactions within the Group is also eliminated. Certain subsidiaries have fiscal years ending on December 31 and February 28, and necessary adjustments for significant transactions, if any, are made in consolidation. (b) Foreign currency translation All short-term and long-term monetary receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for payables and receivables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts, and differences arising from the translation are included in the consolidated statement of income. The balance sheet accounts of consolidated foreign subsidiaries are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding non-controlling interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange in effect during the year. Differences arising from the translation are presented as foreign currency translation adjustments in net assets. (c) Marketable securities and investment securities Marketable securities and investment securities are classified into three categories: trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Under the accounting standard, trading securities are carried at fair value and held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are carried at cost, determined by the moving-average method. See Note 5 “Marketable securities and investment securities” for additional information. 121 (d) Allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is stated in amounts considered to be appropriate based on the Group’s past credit loss experience and an evaluation of potential losses in the receivables outstanding. (e) Inventories Inventories include aircraft spare parts, supplies and stock in trade of consolidated subsidiaries, and are stated at cost, principally determined by the moving-average method. The net book value of inventories in the consolidated balance sheet is written down when their net realizable value is less than book value. See Note 6 “Inventories” and Note 23 “Supplementary information for the consolidated statement of income” for additional information. (f) Property and equipment (excluding leased assets) Property and equipment, excluding leased assets, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed based on the estimated useful lives. Major assets are depreciated by the following method: Buildings.................................. Straight-line method Aircraft...................................... Straight-line method The Company and certain subsidiaries employ principally the following useful lives for major property and equipment, based upon the Company’s estimate of durability: Buildings.................................. 3–50 years Aircraft...................................... 9–20 years Major additions and improvements are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repairs, including minor remodels and improvements, are charged to income as incurred. The Group reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assets of the Group are grouped by individual property in the case of rental real estate, assets determined to be sold and idle assets, and by management accounting categories in the case of business assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the discounted cash flows from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition. See Note 22 “Impairment loss” for additional information. (g) Intangible assets and amortization (excluding leased assets) Intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method. Cost of software purchased for internal use is amortized by the straightline method over five years, the estimated useful life of purchased software. (h) Retirement benefits The retirement benefit plans of the Group cover substantially all employees other than directors and corporate auditors. Under the terms of this plan, eligible employees are entitled, upon mandatory retirement or earlier voluntary severance, to lump-sum payments or annuity payments based on their compensation at the time of leaving and years of service with the Company and subsidiaries. The Company and certain significant domestic subsidiaries have trustee employee pension funds to provide coverage for part of the lump-sum benefits or annuity payments. The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution pension plans as well as defined benefit pension plans. The Company accounts for the liability for retirement benefits based on the projected benefit obligations and plan assets at the balance sheet date. The projected benefit obligations are attributed to periods on a benefit formula basis. Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs that are yet to be recognized in profit or loss are recognized within net assets (accumulated other comprehensive income), after adjusting for tax effects, and are recognized in profit or loss over the average remaining service years of employees. (i) Income taxes The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statement of income. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted income tax rates to the temporary differences. See Note 11 “Income taxes” for additional information. (j) Leases Leased assets arising from transactions under finance lease contracts are depreciated to a residual value of zero by the straight-line method using the term of the contract as the useful life. 122 Financial / Data Section Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (k) Derivatives The Group uses derivatives, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and commodity options and swaps are to limit its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The Group does not use derivatives for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains or losses charged or credited to income, except for those which meet the criteria for deferral hedge accounting under which an unrealized gain or loss is deferred. Receivables and payables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts are translated at the corresponding foreign exchange contract rates. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses. (l) Revenue recognition Passenger revenues, cargo and other operating revenues are recorded when services are provided. (m) Cash equivalents Cash equivalents are short-term investments that are readily convertible into cash and exposed to insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash equivalents include time deposits and negotiable certificates of deposit, all of which mature or become due within three months of the date of acquisition. See Note 21 “Supplementary cash flow information” for additional information. (n) Per share information The Company conducted a 1-for-10 ordinary share reverse stock split effected October 1, 2017. All prior year share and per share figures have been restated to reflect the impact of the reverse stock split, to provide data on a basis comparable to the year ended March 31, 2018. Such restatements include calculation regarding the Company’s weighted-average number of common shares, basic net income per share, and cash dividends per share. (o) Transactions to deliver shares of the Company’s stock to employees, etc., through trusts The Company has transactions which consist of delivery of shares of the Company’s stock to the Employee Stock Ownership Group through trusts for the benefit of the Company’s employees. (1) Transaction outline The Company introduced a “Trust Type Employee Stock Ownership Plan” (the “Plan”) on July 12, 2013 as an incentive for the Group’s employees to work in unison to overcome the current harsh business environment and achieve further growth, and as a measure to advance employee welfare. The aim of the Plan is to promote employee asset-building by encouraging stock acquisition and holding through the expansion of the “ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. Employee Stock Ownership Association,” “ANA Group Employee Stock Ownership Association” and “ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS TRADING CO., LTD. Employee Stock Ownership Association” (collectively, the “Stock Ownership Association”). The Plan is an incentive plan for all employees who participate in the Stock Ownership Association. Under the Plan, the “ANA Group Employee Stock Ownership Trust” (the “ESOT”), which was established to transfer the Company’s shares to the Stock Ownership Association, will acquire a portion of the Company’s shares in a single purchase and sell the shares to the Stock Ownership Association over a certain period of time. If a gain on sale of shares is then accumulated within the ESOT through the sale of the Company’s shares to the Stock Ownership Association by the termination of the ESOT, residual assets will be distributed to the Group employees who meet the beneficiary requirements (all individuals who have participated in the Stock Ownership Association during the trust period, including retirees). The ESOT was terminated in July 2017. The gain resulting from sale of shares (Capital surplus) of ¥2,641 million, which was accumulated within the ESOT through the sale of the Company’s shares to the Stock Ownership Association, was distributed as residual assets to ANA Group employees who met the beneficiary requirements. The Company guarantees the borrowings for the ESOT’s acquisition of the Company’s shares, and repays any borrowings outstanding at the termination of the trust pursuant to the guarantee agreement. (2) Accounting method for transactions to deliver the Company’s treasury stock through trusts The Company has adopted the “Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees, etc. through Trusts” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Practical Issues Task Force (“PITF”) No. 30 issued on March 26, 2015). In accordance with PITF No. 30, upon transfer of treasury stock to the employee stock ownership trust (the “Trust”) by the entity, any difference between the book value and fair value of the treasury stock is recorded in capital surplus. At year end, the Company records (1) the Company stock held by the Trust as treasury stock in net assets, (2) all other assets and liabilities of the Trust on a line-by-line basis, and (3) a liability/asset for the net of (i) any gain or loss on delivery of the stock by the Trust to the employee shareholding association, (ii) dividends received from the entity for the stock held by the Trust, and (iii) any expenses relating to the Trust. 123 (3) Matters concerning the Company’s treasury stock held by trusts The book value of the Company’s treasury stock held by trusts was ¥1,346 million as of March 31, 2017, and is recorded as treasury stock in net assets. None of the Company’s stock remains in the trust for the current fiscal year. The number of shares held by the ESOT as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 was 1,378 thousand and 6,379 thousand, respectively. The average number of shares during the year ended March 31, 2017 was 8,493 thousand. For the purpose of calculating per share information, the number of shares at the end of the fiscal year and the average number of shares during the fiscal year are included in treasury stock that is deducted from the calculation. (p) Share remuneration plan for directors The Company has transactions for delivery of the Company’s treasury stock through a trust as a share remuneration plan (the “Trust for Delivery of Shares to Directors”) in order to improve its operating performance, increase its corporate value and raise the directors’ awareness of shareholder-oriented management. (1) Transaction outline Trust for Delivery of Shares to Directors is a system in which funds are contributed by the Company, and shares acquired are distributed to the Company’s directors in accordance with the Company’s operating performance, etc. (2) The Company’s treasury stock remaining in the trust The Company’s treasury stock remaining in the trust is recorded at book value (excluding associated expenses) of the trust and is reflected as treasury stock in net assets. The book value was ¥417 million for the previous fiscal year and ¥360 million for the current fiscal year. The number of shares was 1,318 thousand shares for the previous fiscal year and 114 thousand shares for the current fiscal year. (q) Unapplied new accounting standard “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (“ASBJ” Statement No. 29 – March 30, 2018) “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No. 30 – March 30, 2018) (1) Overview The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new revenue standard, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, (International Financial Standard 15 (“IFRS 15”) and Accounting Standard Codification 606 (“Topic 606”) issued by IASB and FASB, respectively) on May 2014. Against the background of the fact that IFRS 15 will be effective from periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and Topic 606 will be effective from periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, the ASBJ issued ASBJ Statement No. 29, “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition,” and ASBJ Guidance No. 30, “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition.” The core principle of the standard and guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASBJ’s primary policy for developing its accounting standard for revenue recognition was to include the basic principles of IFRS 15 for the purpose of comparability, between financial statements in accordance with Japanese GAAP and those in accordance with IFRS or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, for particular items for which industrial practice should be taken into consideration, alternative means are to be provided to the extent that comparability is maintained. (2) Application date The Company will apply the accounting standard and guidance for annual periods beginning on or after April 1, 2021, and is in the process of measuring the effects of applying the accounting standard and guidance on its consolidated financial statements in future applicable periods. 4.

Asset retirement obligations (a) Asset retirement obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (1) Overview of asset retirement obligations The Company and its domestic subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts with such entities for the Head Office, sales branches, airport branches and certain other offices. As the Company and its domestic subsidiaries have restoration obligations for such properties at the end of each lease period, related legal obligations required by law and the contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as asset retirement obligations. (2) Calculation of asset retirement obligations The Group estimates the expected period of use as 1 to 30 years and calculates the amount of asset retirement obligations with a discount rate of 0% to 2.27%. The following table indicates the changes in asset retirement obligations for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017: U.S. dollars Yen (Millions) (Thousands) 2018 2017 2018 Balance at the beginning of the fiscal year ¥1,074 ¥ 949 $10,109 Liabilities incurred due to the acquisition of property and equipment 1 5 9 Accretion expense 14 15 131 Liabilities settled (31) (14) (291) Other 261 119 2,456 Balance at the end of the fiscal year ¥1,319 ¥1,074 $12,415 (b) Asset retirement obligations not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet The Company and its domestic subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property, and have entered into real estate lease contracts with such entities for land and office at airport facilities, including Tokyo International Airport, Narita International Airport, New Chitose Airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport, Osaka International Airport, Kansai International Airport, Fukuoka Airport and Naha Airport. The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have restoration obligations when they vacate and clear such facilities. However, as the above airports are considered to be critical infrastructure, it is beyond the control of the Company alone to determine when to vacate and clear such facilities, and it is also impossible to make reasonable estimates as there are currently no relocation plans for the above properties. Therefore, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries do not record asset retirement obligations for the related liabilities. 131 11. Income taxes The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries are subject to Japanese national and local income taxes which, in the aggregate, resulted in a normal effective statutory tax rate of approximately 30.86% for each of the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. The Group files a tax return under the consolidated corporate-tax system, which allows companies to base tax payments on the combined profits or losses of the parent company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries. The tax effects of significant temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards which resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities at March 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: U.S. dollars Yen (Millions) (Thousands) 2018 2017 2018 Deferred tax assets: Liability for retirement benefits ¥ 48,276 ¥ 48,447 $ 454,405 Accrued bonuses to employees 14,488 13,458 136,370 Prepaid expenses 7,452 70,143 Long-term unearned revenue 6,460 7,270 60,805 Unrealized gain on inventories and property and equipment 4,728 4,976 44,503 Other provisions 3,546 679 33,377 Deferred loss on hedging instruments 3,138 5,953 29,536 Impairment loss 2,775 1,457 26,120 Accrued enterprise tax 2,528 2,034 23,795 Other 22,197 24,292 208,932 Total gross deferred tax assets 115,588 108,566 1,087,989 Less valuation allowance (7,050) (6,486) (66,359) Total net deferred tax assets 108,538 102,080 1,021,630 Deferred tax liabilities: Unrealized gain on securities (10,315) (8,721) (97,091) Retained earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates (2,316) (2,173) (21,799) Deferred gain on hedging instruments (1,728) (808) (16,265) Other (897) (2,890) (8,443) Total gross deferred tax liabilities (15,256) (14,592) (143,599) Net deferred tax assets ¥ 93,282 ¥ 87,488 $ 878,030 A reconciliation of the difference between the normal effective statutory tax rate and the actual effective income tax rate for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: 2018 2017 Normal effective statutory tax rate 30.86% 30.86% Reconciliation: Amortization of goodwill 0.63 0.04 Expenses not deductible for income tax purposes 0.38 0.49 Changes in valuation allowance 0.20 (1.98) Inhabitant tax per capita levy 0.11 0.14 Gain on step acquisitions (5.30) – Income taxes for prior periods (0.93) (0.14) Other, net (0.01) (0.62) Actual effective income tax rate 25.94% 28.79% 132 Financial / Data Section Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 12.

This is because the shares held by subsidiaries and affiliates are recognized as treasury stock. The Companies Act requires that an amount equal to 10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus), depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends, until the aggregate amount of legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the common stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts within equity under certain conditions upon resolution of the shareholders. 134 Financial / Data Section Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (b) Type and number of outstanding shares Number of shares (Thousands) As of March 31, 2018 Balance at Increase in shares Decrease in shares Balance at Type of shares beginning of year during the year during the year end of year Issued stock: Common stock (*4) 351,642 – 3,144 348,498 Total 351,642 – 3,144 348,498 Treasury stock: Common stock (*1, *2, *3, *4) 1,412 16,257 3,803 13,866 Total 1,412 16,257 3,803 13,866 (*1) T  he increase of 16,257 thousand shares of treasury stock is the total of 16,214 thousand shares, which are issued shares subsequently purchased by the Company; 38 thousand shares, which the Company purchased from holders of fractional shares; and 4 thousand shares, which is the increase associated with changes of ownership ratios of affiliates which hold the Company’s stock.

Financial instruments and related disclosures Overview (a) Group policy for financial instruments The Group limits its fund management to short-term time deposits and raises funds through borrowings from financial institutions, including banks. The Group uses derivatives for the purpose of reducing the risks described below and does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. (b) Types of financial instruments and related risk Trade receivables (notes and accounts receivable) are exposed to credit risk in relation to customers. Marketable securities and investment securities are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations. Those securities are composed mainly of the shares of other companies with which the Group has business relationships. Substantially all trade payables have payment due dates within one year. Borrowings are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments, and certain long-term debt with variable interest rates is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk. However, to reduce such risk for long-term interest-bearing debt at variable rates, the Group utilizes interest rate swap transactions as hedging instruments. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses. For derivatives, in order to reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts for specific receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, mainly for aircraft purchase commitments. In addition, the Group enters into commodity derivative transactions such as swaps and options to mitigate fluctuation risk of the commodity prices of fuel and to stabilize operating profit. 1) Management of credit risks (risks such as breach of contract by customers) The Group manages its credit risk from receivables on the basis of internal guidelines, which include monitoring of payment term and balances of major customers by each business administration department to identify the default risk of customers at an early stage. As for derivatives, the Group believes that the credit risks are extremely low, as it enters into derivative transactions only with reputable financial institutions with sound credit profiles. 2) Management of market risks (fluctuation risks of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates) In order to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks, the Group principally utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts for receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. In order to mitigate the interest rate fluctuation risks related to debt, the Group utilizes interest rate swap transactions. In addition, the Group enters into commodity derivative transactions such as swaps and options to mitigate fluctuation risk related to commodity prices for fuel. As for marketable securities and investment securities, the Group periodically reviews the fair values and the financial conditions of the issuers to identify and mitigate risks of impairment. There are internal management regulations for derivative transactions which set forth transaction authority and limits on transaction amounts. The Group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with such policies. Moreover, the Group reports plans and results of methods and ratios for offsetting risks at the quarterly meetings of the Board of Directors. 3) Management of liquidity risks related to financing (risks that the Group cannot meet the due dates of payables) The Group manages liquidity risks by establishing a financial plan in order to procure and invest funds that are necessary for the operation of the Group over a certain period of time, in accordance with the Group’s business operating plan and budget. (c) Supplementary explanation of the estimated fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, if available. When there is no quoted market price available, fair value is reasonably estimated. Since various assumptions and factors are reflected in estimating the fair value, different assumptions and factors could result in different fair value estimates. In addition, the notional amounts of derivatives presented in Note 17 “Derivatives and hedging activities” are not necessarily indicative of the actual market risk involved in derivative transactions. 136 Financial / Data Section Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Estimated fair value of financial instruments The carrying values of financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 and 2017, and their estimated fair values, are shown in the following tables. The following tables do not include financial instruments for which fair value cannot be reliably determined (Please refer to Note 2 below).

Notes: 1. Methods to determine the estimated fair value of financial instruments and other matters related to securities and derivative transactions Assets (a) Cash and deposits The carrying values of cash and deposits approximate fair value because of their short maturities. (b) Notes and accounts receivable The carrying values of notes and accounts receivable approximate fair value because of their short maturities. 137 (c) Marketable securities and investment securities The fair values of marketable and investment securities are measured at the quoted market price of the stock exchange for the equity instruments, and at the quoted price obtained from the financial institution for certain debt instruments. The information on the fair values of marketable and investment securities by classification is included in Note 5 “Marketable securities and investment securities” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Liabilities (a) Accounts payable The carrying values of notes and accounts payable approximate fair value because of their short maturities. (b) Short-term loans The carrying values of short-term loans approximate fair value because of their short maturities.

Derivatives and hedging activities The Group operates internationally and is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and jet fuel prices. In order to manage these risks, the Group utilizes forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transactions related to purchase commitments, principally of flight equipment, and foreign currency receivables and payables. Also, the Group utilizes interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to outstanding debt. In addition, the Group also enters into a variety of swaps and options in its management of risk exposure related to jet fuel prices. The Group does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The Group has developed internal hedging guidelines to control various aspects of derivative transactions, including authorization levels and transaction volumes. The Group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with these internal guidelines. Derivative and hedging transactions initiated by respective operational departments have been examined by the accounting department and these transactions, including their measures and ratios, are generally monitored by management on a quarterly basis. Assessment of hedge effectiveness is examined at inception and, on an ongoing basis, periodically. The Group is also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties in regard to derivative financial ­instruments; however, it is not expected that any counterparties will fail to meet their obligations, as the majority of the counterparties are internationally recognized financial institutions. Summarized below are the notional amounts and estimated fair values of the derivative financial instruments outstanding as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 for which hedged accounting has been applied.
