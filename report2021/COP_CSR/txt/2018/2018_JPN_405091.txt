are creating self-contained local sales and supply configurations with the aim of becoming the undisputed global market leader. DIC has secured a 40% share of the Japanese market for PPS compounds, but there are many markets overseas that we must still cultivate. We have established production, sales and technical service configurations in four regions, positioning us to ensure an accurate grasp of local market requirements and offer technical support, including by providing advice on molds and molding technologies and analyzing materials, thereby creating self-contained local sales and supply configurations that will support market expansion. Looking ahead, we would also like to create similar self-contained local customer service configurations around the world. PPS compounds are an outstanding, environment-friendly material. Accordingly, we expect that our customer base going forward will not be limited to automakers, but will expand to include manufacturers in such industries as housing equipment and aerospace. PPS Products Manager and Senior Manager, PPS Products Group, Solid Compounds Product Division Toshiyuki Mori Key Person from DIC DIC‚Äôs principal strength is its close relations with automotive components manufacturers and swift its responsiveness. To encourage the further use of PPS compounds in automotive components, it is crucial that we promptly grasp their technical requirements and that we actively bring our proprietary know-how and new technologies to facilitate collaborative development. We must also fully leverage our integrated configuration, which encompasses everything from polymer design through to molding compounds, to promote the swift development and commercialization of new products. To these ends, we are creating opportunities to share information and strengthen communication, including organizing technological exchange meetings, so as to expand our selection of applicable materials. The effectiveness of this approach reflects the competitive advantage we enjoy thanks to our proven track record to date. Senior Manager, Nagoya EP Sales Department, Solid Compounds Product Division Kenji Hasegawa Key Person from DIC As high-performance plastics, PPS compounds offer unlimited possibilities. In addition to extremely high strength and durability, automotive components must deliver both electrical insulating and heat dissipating properties, among a host of other attributes. Manufacturers must also strive to make components thinner and smaller. The ability of PPS compounds to satisfy all of these challenging requirements underscores its suitability for a wide variety of components. By expanding applications for our PPS compound production technologies, we are contributing to efforts to reduce the environmental impact, as well as the cost, of many different manufactured products. Accordingly, simply changing our perspective makes it possible to cultivate entirely new applications for PPS compounds. The sky really is the limit. Head Researcher, Polymer Processing Technical Group 2, Polymer Processing Technical Division Hirokiyo Nakase C Other Efforts to Create Value for Society TO PI Cultivating Applications for PPS Compounds in Increasingly Diverse Fields DIC is creating new value for society by leveraging the properties of PPS compounds to encourage its use as a high-performance alternative to metal materials in numerous fields other than automobile manufacturing. In the area of housing equipment, for example, the Company is capitalizing on the material‚Äôs hydrothermal resistance, pressure resistance and toughness (sturdiness), among others, to promote its use in hot water heaters, combination faucets and other water supply equipment, and joints and valves for pipes. Going forward, DIC will work to further expand applications for PPS compounds by adding surface decoration. In the area of components for precision instruments, DIC is using PPS compounds in low-friction and low-abrasion gears and bearings. DIC is also expected to expand into the aerospace field.

At one of the trade fairs in which we participated, a female architect spotted our display and said that the IZANO helmet was exactly what she had been looking for. She went on to tell me that she could not stand the helmets usually handed out to visitors at construction sites and had been searching for a helmet that delivered both professional-level safety and an attractive design, and that could be carried in her bag. In that our aim had been to develop a helmet that was not only suited to disaster situations but also boasted outstanding versatility, her comments made me extremely happy. I look forward to developing other innovative products that respond precisely to the diverse needs of our customers.

The company develops and supplies a broad range of products that address diverse social imperatives. Social Imperative Shelf life and the lightweighting of packaging are business-critical activities for brand owners in today‚Äôs marketplace. Under the increasing scrutiny of regulations worldwide, packaging must protect products, giving them optimal freshness and shelf life, whether in transit, in-store or at home. This applies as much to products with a long shelf life as to fresh produce, which needs packaging that will preserve color, fragrance, texture and appeal, as well as ensure that it remains safe to consume. Many external factors impact negatively on shelf life and freshness, from oxygen and UV light to moisture and odors. Protective packaging needs to be functional. While traditional packaging materials such as glass and metal are impermeable, their weight can be a disadvantage, increasing transportation costs and carbon footprint. This has led to the trend of utilizing plastic packaging formats, including pouches, but to create packaging that enhances shelf life, these must be carefully structured to deliver optimum shelf life, in some cases using a considerable number of layers. The packaging market‚Äôs need for products that deliver enhanced shelf life, as well as sustainable, recyclable, metalSun Chemical‚Äôs free and waste-reducing solutions, can be addressed through a revolutionary approach that replaces current barrier Response technology with printable oxygen-barrier coatings. Sun Chemical‚Äôs SunBar ¬Æ (Aerobloc) oxygen-barrier coatings are technically advanced next-generation products designed to enable the lightweighting of packaging by removing ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) polymer layers, as well as offering Polymer film Polymer film Ink improved laminate flexibility. SunBar (Aerobloc) oxygen-barrier ¬Æ Ink Adhesive METAdhesive polymer film coatings provide a smooth, homogenous, pinhole-free layer that can METAdhesive polymer film Adhesive be easily overprinted with inks and laminated to a variety of secondary Polymer film Polymer film films. These coatings are cost-effective, compostable and printable with either flexo or gravure inks, allowing for lighter-weight packaging, Polymer film Polymer film Barrier coating a reduced carbon footprint and easy application with few changes to Barrier Ink coating Ink Adhesive current equipment. Adhesivefilm Polymer Polymer film Sun Chemical‚Äôs recent partnership with acpo, ltd., allows the latter to deliver SunBar ¬Æ (Aerobloc) pre-coated films to converters who cannot coat their own films. acpo specializes in coating thin films with state-ofthe-art equipment. These customers now have access to economically priced alternative barrier films with improved barrier protection without the need for capital investment in a coating unit. VOICE from the SunBar ¬Æ (Aerobloc) can resolve many of the challenges that brand owners are facing. DIC Group Brand owners today face a variety of challenges‚Äîfrom sustainability, regulatory compliance and food safety to lightweighting packaging to cut costs‚Äîwhile at the same time enhancing product shelf life. Coated plastics offer barrier improvements, but also have downsides that pose substantial hurdles to overcome. SunBar ¬Æ (Aerobloc) oxygen-barrier coatings serve as a solution to offset these deficiencies and can resolve many of the challenges that brand owners are facing in today's competitive marketplace.

Chemical Group. Occupational Safety and Health Prioritizing Safe Operations The DIC Group recognizes that operational safety is fundamental to its operations and is also a core component of Responsible Care. Accordingly, the Company undertakes occupational safety and health, security and disaster prevention measures to foster a ‚Äúsafety first‚Äù philosophy Groupwide and in the mind of every employee. Because its manufacturing operations span diverse fields, the DIC Group has numerous production processes that use hazardous and toxic materials and rotating devices, including ones that do not involve chemical reactions. Any accident involving such materials or devices has the potential to significantly impact society in general and damage the health of the Group and partner company employees and local residents. With the aim of preventing such accidents, the DIC Group places a high priority on reducing risks in the workplace by enhancing awareness of Principles of Safe Conduct and training safety personnel. The Group strives to enhance safety through efforts to reinforce its safety infrastructure and create a safety-oriented corporate culture. DIC Report 2017 62 ESH Basic Approach As a responsible member of society and a company that manufactures and sells chemical substances, the DIC Group recognizes that proper consideration for ESH is fundamental to its operations and works to incorporate this awareness into all of its business activities. Guided by this philosophy, the DIC Group analyzes accidents and communicates information thus derived, based on which it undertakes risk assessment with the aim of ensuring occupational safety and health. Principal Initiatives in Fiscal Year 2016 1 Making Regional Data Visible through Monthly Reports The DIC Group conducts its diverse businesses in accordance with a wide range of national and regional legal systems, working environments and practices. The risk of accidents and disasters varies from one industry to another because of differences in the facilities, machinery and raw materials used. For Group companies to work as one to improve occupational safety and health, it is therefore crucial to establish appropriate benchmarks for each region (Japan, Greater China, the Asia‚ÄìPacific region, and the Americas and Europe). In fiscal year 2016, DIC defined accidents, disasters and reporting procedures for each region, as well as gathered and shared statistical information related to occupational safety, including employee numbers, working hours, number of accidents leading to workdays lost, number of accidents not leading to workdays lost, number of accidents involving fires/explosions, workdays lost, workdays lost before restart of operations, occupational accident frequency rate, occupational accident severity rate, work days lost per thousand employees and workdays lost per million work hours. This approach made it possible to objectively compare the operational safety of individual Group companies, establish more precise targets and facilitate improvement programs. In fiscal year 2015, DIC established a system for aggregating monthly occupational safety and health data for each company in Greater China and the Asia‚ÄìPacific region as a monthly report. Domestic Group companies already had such a setup in place. This made it easier to more swiftly identify and compare working hours, the numbers of accidents leading to workdays lost, occupational accident frequency rates and other monthly data for these regions, thereby further streamlining Groupwide management. Monthly report 2 Reducing Risks By understanding potential risks in production processes, facilities and devices, and the hazards of chemical substances, the DIC Group systematically prepares initiatives to prevent accidents and occupational injuries. The Group also creates risk assessment guidelines when deploying new or modified equipment or changing production processes to continue risk reduction activities. With the aim of reducing risks associated with chemical substances in Japan, since fiscal year 2015 the DIC Group has created a framework to facilitate the methodical implementation of risk assessments in line with the policy set forth by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Specifically, the Group has formulated proprietary guidelines, including assessment procedures, and is considering measures to assess hazards and toxicity and lower risks associated with chemicals set forth in Japan‚Äôs Poisonous and Deleterious Substances Control Act, including Lecture on the assessment of risks associated with chemical substances modifying and improving practices for handling such substances. To facilitate the smooth implementation of the guidelines, in fiscal year 2016 the Group held seven lectures at 12 DIC Group companies in Japan, which were attended by a total of 149 employees. Participants have been tasked with promoting a three-year plan for reducing risks associated with chemical substances by propagating assessment know-how and procedures at their respective workplaces. 3 Promoting E-Learning-Based Training for Employees To enhance its ESH and disaster prevention capabilities, the DIC Group recognizes the importance of ensuring that all of its employees gain a broad understanding of chemical substances, production processes, and pertinent law and regulations. In fiscal year 2016, the Group introduced an e-learning program on a trial basis to verify its value and, having done so, in fiscal year 2017 the Group began deploying the program at successive Group companies in Japan. The Group also began offering an e-learning program in the PRC in fiscal year 2016, capitalizing on a highly developed smartphone-based e-learning environment and active national and regional government endorsement, and intends to gradually introduce and expand availability once it has verified the program‚Äôs usefulness. DIC Report 2017 63 ESH I C G ro u eD p th VOICE Regional ESH OÔ¨Écer Takeshi Hosomi Fr o m We are using e-learning to enhance the know-how and skills of employees. In fiscal year 2016, we promoted the creation of opportunities and educational materials to facilitate systematic training in key aspects of ESH, which is critical to the promotion of Responsible Care, in Japan. Specifically, we structured training around 16 laws and regulations pertinent to the operation of production facilities, including the Fire Service Act, the Air Pollution Control Law and the High Pressure Gas Safety Act, and verified the appropriateness of educational materials from the perspective of Responsible Care Department specialists, plant ESH officers and production departments. In the PRC, we developed an e-learning program for safety management training targeting ESH officers. Going forward, we will select educational materials appropriate for different trainees with the aim of enhancing the know-how and skills of employees. 4 Training Skilled Safety Personnel to Predict Risks The DIC Group regularly trains skilled safety personnel on how to handle chemical substances, using materials such as its Principles of Safe Conduct and Environment and Safety Guidelines for the R&D Department, as well as safety data sheets (SDSs) and its Occupational Accident Case Studies database. In recent years, the Group has focused especially on a technique called Kiken Yochi Training (KYT) (‚Äúhazard prediction training‚Äù) and on hands-on safety training for employees of Group companies worldwide. The Group also undertakes similar initiatives at production sites in Greater China and the Asia‚ÄìPacific region. In the ROK and Malaysia, local employees have voluntarily translated Principles of Safe Conduct. Headquarters has already translated Principles of Safe Conduct into English and Chinese, using it throughout Greater China and the Asia‚ÄìPacific region. KYT is a constructive way to further increase safety awareness. Domestic DIC Group companies use the technique extensively, and the Group is working to accelerate its deployment in Greater China and the Asia‚ÄìPacific region. 5 Advancing Hands-On Safety Training Hands-on safety training is an effective alternative to classroom-based learning that uses actual equipment to simulate potential risks in the workplace, thereby heightening employees‚Äô awareness of the importance of proper safety. In Japan, the DIC Group initiated a full-fledged hands-on safety training program in 2012 and since then has offered training that bases simulations on previous accidents, including those involving being caught in machinery, electrical discharges or fires from static electricity. In 2014, the Group opened the Saitama Hands-On Safety Training Center, a facility boasting equipment that allows the simulation of an array of accidents, with the goal of fostering skilled safety personnel by incorporating training in new employee and rank-specific training programs. DIC‚Äôs Chiba, Sakai, Hokuriku, Saitama, Kashima and other plants have established their own hands-on safety training equipment and curricula to further embed safety into the DIC Group culture. In light of frequent accidents at domestic production facilities that involved employees with fewer than three years of experience, the DIC Group included safety training and KYT in the training curricula for new employees in fiscal year 2014. In fiscal year 2015, the Group downsized six types of hands-on equipment for a mobile initiative and raised the standards of lecturers. In fiscal year 2016, the Group loaned 20 pieces of hands-on training equipment for a mobile initiative encompassing five sites. Overseas Group companies are also deploying hands-on safety training equipment. Installations in Greater China have included those at Nantong DIC Color, a manufacturer of printing inks and organic pigments; DIC Graphics (Guangzhou) Ltd., which manufactures printing inks; and Changzhou Huari New Material Co., Ltd., a synthetic resin manufacturer, in the PRC, and at Taiwanese printing inks manufacturer DIC Graphics Chia Lung. In the Asia‚ÄìPacific region, there have been installations at DIC Compounds (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd.; and PT DIC ASTRA Chemicals in Indonesia, a manufacturer of printing inks. As well as providing regular hands-on safety training for local employees, these sites offer education for safety instructors. In fiscal year 2016, the cumulative number of participants in hands-on safety training across the global DIC Group surpassed 10,000.

Basic Approach to Sustainable Procurement Having recognized the increasing importance of addressing global issues related to human rights, climate change and water risk, among others, as social imperatives, the DIC Group promotes socially responsible procurement practices. To ensure its extended supply chain functions in a socially responsible manner, the DIC Group established the DIC Group Universal Purchasing Policy, based on which it also formulated purchasing management regulations, in 2008 and the DIC Group CSR Procurement Guidelines, which clarify issues it expects suppliers to address, in 2009. Using the policy and guidelines, the Group promotes CSR procurement across its supply chain by ensuring that all suppliers implement improvements and initiatives necessary to ensure the sustainability of Group procurement.

DIC Report 2017 108 Sustainable Procurement Promoting CSR Procurement Based on the DIC Group Universal Purchasing Policy, and incorporating requirements contained in guidebooks put out by external organizations including the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA), DIC has formulated the DIC Group CSR Procurement Guidelines, a series of requirements pertaining to ESG-related imperatives, including the management of chemical substances in and reduction of the environmental impact of raw materials, as well as respect for human rights across its entire supply chain. With the aim of compelling suppliers to observe these guidelines, the Group conducts assessments and on-site inquiries in accordance with the DIC Group Supply-chain CSR Deployment Guidebook. (Version 2 of the guidebook was published in July 2013.) These efforts have proven effective in enabling the Group to reinforce relations with its suppliers. Supplier Self-Evaluations In accordance with version 2* of the DIC Group Supply-chain CSR Deployment Guidebook, the DIC Group asks suppliers to complete questionnaires, which it uses to ascertain the status of suppliers‚Äô CSR procurement practices.

When we discovered particularly outstanding initiatives being implemented by suppliers, as well as when we felt suppliers‚Äô understanding of CSR fell short, we introduced DIC initiatives as case studies. This has allowed us to build win‚Äìwin relationships with suppliers that I am confident will underpin sustainable growth for all concerned going forward.

Responding Accurately to the Changing Needs of Society In light of the expansion and increasing severity of environmental issues and other key social imperatives, expectations that companies will help contribute to the resolution of related problems are growing, the DIC Group‚Äôs approach is to swiftly gain insights into concerns shared by its stakeholders and to offer appropriate solutions. While the starting point of these efforts is listening to the voices of its customers‚Äîan approach known as ‚Äúcustomer in‚Äù‚Äîthe Group also takes a ‚Äúmarket-in‚Äù approach, paying heed to the importance of anticipating social imperatives. Promoting Businesses that Respond to Future Social Imperatives One of the central strategies of the DIC Group‚Äôs current medium-term management plan, DIC108, is to create next-generation businesses. The Group is responding to this challenge through the cultivation of business models that address social imperatives. For example, one of the principal objectives behind efforts to expedite the development of electric vehicles (EVs) is the need to address increasingly crucial issues such as global warming and the depletion of fossil fuels. However, the practicality of EVs depends on resolving a number of key technological challenges, notably increasing the capacity of storage batteries and developing new power semiconductors, battery charging devices. The DIC Group conducts tireless research aimed at addressing such technological challenges, and is developing innovative materials and systems for storage batteries, power semiconductors and sensors, among others, that will yield concrete, viable solutions, thereby contributing to sustainability. The Group will continue to promote business activities with roots in the needs of society with the aim of further evolving its business models. Examples of Optimized Business Models that Respond to Social Imperatives 1 Linablue¬Æ Natural Blue Food Coloring: Contributing to Food Safety The DIC Group‚Äôs health foods business centers on Spirulina, a cyanobacteria rich in vitamins and minerals that contributes to a balanced diet. Spirulina also absorbs CO 2 as it grows, thus helping to reduce CO2 in the air. The Group also produces and markets Linablue¬Æ, a Spirulina-derived natural blue food coloring that is the only natural food coloring that has been approved as safe by regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe, as well as Japan. The Group will continue to actively promote the expansion of markets for Linablue ¬Æ as a product that responds to a variety of social imperatives.

Among the company‚Äôs noteworthy achievements is its development of a system for sorting waste plastics, generated during the manufacture of original products, by type and color, which has enabled the company to diversify its lineup of products made with recycled plastics, increasing the volume of such materials it uses and adding value to the products in which they are used. 0DWHULDOUHF\FOLQJLQYROYHVWKHUHF\FOLQJRIPDWHULDOIURPDQRULJLQDODSSOLFDWLRQEXWLQDGLIIHUHQWIRUP Helmets made with recycled plastics Anticipating Trends and Promoting Efforts to Identify and Cultivate Promising New Markets :LWKWKHDLPRIUHDOL]LQJVXVWDLQDEOHJURZWKRYHUWKHPHGLXPWRORQJWHUPWKH',&*URXSKDVLGHQWL¬øHGSURPLVLQJQHZPDUNHWVDULVLQJIURPVRFLDOLPSHUDWLYHVLQVL[NH\ areas‚Äîresources, materials and energy; logistics and industrial equipment; electronic and electrical equipment; pharmaceuticals and medical devices; general consumer products; and construction infrastructure‚Äîand is striving to assess its ability to cultivate demand in each.

The DIC Group‚Äôs Guidelines for Social Contribution Activities In line with its Color and Comfort by Chemistry management vision, the DIC Group will promote social contribution initiatives in three areas: business activities, culture and education, and communities and society. Business activities The DIC Group will offer products and services that contribute to the development of a sustainable society and protection of the global environment from the viewpoint of ‚ÄúCSR through business activities.‚Äù Culture and education The DIC Group will engage in activities that will contribute to the development and promotion of culture, the arts, science and education, including fostering next-generation human resources in areas such as the culture of color and chemistry. Communities and society The DIC Group will strive to coexist harmoniously with local communities to develop a relationship of mutual trust. Moreover, the Group will provide an environment that enables employees to engage in voluntary contribution activities in their respective local communities. Examples of Recent Initiatives Publication of the Guidebook for the Universal Color Design‚ÄìRecommended Color Set The DIC Group is actively involved in R&D in the area of color universal design (CUD), as well as in expanding public awareness and understanding of CUD‚Äôs importance. Under the supervision of the University of Tokyo, the Group, in cooperation with the Japan Paint Manufacturers Association, the Industrial Research Institute of Ishikawa and the Color Universal Design Organization, created the Color Universal Design‚ÄìRecommended Color Set and, in 2013, the published the Guidebook for the Color Universal Design‚ÄìRecommended Color Set.

At AIC 2015 TOKYO, the midterm meeting of the International Colour Design‚ÄìRecommended Color Set Association (ACI) in May 2015, Chiba University, the Central Research Laboratories and DIC Color Design, Inc., gave a presentation on issues to consider in printing warnings and other important information on packaging and the results of joint research on the color appearance of red spot colors. After AIC 2015 TOKYO, the DIC Group and Chiba University‚Äôs team continued to conduct joint research on the XVHRIFRORULQDQDJLQJVRFLHW\7KHXQLYHUVLW\JDYHDSUHVHQWDWLRQRQLWV¬øQGLQJVDWDPHHWLQJRIWKH&RORU6FLHQFH Association of Japan in June 2017. As people age, their ability to see colors deteriorates. Accordingly, for elderly people the visibility and legibility of colors in everyday life is as crucial as their aesthetic beauty. It is thus important to ensure that, for example, the printing on road signs is visible at night and that the instructions on pharmaceutical and food packaging is readable if the power goes out because of a disaster, and that signage and brochures are clear in museums, which may use low lighting to prevent damage to works of art. Accordingly, the DIC Group and Chiba University conducted a study of the impact of age and illumination level on the legibility printed materials. Because age reduces the ability to tell the difference between blue and black as a consequence of cataracts and other issues, researchers asked younger and older study participants to evaluate printed samples produced using EOXHSULQWDJDLQVWDFKURPDWLFEDFNJURXQGV7KLVH[HUFLVHHQDEOHGUHVHDUFKHUVWRFRQ¬øUPGLIIHUHQFHVLQZKDWLV Booth for evaluating colors and printed legible to the young and the elderly and identify color schemes that work under various illumination levels. samples Looking ahead, the DIC Group will continue to promote research initiatives that contribute to society and add color to lifestyles. DIC Report 2017 119 Harmony with the Community and Social Contributions Visiting Science Lab Program In line with the Japanese government‚Äôs efforts to promote career education initiatives, as well as to help curb a decline in the popularity of science among children, DIC and DIC Graphics conduct visiting science labs at public elementary schools. Through this program, which focuses on, among others, experiments in pigment synthesis and offset printing, the Group seeks to spark children‚Äôs interest in science and encourage them to realize the close relationship between science and their everyday lives. The DIC Group‚Äôs visiting science lab program was nominated and won gold in the 2016 Education Support Grand Prix, sponsored by Tokyo-based Leave a Nest Co., Ltd. The Education Support Grand Prix is the only awards program in Japan that evaluates and recognizes the educational initiatives of companies committed to helping children thrive from both a business and an educational perspective. One of 12 finalists from among 100 companies promoting next-generation initiatives, the DIC Group was selected through a stringent judging process by a jury consisting of leading educators. In explaining their decision, jury members cited measures and systems in place to ensure that the program, the goal of which is purely to contribute to society, continue regardless of operating results, as well as the use of know-how and technologies particular to the DIC Group and benefits for schools, which include the fact that students earn credits as factors behind their decision.

DIC‚Äôs initiative stood out among nominated programs from more than 100 other companies because rather than being an effort centered on advertising potential or boosting sales, it is an initiative that genuinely seeks to contribute to society. This approach earned high marks. Also worthy of praise is the fact that the program instructors who visit schools in the vicinity of DIC sites are trained researchers who do so as part of their regular work duties. Participation in the program is actually factored into employees‚Äô performance Representative of the jury, reviews.

DIC Report 2017 133 Third-Party Verification The DIC Group commissioned SGS Japan Inc. to conduct third-party verification of its data for greenhouse gas emissions, discharge of industrial waste and number of occupational accidents (including number of accidents leading to workdays lost). DIC Report 2017 134 Third-Party Opinion Regarding DIC Report 2017 Once again this year, I had the honor of reviewing the DIC Report. I was particularly impressed with the Company‚Äôs account of its success in surpassing the targets it had set, other than that for net sales, for fiscal year 2016, the first year of its medium-term management plan, DIC108, which resulted from the implementation of measures in line with the growth scenario outlined in the plan. The explanation of how DIC is managing its business portfolio by dividing its businesses into three categories‚Äîbusinesses with stable earnings bases, businesses that will drive Counselor, The Japan Research Institute, Limited growth and next-generation businesses‚Äîwith the aim of long-term targets, namely, Eiichiro Adachi consolidated net sales of ¬•1,000 billion and operating income of ¬•100 billion in fiscal year 2025, was clear and convincing. In his current capacity, Eiichiro Adachi I would like to offer a few suggestions for enhancing the DIC Group‚Äôs reporting of conducts industry research and assesses corporate per formance from its sustainability initiatives, as well as its disclosure thereof. First, I would like to see the perspective of social responsibility. He also provides financial institutions the promotion of sustainability accorded further importance in Group management. with corporate information for socially The segments titled ‚ÄúInitiatives to Strengthen Governance at Subsidiaries‚Äù and responsible investing (SRI). A member of the Market Evolution and Corporations in ‚ÄúResponding to New Laws and Regulation‚Äù on page 52 were particularly timely. In the 21st Century working group organized DIC108, the Group pledges to work as one, guided by its new slogan, to drive DIC by the Keizai Doyukai (Japan Association of Corporate Executives), Mr. Adachi forward. The Group has budgeted ¬•150.0 billion for strategic investments over three was involved in the preparation of The years. It is important to acknowledge the increasing importance of environmental and 15th Corporate White Paper on ‚ÄúMarket Evolution‚Äù and CSR Management: Toward social due diligence in assessing potential M&A targets. Accordingly, I look forward Building Integrity and Creating Shareholder to the Group enhancing its disclosure regarding the compliance, risk management, Value. From March 2005 to May 2009, he also served as a national expert for Japan information security and other basic practices of its subsidiaries. to the ISO 26000 working group. Second, looking at the report as a whole, my impression was that there is room for a more comprehensive explanation of the relationship between individual businesses and sustainability initiatives. For example, I recognize that the newly developed environment-friendly polyurethane resin , which has the same performance of conventional polyurethane resins but does not contain environment-damaging DMF, which is introduced on page 28, is an appropriate example of product development designed to contribute to a sustainable society. However, in recent years the pollution of oceans caused by the increased consumption and disposal of plastic waste has become a major environmental issue. I would like to see the DIC Group‚Äôs awareness of such newly emerging social imperatives reported on somewhere in the DIC Report. Third, I would like to see the Group strengthen its efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In October 2016, the Group set a target for reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 7.0% from the fiscal year 2013 level by fiscal year 2020, or an average of 1.0% annually. However, compared with recent moves toward the realization of a carbon constrained, or low-carbon, society, this is actually a rather modest goal. With the weighting of fine chemicals in the Group‚Äôs product portfolio likely to continue increasing, I recognize that this is a difficult challenge, but I look forward to seeing the Group promote even more ambitious initiatives. Last year, I stated that I would like to see an increase in reporting on initiatives in overseas markets. This year, more overseas examples were featured in the This third-party opinion reflects my view of the sustainability initiatives and information ‚ÄúVoice from the DIC Group‚Äù and Topics sections, so I would like to acknowledge disclosure of the DIC Group, as understood an improvement on this score. The Group reported on its efforts to create positive from reading this report, from my perspective as an individual who provides corporate work environments. I was both surprised and pleased to see on page 103 that the information to financial institutions to assist voluntary separation rate for female employees of the parent company has declined SRI. It is not intended as a comment on to less than 1% and that the average years of service for female employees currently whether or not the information herein has been measured and calculated accurately to exceeds that for male employees. In next year‚Äôs DIC Report, I hope to see more farconform to commonly accepted standards reaching information on how the Group is leveraging its strengths while at the same for the preparation of environmental or other reports or a judgment on whether the report time integrating the concept of sustainability into each of its businesses. covers relevant important matters in full.

Year-on-year percentage changes in squared parentheses represent Results increases or decreases excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Interregional transactions within the Printing Inks segment are included. Accordingly, the aggregates of regional net sales and operating income figures for the Printing Inks segment differ from the figures presented in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Printing Inks Japan Sales of packaging inks benefited from healthy shipments. However, overall sales in Japan slipped, reflecting decreased demand for publishing inks and news inks and the erosion of sales prices across the board. Operating income soared, underpinned by the aforementioned shipments, as well as by the positive impact of cost reductions and an improved product mix, among others. The Americas and Europe Although sales of packaging inks rose, sales in Europe and North America were down, owing to waning demand for publishing inks and news inks. Sales in Central and South America advanced, buoyed by brisk shipments of packaging inks and publishing inks. As a consequence of various factors, including these results, and of the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, overall sales in the Americas and Europe declined. Foreign currency fluctuations also hindered operating income, which decreased despite being level in local currency terms. 3 Management‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis Asia and Oceania While shipments of packaging inks were solid, flagging sales prices in all product categories pushed down sales in the PRC. A sharp increase in sales of publishing inks and packaging inks underpinned higher sales in Southeast Asia. In Oceania, sales rose, bolstered by robust shipments of publishing inks and packaging inks. Sales in India slipped, with contributing factors including falling sales of news inks. For these and other reasons, overall sales in Asia and Oceania decreased, hampered by foreign currency fluctuations. Operating income was up in local currency terms, bolstered by higher sales of high-value-added products, cost reductions and other factors, but down after translation, reflecting foreign currency fluctuations.

Sales of thin-film transistor (TFT) liquid crystals (LCs) rose substantially, reflecting higher shipments from a new production facility in the PRC and the start of full-scale shipments from Japan, which had been delayed. While these factors boosted results in local currency terms, segment sales were down after translation, owing to foreign currency fluctuations.

Sales overseas were also down, hindered by the deterioration of sales prices and by foreign currency fluctuations, although sales to customers in the electrical and electronics industries were solid. For these and other reasons, segment sales decreased. Cost reductions and other factors sparked a sharp increase in segment operating income.

Thanks to robust shipments overseas, sales of jet inks were up overall, despite the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations on exports, which hurt domestic sales. Although these factors led to an increase in local currency terms, segment sales decreased after translation, owing to foreign currency fluctuations.

Nonetheless, segment sales declined, despite being level in local currency terms. Reasons for this result included dwindling sales of industrial adhesive tapes, which were hindered by sluggish demand for products used in smartphones. Segment operating income fell, with contributing factors including the aforementioned sales results.

Consolidated Subsidiaries Year ended December 31, 2016 Note 1: Basis of The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions Presenting set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations, and Financial in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (‚ÄúJapanese GAAP‚Äù), which are different Statements in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards (‚ÄúIFRS‚Äù). In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which DIC Corporation (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) is incorporated. Note 2: Summary of Consolidated financial statements Significant Under the control or influence concept, those companies in which the Company, directly or indirectly, is able to Accounting exercise control over operations are fully consolidated and those companies over which the Company has the Policies ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its significant subsidiaries: Sun Chemical Group Co√∂peratief U.A., DIC (China) Co., Ltd., DIC Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, SEIKO PMC CORPORATION, DIC Investments Japan, LLC., DIC Graphics Corporation and 144 other companies in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (146 other companies in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profit included in assets resulting from transactions within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù) is eliminated. Investments in 23 affiliates in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (22 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015) are accounted for by the equity method. Accounting period of consolidated subsidiaries The closing date of the consolidated subsidiaries is the same as the consolidated closing date. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand, certificates of deposit and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have insignificant risk of changes in value. Investment securities Investment securities are classified and accounted for, depending on management‚Äôs intent, into available-forsale securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gain and loss, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component of net assets. Available-for-sale securities whose fair values are not readily available are carried at cost. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the moving-average method. Allowance for doubtful accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts of the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries is provided based on historical experience for normal receivables and on an estimate of collectibility of receivables from companies in financial difficulty. Allowance for doubtful accounts of foreign consolidated subsidiaries is provided based on an estimate of collectibility of receivables. Inventories Inventories are principally stated at cost, cost being determined by the FIFO method, which evaluates the amount of the inventories shown in the balance sheet by writing them down based on their decrease in profitability. Property, plant and equipment (excluding leased assets) Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Significant renewals and additions are capitalized; maintenance and repairs, and minor renewals and improvements, are charged to income as incurred. Depreciation of buildings (other than facilities attached to buildings) of the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries is calculated principally by the straight-line method. Besides, depreciation of facilities 12 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements attached to buildings and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016 is also calculated by the straight-line method. Other property, plant and equipment are calculated by the declining-balance method. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment of foreign consolidated subsidiaries is calculated principally by the straight-line method. The range of useful lives is principally from 8 to 50 years for buildings and structures and from 3 to 11 years for machinery, equipment and vehicles. Intangible assets (excluding leased assets) Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, and are amortized by the straight-line method. Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a reasonable period not exceeding 20 years. Leased assets Leased assets related to finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are depreciated on a straight-line basis, with the lease periods used as their useful lives and no residual value. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries account for lease transactions in accordance with either the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (‚ÄúU.S. GAAP‚Äù) or IFRS. Retirement and pension plans The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries account for net defined benefit asset/liability for employees‚Äô and executive officers‚Äô retirement benefits. Pension assets are deducted from retirement benefit obligations and the net amount is recognized based on the estimated amount of payment as of the balance sheet date. In calculating retirement benefit obligations, the Company applies a method of attributing expected retirement benefits to each period on a benefit formula basis. The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries amortize actuarial gain and loss in the succeeding years primarily by the straight-line method over stated years that do not exceed the average remaining service period of the eligible employees (15 to 16 years). Past service costs are amortized in the accounting periods when they accrue. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries are accounted for in accordance with either U.S. GAAP or IFRS. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized in the succeeding year primarily by the straight-line method over stated years that do not exceed the average remaining service period of the eligible employees (10 to 28 years). Past service costs are amortized over 4 to 26 years. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized past service costs are recorded in ‚ÄúRemeasurements of defined benefit plans‚Äù in net assets after adjusting income tax effect. Asset retirement obligations The asset retirement obligation is recognized as the sum of the discounted cash flows required for the future asset retirement and is recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made. If a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation cannot be made in the period in which the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation can be made. Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, an asset retirement cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related fixed asset by the amount of the liability. The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense through depreciation over the remaining useful life of the asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period. Any subsequent revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows are reflected as an increase or a decrease in the carrying amount of the liability and the capitalized amount of the related asset retirement cost. Income taxes The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income (loss) included in the consolidated statement of income. Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws to the temporary differences. Research and development costs Research and development costs are charged to income as incurred. 13 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of translation of financial statements of foreign consolidated subsidiaries The financial statements of foreign consolidated subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are translated into Japanese yen based on the following procedures: (1) Assets and liabilities of foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. (2) Income and expenses are translated into Japanese yen at the average rate during the year. The differences of translation are included in foreign currency translation adjustment and non-controlling interests, which are presented as separate components of net assets. Translation of foreign currency account Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date and any difference arising from the translation is recognized in the consolidated statement of income if hedge accounting is not applied. Derivatives and hedging activities To hedge risks associated with the fluctuations of exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts, currency options and swaps, interest rate swaps, and commodity swaps. To hedge a part of the risks associated with the fluctuations of exchange rates for investments in foreign entities, the Company uses loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Group does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments and foreign currency transactions are classified and accounted for as follows: 1) all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognized in the consolidated statement of income and 2) for derivatives used for hedging purposes, if derivatives qualify for hedge accounting because of high correlation and effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, gains or losses on derivatives are deferred until maturity of the hedged transactions. Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the contracted rates if the forward contracts qualify for hedge accounting. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred and recognized in income when the hedged transaction occurs. If interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting and meet certain specific matching criteria, they will not be measured at market value, rather the differential paid or received under the swaps will be recognized in interest expenses or interest income. Per share information Earnings per share (basic) is computed by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares issued for the period, retroactively adjusted for stock splits. The Company implemented the consolidation of shares of common stock by a factor of 10 to 1, with July 1, 2016, as the effective date. Earnings per share (basic) is calculated based on the assumption that the consolidation had been implemented at the beginning of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Earnings per share (diluted) reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock. Earnings per share (diluted) assumes full conversion of the outstanding convertible notes and bonds at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance) with an applicable adjustment for related interest expense, net of tax, and full exercise of outstanding warrants. Cash dividends per share presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are dividends applicable to the respective years, including dividends to be paid after the end of the year. Cash dividends per share applicable to the period for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, comprises interim dividends of ¬•4.00 (before the consolidation) and year-end dividends of ¬•60.00 (after the consolidation). If the consolidation had been taken into consideration, cash dividends per share applicable to the period for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, would be ¬•100.00. Note 3: Accounting Application of Accounting Standard for Business Combinations and other regulations Changes Effective from the beginning of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Company has applied ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Business Combinations‚Äù (ASBJ Statement No. 21, September 13, 2013), ‚ÄúAccounting 14 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Standard for Consolidated Financial Statements‚Äù (ASBJ Statement No. 22, September 13, 2013), ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Business Divestitures‚Äù (ASBJ Statement No. 7, September 13, 2013), etc. As a result, the method of recording the amount of difference caused by changes in the Company‚Äôs ownership interests in subsidiaries in the case of subsidiaries under ongoing control of the Company was changed to one in which it is recorded as capital surplus, and the method of recording acquisition-related costs was changed to one in which they are recognized as expenses for the fiscal year in which they are incurred. Furthermore, for business combinations carried out on or after the beginning of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the accounting method was changed to one in which the reviewed acquisition cost allocation resulting from the finalization of the provisional accounting treatment is reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year to which the date of business combination belongs. In addition, the presentation method for ‚ÄúNet income‚Äù and other related items was changed, and the presentation of ‚ÄúMinority interests‚Äù was changed to ‚ÄúNon-controlling interests.‚Äù Application of ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Business Combinations,‚Äù etc., is in line with the transitional measures provided for in paragraph 58-2 (4) of ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Business Combinations,‚Äù paragraph 44-5 (4) of ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Consolidated Financial Statements‚Äù and paragraph 57-4 (4) of ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Business Divestitures.‚Äù The Company is applying the standards prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Company adopted the method of recording cash flows from the purchase or sales from changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in change in scope of consolidation as ‚ÄúNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities.‚Äù Moreover, the method of recording cash flows relating to costs arising from the purchase of investments in subsidiaries resulting in change in scope of consolidation and costs arising from the purchase or sales from changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in change in scope of consolidation as ‚ÄúNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities‚Äù was adopted. As a result, the impact of this change on the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 was immaterial. Application of Practical Solution on a change in depreciation method due to Tax Reform 2016 Following the revision to the Corporation Tax Act, the Company has applied ‚ÄúPractical Solution on a change in depreciation method due to Tax Reform 2016‚Äù (ASBJ Practical Issues Task Force No. 32, June 17, 2016) from the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, and changed the depreciation method for facilities attached to buildings and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016 from the declining-balance method to the straightline method. As a result, the impact of this change on the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 was immaterial. Note 4: Changes in ‚ÄúLong-term loans receivable‚Äù of ‚ÄúInvestments and other assets,‚Äù which had previously been separately prePresentation sented, is included in ‚ÄúOther‚Äù from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, because its materiality has de(Consolidated creased, and prior period financial statements have been reclassified in accordance with the new presentation. Balance Sheet) The balance which is included in ‚ÄúOther‚Äù as of December 31, 2015 is ¬•110 million. Note 5: New Accounting Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets Pronouncement On March 28, 2016, ASBJ issued ASBJ Guidance No. 26, ‚ÄúImplementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets.‚Äù (1) Overview When authority for providing practical guidelines on the accounting and auditing treatment of recoverability of deferred tax assets (limited to the portion related to accounting treatment) was transferred from JICPA to ASBJ, ASBJ fundamentally followed the framework of classifications mainly prescribed in JICPA Auditing Standards Board Report No. 66, ‚ÄúAudit Treatment of Judgments with Regard to Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets.‚Äù This system classifies companies into five categories and the amount of deferred tax assets to be recorded is estimated in accordance with these classifications. The implementation guidance makes necessary reviews a part of the classification criteria and treatment of the amount of deferred tax assets to be recorded. With 15 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements regard to the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the implementation guidance prescribes the guidelines to be used when applying accounting standards related to tax-effect accounting (Business Accounting Council). (Review of the criteria as to the classification and the treatment for the recognition of deferred tax assets) (i) accounting treatments for entities which are not included in any categories, (ii) criteria as to the classification of entities in Category 2 and Category 3, (iii) accounting treatments of unscheduled deductible temporary differences for entities in Category 2, (iv) accounting treatments for deductible temporary differences for entities in Category 3, which are scheduled to be deductible after five years, and (v) accounting treatments for entities in Category 4 in the current fiscal year, which are expected to be included in Category 2 or Category 3 in the following year. (2) Date of adoption The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries will adopt the revised implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017.

(3) Defined contribution pension plans The required contributions borne by the Company and a number of consolidated subsidiaries in relation to the defined contribution pension plans for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were ¬•1,947 million and ¬•2,151 million, respectively. Note 13: Net Assets Japanese companies are subject to the Companies Act of Japan (the ‚ÄúCompanies Act‚Äù). The significant provisions in the Companies Act that affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below: (1) Dividends Under the Companies Act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year-end dividend upon resolution at the shareholders‚Äô meeting. For companies that meet certain criteria such as: (a) having the board of directors, (b) having independent auditors, (c) having the board of corporate auditors and (d) the term of service of the directors is prescribed as one year rather than two years of normal term by its articles of incorporation, the board of directors may declare dividends (except for dividends in kind) at 21 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements any time during the fiscal year if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. The Company meets all the above criteria. The Companies Act permits companies to distribute dividends in kind (non-cash assets) to shareholders subject to a certain limitation and additional requirements. Semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year upon resolution by the board of directors if the articles of incorporation of the company so stipulate. The Companies Act provides certain limitations on the amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury shares. The limitation is defined as the amount available for distribution to the shareholders, but the amount of net assets after dividends must be maintained at no less than ¬•3 million. (2) Increases/decreases and transfer of common stocks, reserve and surplus The Companies Act requires that an amount equal to 10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus) depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends until the total of the aggregate amount of legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the common stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts under certain conditions upon resolution of the shareholders. (3) Treasury shares and treasury stock acquisition rights The Companies Act also provides for companies to purchase treasury shares and dispose of such treasury shares by resolution of the board of directors. The amount of treasury shares purchased cannot exceed the amount available for distribution to the shareholders which is determined by a specific formula. Under the Companies Act, stock acquisition rights, which were previously presented as a liability, are now presented as a separate component of equity. The Companies Act also provides that companies can purchase both treasury stock acquisition rights and treasury shares. Such treasury stock acquisition rights are presented as a separate component of equity or deducted directly from stock acquisition rights. Note 14: Capital Stock The Company retired its treasury shares on January 15, 2016. In addition, the Company implemented the consolidation of shares of common stock by a factor of 10 to 1, with July 1, 2016, as the effective date. As a result, the number of authorized shares as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are 150,000,000 shares and 1,500,000,000 shares, respectively, and the number of shares issued as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are 95,156,904 shares and 965,372,048 shares, respectively. Note 15: Treasury Shares The Company retired its treasury shares on January 15, 2016. In addition, the Company implemented the consolidation of shares of common stock by a factor of 10 to 1, with July 1, 2016, as the effective date.

Means of financings include direct financing such as the issuance of bonds and commercial papers and liquidation of receivables, as well as indirect financing such as shortand long-term bank borrowings, the terms of which are determined based on financial market conditions and balance of account at the time. Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments Receivables such as notes and accounts receivable‚Äìtrade are exposed to customer credit risk. In addition, some of such receivables are denominated in foreign currencies and are exposed to the market risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. Investment securities, mainly the stocks of customers and suppliers, are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations. Payment terms of payables, such as notes and accounts payable‚Äìtrade, are less than one year. In addition, some of such payables are denominated in foreign currencies and are exposed to the market risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. Funds needed for operations are mainly procured as short-term loans payable, whereas funds needed for capital expenditure and investment are mainly procured as long-term loans payable, bonds payable and lease obligations with regard to finance lease transactions. A part of such bank loans, bonds and lease obligations are exposed to market risks from changes in variable interest rates. Trade accounts payable and loans payable of the Company are also exposed to liquidity risk that the Company cannot meet its contractual obligations in full on maturity dates. Risk management for financial instruments The Company manages its credit risk from trade notes and accounts receivable on the basis of internal guidelines, which include the monitoring of payment terms and balances of customers by the sales and business administration departments to identify the default risk of customers at an early stage. The consolidated subsidiaries of the Company manage the exposure to credit risk on their own in accordance with their internal guidelines. Investment securities are managed by monitoring market values, the financial position of issuers and considering the relationship with customers and suppliers on a regular basis. The Group also tries to mitigate liquidity risk by arranging lines of credit with financial institutions, along with adequate financial planning. 24 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Fair value of financial instruments The following tables present the carrying amounts and the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Net debt amounts are indicated in parentheses. The valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments and information on the marketable securities and derivative financial instruments are as follows: Assets Cash and deposits and notes and accounts receivable‚Äìtrade The fair value of cash and deposits and notes and accounts receivable‚Äìtrade approximates their carrying amounts as these amounts are settled in a short period of time. Investment securities The fair value of investment securities is measured at the quoted market price on the stock exchange. Liabilities Notes and accounts payable‚Äìtrade, short-term loans payable and income taxes payable The fair value of these accounts approximates their carrying amounts as these amounts are settled in a short period of time. Current portion of long-term loans payable and long-term loans payable For long-term loans payable bearing a floating interest rate, the fair value of those subject to special treatment of interest rate swaps are based on present value by totaling the amount of principal and interest, together with related interest rate swaps, discounted by the interest rate that would apply if equivalent long-term loans were newly entered into. The fair value of other long-term loans payable for which a floating interest rate is applied approximates their carrying amount, due to the fact that the market rate of interest is quickly factored in while credit status of the Company remains unchanged. On the other hand, the fair value of long-term loans payable for which a fixed interest rate is applied is determined by discounting the cash flows related to the long-term loans payable. The discount rate applied for 26 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements the calculation above is the interest rate that may be currently available to the Group for loans payable with similar terms and conditions. Bonds payable As for bonds payable which has observable market prices, the fair value is measured using the quoted market prices. Lease obligations (current) and lease obligations (non-current) The fair value of these accounts is determined by discounting the cash flows related to the lease obligations. The discount rate applied for the calculation above is the interest rate that may be currently available to the Group for lease obligations with similar terms and conditions. Derivative financial instruments Please see Note 20 ‚ÄúDerivative Financial Instruments‚Äù for more information. Financial instruments whose fair value is not reliably measured There are no market prices for non-listed stocks and others (carrying amounts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are ¬•22,755 million and ¬•21,328 million, respectively) whose future cash flows cannot be estimated. The fair value of such non-listed stocks and others is not reliably determinable and thus is excluded from investment securities.

Basic framework for internal control over financial reporting Yoshiyuki Nakanishi, Representative Director, President and CEO, and Masayuki Saito, Representative Director, Executive Vice President and CFO of DIC Corporation (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), are responsible for designing and operating internal control over the Company‚Äôs financial reporting and have designed and operated internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the basic framework for internal control set forth in ‚ÄúOn the Revision of the Standards and Practice Standards for Management Assessment and Audit concerning Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (Council Opinions),‚Äù issued by the Business Accounting Council of the Financial Services Agency of Japan. Internal control aims to achieve its objectives to a reasonable extent with the organized and integrated function of basic individual elements of internal control as a whole. Accordingly, due to the inherent limitations, there is a possibility that misstatements may not be completely prevented or detected by internal controls over financial reporting. 2. Scope of assessment, the basis date of assessment and assessment procedures The assessment of internal control over financial reporting for fiscal year 2016 was conducted as of December 31, 2016, which is the end of this fiscal year. The assessment was performed in accordance with relevant assessment standards generally accepted in Japan for internal control over financial reporting. In conducting this assessment, we began by evaluating internal control which may have a material impact on overall consolidated financial reporting (‚Äúcompany-level controls‚Äù) and, based on the results of this assessment, business processes to be assessed were selected. We then analyzed these selected business processes to identify key controls therein that may have a material impact on the reliability of the Company‚Äôs financial reporting, after which we examined the design and operation of these controls. These procedures thus allowed us to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of the Company‚Äôs internal control. We determined the required scope of assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates from the perspective of materiality or the degree to which it may affect the reliability of financial reporting. Materiality of the impact which may affect the reliability of financial reporting is determined based on potential quantitative and qualitative impact on financial reporting. In light of the results of assessment of company-level controls, we reasonably determined the scope of assessment of process-level controls. Consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates which were concluded as immaterial taking into account the degree of quantitative and qualitative impact are not included in the scope for assessment of company-level controls. With regard to the process-level controls, significant locations and business units to be tested were selected based on the changes in the scope of consolidation during the year, as well as on net sales for the previous year, with locations and business units the combined sales volume of which reached approximately twothirds of consolidated net sales being defined as ‚Äúsignificant.‚Äù The scope of assessment at these locations and business units encompassed business processes relevant to net sales, accounts receivable-trade, accounts payable-trade, inventories and manufacturing facilities included in property, plant and equipment as significant accounts that may have a material impact on the business objectives of the Company. In addition, business processes relating to (i) greater likelihood of material misstatements, and/or (ii) significant accounts involving estimates and management‚Äôs judgment, were also identified as business processes having greater materiality, taking into account their impact on financial reporting, and were included in the scope. 3. Results of the assessment Based on the results of the assessment, we concluded that as of the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting was effectively maintained.
