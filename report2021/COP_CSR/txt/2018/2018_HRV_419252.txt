(continued) Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued) Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. REVENUE RECOGNITION UNDER LONG-TERM (CONSTRUCTION) CONTRACTS Revenue recognized from construction contracts recognized in profit or loss in 2017: HRK 1,262,226 thousand (85 per cent of the total revenue amount for 2017).

(continued) Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued) Key Audit Matters (continued) IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND RELATED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES As at 31 December 2017, investments in subsidiaries in the separate financial statements amounted to HRK 280,799 thousand while loans and receivables to subsidiaries amounted to HRK 34,081 thousand.

(continued) Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued) Other Matter The separate financial statements of the Company and consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2016 were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on 29 April 2017. Other Information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Management Report and Corporate Governance Statement included in the Annual Report of the Company and the Group, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. With respect to the Management Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we also performed procedures required by the Accounting Act in Croatia (“Accounting Act”). Those procedures include considering whether: • the Management Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Articles 21 and 24 of the Accounting Act, • the specific information in the Corporate Governance Statement required by Article 22, paragraph 1, items 3 and 4 of the Accounting Act (“relevant sections of the Corporate Governance Statement”) has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Article 22 of the Accounting Act; and • the Corporate Governance Statement includes the information specified in Article 22, paragraph 1, items 2, 5, 6 and 7 of the Accounting Act. Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and procedures above, in our opinion: • the information given in the Management Report and the relevant sections of the Corporate Governance Statement for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared, is consistent, in all material respects, with the financial statements; • the Management Report and the relevant sections of the Corporate Governance Statement have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of Articles 21, 22 and 24 of the Accounting Act, respectively; • the Corporate Governance Statement includes the information specified in Article 22 paragraph 1, items 2, 5, 6 and 7 of the Accounting Act. In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the entity and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are also required to report if we have identified material misstatements in the Management Report and Corporate Governance Statement. We have nothing to report in this respect. This version of the audit report is a translation from the original, which was prepared in Croatian language. All possible care has been taken to ensure that the translation is an accurate representation of the original. However, in all matters of interpretation of information, views or opinions, the original language version of the audit report takes precedence over this translation. 46 Independent Auditors’ Report to the shareholders of Dalekovod d.d. (continued) Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued) Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with EU IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s and the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s and the Group’s financial reporting process. Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s and the Group’s internal controls. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s and the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. This version of the audit report is a translation from the original, which was prepared in Croatian language. All possible care has been taken to ensure that the translation is an accurate representation of the original. However, in all matters of interpretation of information, views or opinions, the original language version of the audit report takes precedence over this translation. 47 Independent Auditors’ Report to the shareholders of Dalekovod d.d. (continued) Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued) Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued) • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements We were appointed by those charged with governance on 14 July 2017 to audit the financial statements of the Company and the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017. Our total uninterrupted period of engagement is 1 year, covering the year ended 31 December 2017. We confirm that: • our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report presented to the Audit Committee of the Company dated 26 April 2018; • we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services (NASs) referred to in Article 44 of the Audit Act. We also remained independent of the audited entity in conducting the audit. The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Igor Gošek.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 1 – GENERAL INFORMATION The Dalekovod Group (the Group) comprises the parent company Dalekovod d.d., Zagreb and 23 subsidiaries owned by the parent company (2016: 23 subsidiaries owned by the parent company and additional one company owned by subsidiaries) – note 20. Dalekovod d.d., Zagreb (the Company) was incorporated in compliance with the laws and regulations of the Republic of Croatia. The registered office of the Company is in Zagreb, Marijana Čavića 4 street. The Company’s shares are listed on the public joint stock company listing on the Zagreb Stock Exchange. The Company’s principal activity is the engineering, production, construction and installation of electric power facilities, facilities for road, railroad and mass transit and telecommunication infrastructure. Management Board members of the Company during 2017 were: Mr. Alen Premužak (President of the Management Board), Mr. Marko Jurković (Member of the Management Board; resigned on 1 April 2018), Ms. Helena Jurčić Šestan (Member of the Management Board), Mr. Ivica Kranjčić (Member of the Management Board and Mr. Ivan Kurobasa (Member of the Management Board). Going concern The Company went through the pre-bankruptcy settlement procedure, which also includes the financial and operational restructuring plan. Taking into account the Commercial court’s approval of the prebankruptcy settlement between the Company as debtor and its creditors from 29 January 2014 and the subsequent increase in share capital financial statements have been prepared under the going concern principle. NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies are applicable to both the Group and to the Company and they have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 2.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS) under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land, buildings, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and available for sale financial assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with EU IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 4. 59 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.1 Basis of preparation (continued) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been released and are effective but not mandatory for the year ended 31 December 2017 and/or are not yet adopted by the European Union and as such have not been applied in preparation of these financial statements. Overview: IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with customers and related appendices to different other standards (effective for annual periods which begin on or after January 1st, 2018) Standard offers unique Five-step Model Framework for determination and recognition of revenues from contracts with customers. New Standard replaces actual standards IAS 18 Revenue Recognition and IAS 11 Accounting for Construction Contracts. Company will use possibility of simplified initial application of IFRS 15, i.e. contracts which have not been completed till January 1st will be recognized as have been recognized in accordance with IFRS 15 from the beginning. The cumulative effect of transition will be recognized as equity value adjustment in year of initial application. According to current management estimate, the Company does not expect that transition to the new financial reporting standard will result with material impact on financial statements in terms of time and the amount of recognition revenue from customers According to the initial ongoing analysis of customer contracts, the following areas have been identified that could give rise to differences in relation to existing accounting treatment In accordance with IFRS 15, the Company should recognize revenue to present the transfer of the promised goods or services to customers in the amount which reflects the fee that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services using the 5-step model. Accordingly, revenue recognition is based on the transfer of control and revenue is recognized at a certain time or period. Based on the analysis of customer contracts, realizing current accounting policies and certain clauses of the contract in accordance with IFRS 15, currently we do not expect that the impact of IFRS 15 will result in material changes in terms of time and amount of revenue recognition under existing customer contracts. Some customer contracts include a contracted variable fee. Based on the analysis of customer contracts in accordance with IFRS 15 and understanding existing accounting policies, currently we do not expect that the impact of IFRS 15 will result in materially significant changes in terms of time and amount of revenue recognition under existing customer contracts. In accordance with IFRS 15, the cost of sales charges (customer acquisition costs) should be capitalized and recognized through the duration of the customer agreement. In accordance with IFRS 15 and understanding of existing accounting policies, we currently do not expect that the previously mentioned will result in material changes in terms of time and the amount of recognition of revenue under customer contracts. Some customer contracts have a contractual clause relating to a performance guarantee. Based on the analysis of the customer agreement and some warranty clauses, it has been established that these guarantees do not represent a separate delivery obligation. In accordance with IFRS 15 and understanding of existing accounting policies, we currently do not expect that the impact of IFRS 15 will result in material changes in terms of time and revenue recognition under existing customer contracts. 60 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.1 Basis of preparation (continued) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted (continued) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for annual periods which begin on or after January 1st, 2018) In July 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company currently plans to apply IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018. This new standard is not expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Company since the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair value. IFRS 16 Leases (effective for annual periods which begin on or after January 1st, 2019) IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance lease sheet accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard – i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of initial application of IFRS 16. So far, the most significant impact identified is that the Group will recognise new assets and liabilities for its operating leases. This new standard is not expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Company. 2.2 Consolidation (a) Subsidiaries In the separate financial statements, the Company carries investments in subsidiaries at cost less impairment. Investments are tested annually for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Investments in subsidiaries that suffered an impairment in previous periods are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group (acquisition date). They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. The date of exchange is the acquisition date where a business combination is achieved in a single transaction, and is the date of each share purchase where a business combination is achieved in stages by successive share purchases. 61 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.2 Consolidation (continued) (a) Subsidiaries (continued) Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, unless there is evidence of impairment of transferred assets. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. (b) Changes in ownership of subsidiaries without loss of control The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. (c) Disposal of subsidiaries When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate. (d) Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group or the Company have significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. The Group accounts for investments in associates using the equity method and the Company accounts for them at cost. The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates are been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 62 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.2 Consolidation (continued) (d) Mergers The predecessor method of accounting is used to account for the merger of entities under common control. The carrying value of assets and liabilities of the predecessor entity are transferred as balances in the merged entity. On the date of the merger, inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the two entities merging are eliminated. Any difference between the carrying value of net assets merged and net assets given up is recorded as equity. (e) Joint ventures The Group's interest in a jointly controlled entity is accounted for using the equity method of accounting and is initially recognised at cost. Under the equity method, the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, whereas its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. 2.3 Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Management Board of the Company. 2.4 Foreign currencies (a) Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Croatian Kuna (HRK), which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. (b) Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. (c) Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: (i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; (ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and (iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. 63 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.4 Foreign currencies On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to ‘Cumulative foreign exchange differences’ within shareholders’ equity. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold and control over the subsidiary is lost, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. 2.5 Property, plant and equipment 2.5.1 Property, plant and equipment Land, buildings and other tangible assets, except assets under foreclosure, are carried in the balance sheet at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. Land and assets under construction are not depreciated. Depreciation is calculated when asset is available and ready to use. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Useful live in years Buildings 20 – 40 Equipment 5 – 10 Machinery 25 64 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.5 Property, plant and equipment (continued) 2.5.1 Property, plant and equipment (continued) The residual value of an asset is the estimated amount that the Group would currently obtain from disposal of the asset less the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life. The residual value of an asset is nil if the Group expects to use the asset until the end of its physical life. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (note 2.8). Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. Gains and losses are included in the line item “other (losses)/gains – net” in the income statement. 2.5.2 Assets under foreclosure Assets under foreclosure are carried at fair value based on periodic, but at least triennial, valuations by external independent assessors. Increases in the carrying amount of assets under foreclosure arising on revaluation are credited to other comprehensive income and presented in equity under revaluation reserves. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged against revaluation reserves directly in equity; all other decreases are charged to the income statement. Land after initial recognition is stated at a revalued amount that makes its fair value at the date of revaluation less any accumulated impairment losses. Independent estimates of land values are made when the carrying amount is significantly different from the fair value. Any increase in the value of the land is recorded within other comprehensive income on the revaluation reserve position, unless and only to the extent to which it invalidates the value of the same asset that was previously recognized as an expense and in that case is shown as income. Any impairment is first offset by an increase that relates to an earlier valuation of the value of the same asset and subsequently recognized as an expense. The relevant part of the revaluation reserves made during the previous valuation of the value is released from the revaluation reserves directly to retained earnings after the disposal of the asset. After initial recognition at cost, buildings are recognized at a revalued value, which represents fair value on the revaluation date less any subsequent depreciation on buildings and expense impairment. Fair value is based on market value, which is the estimated value for which the asset could be sold at the date of valuation between voluntary parties under normal business and commercial conditions. When the carrying amount of an asset increases as a result of revaluation, the increase is directly approved within of other comprehensive income on the revaluation reserve position. Revaluation increases are recognized as income to the extent that it reverses the revaluation reduction of the same asset previously recognized as an expense. 65 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.5 Property, plant and equipment (continued) 2.5.2 Assets under foreclosure (continued) When the carrying amount of the asset is reduced as a result of revaluation, this decrease is recognized as expense. Revaluation reduction directly charges the revaluation reserve within other comprehensive income to the extent that this decrease does not exceed the amount that exists as a revaluation reserve for the same asset. Every year transfer from other comprehensive income (revaluation reserves) to other reserves are made in amount not higher then depreciation of revalued asset. Also, the accumulated amortization at the date of revaluation is made and excludes the carrying amount of the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is adjusted to the revalued amount of asset. At the time of withdrawal from use or alienation, all remaining revaluation reserves of such assets are transferred to retained earnings. 2.6 Investment property 2.6.1 Investment property Investment property, except assets under foreclosure, principally comprising office buildings and land, is held for long-term rental yields or appreciation. Investment property is treated as a long-term investment unless it is intended to be sold in the next year and a buyer has been identified, in which case it is classified within current assets. Investment property is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment, where required. Depreciation for buildings is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate cost over estimated useful life (20 to 40 years). Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with it will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. If an investment property becomes owner-occupied, it is reclassified to property, plant and equipment, and its carrying amount at the date of reclassification becomes its deemed cost to be subsequently depreciated. 2.6.2 Assets under foreclosure Assets under foreclosure are carried at fair value based on periodic, but at least triennial, valuations by external independent assessors. Increases in the carrying amount of assets under foreclosure arising on revaluation are credited to other comprehensive income and presented in equity under revaluation reserves. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged against revaluation reserves directly in equity; all other decreases are charged to the income statement. Land after initial recognition is stated at a revalued amount that makes its fair value at the date of revaluation less any accumulated impairment losses. 66 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.6 Investment property (continued) 2.6.2 Assets under foreclosure (continued) Independent estimates of land values are made when the carrying amount is significantly different from the fair value. Any increase in the value of the land is recorded within other comprehensive income on the revaluation reserve position, unless and only to the extent to which it invalidates the value of the same asset that was previously recognized as an expense and in that case is shown as income. Any impairment is first offset by an increase that relates to an earlier valuation of the value of the same asset and subsequently recognized as an expense. The relevant part of the revaluation reserves made during the previous valuation of the value is released from the revaluation reserves directly to retained earnings after the disposal of the asset. 2.7 Intangible assets (a) Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the carrying value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business sector at the acquisition date. Goodwill on acquisition is included in intangible assets. Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or whenever there are indications of impairment, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, identified by business segment. If a part or the whole cash generating unit is sold, the related goodwill is included in the carrying amount of net assets sold when determining gain or loss on the transaction. (b) Computer software Computer software is capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives (5 years). 2.8 Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life (such as land or goodwill) which are not subject to amortisation are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. 67 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.9 Financial assets The Group and the Company classify their financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. (a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets valued at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Assets in this category is classified as current assets. Financial assets valued at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ category are presented in the income statement within the line item ‘other (losses)/gains – net’ in the period in which they arise. (b) Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value and the transaction costs are recorded in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of monetary securities and non-monetary securities classified as available-forsale are recognised in other comprehensive income. In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement in line item ‘other (losses)/gains – net’. Interest on available-for-sale securities calculated using the effective interest rate method is recognised in the income statement. Dividends on available-for-sale securities are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established. The Group and the Company assess at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement. 68 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.9 Financial assets (continued) (c) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Trade and loan receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group and the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement within “other operating expenses”. Subsequent recoveries of the provision for impairment of trade receivables are recorded in the income statement within “other operating expenses”. 2.10 Leases (a) The Group and the Company are the lessee The Group and the Company lease certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Group or the Company has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the lease’s commencement at the lower of fair value of the leased property or the present value of minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the balance outstanding. The interest element of the finance costs is charged to the income statement over the lease period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life or the lease term. Leases in which a significant portion of risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. (b) The Group and the Company are the lessor Assets under an operating lease where the Group and the Company are the lessor are depreciated over their expected useful lives on a basis consistent with similar owned assets. Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the proceeds are not balanced, unless there is an alternative basis representing the time frame in which the benefits of the lease and the depreciation of the leased property are matched. 69 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.11 Inventories Inventories of raw materials and spare parts are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the weighted average method, or net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. The cost of work-in-process and finished goods comprise raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). Small inventory and tools are expensed when put into use. 2.12 Construction contracts Contract costs are recognised when incurred. When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the contract will be profitable, contract revenue is recognised over the period of the contract. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. The Group and the Company use the ‘percentage of completion method’ to determine the appropriate amount to recognise in a given period. The stage of completion is measured by reference to the contract costs incurred up to the balance sheet date as a percentage of total estimated costs for each contract. Costs incurred in the year in connection with future activity on a contract are excluded from contract costs in determining the stage of completion. Costs are presented as inventories, prepayments or other assets, depending on their nature. The Group and the Company present as an asset the gross amount due from customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses) exceed progress billings. Progress billings not yet paid by customers and retention are included within ‘trade and other receivables’. The Group presents as a liability the gross amount due to customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses). 2.13 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. 70 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.14 Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Where the Company purchases its equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. 2.15 Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset form part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group or the Company have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 2.16 Income tax The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. The tax base represents the difference between income and expenses, as determined by the applicable law. Management of the Group periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and consider establishing provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. 71 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.17 Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 2.18 Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 2.19 Employee benefits (a) Pension obligations and post-employment benefits In the normal course of business through salary deductions, the Group and the Company make payments to mandatory pension funds on behalf of its employees as required by law. All contributions made to the mandatory pension funds are recorded as salary expense when incurred. Furthermore, according to the Collective bargaining agreement, the Group and the Company have an obligation to make severance payments to employees at the time of the employees’ retirement. The liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less past service costs with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of governmental bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related retirement severance payment. 72 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.19 Employee benefits (continued) (b) Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to their present value. (c) Other long-term employee benefits The Group recognises a liability for long-term employee benefits (jubilee awards) evenly over the period the benefit is earned based on actual years of service. The long-term employee benefit liability is determined using assumptions regarding the likely number of staff to whom the benefit will be payable, estimated benefit cost and the discount rate. 2.20 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense. 2.21 Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s and the Company’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, estimated returns, rebates and discounts. The Group and the Company recognise revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s and the Company’s activities as described below. (a) Revenue from construction contracts When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the contract will be profitable, contract revenue is recognised over the period of the contract (note 2.12). 73 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.21 Revenue recognition (continued) (b) Sales of goods Sales of goods are recognised when the Group and the Company have delivered products to the customer, the customer has accepted the products and collectability of the related receivables is reasonably assured. (c) Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group and the Company reduce the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans is recognised using the original effective interest rate. (d) Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. 2.22 Dividend distributions Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the General Assembly of the Company’s shareholders. 2.23 Earnings per share Earnings per share is determined by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of participating shares outstanding during the reporting year. 2.24 Value added tax The Tax Authorities require the settlement of VAT on a net basis. VAT related to sales and purchases is recognised and disclosed in the balance sheet on a net basis. Where a provision has been made for impairment of receivables, impairment loss is recorded for the gross amount of the debtor, including VAT. 74 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2.25 Mezzanine debt Mezzanine debt is initially recognized as financial liability recognized at fair value (host contract). Within the host contract, according to IAS 39 the Company has identified embedded derivatives options, for (a) option for holder of the mezzanine instrument to require issuance of additional senior debt for no additional proceeds should the Company achieve certain pre-defined debt-to-EBITDA (D/E) ratios in 7th year and (b) option for early repayment of the mezzanine debt after 7th year for a maximum amount up to HRK 35,5million. Option (b) is treated as derivative at fair value and is offset with total mezzanine debt, according to IAS 32.42, which defines net representation of financial liabilities taking into account that Company intends to settle net amount of the commitment. Management’s estimates in assessing the mezzanine debt were as follow: i. Part of mezzanine debt for which there is an obligation to pay proceeds from the sale of the investment in the creditor agreement (to a maximum of HRK 62 million) will be paid in full amount, i.e. estimated proceeds from sale of investment is in line with the maximum amount of HRK 62 million and higher. ii. pre-defined debt-to-EBITDA ratio (2.5) in 7th year will not be achieved. The management estimates that EBITDA will not be on the level which would result that D/E ratio is below the 2.5. iii. the management plans to use early repayment option after 7th year and the Company will repay remaining outstanding mezzanine debt amounting HRK 176.4 million (note 32) with a maximum amount of HRK 35.5 million. Part of mezzanine debt for which there is an obligation to pay proceeds from the sale of the investment identified in the creditor agreement (to a maximum of HRK 62 million) is accounted for as a financial liability initially recognised at fair value and classified as other financial liabilities and subsequently would be measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, taking into consideration changes in future expected future cash flows in accordance with IAS 39. 2.26 Assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be largely compensated through sale rather than through its continuing use; if these assets are available for immediate sale in their existing state under conditions frequent and common for sale of such assets, and if the sale is probable. Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of net book value and fair value less cost to sell. Loss on impairment from reduction to fair value less cost to sell, is charged to profit or loss. Investments in associates and joint ventures that meet the criteria for classification as assets held for sale at a certain time ceased to be measured using the equity method and are measured at lower of carrying value based on equity method and fair value less cost to sell. 75 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 3 – FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 3.1 Financial risk factors The Company’s and the Group’s activities expose them to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk), price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group and the Company do not have a written risk management programme, but overall risk management in respect of these risks is carried out by the Company’s finance department. (a) Market risk (i) Currency risk The majority of foreign sales revenue is denominated in EUROs. Domestic sales revenue is denominated in HRK. The majority of long-term and short-term loans were agreed with a currency clause, i.e. they are linked to the EURO. Along EUR, the Company is exposed to the movement in exchange rates between NOK, UAH and Croatian Kuna. Although any movement in exchange rates between the EURO against the Croatian Kuna will have an impact on the Group’s and the Company’s operating results, the Company does not use financial instruments to protect against currency risk. At 31 December 2017, if the EURO had weakened/strengthened by 1.00% against the HRK (2016: 1.00%), with all other variables held constant, the net profit for the reporting period after tax would have been HRK 278 thousand (2016: HRK 1,758 thousand) lower/(higher), mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/(losses) on translation of EURO-denominated trade receivables, trade payables, borrowings and foreign cash funds. According to the Management Board estimation, the impact of changes in other currencies does not have significant effect on the financial statements of the Group and the Company. (ii) Price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities fair value and price risk because of investments held by the Group classified on the consolidated balance sheet either as available for sale or at fair value through profit or loss. Equity investments classified as available for sale are not listed, while those classified as fair value through profit or loss are publicly traded but do not have a significant effect on the financial position. To manage its fair value and price risk arising from investments in equity securities, the Group monitors market transactions and performance of investment entities. 76 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 3 – FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) 3.1 Financial risk factors (continued) (iii) Cash flow interest rate risk The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, therefore the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s and the Company’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings and commercial papers. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group and the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group and the Company analyse their interest rate changes on a regular basis. Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions and alternative financing. Based on these scenarios, the Group and the Company calculate the impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift. As at 31 December 2017, if the effective interest rate on borrowings had increased/decreased by 0.82% on an annual level (2016: 0.82%), the loss after tax would have been higher/lower by HRK 92 thousand (2016: HRK 103 thousand) as a result of a higher/lower interest expense. (b) Credit risk The Group’s and the Company’s assets which potentially subject them to concentrations of credit risk primarily include cash, trade and other receivables. The Group and the Company has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, within previously defined credit limits. A favourable structure of buyers (major buyers are mainly state-owned companies) and the fact that, if necessary, collection from buyers is regulated by bank payment guarantees, bills of exchange, letters of credit and other types of security, almost completely diminishes the risk arising from the collection of trade receivables. A detailed analysis and maximum exposure to credit risk are shown in note 31. Further, judgements and estimates in respect of credit risk exposure and related impairment provisions are described in more detail in note 4(b). (c) Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to meet all obligations. The Group aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available. With the legal validity of the pre-bankruptcy settlement on 14 February 2014 conditions for enforcement of financial restructuring were met which had significant affect over the Company’s debt and their maturity. Part of trade payables is converted into share capital (note 30), part is converted into mezzanine debt (note 5) and part is reclassified into long-term liabilities in accordance with the adopted plan. Borrowings are also partly converted into mezzanine debt, and partly reprogrammed. The maturity of borrowings is presented in note 31. 77 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 3 – FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) 3.2 Capital risk management The Company's and Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company and the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The Company and the Group monitor capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including long-term and short-term borrowings, as shown in the balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits given. Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the balance sheet, plus net debt. The Company's gearing ratio was as follows: 31 December 31 December (in thousands of HRK) 2017 2016 Borrowings (note 31) 461,531 491,725 Cash and cash equivalents (note 28) (89,349) (86,849) Net debt 372,182 404,876 Equity 294,572 271,184 Total equity and net debt 666,754 676,060 Gearing ratio Company 55.8% 59.9% The Group's gearing ratio was as follows: 31 December 31 December (in thousands of HRK) 2017 2016 Borrowings (note 31) 476,451 520,097 Cash and cash equivalents (note 28) (107,378) (105,428) Net debt 369,073 414,669 Equity 236,301 223,579 Total equity and net debt 605,374 638,248 Gearing ratio Group 61.0% 65.0% 78 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 3 – FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) 3.3 Fair value estimation Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value. IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1). Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2). Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). The table below present the Group’s assets at fair value as at 31 December 2017 and 2016: (in thousands of HRK) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Group 31 December 2017 Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings 156,950 156,950 Available for sale financial assets Listed entities 274 5 279 Unlisted entities 1,320 1,320 Financial asstes at fair value through profit and loss Investments in cash funds 497 497 Total 771 1,320 156,955 159,046 31 December 2016 Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings 171,522 171,522 Available for sale financial assets Listed entities 509 5 514 Unlisted entities 4,054 4,054 Financial asstes at fair value through profit and loss Investments in cash funds 30,485 30,485 Total 30,994 4,054 171,527 206,575 There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during 2017 and 2016. 79 DALEKOVOD d.d.

A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. 81 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 3 – FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) 3.3 Fair value estimation (continued) The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-thecounter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. NOTE 4 – CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below. (a) Revenue recognition The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its revenue from construction contracts to determine the appropriate amount to recognise in a given period. The stage of completion is measured by reference to the contract costs incurred up to the balance sheet date as a percentage of total estimated costs for each contract (note 7). (b) Impairment of loans and receivables The Group and the Company review the portfolio of loans and receivables on an annual basis to assess impairment. While assessing the recognition of impairment in the statement of comprehensive income, the Group and the Company assess whether there is observable data indicating the existence of a measurable decrease in future cash flows of the portfolio of loans and receivables before establishing the impairment of certain loans and receivables in the stated portfolio (note 11). (c) Useful life of property, plant and equipment The Company’s and the Group companies’ managements determine and reassess the useful lives and related depreciation charge for tangible assets. This assessment is based on the estimated remaining useful life of assets and could significantly change as a result of technical innovation and activities of competitors. Management will increase the depreciation charge if it assesses that the useful life of assets is lower than prior to estimates, or it will write off obsolete and discarded property (note 2.5). (d) Legal claims and disputes Provisions for legal claims and disputes are recorded based on Management's best estimate of probable losses after consultation with legal counsel (note 34). (e) Sale of assets held for sale Sale of asset held for sale, which is one of the measures of the pre-bankruptcy settlement, is expected within a defined time period (note 2.26). Mezzanine debt Estimates related to the recognition of mezzanine debt are described in the summary of significant accounting policies for the recognition and measurement of mezzanine debt (note 2.25). 82 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 5 – PRE-BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT The pre-bankruptcy settlement procedure (“the Settlement”), which the Company initiated on 20th December 2012, was formally completed at 14 February 2014 by issuance of the final legally valid decision. As a part of pre-bankruptcy settlement the Company prepared financial and operating restructuring plan which was the basis for negotiations with creditors and which was accepted by creditors on 2 April 2013 by more than 90% votes indicating the commitment of the Company’s creditors; suppliers, banks, tax authorities and other stakeholders to support completion of administrative proceedings. The restructuring plan prepared by the Company, and adopted by the creditors, incorporate financial and operational measures with the objective of deleveraging the Company and thus improving profitability and EBITDA to achieve a long term sustainable business case. Financial restructuring is focused on ensuring liquidity, through disposal of non-core assets and debt restructuring and reduction, with the objective of creating conditions for recapitalisation and achieving financial stability. Following the date on which the Settlement became legally effective the Company implemented the following measures with the accompanying effect on the financial position and financial performance of the entity for the year ended 31 December 2014: • As of 28 March 2014, the share capital was decreased from HRK 286,726 thousand by HRK 258,054 thousand to HRK 28,672 thousand to cover the losses by reducing the nominal value of share from HRK 100 to HRK 10. Simultaneously, the share capital was increased from HRK 28,672 thousand by HRK 158,522 thousand to HRK 187,194 thousand by cash payment of HRK 150,000 thousand and a contribution in rights/conversion of debt of HRK 8,522 thousand by issuing 15,852,168 new shares. Phase I of the cash injection into the share capital was available to a Croatian equity fund. • As of 21 August 2014, the share capital was increased from HRK 187,194 thousand by cash payment of HRK 59,999 thousand to HRK 247,193 thousand by issuing 5,999,872 new shares. Phase II of the cash contribution was available to existing shareholders and limited to the HRK 60,000 thousand. • Conversion of the debt in the amount of HRK 238,421 thousand in mezzanine debt. Mezzanine is a subordinated low-interest hybrid instrument with equity and debt conversion right subject to EBITDA and net debt targets. Mezzanine lenders are not shareholders of the Company these are banks who are not related to the Company in the amount of HRK 207,026 thousand and entities who are related parties of the Company in the amount of HRK 31,395 thousand. Mezzanine debt is financial liability initially recognized at fair value (host contract) within which the Company identified embedded derivative, which is treated as derivative at fair value and is offset with total mezzanine debt, according to IAS 32.42, which defines net representation of financial liabilities taking into account that Company intends to settle net amount of the commitment. 83 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 5 – PREBANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT (continued) Estimates applied in recognition and measurement of mezzanine debt are disclosed under section Summary of significant accounting policy (note 2.25). Embedded derivative is separated from host contract and recognized at fair value. Fair value gain on initial measurement of embedded derivative in the amount of HRK 151,908 thousand was recognised as finance income in statement of comprehensive income. • Transfer of trade payables and liabilities towards tax authorities to long term payables – since the terms of these debts are substantially modified in accordance with the Settlement, the renegotiation of the liabilities in the amount of HRK 176,448 thousand is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original liabilities. The new modified financial liabilities recognised at fair value amounted to HRK 158,176 thousand. The difference, between the consideration paid and the carrying amount of the original liabilities which are derecognised, is recognised in finance income within profit or loss in the amount of HRK 18,272 thousand. These financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with the unwinding of the discount on the long-term payables in the amount of HRK 1,583 thousand (2016: HRK 3,498 thousand) accounted for as an interest expense in profit and loss in 2017. Renegotiated maturity date of these long term payables is 31 March 2018. Liabilities have been settled till the date of publishing of these financial statement. • New repayment plan, substantially different from the original, have been agreed with lessor for the finance lease arrangement. Fair value gain on initial recognition on new financial liability in the amount of HRK 15,269 thousand was realised and recognised as finance income in profit or loss. Expected repayment date for this portion of mezzanine principle 31 December 2022 which is the period for the unwinding of the discount realised at initial recognition. • Repayment terms of loans received, other than those transferred to mezzanine, did not change significantly so no fair value gains or losses have been recognised. The liabilities have been reclassified to reflect the loans repayment plans. All liabilities from the pre-bankruptcy settlement to financial institutions are regularly settled and the payment of the first instalment to suppliers was made in accordance with the Settlement. • Also, in compliance with the Settlement, the liabilities for interest and fees were written off and the Company realised income on release of liabilities for interest and fees in the amount of HRK 19,188 thousand. Income on release of liabilities from interest and fees have been recognised as finance income in the profit or loss. • Furthermore, three creditors (banks) decided to settle their receivables outside the pre-bankruptcy settlement through future proceeds from the sale of assets under foreclosure (pledged as security for payment), as explained in note 31 of the financial statements. • Additionally, the Company’s debt on the basis of joint debt, joint and several liability or warranty was relived in full. 84 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 6 – CORRECTION OF ACCOUNTING ERRORS During 2017, Management Board of subsidiary Dalekovod Proizvodnja d.o.o. identified an error in the accounting of production process, where the inadequate turnover rate was used in variance allocation to inventories held at stock. Furthermore, during the analysis of inventories held at stock, Management identified obsolete inventories as a result of changes in technology and technological processes and changes in customer requirements. Since these errors are result of omissions made in previous years, they were corrected in accordance with requirements of IAS 8 and they resulted in corrections of previously published balances.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as stated in note 2.7. The recoverable amount of cash generating units is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by the management covering a five-year period. The terminal growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the five-year period is 3.00%, and the present value of future cash flows is calculated using a discount rate of 7.24%. The growth rate assumption was based on the historical data and the management’s expectations for market development. The discount rate used is based on the Group's weighted average cost of capital. During 2013 goodwill impairment loss in the amount of HRK 3,346 thousand have been recognised in the income statement.

Furthermore, the Company also owes a debt to one of the banks based on unpaid guarantees in the amount of HRK 6,309 thousand as at 31 December 2017 (Note 33). 121 DALEKOVOD d.d. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 31 – BORROWINGS (continued) The enforcement procedures were initiated by enforcing the separate satisfaction right by banks that chose to have their claims against the Company secured by first-rank pledges over assets satisfied through enforcement procedures, rather than the settlement accepted. The Company believes that no additional losses (cash outflows) may be incurred as a result of the separate satisfaction liabilities because the applicable Financial Operations and Pre-bankruptcy Settlement Act allows for claims of creditors with separate satisfaction rights to be satisfied only from the pre-bankruptcy debtor’s assets over which the creditor held a separate satisfaction right at the time the pre-bankruptcy settlement was initiated. The Company and the Group as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, according to the accounting policy for assets under foreclosure, have fair valued the corresponding loan obligation and other liabilities (guarantees) which relate to assets under foreclosure (notes 5, 18 and 19). The Group's borrowings totalling HRK 22,577 thousand (2016: HRK 33,840 thousand) are exposed to interest rate changes, since the contracted interest rate is variable. Other borrowings in the amount of HRK 398,435 thousand (2016: HRK 406,754 thousand), except for borrowings which will be discharged by selling assets under foreclosure, have fixed interest rates and relate to loans, bonds and finance lease liability. According to pre-bankruptcy settlement, interest rate on senior debt, bonds and finance lease is fixed at 4% while on other lease financing interest rate is variable and ranges from 4.0% to 6.7% . The borrowings are denominated in the following currencies: The maturity of long-term borrowings is as follows: 122 DALEKOVOD d.d.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 NOTE 34 – PROVISIONS (continued) Provisions for jubilee awards and severance payments These provisions relate to estimated long-term employee benefits for jubilee awards and severance payments at the time of retirement according to the Collective bargaining agreement. The liability is calculated by independent actuaries. Significant assumptions used by the actuary are as follows: an annual leaver's rate of 5.36% for the Group, and 3.0% for the Company (2016: Group 4.59%, Company 2.00%); the age of retirement is determined for each individual employee taking into account their present age and the overall realised years of service (the average age of retirement used in the calculation is 61 years for men and 62 years for women). Other provisions Other provisions relate to provisions for court cases and bonuses to employees. NOTE 35 – SHARE BASED PAYMENTS Employee share options Options for the purchase of Dalekovod d.d. shares were granted to key management of the Group. The exercise price of the granted option equals the weighted average share price of Dalekovod d.d. shares as per the Zagreb Stock Exchange in the year the option is granted. The vesting period normally starts at the date of option contract signed. Options are acquired separately for each business year. All the terms and conditions apply, unless circumstances arise as provided in each of the contracts applicable to the periods that implies an early termination of a mandate, breach of contractual provisions, relocation within the company, etc., in which case such an option generally becomes exercisable within six months from the occurrence of any of the circumstances described above. The following share-based payment arrangements were effective in the current and comparative reporting periods: Fair value measurement The fair value of the employee share options and the share appreciation rights is measured using the Black-Scholes formula. Measurement inputs include the share price on the measurement date, the exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on an evaluation of the historical volatility of the Company’s share price, particularly over the historical period commensurate with the expected term), expected term of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option holder behavior), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value. 127 DALEKOVOD d.d.
