H.E. António Guterres Secretary-General United Nations NEW YORK NY 10017 USA 1 October 2018 Dear Secretary-General, Orora Limited United Nations Global Compact Communications on Progress 2018 Orora’s approach to sustainability is founded on the Orora Way and its values of Teamwork, Passion, Respect and Integrity. Based on these values, sustainability is managed through three focus areas – People, Planet and Prosperity – by delivering shared benefits for our communities, our environment and our customers, as well as our operations. Guided by the Orora Values, Orora reaffirms its commitment to the ten UNGC principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The highlights of the second Orora Communications on Process (COP) include: A re-examination of the broader sustainability landscape to identify emerging sustainability risks and opportunities for Orora; The introduction of Orora’s Supplier Assurance Framework (SAF) program to identify and mitigate potential human rights and environmental issues within its supplier base across both its Australasian and North American businesses; The signing of two Power Purchase Agreements for renewable wind power, that will supply over 80% of Orora’s electricity needs in Australia; A$23million investment in a secondary waste water treatment plant and bio-gas generator creating renewable electricity, equating to approximately 5% of annual demand, for Orora’s paper mill producing 100% recycled paper in Sydney, Australia. This year Orora is presenting its COP as an index demonstrating actions and outcomes as communicated in Orora’s 2018 Annual Report, Orora’s Corporate Governance Statement, and other relevant documents. Orora will continue to advocate for the principles of the UNGC in all of its business, policy and community interactions.
