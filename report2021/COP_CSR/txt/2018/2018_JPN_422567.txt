The ceremony was held at the Prime Minister's official residence on 26 December 2017, hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The award was in recognition of SARAYA’s contribution to the improvement of hygiene in Uganda, activities promoting biodiversity in Sabah, Malaysia, and encouraging the use of sustainable palm oil. About Japan SDGs Awards The Government of Japan established a cabinet body, the SDGs Promotion Headquarters, headed by the Prime Minister and composed of all ministers on 20 May 2016, in order to ensure a whole-of-government approach to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in a comprehensive and effective manner. The Japan SDGs Awards incentivize and promote good practice.

Saraya invented and supplied hand disinfectant liquid soap and its dispenser, and promoted hand hygiene at many workplaces, schools and public facilities in post WW II Japan when sanitation systems were still poor and hygiene practices were insufficient – the same issues that many developing countries such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are still facing today. In Target 3.1 through to Target 3.3 of SDG 3, it is believed that hand hygiene is the single most important means of preventing infection and a fundamental element of good infection control. SDG Saraya has vast knowledge, experience and resources with respect to infection prevention and control, and has been utilizing them to promote hand hygiene through business activity and corporate social responsibility in the 6 East African region as well as in the South Asian region. This applies especially to Uganda and Cambodia where its work started. This report covers eleven goals of SDGs to explain Saraya’s sustainable product development, activities for preserving biodiversity, and the business contribution to improving and controlling global sanitation and hygiene for all stakeholders. SDG This also contains Saraya’s legacy together with the latest information and statistics (as of JUNE 2018) in order to provide a clear insight into how Saraya proceeds towards sustainability. 8 Any questions and queries are welcome and you can contact us by email at <sustainability@saraya.com>.

Jared Diamond wrote in his book “Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed” that any civilization can easily collapse especially as a result of environmental deterioration. This book tells us that we need to take seriously that even our global society could collapse by the deterioration of the environment. I visited the cave in Lascaux and saw the paintings by Cro-Magnons. It is easy to see that they had skills and intelligence over 20,000 years ago. Homo sapiens initiated the agricultural revolution 5,000 years ago. The industrial revolution began 300 years ago. In such a short space of time, we are now already facing the collapse of our civilization. All society and business has to reform in a sustainable way. It is very appropriate that the United Nations set the “SDGsSustainable Development Goals” in 2015. These goals should be acheived by all members of global society. The cave painting of Lascaux (1) SDGs in SARAYA It was very gratifying for SARAYA to win the first SDGs Japan Award in Dec. 2017 promoted by the Japanese Government. It was presented by Mr. Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, and Mr. Taro Kono, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan. The award is given in recognition of our active contributions to the Borneo Conservation Trust in Malaysia, and our activities supporting healthcare improvements in Uganda and Kenya. We are now classifying our projects to correspond to the SDGs which are highly relevant to our business activities. We believe that our projects should have a grass roots connection to local inhabitants and promote local development. Although they are small steps, our aim is to take concrete and constant steps such as these towards the SDGs. The challenges are described in the following pages. 2) Healthcare and Food Sanitation Development in Uganda and Kenya We started the project “Wash a Million Hands!” in Uganda in 2010. Since then we have expanded the activities from public health to the hospitals. We started the local production of alcoholic hand rub in 2014. We have been collaborating with NGOs. The Japanese Organization for International Cooperation in Family Planning (JOICFP) has been intensively promoting the importance of hand disinfection at the time of birth in village maternity centers to decrease the infection of mother & child at the time of birth. We have supported the JOICEP since 2011. (cf. p.8) Alsoft V was used for infection In Kenya, in addition to the healthcare business, we will be starting a pilot study becontrol of the Marburg virus at Kapchorwa Hospital in Uganda tween 2018-2019 in Mombasa Port to make high quality fish fillets by using a Rapid in 2017.

We have also started the production of pellets from the empty oil palm fruit bunch. (cf. p.16-17, 24-25) Empty oil palm fruit bunch after oil extraction, and the fuel pellet (4) Rapid Freezer in Cambodia We have developed a machine called “RAPID FREEZER” (pictured right) to make high quality frozen products. Between 2017 to 2018, we conducted a pilot study in Cambodia to make frozen tilapia fillets and frozen tropical fruits to sell to the local supermarkets and restaurants, with the aim of creating more value for farmers and fishermen from locally produced products. The project was successfully Freezing mangos rapidly to preserve the natural juices and flavors in a Rapid Freezer completed, and we are now looking to scale up the operation as a business with collaborating partners. (5) Desert Jojoba Oil Plantation in Egypt A joint venture company “Simmond” was established in 2016 between Professor Fukui, members of Osaka University, and SARAYA. The purpose is to turn the Egyptian desert green by planting jojoba trees. Jojoba trees bear fruit which produce jojoba oil, which is very suitable for cosmetic products. We are now developing Jojoba plantation Jojoba nursery trees cosmetic product lines using the jojoba oil produced from the plantation in Egypt, and selling them on the market. (6) Herbal essence extraction in Tunisia At the beginning of 2018, we set up a herbal and floral essential oil processing factory in the middle of farmland at Cap Bon Peninsula in Tunisia. We worked toSaraya Baute et Sante and Neroli gether with local farmers to grow neroli, roses and geraniums. We have already had our very first harvest of 50 kg of essential oils. We are determined to establish the technologies and make it ready for local application to increase the income of the local people, as well as to create a new supply chain for SARAYA. Although they are small steps, we are now conducting many projects around the Harvested Neroli flowers world with the hope of making supply chains more transparent, from the sources all the way to the consumers, as well as to share the values of sustainable develPresident Saraya Co., Ltd. opment among the people in the supply chains. I also hope our relentless efforts Yusuke Shiro Saraya and trials will not only be successful for the participants, but also create a new wind of change to establish a better and more sustainable world for everyone to live in. 3 Good Health and Well-Being Sanitation Legacy 1952 in Japan People in Japan were often suffering from outbreaks of ʼ52 dysentery and food poisoning in 1951 after WWII. There 111,709 Push type dispensers (1952) 120,000 were over 111,000 patients at the peak of the dysentery ‘53 108,009 epidemic in 1952. Back then, solid soaps (bar soaps) were 100,000 widely available in the market, but liquid soaps were not 80,000 yet sold in Japan. 60,000 In April 1952, Saraya introduced liquid soap with a disinfectant effect along with a dispenser.

In November the same year, the new regulations from the Japanese Health Ministry for compulsory hand washing and disinfection at food processing facilities came into force. Saraya has been developing ever since as one of the leading companies in the field of public and food hygiene. Introduced Alcohol-Based Hand Disinfectant The “Hand Saniter” was the very first alcohol-based product Saraya introduced to the world. Saraya has been Iga Factory (pharmaceutical factory) established in 1998 researching and developing alcohol-based hand disinfectants (ABHD) ever since. In 1976, MRSA (Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus) had not been isolated in Japanese healthcare facilities, but by 1987, MRSA was isolated from over 58% of patients. In 1996, prevention and control measures for nosocomial MRSA infection, such as the application of alcohol-based hand disinfectants, finally received medical funding from the governBest Sanitizers, Inc. established in 1995 ment. The number of MRSA patients in Japan reached 118,539 by 2013. Meanwhile, “Hibischol” (ABHD), which was first introduced in 1986 at the time of the MRSA outbreak in Japan, has become one of our leading products Kentucky Factory established in 2006 as a prevention and infection control measure. In 1995, Saraya acquired Best Sanitizers, Inc. A joint venture company was set up, and Saraya’s “Alsoft V” was then introduced to the American market through Best Sanitizers. We launched our new product line called “Viro Stera” in 2010 which has proven effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including non-enveloped virus such as Norovirus as well as ordinary fungi. It is now being produced and sold by Saraya Manufacturing (U) Ltd. in Hand disinfectants Viro Stera and Uganda as Alsoft A.

According to UNICEF, the rate is defined as “the Kenya Rwanda probability of dying between birth and exactly five years Burundi Tanzania of age, expressed per 1,000 live births”. The number of Africa infant deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa is 1.91 million, which is nearly 45% of the overall world infant mortality rate. According to the UNICEF report, it is estimated that 0.26 million infants died in East Africa including Uganda. Among them, a large number of deaths were caused by pneumonia or acute diarrhea, which can be prevented by Estimates of child mortality in Africa 2016 basic hand hygiene practices such as hand washing.

The donations through this project have also been used for installing water tanks at schools in Uganda and promoting hand hygiene practice through UNICEF activities. The number of mothers Saraya reached to promote the importance of hand hygiene in Uganda topped 1.2 million, and the rate of handwashing after going to the toilet has been steadily improving from 14% in 2007, 33.2% in 2015, to 36% in 2016. 354 water tanks (60L) with a tap have been installed at schools where there was no access to water. So far, pupils in 177 schools in the Gulu, Kitgum, Pader and Abim districts can now wash their hands with clean water. “Wash a Million Hands Project-Uganda” Promotion Products 5 100% Hospital Hand Hygiene Project Saraya East Africa Co., Ltd. Saraya chose Uganda as an African hub for promoting and improving basic sanitation in developing countries, then set up a subsidiary company, Saraya East Africa Co., Ltd. in Kampala. In 2011, Saraya’s hand hygiene project proposal in the healthcare sector was selected as the BOP business preparation survey for infection control and prevention using a new alcohol-based disinfectant in collaboration with JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency). Saraya’s Saraya Manufacturing Co., Ltd. alcohol-based hand disinfectant Hibiscohl S was installed at Gombe Hospital and Entebbe Hospital as a case-study of the pilot project from May 2012 to April 2013. At Gombe Hospital, a hand hygiene compliance project was initiated under the supervision of Dr. Lule Haruna. At the beginning of the project, the compliance rate was barely improved and it took some time to reach 70%. However, since reaching this level, significant results were recorded. After hitting the 70% compliance rate, zero case months of acute diarrhea and post C-S sepsis were recorded, as shown in the “Comparison of HH comA nurse in Gombe Hospital pliance and case occurrence” chart.

While participating in the pilot project, Saraya set up a subsidiary company “Saraya Cambodia Co., Ltd.” in Phnom Penh in 2013. The company seeks a way to break into the Cambodian market by introducing locally manufactured products because importing infection prevention lines made-in-Japan is hardly competitive. It has been reported that the hand washing compliance rates in hospitals are still relatively low in ASEAN countries including Cambodia, which is the principle measure for infection prevention and control at hospitals. Saraya hosted the first IC-IPC2014 (International ConThe National Maternal and Child Health Center in Cambodia ference on Infection Prevention and Control at the Healthcare Facilities in the ASEAN Community) in 2014 to promote hand hygiene at hospitals, and made a presentation of the results of the pilot project at the National Maternal and Child Health Center and the National Children’s Hospital. It was held by the Health Ministry of the Royal Government of Cambodia at the International Hotel in Phnom Penh on 19 August 2014, with a joint collaboration between the JICA Cambodia office and Saraya.

There should have been more CSPO oils produced, but the relatively small size of palm kernel oil crushing mills, called “PK crushers”, means that they often do not have RSPO certificates. The same applies to certified palm kernel seeds whose crushers do not have certificates from RSPO and therefore produce uncertified oil. The shortage of CSPK pushes up the value of Book & Claim credits from 70 to 100 USD/t. An independent smallholder in Gomanton village installs beehives at an entrance to deter elephants. Cooperation with Wild Asia Wild Asia is a social enterprise, which was established in 2003 with its headquarters in Malaysia. They have been promoting tropical rainforest conservation and supporting smallholders to obtain RSPO certification within the Wild Asia Group Scheme (WAGS). Younger generation oil palm smallholders in Sabah are acting positively to obtain RSPO. In fact, they put into practice the WAGS to reduce pesticide or fertilizer use and increase yields. Nevertheless, the older generation of smallholders tends to cling to conservative and traditional methods and they The Kemajuan Tanah Julur Collection Center opened in 2017.

In 2017, Saraya purchased palm kernel oil book & claim credits, which are worth 700t, through Wild Asia. These are the credits which smallholders gained from CSPO seeds and which were the equivalent of the oil palms they sold to mill farmers. These smallholders were introduced to the buyers and thus guaranteed its tractability. What’s more, this scheme also helps support these inOne of the WAGS’s projects: the Award System.

The laboratory was carrying out field research to investigate the pollution level of the Inagawa river on behalf of the local government from Hyogo Prefecture. Mr. Saraya was himself contributing by researching BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) as a pollution index of aquatic life populations. His graduate thesis was research on wastewater treatment using algae and turning those algae into biomass. He then graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, having studied Sanitary Engineering in 1975. He joined Saraya in 1976 and the following year, he became the factory manager at the Saraya factory where he runs a private laboratory. In 1969, Saraya introduced to the world the Yashinomi detergent, which is very kind to the skin and high in TV commercial of Yashinomi Detergent in 1980 biodegradability. It was the first of its kind in Japan with a plant based fatty acid. It does not contain phosphoric acid which is one of the main causes of water pollution, and does not form sewage sludge as caused by soap wastewater. Since then, Yashinomi detergent has been an iconic and best-selling product for generations in Saraya’s long history. In 2010, we developed a bio-surfactant called “SOFORO” for laundry detergent for the first time, and it has been added to various Saraya products, including the “Lactoferrin Lab.” cosmetic brand.

He was genuine and honest and admitted that he had no idea how selling his company’s products in Japan was affecting these innocent animals in Borneo. Since then, he took a swift turn and set his company vision as truly friendly to both people and the environment. As a start, he launched biodiversity conservation activities in Sabah, Malaysia. A baby elephant with its leg tied with a rope which was set as a trap Right after the interview, Saraya immediately sought out by local hunters. If baby elephants escape from the traps but still have Mr. Nobuo Nakanishi who is now a member of Saraya and a rope tangled around a leg, this gets trapped under the skin as the elephant grows and ultimately causes the elephant’s death as it can a director of the Borneo Conservation Trust Japan. Then no longer walk. These elephants are called “Tally” (rope) by the locals.

In Sabah Mr. Nakanishi joined an elephant rescue mission organized by SWD (Sabah Wildlife Department) in autumn 2004. In the following January, Mr. Saraya made a public report on the rescue mission and the possibility of the extinction of the elephants at the RSPO Seminar in Kuala Lumpur. This report was also broadcast in the TV series as part 2 of “Tears From right, Sabah State Secretary Palm Oil Symposium 2007 and Mr. Saraya.

Mr. Saraya proposed the “Green corridor project” but initially faced a rejection from growers and couldn’t gain their approval. In February 2006, Mr. Saraya again proposed the “Green corridor project” at BBEC (Borneo Biodiversity and Ecosystems Conservation) and this time the same project received full approval at the conference. The success led to an aerial photo shooting from a helicopter including the Sabah State Secretary as a guest.

Borneo Conservation Trust Press conference at the launch of the Borneo Conservation Trust, 12 September 2006 In September 2006, Mr. Saraya established the Borneo Kinabatangan Green Corridor Project Lot2 Conservation Trust, together with Mr. Patrick Mahedi AnForest Reserves(FR) and Wildlife Sanctuary Target area for Green corridor Lot1 Plantation dau of SWD (Sabah Wildlife Department) and Dr ToshiSg.Lokan FR Lot8 ● Lot4 Keruak FR nori Tsubouchi, COO of then BBEC (Borneo Biodiversity Materis FR Gomantong FR Pangi FR Lot10a Lot5 ● Lot7 and Ecosystems Conservation). Mr. Saraya was a trustee Lot10b Lot9 Lot3 Deramakot when the trust was launched, and then became Deputy FR Pin-Supu FR Lot6 Chairman in 2013. The trust was approved by the government as an NGO in October 2006. The headquarters was set up in the SWD (Sabah Wildlife Department) office in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. BCT’s mission, other than the Green Corridors, includes wildlife conservation, such as rescuing injured elephants and isolated orangutans as well as promoting biodiversity conservation activities. Saraya has been donating 1% of Yashinomi detergents and Happy Elephant products’ sales to BCT since May 2007. BCT has acquired 80ha of forest under the Green Corridor project (of which Saraya’s forests are approximately SDG 12ha), which is merely 0.4% of its goal of 20k ha. One of the possible reasons for the slow growth is that the land 15 price has risen incredibly and much less land is becoming available for sale. One of the reasons for this development is that at Sandakan, a transport hub in Sabah, the security situation has deteriorated and is having a negative impact on tourism in the lower Kinabatangan River This Rescue Center was set up within the Borneo Elephant Sanctuary in LOT8 conservation area in 2013. Further construction work such as area, and that leads people to shift to the cultivation of roofing and installing a sandpit was done in 2017. Saraya supported oil palms. this construction work.
