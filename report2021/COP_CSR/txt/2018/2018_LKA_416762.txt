Other Income Accounting Policy Revenue from dividends is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established. Gains or losses of revenue nature arising from the disposal of property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets, including investments, are accounted for in the income statement, after deducting from the net sales proceeds on disposal of the carrying amount of such assets. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis. Income from scrap sales are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods. Rental income is recognised on an accrual basis. Group Company For the year ended 31 March 2017 2016 2017 2016 Rs. '000 Rs. '000 Rs. '000 Rs.

Income tax expense Accounting Policy Current Tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Accordingly, provision for taxation is based on the profit for the year adjusted for taxation purposes in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and the amendments thereto. Deferred Tax Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:  Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and  In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:  Where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and  In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. 146 Cargills (Ceylon) PLC Annual Report 2016/17 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax and deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity are also recognised in equity and not in the Statement of Profit or Loss. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Cargills Quality Confectioneries (Private) Limited is exempt from income tax till the year of assessment 2017/2018 in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and subsequent amendments thereto. Cargills Quality Dairies (Private) Limited, Cargills Quality Foods Limited, Cargills Agrifoods Limited and Kotmale Dairy Products (private) Limited are subject to a concessionary tax rate of 10% under the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and subsequent amendments thereto. However, as the Department of Inland revenue is contesting the income tax exemptions claimed, provisions have been made for income tax at the normal rate for the financial years ended 31 March 2012, 31 March 2013, 31 March 2014, 31 March 2015, 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2017 although tax returns continue to be filed based on concessionary tax rate.

Earnings per share (EPS) Accounting Policy Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group / Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Property plant and equipment Accounting Policy Basis of Recognition Property, Plant and Equipment is recognized if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group and cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Basis of Measurement An item of Property, Plant and Equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset is initially measured at its cost. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and cost incurred subsequently to add to or replace a part of it. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring at the site on which they are located and capitalised borrowing costs. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as a part of computer equipment. When parts of an item of Property, Plant and Equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of Property, Plant and Equipment. Cost model Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Revaluation Model Land and buildings are measured at fair value less accumulated depreciation on buildings and impairment charged subsequent to the date of the revaluation. Where land and buildings are subsequently revalued, any increase in the carrying amount is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity in the asset revaluation reserve. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged against the revaluation reserves in the statement of changes in equity, any excess and all other decreases are charged to the statement of profit or loss. Revaluation of free hold land and buildings are done by professionally qualified independent valuers once in every three years. The Group revalued all its freehold land and buildings as at 31 March 2016. Subsequent Costs The cost of replacing a part of an item of Property, Plant and Equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The cost of day today servicing of Property, Plant and Equipment are charged to the Statement of Profit or Loss as incurred. Repairs and Maintenance Repairs and maintenance are charged to the Statement of Profit or Loss during the financial period in which they are incurred. The cost of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the assets when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the most recently assessed standard of performance of the existing assets will flow to the Company and Group and the renovation replaces an identifiable part of the asset. Major renovations are depreciated during the remaining useful life of the related asset. Capital Work-in-Progress These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalisation. These are stated in the Statement of Financial Position at cost. Capital assets which have been completed during the year and put to use have been transferred to Property, plant and equipment. Cargills (Ceylon) PLC Annual Report 2016/17 151 Notes to the Financial Statements 12. Property plant and equipment (contd.) De-recognition Property, plant and equipment are de-recognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on de recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in ‘Other income' or expense in the Statement of Profit or Loss in the year the asset is de-recognised. The revaluation surplus included in equity in respect of an item of property, plant and equipment will be transferred directly from revalution reserve to retained earnings when the asset is de-recognised. Depreciation Depreciation is recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss on a straight–line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment since this method most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows; Class of asset % per annum Period Buildings 2 50 years Improvement of leasehold properties 10 – 25 4 -10 years Motor vehicles 25 4 years IT equipment and software 20 – 33.3 3 -5 years Office and other equipment 20 5 years Air condition and refrigeration 10 – 20 5 -10 years Plant and machinery 10 – 20 5 -10 years Furniture and fittings 20 5 years The above rates are consistently used by all the Group entities. The depreciation rates are determined separately for each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment and commence to depreciate when it is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the management. Depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale or the date that the asset is de-recognised. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. 152 Cargills (Ceylon) PLC Annual Report 2016/17 Freehold Freehold Expenditure Plant, Motor Total Total land building incurred on machinery vehicles 2017 2016 leasehold and others building Rs.

The total deprecitation cost amounting to Rs. 37.44 Mn (2016 Rs. 35.97 Mn) is included in the other expenses of the Company. Capital work in progress consists of expenditure incurred on projects which are not completed and commenced business operations as at the reporting date. Fully depreciated assets of the Group as at the year end is Rs. 2,649.38 Mn (2016 2,354.35 Mn) and that of the Company is Rs. 225.87 Mn (2016 Rs. 224.14 Mn). 13. Investment property Accounting Policy Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Investment properties are initially recognised at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition the investment properties are stated at fair values, which reflect market conditions at the reporting date. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the Profit or Loss in the year in which they arise. Where Group companies occupy a significant portion of the investment property of a subsidiary, such portion of investment properties are treated as property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Financial Statements, and accounted for as per LKAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment. De-recognition Investment properties are de-recognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss in the year of retirement or disposal. Subsequent Transfers to/from Investment Property Transfers are made to investment property when, and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by the end of owner occupation, commencement of an operating lease to another party or completion of construction or development. Transfers are made from investment property when, and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by commencement of owner occupation or commencement of development with a view to sale. For a transfer from investment property to owner occupied property or inventories, the deemed cost of property for subsequent accounting is its fair value at the date of change in use. If the property occupied by the Company as an owner occupied property becomes an investment property, the Company, accounts for such property in accordance with the policy stated under property, plant and equipment up to the date of change in use. Any difference at the date of the change in use between the carrying amount of the property and its fair value is recognised as a revaluation of property, plant and equipment and is not transferred to profit or loss at the date of transfer and subsequent disposal, any existing revaluation surplus that was recognised under revaluation model to the property will be transferred to retained earnings. Cargills (Ceylon) PLC Annual Report 2016/17 155 Notes to the Financial Statements 13. Investment property (contd.) When the Company completes the construction or development of a self-constructed investment property, any difference between the fair value of the property at that date and its previous carrying amount is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss. Determining Fair Value External and independent valuers, having appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of property being valued, values the investment property portfolio annually. Investment Property Leased within the Group Any property leased out to parent or subsidiary is considered as owner-occupied from the perspective of the Group and adjustments are made for consolidation purposes.

Intangible assets Accounting Policy Intangible Assets The Group’s intangible assets include the value of computer software, brand name, franchise fee and goodwill. Basis of Recognition An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Group in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting StandardLKAS 38 on ‘Intangible Assets’. Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are stated in the Statement of Financial Position at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses if any. Subsequent Expenditure Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred. Useful Economic Lives, Amortisation and Impairment The useful economic lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each reporting date. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and they are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset. Amortisation is calculated using the straight– line method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful economic lives at the rates as specified below; Class of asset % per annum Period Computer software 25 4 years Franchise fee 10 10 years The unamortised balances of intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication for impairment and recognised in profit or loss to the extent that they are no longer probable of being recovered from the expected future benefits. De-recognition Intangible assets are de-recognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in the profit or loss in the year the asset is de-recognised. 158 Cargills (Ceylon) PLC Annual Report 2016/17 Goodwill Franchise fee Software Brand name Total 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Rs.

This action was based on legal advice received that the aforesaid section could be read on a standalone basis. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) subsequently informed the Company that the said Section 246 cannot be read on a standalone basis and should be read as a part of Part VIII of the Companies Act which deals with ‘Amalgamations’. Accordingly, the SEC directed that the Company and KHP give the former minority shareholders of KHP the opportunity to continue as shareholders of KHP if they so desire. Accordingly on 18 July 2016 the Company (jointly with KHP) wrote to the shareholders as directed by the SEC. Applications were received from shareholders holding 18,512 shares requesting to continue as shareholders of KHP, while holders of 297 shares requested for fresh Cheques to complete the disposal of their shares. Additionally the shareholders who did not encash their previous pay orders also continue to remain as shareholders of the KHP.

Other equity/Put liability Accounting Policy Written put options over NCI Recognition and measurement When an entity writes a put option with the non-controlling shareholders in an existing subsidiary on their equity interests in that subsidiary, and the put option granted to non-controlling shareholders provides for settlement in cash or in another financial asset by the entity, the entity is required to recognize a liability for the present value of the exercise price of the option as per LKAS 32. Accordingly Group has recognized a put liability as at reporting date. The group has accounted for its written put option over non-controlling shareholders using the present access method and determined such as its accounting policy to be applied consistently. The determination of present value of the exercise price (i.e. fair value) for put options related to non-controlling interests has involved management judgements and estimates of vital factors such as the likelihood of exercise of the option and the timing thereof, adherence to the conditions of the shareholder agreement by both parties, projected cash flows of the underlying operations, the weighted average cost of capital, etc. A change in any of these factors may have a significant impact on future results and cash flows. Subsequent measurement Subsequent changes in the carrying amount of the put liability will be recognized within equity. Group As at 31 March 2017 2016 Rs. '000 Rs. '000 Put option over Non Controlling Interest (NCI) 2,761,159 2,251,743 The put option over NCI relates to Put Option agreement between Cargills Foods Company (Private) Limited (CFC), International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Cargills Ceylon PLC (CCP) IFC has subscribed for 4,130,424 shares of CFC (representing 8% shares of the Company) for an aggregate subscription price of Rs. 2,550 Mn on 25th February 2015. Therefore IFC is considered the investor of CFC and non-controlling interest to CCP and CCP acts as the grantor / sponsor to the contract. CCP has granted IFC an option (The Put Option) to sell their shares to CCP during the put period on up to three occasions at the Put Price. As per the Put option agreement the Put Price means in relation to any given exercise of the put option, the price (calculated as of the date of settlement of purchase of the relevant Put shares by the grantor) that provides IFC an IRR of 9% in local currency terms; provided that the put price, shall be suitably adjusted to account for any dividends received by IFC on the Put shares and there shall not be any discount for liquidity or minority stake. 172 Cargills (Ceylon) PLC Annual Report 2016/17 The assumptions on which the above present value of the exercise price has been determined are as follows Conditions of the Shareholder Agreement will not be breached by either party until the Put Period arrives In the event of non-listing of the company by CCP, IFC will wait until the end of the Put Period to exercise the Put Option Weighted average cost of capital of CCP is 11.9% Pricing date as 31 March 2017 A year is assumed to have 365 days The present value of the exercise price has been derived based on an exercise price of Rs. 4,263,498,814/which has been computed after adjusting for an IRR of 9% and a put period from 25th February 2015 (which is the share certificate date) to 10th February 2021 (which is assumed as the exercise date). 23. Reserves Accounting Policy Equity Reserves The reserves recorded in equity (Other comprehensive income) on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position include; ‘Revaluation reserve’ consists of net surplus resulting from the revaluation of property plant and equipment. ‘Available for Sale’ reserve, which comprises changes in fair value of available for sale investments. ‘General Reserve’ represents the amounts set aside by the Directors for general application.

The cash and cash equivalents are held with banks, which are rated AAA(lka) to A(lka), based on Fitch Ratings. 37.1.5 Guarantees The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly owned subsidiaries. 37.2 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group holds cash and undrawn committed facilities to enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk. The Group monitors its risk to shortage of funds by considering maturity of both the Group’s financial investment and financial assets and other projected cash flow from operations. The Group’s objective is to maintain balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of multiple sources of funding including bank loans and overdrafts over a wider spread of maturity periods.
