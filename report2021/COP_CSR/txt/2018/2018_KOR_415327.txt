We were able to ensure safety with such endeavors that allowed strategy. KORAIL has shifted the paradigm of railway safety to prioritize and perform us to monitor disasters in real time and respond to them quickly. scientific safety management and identify tasks for safety innovation. We held Raising Safety Awareness of Employees at All Levels the first railway safety innovation committee in July 2016 to shift the existing KORAIL runs training sessions and educational programs to raise safety Advancement of Disaster Response System Increased Number of Remote Control Systems paradigm and establish future-oriented safety measures. The committee is awareness of employees at all levels not only for the company but also the KORAIL shaped its disaster response system based on 117 years of know-how Switch Wireless equipment Video surveillance composed of experts in five fields including safety, operation, vehicles, safety of the country.

We prescribed maintenance procedures for all trains, reinforced the safe railway trusted by the people of Korea and respond to the increasing industrial safety and health. Moreover, we handed out safety vests to reduce competence of the operators, and advanced the control tower operation by demand for safety. We reviewed the existing safety strategy and benchmarked safety accidents of workers working on railroads and developed a train identifying risk factors derived from the introduction of new high-speed trains the safety culture of advanced railway corporations overseas to seek measures proximity alert system to reinforce the safety management and supervision of SR, binary maintenance, and system changes. To minimize failures and Voltage application indicators (6,151 units) Safety alarm system (124 units) to innovate the safety management system. Moreover, we upgraded the system.
