Freight turnover t/km (tonFreight turnover is an economic indicator of transport kilometer) performance (an indicator of the volume of cargo transportation) equal to the product of the weight of cargo carried for a certain period of time at the distance of transportation. The freight turnover is measured in ton-kilometers. For example, if different vessels transported 5 million tons of cargo for a year to an average distance of 150 km, then the annual freight turnover is 5 * 150 = 750 million ton-kilometers. 2. Passenger turnover pkm Passenger turnover is an indicator of the volume of passenger transportation in passenger-kilometers; it is calculated as the product of the number of passengers per distance of transportation. 3. Average schedule speed km/h The average speed of the train along the site, taking into account the standing time at transfer stations, acceleration, deceleration and delay of the train on the running lines. In order to determine the average schedule speed, it is necessary to divide the product of the number of trains by the length of a site (km) by the sum of the duration (hours) of such trains being at this site: , where is total train-kilometers at the site; is train-hours taking into account the standing time of trains at transfer stations. The schedule speed depends on the capacity of the site, the technical condition of the track and the rolling stock, the train schedule and dispatching regulation. 4. Injury frequency rate The rate (Rf) expressing the number of occupational accidents per 1,000 employees. Calculation formula: , where Т is the total number of people injured for a certain period of time, whether the temporary incapacity has ended in this period or not. Р is an average headcount of employees for the period of time. 2017 Sustainability Report 49 Unit of № Term Measurement Explanation (if applicable) 5 Dynamic load of a t/car Dynamic load of a loaded car characterizes the average loaded car load of a loaded car along the entire route and is calculated by dividing the net freight turnover by the run of the loaded cars of the operating fleet. Car turnaround day The time taken to complete a cycle of operations from the 6 end of one loading to the end of the next loading or delivery in the loaded or empty state. 7 Average daily net t-km The number of tons per kilometer per day per car of the capacity of a car operating fleet. It is calculated as a quotient from the division of the net freight turnover by the operating fleet of cars assigned to a certain period of time. 8 Average daily run km The average daily run of a car is distance in kilometers of freight cars per car of the operating fleet per day. 9 A round trip of a km The average distance run by the car during the turnaround freight car time. 10 Loaded round trip km The average distance run by the car when loaded during of a freight car the turnaround time. 11 Length of track in km The length of the railway lines between the stations, use without taking into account such ways as the second main, station, etc. 12 Main track lines km The sum of the lengths of all the main track lines (first, second, third, etc.). 13 Access tracks Railway tracks connecting the railway station located on the main line with an industrial enterprise or other organization. 14 Rolling stock Train vehicle units intended for the transportation of cargo and passengers by rail. 15 EBITDA % The analytical indicator equal to the amount of profit before deduction of interest expenses, taxes, wear and tear and accrued depreciation. Also known as pre-tax profit . 16 EBITDA margin Measure the company’s profitability. It is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA and revenue. 17 NZHS Regional mains divisions 18 KTZ NC JSC, Kazakhstan Temir Zholy National Company Joint-Stock Company Company 19 Report The 2016
