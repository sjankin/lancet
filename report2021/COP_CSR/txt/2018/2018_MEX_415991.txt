José Antonio Fernández Carbajal Executive Chairman of the Board 9 FEMSA Comercio Steady growth, sustainable performance The past decade of strong, steady growth in our FEMSA Comercio retail operations has helped to position our company to continue delivering value to our stakeholders in the coming years. FEMSA Comercio contributed 50 percent of FEMSA’s consolidated revenues in 2017 (up from 38 percent in 2007) and contributed 33 percent of EBITDA in 2017 (up from 18 percent in 2007), reflecting an increasingly balanced core portfolio over time and favorably diversifying our financial performance. Despite rising inflation in Mexico, the rapid transformation of Mexico’s fuel industry, and a number of severe natural disasters in 2017, our retail operations made solid progress in a resilient consumer environment and are well positioned to continue creating value and driving long-term earnings growth.

Total OXXO stores Expanding convenience Driving the sustained growth of the OXXO brand is FEMSA’s dedicated focus on creating value for stakeholders while refining our business model and offerings to meet the market’s needs. Consumers who have relied on OXXO to quench their thirst, satisfy a snack craving or pick up a prepared meal now increasingly appreciate the one-stop convenience of purchasing other products or using essential services while at one of our stores. For example, providing a place to securely make deposits and withdrawals from bank accounts, receive remittances from relatives living abroad, and pay utility bills are ways our company is investing in the social and relationship capital of our customers to earn their trust.

We first entered this market segment in 2013, with the acquisition of two regional drugstore chains in Mexico. In 2015, we expanded further with two additional acquisitions, including a majority stake in the Chilean pharmacy and distribution chain, Grupo Socofar, which operates an integrated platform in Chile and Colombia. Our current growth strategy for the Health Division is to further consolidate our market presence and facilitate continued international expansion by leveraging both our effective small-box retail processes and our operational and logistics expertise.

To ensure that we maintain a motivated workforce, we are also making investments in the human capital of our organization. We are taking steps to ensure that our OXXO employees are working in stores closer to their home, thereby saving them time and money, while potentially contributing to a reduction in traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions related to commuting. In 2017, we also took steps to increase compensation, training, and diversity among our OXXO employees as part of our plan for employee engagement and retention. Though these new policies and investments in human capital partially contributed to a slight contraction of OXXO’s operating margin in 2017, we believe that our valuecentered approach will reduce turnover and related costs of hiring and training in the longer term.

To further consolidate our presence in the market and create additional value for shareholders, in 2017 we invested in the expansion of our infrastructure and continued to roll out our OXXO GAS branding to new stations. 14 FEMSA at Value Creation Dear FEMSA Coca-Cola Sustainability FEMSA Corporate a Glance Highlights Shareholders Comercio FEMSA Foundation Governance 70 net new service stations in 2017 This unique set of circumstances led to a contraction in gross margin in the Fuel Division in the first two quarters of 2017, with gross profits per liter remaining relatively flat versus the previous year, in peso terms.

Navigating market pressures The number of vehicles on Mexico’s roads has grown steadily over the last few decades and, with it, demand for gasoline. Domestic refining output has not kept pace with demand, and gasoline imports have increased as a result. That fact, combined with the currency conditions present in early 2017—namely a steep depreciation of the Mexican peso vis à vis the U.S. dollar—contributed to a sharp increase in the price of gasoline and diesel in January 2017 by an average of approximately 17 percent. Spotlight on Sustainability: We are continually working to find efficiencies and save resources at our OXXO GAS service stations: � Since 2011, we have installed LED lighting at OXXO GAS stations, which use less electricity, provide better lighting conditions and create safer and more comfortable spaces. � Since 2015, we have expanded the installation of efficient toilets in service station restrooms, including dry urinals that save an average of 3.8 liters of water per flush. � In 2017, we deployed a new waste management program to separate organic and inorganic waste. � As of the end of 2017, we have planted more than 1,000 trees at OXXO GAS stations. 15 Coca-Cola FEMSA Guiding our business growth As a strategic partner to The Coca-Cola Company and the largest Coca-Cola franchise bottler in the world, by sales volume, Coca‑Cola FEMSA holds a leadership position within the beverage industry with a multi-category portfolio and global footprint.

We base our actions on an underlying commitment to ethics and values, and we organize our sustainability approach along three pillars: Our People, Our Planet and Our Community. Since 2005 we have been signatories of the United Nations Global Compact, through which we pledge to follow and promote its 10 principles relating to human rights, labor practices, the environment and anti-corruption.

The eleven countries in which FEMSA operates have accepted the SDGs and will be using them to define their 2030 agendas. But to fully make a global impact, businesses and civil society must also take action. In 2017, FEMSA began an analysis to gain a better understanding of what the SDGs mean for our core business and how we can best contribute to them. In 2018, we will also be considering how the SDGs can help guide our own corporate sustainability goals. Our approach to materiality FEMSA’s Strategic Sustainability Framework is based on the priorities and issues that are most important to our business and the stakeholders with whom we engage. Our key topics, which correspond to nine action areas across our stakeholder groups include employees, consumers, suppliers, three pillars.
