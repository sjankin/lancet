As for other forms of indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 3), the Energy & Loss Committee (E&L Committee) is the main driver to monitor and manage processes to reduce GHG emissions from indirect sources as reducing crude oil losses during transport from oil production plant to refinery (i.e. ocean loss) to decrease GHG emissions from the upstream processes. Then, for the transport process, developing a network of pipelines is used to decrease dependence on other vehicles such as lorry and ships in product distribution. Lastly, for waste management, GHGs from landfill disposal is controlled in accordance with the Waste Management Policy driven by Waste Management Committee, and the organization-wide target of zero waste to landfills by 2020. Other initiatives to reduce indirect GHG emissions include reducing employees’ individual GHG emissions from transportation.
