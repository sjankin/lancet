In 2016 and 2017, we worked with an external consultant to identify the possible risks that Placing the Shopping Center in Areas with High Connectivity and Use climate change could pose for the specific geographic areas where we operate. The main of Public Transportation results were as follows: We ensure that our shopping centers are located in interconnected urban areas, making it easy for our visitors to use public transportation. This helps create more integrated cities, bringing the most important services closer to different social groups, closing distances and helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Summary Chile Peru Colombia More than 90% More than Drought: Decreased precipitation and higher temperatures in some 780 spaces of our shopping centers are for bicycles that were used by cities, which could affect future water 71 150 meters or less from public more than 178,000 people last availability. year. transportation Fluctuation in the price of energy: Unique design: Our shopping centers are designed in accordance Droughts would drive down with their surroundings and the future conditions under which production of hydroelectric they will operate. power, triggering restrictions on consumption or surcharges. We reduce environmental impact with practices like low-water landscaping, efficient watering systems, natural lighting, green walls to improve thermal insulation and other alternatives that positively impact our use of natural resources. Heat waves: Would trigger greater demand on air conditioning units and drive up energy consumption. Increased precipitation and flooding: Would effect living conditions in the cities and We have 37.5% We have more than 150 preferential of our shopping centers increase demand for infrastructure more than investment. 5,000 m2 feature an open design in common areas, which reduces parking spaces for of green walls in our the demand on air conditioning low-emissions cars This helps us understand the possible impacts of climate change on the real estate industry, shopping centers systems as well as the importance of putting environmentally sustainable practices into place for both constructing and operating our shopping centers. SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION CERTIFICATIONS Identification and assessment of environmental impacts In 2015, Arauco Quilicura became the first shopping center in Chile to earn LEED In the development phase, we carried out all the locally required environmental (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certification. In 2017, we added two verifications, detecting potential environmental impacts and developing a plan to other shopping centers to our LEED-certified portfolio: manage them. 100% of our shopping centers are located in highly populated urban areas. InOutlet Premium Lurín LEED Silver Parque La Colina Colombia LEED Gold First shopping center in Peru to Only Parque Arauco shopping center To date, environmental impact studies show that none of our shopping earn the certification. with LEED Gold certification. centers significantly impact biodiversity. None of our shopping centers are located near or in protected areas or in areas of high biodiversity value. Efficient use of resources: Installation of energyand water-efficient artifacts and fixtures is considered during the design and construction phases as a factor that optimizes water savings. 72 66.7% of shopping centers in Colombia feature rainwater collection systems for reuse in bathrooms and watering. We prioritize the use of efficient lighting and nearly half of our shopping centers have installed efficient lighting in 80% of fixtures. Practices and high materials standards: We make sure to select highly durable building materials and strive to chose materials from local suppliers, with preference shown for those with recycled content. We have taken progressive steps toward recycling waste produced during our construction projects. During construction of Parque La Colina, 100% of the steel used was supplier-certified, post-consumer recycled, while 4% of the concrete used was supplier-certified, preconsumer recycled. Integrated Report 2017 parque arauco SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS The main environmental impacts associated with shopping center operations are tied to the intensity of energy and water demands as well as generation of waste and greenhouse gas emissions. In 2017, we established two work areas that enable us to structure efficient use of resources and reduce environmental impact. I. Establishing an environmental management mechanism OUR GREEN WALLS » We implemented a universal process for logging and monitoring the shopping centers in Peru and Colombia, accounting for 54.2% of our main shopping centers.* In 2010, Parque Arauco Kennedy, a pioneer of its time, became the first shopping center in Chile to install green walls. » In 2018, we plan to implement the process in the rest of the portfolio in Chile. 73 Today, we have 900m2 of green walls at Parque Arauco Kennedy and 470m2 at Arauco Quilicura. The plants are hung on a support structure made of plastic recovered from industrial waste and textiles, making it possible to grow vegetation without requiring soil. II. Implementing the operational efficiency project All materials are from recycling centers throughout the Metropolitan Region of Santiago. » We conducted energy diagnostics to learn about behavior and management opportunities in some of our main shopping centers. Our green walls block the sun’s direct rays, providing a ventilated » We formed operational efficiency committees to establish a road map and environmental façade. Furthermore, a drip watering mechanism and a water management projects in our operations. reuse system enables water to be used more efficiently. *See the beginning of this chapter for details on the environmental scope of the portfolio. « MECHANISMS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT In an effort to monitor change and continuous improvement, we developed a process that enables us to learn about and oversee our shopping centers’ environmental performance. In 2017, when we began implementing this initiative in shopping centers in Peru and Colombia, we established performance indicators and defined procedures for proper management. In order to implement the environmental management mechanism, we offered more than 10 trainings for Parque Arauco employees who are directly involved in managing and using natural resources, like operations supervisors and shopping center managers. 74 MEASURING AND MONITORING ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS CARBON FOOTPRINT (G4-EN15, G4-EN16, G4-EN18) We measured the carbon footprint (scopes 1 and 2) of the operations of all shopping centers, according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidelines. Our 2017 emissions totaled 20,152 tons of CO2e, broken down as follows: 20.6% Chile Peru 6.9% Colombia 72.5% Integrated Report 2017 parque arauco DIRECT EMISSIONS (SCOPE 1) INDIRECT EMISSIONS (SCOPE 2) GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INTENSITY.

Data tied to replacing refrigerant gases is not included. 3. Indirect emissions: Emissions released by the producer of the energy required by the organization.

INTENSITY OF Recycling management includes recovery of materials like card WASTE GENERATION board, glass, paper, plastic and cans. Furthermore, organic 78 waste undergoes a dehydration treatment prior to use as The waste generated at our shopping centers is from our tenants and customers or visitors.

Five of our shopping centers included in the scope of this chapter (see page 70), do not have waste logging mechanisms because waste is managed by the corresponding municipality. They are, therefore, not included in this indicator. 2. In contrast with the indicators on emissions, energy and water intensity, at Parque Arauco we manage our tenants’ non-hazardous waste. Consequently, GLA (not square meters of common area) is the critical factor for monitoring this indicator. « IMPLEMENTING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY PROJECTS (G4-EN6, G4-EN10, G4-EN7, G4-EN19) We focus efforts on mitigating our environmental impact and progressively improving environmental management to exceed legal requirements by implementing initiatives to reduce use and consumption of natural resources. This year we worked on implementing operational efficiency projects, conducted an energy diagnostic to identify continuous improvement opportunities and formed operational efficiency committees in each country. 79 1.
