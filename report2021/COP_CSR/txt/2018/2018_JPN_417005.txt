Sei-katsu-sha Insight Sei-katsu-sha insight is the foundation of our thinking and planning. It reminds us that consumers are more than just shoppers performing an economic function. They have heartbeats. These unique, autonomous individuals that we in the Hakuhodo DY Group refer to as sei-katsu-sha are the inhabitants of an increasingly complex world. We believe that deeper insight into their lives is the source from which new value springs. That is why we make it our business to know sei-katsu-sha better than anyone else and to use that knowledge to make media a stronger bridge between advertisers and customers. Commitment to Partnership Partnership is the way we do business, the starting point for all business activities. From the standpoint of sei-katsu-sha, we pay constant, careful attention to the needs of our clients and of media suppliers. We believe that engaging in dialogue and acting together are the best ways to find the solutions to those needs. As our clients’ and media suppliers’partner, our aim is to build strong, long-lasting relationships. By working together over the long term, we are better able to provide durable and coherent solutions to our partners. We believe that the times ahead will be marked by new innovations in these policies, as we work in partnership with advertisers to create marketing solutions that add value to every business domain in which they are involved. As a partner to media suppliers and content holders, we aim to add value across the whole diverse spectrum that media and content has become.

However, to facilitate a deeper understanding of the Group, we recognize the importance of reporting not only financial information but also non-financial information such as social and environmental initiatives, which represent an essential part of the Group’ s value creation. Accordingly, Annual Report 2017 was created in a way that better encompasses such non-financial aspects.

(Please refer to Page 3 for details of the strategic operating unit.) Annual Report 2017 11 To Our Stakeholders During fiscal 2016, there was a strong sense of stagnation in the Japanese economy stemming from such factors as the Kumamoto earthquakes, the BREXIT vote in Britain, and continued yen appreciation. However, there were also signs of an upward trend as the US dollar became stronger against the yen due to high expectations for growth in the US economy following the presidential election. In addition, corporate earnings in Japan improved, stock prices rose, and the consumer mindset became more positive. At the same time, the domestic advertising market saw steady growth. Against this backdrop, the Hakuhodo DY Group continued to pursue proactive business development under its MediumTerm Business Plan (the “Plan”). This resulted in year-on-year increases in billings in a broad range of customer industries, led by Information / Communications, Cosmetics / Toiletries, and Household products. From the perspective of costs, while we actively carried out investments to promote the strategies of the Plan, we were able to secure an increase in operating income as a result of our efforts to control selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Accordingly, we realized record profit for the fifth consecutive year. Under the Plan, the Group has adopted“Strengthening of sei-katsu-sha data-driven marketing response capabilities,” “Strengthening of business structures in emerging markets, particularly in Asia,” and “Continuous enhancement of specialization and innovation”as three important growth drivers. During fiscal 2016, we steadily executed the strategies of the Plan guided by these growth drivers. For example, we collaborated with other companies to promote data usage and application, strengthened our response capabilities in the CRM business by leveraging sei-katsu-sha data, expanded our network hubs in Asia, and enhanced media / specialty marketing service functions. We also made efforts to acquire expertise and innovation and generate synergies through kyu. Going forward, we will continue to promote the strategies adopted under the Plan as we aim for further growth. Returns to shareholders are determined by comprehensively taking into account factors including the Group’ s business performance, and with a basic policy of maintaining a stable dividend. For fiscal 2016, we paid a full-year dividend of ¥24.0 per share as planned, marking a ¥6.0 increase from fiscal 2015. Furthermore, in accordance with our basic policy of stable dividends and taking into account performance forecasts, we intend to raise the full-year dividend by ¥2.0, to ¥26.0 per share, for fiscal 2017. In addition, with the aspiration to realize sustainable growth and continuous improvement in corporate value, the Group aims to contribute to the creation of an affluent future for sei-katsusha, growth in the economy, and the development of society. To achieve this aim, the Group believes that initiatives toward the resolution of social issues through its business, in addition to profitable growth, are extremely important. In Annual Report 2017, in addition to financial information, we introduce ESG-related initiatives and our approach to sustainability, which is to resolve the constantly changing issues of sei-katsu-sha and society and provide new value to create and spread happiness among sei-katsu-sha and society. Going forward, we will fulfill our social responsibilities as a corporation through initiatives unique to the Hakuhodo DY Group. We thank all of our stakeholders for their support to date, and we ask for your continued understanding and encouragement.

To achieve this aim, the Group believes that initiatives toward the resolution of social issues through its business, in addition to profit­able growth, are extremely important. This section introduces the Group’ s approach to sustainability and some of its ESG* initiatives. Approach to Sustainability  Resolving the constantly changing issues of sei-katsu-sha and society and providing new value to create and spread happiness among sei-katsu-sha and society The value creation that the Group envisions involves leveraging its strengths and assets to make contributions through its business activities that help realize a society in which sei-katsu-sha can flourish and live an active lifestyle of their own choosing. The Group believes that the source of such value creation is its most valuable asset—human resources. The total sum of value created by each Group employee represents value for the Group as a whole. Our employees ascertain social issues from their own perspective, working to become partners to all of our stakeholders by fully immersing themselves in the issues facing sei-katsu-sha and society and making efforts to resolve them. In doing so, our employees aim to bring happiness to sei-katsu-sha and society as a whole. Initiatives to Identify Materiality  The Group is currently working to identify materiality that could impact both its corporate value and society in general. Accordingly, the Group is conducting repeated examinations of each of its core operating companies from a CSR* perspective and moving forward with the following processes toward materiality identification.

In terms of collaboration with external organizations in fiscal 2016, 123 Group employees conducted a total of 586 lectures at 89 educational institutions (elementary schools, junior high schools, high schools, two-year colleges, colleges, graduate schools, and vocational schools). * Career Education Awards To encourage and popularize initiatives to support education by corporations and economic organizations, METI established the Career Education Awards in fiscal 2010. The award system comprises three categories: large enterprise, smallto medium-sized enterprise, and coordinator. In the large enterprise category, H-CAMP won the First Award for Excellence, which recognizes initiatives with the highest level of excellence. In addition, H-CAMP won the Grand Award, which is given to the best initiative out of all three categories. TAP PROJECT JAPAN (Hakuhodo DY Group) TAP PROJECT JAPAN is a joint project between the Japan Committee for UNICEF and the Hakuhodo DY Group that seeks to use the power of design to realize a future where children all over the world can access clean water. The project was initially started in New York in 2007 and then later expanded into Japan in 2009, where volunteer Group employees carry out activities each summer to provide people with new opportunities to learn about water. The events conducted in Tokyo in August 2016 drew crowds of more than 4,000 people. Initiatives conducted through this project to date include building 45 wells and other water supply facilities and 146 restroom units for 48 elementary schools* in Madagascar. * As of March 2017, including spinoff initiatives and activities funded by private, direct donations.

After moving to its Akasaka office, Hakuhodo started the Akasaka Team, which has conducted cleaning activities roughly 190 times since 2008, with over 1,200 participants. In addition to picking up garbage, the Green Bird Project values participating in local communities and forging connections between people.

As such, the Group aims to become a corporate entity in which all employees can leverage their creativity to its full potential. The various initiatives the Group is undertaking to make the new proposals and innovations of its employees a reality lead not only to an improved business performance but also to increased employment. 24 Hakuhodo DY holdings Workstyle Reforms (Hakuhodo DY Group) In December 2016, Hakuhodo and Hakuhodo DY Media Partners unveiled to employees their new workstyle manifesto, which was centered on growth, health, and time design. Based on this manifesto, the Workstyle Design Division was established in April 2017 to draft and implement measures for improving employees’ability to design their work and for contributing to employee health improvement. Meanwhile, at Daiko Advertising and YOMIKO ADVERTISING, committees chaired by company presidents have been established and examining the creation of next-generation workstyles since fall of 2016. Promotion of Active Role of Women (Hakuhodo, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners) To promote the active role of women, we have introduced various systems related to maintaining a work-life balance in each life stage, including pregnancy, giving birth, and returning to work. The content of these systems far surpasses what a company is legally obligated to provide. In these ways, we are offering support for balancing child rearing with work. The Groupwide Business Idea Recruiting and Cultivation Program AD+VENTURE (Hakuhodo DY Group) The AD+VENTURE program aims to recruit, examine, and cultivate a wide range of new business ideas from each Group company and develop such ideas into actual businesses. Without being constricted to existing business domains, the program works to invigorate the entire Group by generating new creativity and forge a corporate culture that encourages new ideas. Over the seven years since its creation, the AD+VENTURE program has received 651 business plans, and 15 of these plans have been turned into actual businesses. The Japan LGBT Research Institute, Inc. is a think tank started in 2016 through the AD+VENTURE program. The institute aims to provide support from a marketing perspective to companies that are focusing on the LGBT community and other diverse sexualities in an effort to give shape to a society that embraces diversity. In March 2017, we implemented an E-learning program that was developed and provided by Japan LGBT Research Institute with the aim of instilling a proper awareness toward the LGBT community and other diverse sexualities. Over 3,400 Group employees participated in this program. Human Resources Development (Hakuhodo DY Group) Based on the Hakuhodo DY Group’ s belief that employees are the most valuable asset, we are providing opportunities for career and skill development that cater to the individuality and ambitions of each employee.

Health Management and Welfare Programs (Hakuhodo, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners) For four consecutive years, all Hakuhodo employees have undertaken the annual health examination. Also, for employees over 29 years old, we offer opportunities once a year to be examined by a doctor at a cooperating medical institution. Starting with the Free Vacation System, Step Holidays, Nursing Care Holidays, and the Nursing Care Support System, we are promoting the establishment of systems that allow our employees to continue working in good health. Annual Report 2017 25 SDGs Creative Volunteer Work for Popularizing the SDGs (Hakuhodo) Hakuhodo is collaborating with the United Nations Information Centre, which bears responsibility for promoting and raising awareness toward the SDGs, and has created a formal Japanese icon and public advertising images for the SDGs in 2016. To ensure that every sector can use these materials with ease, Hakuhodo held numerous discussions with UN-affiliated organizations, NGOs for international cooperation, JICA, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Through such discussions, Hakuhodo developed a universally applicable catch phrase that is easy to use in all sectors. Business Seminars on the SDGs (Hakuhodo DY Group) In May 2017, the Hakuhodo DY Group held the Basic Knowledge Seminar for SDGs in Business, which targeted all Group employees. The main purpose of the seminar was to have employees better understand how they can contribute to realizing the targets adopted within the SDGs. Under this premise, approximately 150 Group employees participated in the seminar.

Outside director Nobumichi Hattori possesses broad-ranging views on corporate strategy as a member of a major U.S. investment bank and as a graduate school professor. Enhancing Governance by Striking a Balance between an Offensive and Defensive Approach At the Board of Directors’meetings, the Company has held numerous discussions on the various initiatives for realizing the targets of the Medium-Term Business Plan. Such discussions require comprehensive and sophisticated management decisions, and I have leveraged my knowledge and expertise within these discussions to provide management advice and supervision from the perspective of both “offensive governance,” which I believe is the most important, and Hakuhodo DY Holdings “defensive governance,” which is also essential. For example, I have made Outside Director statements when necessary on the reasons behind the proposal of agenda Noboru Matsuda items after thoroughly listening to and examining such items. Going forward, I would like to help the Company realize sustainable growth and improve corporate value by enhancing governance while striking a balance between an offensive and defensive approach. Improving the Quality of Governance through Objective Advice The Hakuhodo DY Group has adopted three growth drivers for realizing the targets of the Medium-Term Business Plan. Supported by these drivers, the Group is making ambitious efforts to increase overseas profits and achieve growth through M&A. Drawing on my many years of experience at an investment bank, I continued to actively provide advice and supervision regarding these initiatives during the period under review from the perspective of an outside director. Such advice related to not only the stage of considering an investment Hakuhodo DY Holdings but also to resolving the various issues that occur after making an investment. Outside Director In order for the Group to realize growth and improve corporate value going Nobumichi Hattori forward, I will continue to provide objective advice that helps further improve the quality of the Group’s governance. 40 Hakuhodo DY holdings Fact Sheets Annual Report 2017 41 Ten-Year Summary of Consolidated Financial Statements Years ended March 31 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 For the year Gross billings ¥1,118,749 ¥1,033,396 ¥ 917,065 ¥ 936,476 ¥ 978,321 Revenue 163,897 154,059 143,579 152,218 160,756  Selling, general and administrative 138,889 139,042 137,443 137,951 140,940 expenses Personnel costs 86,923 86,521 90,325 93,514 96,902 Rent 7,378 10,571 11,475 11,097 10,585 Depreciation and amortization 2,719 4,065 3,848 2,687 1,886 Amortization of goodwill and 1,093 934 519 625 527 other intangible assets1 Others 40,774 36,949 31,274 30,027 31,038 Operating income 25,007 15,016 6,136 14,266 19,816 Income before income taxes 18,896 7,874 6,147 13,132 20,355 Profit attributable to owners 10,021 (3,277) 1,277 4,550 8,604 of parent Operating income before 26,100 15,950 6,655 14,891 20,343 amortization of goodwill2 At year-end Total assets ¥ 552,697 ¥ 480,768 ¥ 456,313 ¥ 474,126 ¥ 518,805 Cash and time deposits + Market72,479 58,663 77,890 92,498 101,854 able securities of current assets Investment securities 58,468 46,330 49,981 45,938 53,900 Interest-bearing debt3 2,615 2,679 2,129 2,544 2,768 Net assets 214,074 206,048 208,802 206,455 219,280 Cash flows Net cash provided by (used in) ¥ 26,085 ¥ (14,570) ¥ 25,300 ¥ 22,616 ¥ 20,047 operating activities Net cash provided by (used in) (20,390) 6,783 (4,211) (1,379) (5,444) investing activities Net cash used in financing activities (6,431) (4,613) (3,421) (5,792) (5,017) Per share data (yen)4 Basic net income (loss) ¥ 25.87 ¥ (8.49) ¥ 3.31 ¥ 11.81 ¥ 22.66 Diluted net income5 25.87 — 3.30 11.81 22.64 Cash dividends 8.00 7.00 7.00 7.00 7.00 Dividend payout ratio (%) 30.9 — 211.4 59.2 30.9 Net assets ¥ 547.28 ¥ 514.25 ¥ 520.90 ¥ 518.11 ¥ 542.89 Ratios (%) Revenue to gross billings margin 14.7 14.9 15.7 16.3 16.4 Operating margin before amortization 15.9 10.4 4.6 9.8 12.7 of goodwill6 Operating margin7 15.3 9.7 4.3 9.4 12.3 Ratio of personnel costs to revenue8 53.0 56.2 62.9 61.4 60.3 Return on equity (ROE) 4.7 (1.6) 0.6 2.3 4.3 Shareholders’equity ratio 38.2 41.3 44.0 41.5 39.7 Number of employees 8,305 9,600 9,823 10,081 10,633 (at year-end) 1. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets refers to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from corporate acquisitions. 2. Operating income before amortization of goodwill refers to operating income that has been calculated excluding the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from corporate acquisitions. 3.

Annual Report 2017 47 Operating Results at Major (Consolidated) Subsidiaries Financial Highlights • Billings rose ¥5.0 billion, or 0.6% year on year. This rise was due to an increase in billings from Information / Communications and Cosmetics / Toiletries, which offset a decrease in billings from Automobiles / Related products and Pharmaceuticals / Medical supplies. • Despite a strong performance by Hakuhodo Inc., the billings increase was minimal due to the fall in billings of subsidiaries, primarily overseas. • Although ordinary income fell as non-operating income worsened, profit attributable to owners of parent rose due to an improvement in extraordinary income. ¥ Millions Years ended March 31 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Billings 745,218 795,468 832,528 875,294 880,295 Ordinary income 18,486 24,437 27,083 30,429 29,799 Profit attributable to owners of parent 8,653 12,772 14,281 18,017 18,598 • Billings were up ¥5.8 billion, or 3.8%, year on year. This increase was attributable to a rise in billings from Other and Finance / Insurance, which offset a decrease in billings from Distribution / Retailing and Transportation / Leisure. • Ordinary income rose significantly due to increased billings and improvement in gross margin. Profit attributable to owners of parent fell due in part to the rebound from the lower tax burden in the previous fiscal year brought about by temporary factors. ¥ Millions Years ended March 31 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Billings 150,550 147,335 147,736 155,237 161,094 Ordinary income 1,480 1,335 1,873 2,817 3,367 Profit attributable to owners of parent (312) 541 1,119 3,370 2,138 • Billings declined ¥1.3 billion, or 1.9%, year on year. This decline resulted from a billings decrease in Automobiles / Related products and Transportation / Leisure, which outweighed an increase in billings from Information / Communications and Beverages / Cigarettes / Luxury foods. • Ordinary income was down due to a decline in billings and an increase in SG&A expenses. Furthermore, profit attributable to owners of parent fell due in part to the rebound from the lower tax burden in the previous fiscal year brought about by temporary factors. ¥ Millions Years ended March 31 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Billings 78,115 78,903 73,041 74,744 73,346 Ordinary income 983 1,128 668 1,324 1,113 Profit attributable to owners of parent 1,131 665 42 1,529 631 48 Hakuhodo DY holdings Company Billings by Type of Service and Contribution Business Results (Non-Consolidated) ¥ Billions Year ended March 31, 2017 ¥ Millions 1,000 30 Internet media 63,883 Newspapers 37,168 9.1% 5.3% 750 20 Outdoor media 20,837 Magazines 14,018 3.0% 2.0% 500 10 Creative 98,210 Radio 7,606 14.0% 1.1% Marketing / 137,347 Television 309,630 250 0 Promotion 19.6% 44.2% 0 ‒10 Others 11,027 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 1.6% (Years ended March 31) Billings Ordinary Income (right) ¥ Billions Year ended March 31, 2017 ¥ Millions 1,000 30 Internet media 5,632 Newspapers 13,726 4.5% 11.0% 750 20 Outdoor media 8,141 Magazines 1,544 6.5% 1.2% 500 10 Creative 11,480 Radio 2,372 9.2% 1.9% Marketing / 22,295 Television 56,189 250 0 Promotion 17.9% 45.2% 0 ‒10 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Others 2,965 (Years ended March 31) 2.4% Billings Ordinary Income (right) ¥ Billions Year ended March 31, 2017 ¥ Millions 1,000 30 Internet media 3,715 Newspapers 5,810 5.2% 8.1% 750 20 Outdoor media 3,083 Magazines 1,008 4.3% 1.4% Creative 8,365 Radio 1,475 500 10 11.7% 2.1% Marketing / 21,086 Television 23,821 250 0 Promotion 29.4% 33.2% 0 ‒10 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Others 3,387 (Years ended March 31) Billings Ordinary Income (right) 4.7% Annual Report 2017 49 Stock Information As of March 31, 2017 Number of Percentage of Major Shareholders shares held shares held (%) 1 The Hakuho Foundation 70,605,350 18.17 2 General Incorporated Association Hakusei-kai 18,619,700 4.79 3 Hakuhodo DY Holdings Inc. 15,903,977 4.09 4 Motoko Nakamoto 11,550,000 2.97 5 The Asahi Shimbun Company 11,223,490 2.88 6 Hakuhodo DY Holdings Employees’Shareholdings Association 9,877,700 2.54 7 Japan Trustee Services Bank, Ltd.

While part of the layout has been changed, every effort was made in the preparation of this annual report to ensure there were no discrepancies between it and the content of the Yuho Financial Report. From the perspectives of achieving fairness and completeness for all our stakeholders, we prepare and provide an English version of our Japanese annual report. The financial section of the English annual report is a translation of the financial section of the Japanese annual report that was extracted from the Yuho Financial Report. Again, great care was taken in the preparation of the annual report to ensure there are no major discrepancies between it and the content of the Japanese annual report. However, neither the Japanese nor English annual reports were included in the scope of the audit carried out by KPMG AZSA LLC. * A document Japanese companies must prepare each fiscal year to comply with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.

Annual Report 2017 59 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Method of Preparation for Consolidated and Nonconsolidated Financial Statements (1) The Company’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the “Regulations Concerning the ­Terminology, Forms and Preparation Method of Consolidated Financial Statements” (Finance Ministry Ordinance No. 28 of 1976). (2) The Company’s nonconsolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the “Regulations Concerning the Terminology, Forms and Preparation Method of Financial Statements” (Finance Ministry Ordinance No. 59 of 1963; the “Financial Statement Regulations”). The Company is deemed eligible to submit special financial statements, and has prepared these financial statements as per Article 127 of the“Ordinance on Terminology, Forms and Preparation Method of Financial Statements, etc.” Audit Verification The Company’s consolidated and financial statements for the fiscal year under review (April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017) were audited by KPMG AZSA LLC, as per Article 193, Section 2.1 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. Special Measures to Ensure Appropriateness of Consolidated Financial Statements Hakuhodo DY holdings carries out special measures to ensure the appropriateness of its consolidated financial statements. Specifically, we participate as a member of the Financial Accounting Standards Foundation to appropriately u ­ nderstand and respond to changes in accounting standards. Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Scope of consolidation (1) Number of consolidated subsidiaries―248. Names of primary consolidated subsidiaries―Please refer to pages 91–94. D.A. Consortium Holdings Inc. and 14 other companies were newly established and added to the scope of consolidation. Integrated Communications Group Pte Ltd. and 33 other companies were added as a result of the acquisition of shares. Companies removed from the scope of consolidation included NESPA JAPAN and three other companies that were liquidated, Chubu Asahi Advertising Inc. and two other companies as a result of the sale of shares, and Instore Brand Consulting Inc. and one other company that were merged. (2) Major nonconsolidated subsidiaries IF Vietnam Co., Ltd (Reason for exclusion from scope of consolidation) Nonconsolidated subsidiaries are small in size, and neither their aggregate total assets, sales, net income, or retained ­earnings (amounts corresponding to ownership portion) have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 2. Items related to application of equity-method accounting (1) Nonconsolidated subsidiaries for which the equity method is applied. No items Davc, Inc. was removed from the scope of equity-method accounting as it was liquated. (2) Number of affiliates for which the equity method is applied―57. (Names of major equity-method affiliates) SUPER NETWORK, INC., ADSTAFF-HAKUHODO, INC., Advertisement EDI Center, Inc., mediba Inc., Percept/H Pvt. Ltd., Guangdong GDAD-Hakuhodo Advertising Co., Ltd., and TBWA\HAKUHODO China Co., Ltd. IDEO U LLC was newly established and added to the scope of equity-method application. Environmental Planning Laboratory Inc. and one other company were added as a result of the acquisition of shares. ngi Venture Community Fund Number 2 (VCF-2), an investment limited liability partnership was removed from the scope of consolidation as they were liquidated. 60 Hakuhodo DY holdings (3) Major nonconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which the equity method is not applied Foresight Research Co., Ltd. (Reason for exclusion from scope of equity-method application) The effect of these nonequity-method companies individually on net income and retained earnings is negligible, and as a whole they are not significant, and are therefore excluded from the scope of equity-method application. (4) Items deemed particularly necessary for inclusion regarding the method of equity-method application For equity-method affiliates with fiscal years ending on dates other than March 31, the financial statements for the companies’ respective fiscal years are used. 3. Items related to fiscal year-ends, etc., for consolidated subsidiaries When the difference between a consolidated subsidiary’s fiscal year-end and the Group’s consolidated fiscal year-end is three months or less, the financial statements of the subsidiary for the relevant fiscal year are used. When the difference between a consolidated subsidiary’s fiscal year-end and the Group’s consolidated fiscal year-end is more than three months, provisional financial statements are used based on said company’s financial results in the most recent quarter. For significant transactions that occur between the day following the subsidiary’s fiscal year-end and the Company’ s fiscal year-end, adjustments are applied as necessary for consolidation. In the past, provisional financial statements based on the financial results of the most recent quarter were used for IREP Co., Ltd., and three other companies as their fiscal years ended on September 30. However, in the consolidated fiscal year under review, these companies’fiscal year-ends were changed to March 31. As a result, the consolidated statement of income for the year under review has been adjusted to cover the 15-month period from January 1, 2016, to March 31, 2017. Additionally, the fiscal year-end for K.M.J CO., LTD. which was made a consolidated subsidiary in the year under review through the acquisition of shares, had previously been January 31 and was changed to March 31. Accordingly, the accounting period for the company in the year under review spans eight months. 4. Items related to accounting policies (1) Valuation standards and method for major assets 1) Valuation standards and methods for negotiable securities i. Bonds to be held to maturity Amortized cost method ii. Other securities a. For which a market value is available Market value method, based on the market price, etc., as of the fiscal year-end (with the entire amount of valuation differences directly included under net assets, and the cost of sales calculated using the moving average method) b. For which a market value is unavailable Moving average cost method  For investments in limited liability investment partnerships and similar associations (considered negotiable securities as per Article 2, Section 2 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act), the net amount corresponding to the ownership portion based on the most recently available documents for the reporting date stipulated in the partnership contract is used. 2) Valuation standards for derivative transactions Market value method 3) Valuation standards and method for inventories Primarily, the individually identified cost method is used (with balance sheet values calculated by writing down book values based on decreased profitability). (2) Depreciation methods for major depreciable assets 1) Property, plant and equipment (excluding lease assets) The declining balance method is used at the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries. (However, the straight-line method is applied for buildings (excluding ancillary equipment) acquired on or after April 1, 1998, as well as for ancillary equipment and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016.) The straight-line method is primarily applied at overseas consolidated subsidiaries. The primary years of useful life are as follows: Buildings and structures 3–50 years Annual Report 2017 61 2) Intangible assets (excluding lease assets) Straight-line method For software used internally, the straight-line method is applied based on the Company’s internal period of useful life (five years). 3) Lease assets Lease assets associated with finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership rights The straight-line method is applied, with the lease period as the period of useful life and a residual value of zero. (3) Accounting standards for significant transactions 1) Allowance for doubtful accounts In order to prepare for losses from the nonrepayment of claims, the estimated irrecoverable amount is recorded. i. General claims Actual default rates are used. ii. Claims for which there is concern of nonrepayment or claims in bankruptcy A financial evaluation is used. 2) Provision for bonuses In order to provide for the payment of bonuses to employees, an amount corresponding to the estimated amount of bonus payments to be made for the fiscal year is recorded. 3) Provision for directors’ bonuses To provide for the payment of bonuses to directors, a provision based on the amount expected to be paid was recorded during the fiscal year under review. 4) Provision for directors’ retirement benefits In order to prepare for the payment of retirement benefits to directors and executive officers (excluding those who are deemed employees under the retirement benefit program), an amount to be paid at the fiscal year-end based on ­internal guidelines is recorded. 5) Provision for loss on guarantees In order to prepare for losses associated with guarantee obligations, the estimated amount of losses at the fiscal yearend is recorded. (4) Accounting treatment for retirement benefits 1) Method of period attribution for anticipated amounts of retirement benefits In calculating retirement benefit obligations, the anticipated amount of retirement benefit obligations is attributed to the period ending in the fiscal year under review as per the benefit formula method. 2) Treatment of expenses for actuarial differences and past service costs Actuarial differences are treated as expenses using the declining balance method over a fixed number of years (7–16 years) that does not exceed employees’average remaining period of service at the time they arise, from the following fiscal year. Past service costs are treated as expenses using the straight-line method over a fixed number of years (5–7 years) that does not exceed employees’average remaining period of service at the time they arise. At certain consolidated subsidiaries, past service costs are treated collectively at the time they arise. 62 Hakuhodo DY holdings (5) Significant hedge accounting methods 1) Method of hedge accounting In principle, deferred hedge accounting is applied. However, designation accounting is applied for forward foreign ­exchange transactions that meet the requirements for designation accounting. 2) Hedging methods and scope of hedging Forward foreign exchange transactions are used to hedge foreign currency-denominated monetary claims and obligations and scheduled foreign currency transactions. 3) Hedging policy To effectively manage risks, forward foreign exchange transactions are used to manage risks from exchange rate movements in foreign currency-denominated transactions, based on internal guidelines. 4) Method for evaluating effectiveness of hedging For forward foreign exchange transactions, the major terms of the hedged transaction and the hedging transaction are the same and the transactions are deemed to have a high degree of correlation, and the effectiveness is not determined. (6) Amortization method and period for goodwill Goodwill is amortized in equal amounts over a rational number of years not exceeding 20, by determining the period for which an investment effect will occur on an individual item basis. (7) Scope of cash included in the consolidated statements of cash flows Cash on hand, deposits available on demand, and short-term investments with maturities of up to three months that are highly liquid, easy to convert, and have little risk of price fluctuation (8) Other significant items in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements Accounting treatment for consumption taxes, etc. Consumption tax and regional consumption taxes are excluded. Changes in Accounting Policies Following the revisions to the Corporation Tax Act, the Practical Solution on a Change in Depreciation Method Due to Tax Reform 2016 (PITF No.32, June 17, 2016) has been adopted in the fiscal year under review. Accordingly, the depreciation method for ancillary equipment and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016 has been changed from the declining balance method to the straight-line method. The effect of this change on operating income, ordinary income, and income before income taxes is minimal. Annual Report 2017 63 Change in Presentation (Consolidated statements of income) In light of the lack of significance of provision of allowance for doubtful accounts included under extraordinary loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, this item is now included under other from the fiscal year under review. To reflect this change in presentation, the consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year have been similarly reclassified. As a result, the ¥494 million of provision of allowance for doubtful accounts and ¥92 million of other shown under extraordinary loss in the consolidated statements of income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, have been reclassified as ¥586 million of other. Notes (Consolidated balance sheets) Note 1. Pledged assets and secured liabilities Fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 Cash and time deposits totaling ¥1,297 million and investment securities totaling ¥10 million have been provided as trade ­guarantees, etc. Fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 Cash and time deposits totaling ¥1,205 million have been provided in place of guarantee monies. In addition, investment securities totaling ¥10 million have been provided as trade g ­ uarantees, etc. Note 2. Inventories Fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 The Group’s inventories comprise a broad range of various copyrights related to advertising operations and expenses related to operations in progress, and appropriate classifications are not possible. They are therefore shown as a lump sum. Fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 Same as the fiscal year under review Note 3. Amounts corresponding to nonconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are as follows: Fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 Investment securities (stocks) ¥9,540 million Other assets (capital) ¥6,908 million Fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 Investment securities (stocks) ¥10,930 million Other assets (capital) ¥7,784 million Note 4. Incidental obligations Fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 The Company has ¥103 million in guarantee obligations for bank borrowings under the home financing plan for ­employees. Fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 The Company has ¥236 million in guarantee obligations for bank borrowings under the home financing plan for ­employees. 64 Hakuhodo DY holdings (Consolidated statements of income) Note 1. Write-downs of inventories held for sale in the ordinary course of business due to decreased profitability Fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 Cost of sales ¥879 million Fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 Cost of sales ¥248 million Note 2. Gain on sales of noncurrent assets Fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 Property, plant and equipment Buildings and structures — Others (vehicles and transport equipment) ¥2 million Others (tools and equipment) ¥0 million Intangible assets Software — Total ¥3 million Fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 Property, plant and equipment Buildings and structures ¥12 million Others (vehicles and transport equipment) ¥23 million Others (tools and equipment) ¥0 million Intangible assets Software ¥0 million Total ¥37 million Note 3.

Loss on retirement of noncurrent assets Fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 Property, plant and equipment Buildings and structures ¥21 million Others (machinery) — Others (vehicles and transport equipment) — Others (tools and equipment) ¥9 million Others (lease assets) ¥14 million Intangible assets Software ¥75 million Total ¥120 million Fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 Property, plant and equipment Buildings and structures ¥49 million Others (machinery) ¥0 million Others (vehicles and transport equipment) ¥0 million Others (tools and equipment) ¥21 million Others (lease assets) — Intangible assets Software ¥188 million Total ¥259 million Note 6. Impairment loss Fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 The Hakuhodo Group recorded impairment losses regarding the following asset groups. Shares Place Purpose Type Amount Property, plant and equipment and other assets ¥0 million Software ¥134 million Japan Business assets, etc. Goodwill ¥102 million Intangible assets and other assets ¥112 million United States Business assets Intangible assets and other assets ¥321 million Software ¥20 million Other Business assets, etc. Goodwill ¥68 million Intangible assets and other assets ¥32 million The Group conducts grouping for business assets based on a single unit company, which is regarded as the minimum unit that generates cash flows that are mostly independent from cash flows of other assets and asset groups. In addition, idle assets and rental property assets are grouped by individual property. As the profits that were expected from business assets could no longer be forecast during the year under review, asset book value declined to the recoverable amount, and that decrease was recorded as an impairment loss of ¥793 million. Also, the recoverable amount for each asset group is calculated by estimating the value in use and applying a discount rate of 11.8%–18.5% to future cash flows. However, the recoverable amount for asset groups with no foreseeable cash flows is estimated at zero. Fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 The importance is insignificant, and this section is therefore eliminated. 66 Hakuhodo DY holdings Note 7.

Items related to financial instruments Fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 (1) Policy for dealing in financial instruments The Group purchases financial assets as investments with an emphasis on security and liquidity, and procures funds using methods that take into account stability, economy, and flexibility, in light of the Group’s funds and financial market conditions. Derivative transactions are used to avoid the risks mentioned below, and are not used for speculative purposes. (2) Details and risks of financial instruments Notes and accounts receivable–trade—the Group’s operating claims—expose the Group to the credit risk of the customer. Foreign currency-denominated operating claims also expose the Group to exchange rate risk, but this risk is in principle diminished by the profit or loss arising from the hedged foreign currency-denominated operating obligation. Securities and investment securities are primarily bonds to be held to maturity or shares of companies that have a business relationship with the Group, and expose the Group to risk from market price fluctuations. Notes and accounts payable–trade—the Group’s operating obligations—are mostly payable within one year. Foreign currency-denominated operating obligations expose the Group to exchange rate risk as noted above. Borrowings are primarily short-term borrowings for working capital. A portion of long-term borrowings has floating interest rates, and therefore expose the Group to risk from interest rate fluctuations. The Group’s derivative transactions are forward foreign exchange transactions used to reduce the risk from exchange rate movements in foreign currency-denominated transactions. Hedging methods and the scope of hedging, hedging policy, and the method for evaluating the effectiveness of hedging with regard to hedge accounting are included in the preceding“Method of Preparation for Consolidated and Nonconsolidated Financial Statements; 4. Items related to accounting policies (5) Significant hedge accounting methods.” (3) Risk management structure for financial instruments 1) Credit risk (risk associated with breach of contract by counterparty) management The Group’s risk management for operating claims is carried out by the department responsible for accounting based on internal accounting regulations. The department prevents the emergence of nonrecoverable claims by setting a credit limit for each obligor, thoroughly managing outstanding payment dates for claims, and regularly monitoring the financial condition of obligors. Bonds to be held to maturity are limited to highly rated bonds based on internal fund management Annual Report 2017 73 regulations, and credit risk is therefore negligible. Derivative transactions are only entered into with highly rated financial institutions in order to reduce counterparty risk. 2) Market risk (risk associated with foreign exchange and other rate fluctuations) management The Group’s foreign currency-denominated operating claims and obligations create exposure to risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, but this risk is in principle diminished by the profit or loss arising from the hedged asset or liability. Forward foreign exchange transactions are used to hedge certain risks, and the execution and management of these derivative transactions is carried out by the department responsible for financing based on internal financing regulations. For stocks, the market value of the shares and financial position of the issuer (counterparty company) are regularly monitored, and the continued holding of the shares is reevaluated in light of the relationship with the counterparty company. 3) Management of liquidity risk (risk of not being able to make payment on payment date) associated with fund procurement The Group manages liquidity risk by having the department responsible for financing at each company raise short-term funds, and prepares a mediumtolong-term funding plan. The Group also uses a liquidity support system in which the Company receives funds from consolidated subsidiaries that have surplus funds and lends funds to consolidated subsidiaries with fund shortfalls. (4) Supplementary information related to market value, etc., of financial instruments The market value of financial instruments is based on the market price, with a rational estimate being used when a market price is not available. The estimation of this amount includes factors that are subject to change, and therefore the use of differing underlying assumptions may result in a different amount.

Overview of retirement benefit plans To fund pension benefits for employees, the Company’ s consolidated subsidiaries use funded and unfunded defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. Defined benefit corporate pension plans (all of which are funded) pay either a lump sum or an annuity based on the employee’ s salary and length of service.

Overview of reporting segments The Company’s business segments are regularly reviewed in light of the separate financial information available from the units that make up the Company, in order for the Board of Directors to allocate management resources and evaluate operating performance. The Group carries out advertising operations in various media, primarily newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and digital media, and provides planning, production, marketing, PR, and other services related to the presentation of advertising. The Company is a holding company, with Hakuhodo Inc., Daiko Advertising Inc., YOMIKO ADVERTISING INC., Hakuhodo DY Media Partners Inc., and kyu as the core operating companies. Each of these core companies has various affiliates, and formulates comprehensive strategies and operates its business to develop and provide services on behalf of the Group. Therefore, the Group is made up of segments constituting the groups organized around the core operating companies. Nevertheless, the advertising-related services noted above constitute the main business of each of these segments, and the economic characteristics, methods of providing and selling services, target markets and customers, and regulatory environment unique to the industry are generally similar. In addition, consolidating these segments can be deemed to facilitate an understanding of the Group’s past performance, and provide appropriate information regarding business activities and the operating environment to appropriately evaluate future cash flow projections. Therefore, the entire Group operates as one consolidated reporting segment. 2.
