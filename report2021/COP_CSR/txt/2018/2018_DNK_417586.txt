International Holding a/s CVR. no. 31 15 85 91 Corporate Social Responsibility 2017 SCHUR INTERNATIONAL HOLDING A/S – CSR REPORTING STATEMENT ON CONTINUED SUPPORT Since Schur in 2015 joined the UN Global Compact, its 10 principles have formed the framework for Schur's efforts for sustainabibility. The latest years' CSR reports have shown the results achieved within the focus areas: Energy, waste, accidents, sick days, CO2 emission as well as equal rights in managements and Boards of Directors. In 2017, Schur initiated the implementation of UN's Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and in continuation hereof handles environment and anti-corruption in accordance with OECD's guidelines for multinational enterprises. Impact analyses have now been carried out in two of the Group's companies. The work confirms that these management tools give both more width and more depth in initiatives and ambitions within the 10 principles. Schur's work to prevent violation of the 48 human rights, initiatives within 20 environmental areas and 12 anti-corruption cases, provide enhanced value both internally and externally. The work further helps to illustrate how Schur can and will work with the 17 global goals. Schur is among the first Danish companies who work on compliance with UN's global minimum standards for responsible conduct of business. Schur is still working with impact analyses in the Group's other companies and will for the first time include the results in the COP reporting for 2019. With this, our third, annual Communication of Progress, it is important for Schur to show our continued support.
