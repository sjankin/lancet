Within the year, we managed to issue premiums for more than 33,000 million pesos and recorded revenues (earned premiums) over 28,600 million pesos. This translates into 29.4% having more than 3.8 million insured units and a market share ROE in the automotive insurance of 31.3% in Mexico. It is important to highlight that during 2017 we achieved profits of 2,064 million pesos, an increase of 58.7%, vis-àvis, 2016 net income. This resulted in an excellent ROE of 29.4%, which means that approximately every 2.5 years, the 92.8% stockholder’s equity would be doubled. combined ratio Our insurance operation outside Mexico has continued to develop and consolidate its operation. Non-insurance subsidiaries continue to give us advantages in costs control and help us have a more efficient operation in the insurance companies. All these subsidiaries presented profits in the year. During 2017, we opened 22 new Quálitas Development Offices (ODQs) in Mexico. This growth in facilities directly impacted the creation of employment sources. For Quálitas, it was a priority that the 1,534 people who joined our staff in 2017 experienced our culture of wellbeing, development, and professionalization at work. For this reason, the contents of Quálitas University were strengthened, which is our maximum initiative to increase their skills, promote their growth and personal fulfillment. We want to guarantee welfare for all our stakeholders and to contribute towards the development of a better insurance and road safety culture so as to maintain a generalized growth in the locations where we operate.

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 In the right direction STRATEGY 22 SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH GRI 102-14 In 2014, we established a program to formally incorporate Social Responsibility and environment protection into the Quálitas culture. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that it was already a successful practice in several departments of the company. Experience has shown us that Social Responsibility requires constant updates and optimization, i.e., it must be incorporated in the constant improvement process of the company. We have taken fundamental steps in the program such as, establishing commitments with all stakeholders that are a part of the company, policyholders and clients, employees, agents, investors, suppliers, community, authorities, and competitors. We are currently in the stage of observing that these commitments are entirely fulfilled. With this objective we have begun the process of establishing information systems, which allows us to know the degree of satisfaction our stakeholders have with respect to the company. In this last stage, we have seen with great satisfaction that the objectives of Social Responsibility and environment protection are useful in our search of the company’s operational quality. Another achievement in 2017 was the entry of Quálitas into the list of companies integrating the Dow Jones Sustainability MILA Pacific Alliance Index, forming part of the sustainability indexes of Dow Jones. To access the MILA sustainability index, we have voluntarily participated in an evaluation process of our sustainability practices conducted by RobecoSAM, whose methodology compares us with the best in the sector. We are proud to be one of the twelve Mexican companies integrating this relevant sustainability ranking of the region2. Undoubtedly, this demonstrates to us that we are in the right direction to achieve our purpose of creating value. 2 The Pacific Alliance is integrated by the stock markets of Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Colombia. CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 In the right direction STRATEGY 23 On the other hand, we seek to implement the 4 Principles for Sustainable Insurance because even though we are not official signatories, we integrate environmental, social, and governance aspects into our management, trying to raise awareness about these issues to all our stakeholders. As part of our responsibility to our stakeholders, in September 2017 we helped affected communities after the earthquakes in Mexico. In a spirit of solidarity together with our agents, business partners, employees, and board members, we collected monetary and in-kind donations in order to help the victims. The company doubled what was collected in those campaigns. In general terms, we started 2017 facing a complex socioeconomic context that left serious social and economic uncertainties for 2018; however, we are confident that the professional and ethical capacity of those integrating our company will allow us to solve such challenges and have a successful year, keeping our prestige as a reliable and innovative company. We invite you to continue reading this second Consolidated Annual Report, which has been prepared based on the methodology of the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) Standards. This is a communication practice that we adopt and consolidate in each financial year to present relevant, accurate, comparable, and reliable information about our financial and non-financial results. In the right direction Juan Orozco y Gómez Portugal Chairman of the Social Responsibility Committee CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 In the right direction STRATEGY 24 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY MODEL In addition to our business model, at Quálitas we have a Corporate Social Responsibility Model which comes from the desire to contribute to the economic and social development of our environment, assuming, in the same way, the challenge that represents the preservation of the environment for our wellbeing and that of future generations. Our Corporate Social Responsibility Model is made up of 3 action pillars, for which a series of performance indicators have been established. This allows us to monitor the impact of each implemented initiative.

VALUE ACTIONS WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS GRI 102-13, FS16 As part of the activities that help us connect with our stakeholders, we promote initiatives for the benefit of a more informed and prepared society, immersed in a financial and insurance culture, positively impacting their life quality. Among the diffusion actions carried out from May to December 2017, we conducted a communication campaign among the ODQs, that was focused on the promotion of an Insurance Culture. The topics of such campaign were: • What is auto insurance? • What are the coverages? • What is a deductible? • What are the premiums? We also continued with the initiative Quálitas Road Safety Campaign, a campaign that promotes good driving practices to ensure the integrity of the drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, or any other person using public roads3. 3 For more information please refer to the chapter 03 Challenges: turning hardships into opportunities and visit www.conductavialqualitas.net CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 In the right direction STRATEGY 29 On the other hand, we made available mobile apps and service portals through which we innovate in terms of digitalization and get closer to new generations. Throughout the year, we worked internally with each department to define and understand what we call “critical moments” or “moments of truth” with the stakeholders. The purpose of this exercise is to improve the quality of the interaction from an operational approach. With regards to the institutional relationships, in 2017 Quálitas maintained a tight relationship with Mexican Association of Insurance Institutions (Asociación Mexicana de Instituciones de Seguros A.C., AMIS, as per its acronym in Spanish) and the Coordinating Office of Insured Risks (Oficina Coordinadora de Riesgos Asegurados S.C., OCRA, as per its acronym in Spanish) in order to work on the intellectual and cultural growth of the sector. It should be noted that the relationship with our stakeholders is not only carried out through planned procedures and formal communication channels, but their immediate needs are constantly monitored to be able to respond, to the extent of our possibilities, to the situations that arise. In September 2017, Mexican society experienced a couple of earthquakes of significant magnitude. Faced with this situation, Quálitas carried out a series of actions to support the people affected by the earthquakes, including our employees. As a response to this situation, Quálitas implemented an internal campaign to help the affected communities, where the company matched the contributions from its employees, agents, office directors, and board members. This amount was thereafter sent to a nonprofit organization which, in turn, also matched the amount. The contribution raised with this campaign was 4.5 million pesos which were used for housing reconstruction projects in affected communities. CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 In the right direction STRATEGY 30 Quálitas supports the development of the most vulnerable communities in terms of education, health, environment, through assistance to efficient nonprofit organizations which have demonstrated their concern for the wellbeing of others. The process for granting donations requires complying with certain requirements and presenting documentation that is analyzed by personnel specialized in the topic and to be presented to the Social Responsibility Committee. Within the year, we supported nonprofit organizations having an impact in Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Jalisco, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Chihuahua, Puebla, Baja California, Guanajuato, Yucatán and Guerrero.

For this, the Quálitas DNA campaign was designed with the purpose of having the company’s values embraced by all members of this organization and making them their own. This campaign, which began in August 2017 and will conclude in June 2018, has been spread to all the offices of Quálitas in Mexico, El Salvador and Costa Rica, and it targets the employees and service offices’ employees. We have relied on printed and electronic media for its diffusion. At the end of 2017, we launched the new complaint channel to report anomalies or illegal acts observed in the company. The channel is called Q Transparencia. One of the features of this new mechanism relies on the fact that its operation is managed by an external service provider with experience in the matter. Through a communication campaign, we emphasized that the confidentiality of the tool is guaranteed due to it being operated by a third party; as well as CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 In the right direction STRATEGY 32 the possibility of maintaining the anonymity during the complaint process, if so desired by the user.

The total written premium increased by 12% regardless of the sales decrease of new cars in Mexico and of the adjustments in premiums, increasing in most cases, as part of the profitability strategy. However, in the breakdown by segment, the individual and fleets segments, which are mainly distributed through agents and are annual policies, reported a higher growth than the total. On the opposite side, the automotive financing institutions, which mainly issue multiannual policies and obtain higher commissions, reported a decrease. CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 In the right direction PROFITABILITY 43 Costs and Operating Result As a result of the combination of sales by segment, the cost of acquisition or commissions paid to our intermediaries had an lower increase than written premium and grew less than revenues did; thus, recording a positive margin. The most relevant cost for the company had a higher increase than earned premium. The claims cost was affected by the high level of inflation in Mexico (6.77%), by the significant increase in vehicle robberies (26.8%), volatility in the exchange rate impacting the price of vehicle spare parts, as well as meteorological and catastrophic events which caused heavy rains, hail, floods, etc. and which increased the number of reported claims. Several cost control measures helped cushion the effect of the aforementioned events. Such measures include: • Use of satellite tracking devices to control vehicle robbery and technological devices to avoid collisions • Implementation of the “Ajuste Exprés” (Express Adjustment, a remote claims assistance without the need of a claims officer attending to the site of the accident which applies exclusively for cases that meet specific conditions) CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 In the right direction PROFITABILITY 44 • Physical inspection requirement for insuring certain vehicles • Negotiation of fixed-cost medical care packages with medical providers • Repair shop certification program to guarantee service quality and competitive costs • Chatbots or robots answering written conversations with policyholders in call center.
