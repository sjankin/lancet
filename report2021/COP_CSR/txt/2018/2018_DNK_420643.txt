We CSR REPORT 2017 achieve more and more renewable energy coming especially from wind, solar and biomass sources. In our CSR report, we have chosen to include the economic, environmental and social arenas, PROJECTS AND EXPECTATIONS FOR 2017 which are important to Brdr. Møller. In 2017, we have participated in several exciting We have selected these based on two conditions projects, including working with Gellerupparken. namely, partly based on materiality Several of these projects which we have been considerations, partly on the basis of their working on during 2016 and 2017 are now being importance to our stakeholders and their completed or is expected to be completed in the possibilities to be able to assess and make beginning of 2018, giving space to new projects and decisions. challenges.

Page 8 OUR OBJECTIVES AND GOALS In 2015 we drafted 3 core objectives for the period ENVIRONMENT 2015-2020, which is our strategic time horizon: 7. Businesses should support a precautionary CSR, GROWTH AND QUALITY approach to environmental challenges 8. The company should take the initiative to On two of the strategic objectives, we have seen promote greater environmental solid progress – CSR and QUALITY. With regard to responsibility our third objective – growth – we have not yet 9. Businesses should encourage the achieved all of our objectives, but are still working development and diffusion of intensively to comply with this part of our strategic environmentally friendly technologies objectives. On, for example. turnover, we have seen the biggest turnover in the company's history – close ANTI-CORRUPTION to 100 million DKK so we are well on our way with regard to this part of our strategic objectives as well. 10. Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and In 2016, we also connected the UN call to support bribery the so-called World Goals. In particular we have been aware of pursuing goal no. 3 (Health and WellGRI STANDARDS being), goal 7 (Sustainable Energy) and goal no. 13(Climate Action). In addition, we have also We have also joined the Global Reporting agreed on the ten principles of the UN Global Initiatives (GRI) standards for our CSR Compact program. They oblige us to ensure human reporting. In addition, we are certified according rights, labour standards, the environment and the to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001, and we have fight against corruption. The 10 principles, which we also incorporated the requirements of ISO 9001 fully support, include: into our quality work, even though we are not certified in accordance with this standard.

These two sources now accounts for 45.8% of the power that is supplied in the Danish electricity grid. The power plants, which produce the electricity we receive is still based on coal-fired power plants, but more and more are gradually changing their production to biofuels. In total our energy consumption amounted to 67,235 kwh. This is a reduction of our energy consumption in 2016 by 338 kwh. This consumption resulted in emissions of climate gases and created a series of miscellaneous residues, as seen from the enclosed numbers shown below.

Danish CHP plants produce both electricity and heat, and we must therefore separate the environmental impacts between these two. By the125% method, it is assumed that heat produced is undertaken with an efficiency of125% (heat impact method). In connection with the transport of electricity between the CHP plant and the customer, there is a loss, partly by the actual transport by cable (the transmission network) and, second, by the ensuing distribution to the consumer (distribution network). These losses are also included in the figures. Transmission loss is already recognized, while the loss in distribution is estimated at 5% of the electricity that is sent via cables. The figures were included in the calculation, based on average figures, on the other hand, in the case of calculated sizes. In connection with the inventory of greenhouse gas emissions these are measured in terms of CO2 equivalents. This occurs because the effect of individual greenhouse gases are very DEVELOPMENT IN EMISSIONS 2016-2017 different. Thus, for example, emissions of CH4 and N2O are more harmful as to the greenhouse effect In order to give an impression of our emissions the table below than CO2 emissions. This is done so that emission of show the developments from 2016-2017. As can be seen our these gases weighs higher than CO2, where emissionsdecreased sharply for the vast majority of gases/substances. In particular, we see that our emissions of CH4, for example carries a weight of 25, while N2O CO2 equivalents decreased by a good 25%. are weighted with 298. 1 kg of CH4 is therefore 25 times more damaging than that of1 kg of CO2, etc. ART 2016 2017 DIFFERENCE Reduction in % CO2-EQUIVALENTS 17.579 C0 2-ækvi. 13.030 CO2-ækvi 4.549 CO2-ækvi 25,9 % SO2 2,87 kg 2,44 kg 0,43 kg 15 % NOX 12,06 kg 11,71 kg 0,35 kg 2,9 % CO 8,76 kg 10,06 kg 1,3 kg 14,8 % NVOMC 1,24 kg 1,24 kg 0 kg 0% PARTICLES 0,39 kg 0,39 kg 0 kg 0% COALFLYASHES 614,9 kg 425,3 kg 189,6 kg 30,8 % COAL SLAG 97,3 kg 68,2 kg 29,1 kg 30,0 % DESULPHORIZATION 244,9 kg 167,0 kg 77,9 kg 31,8 % SLAG 532,9 kg 510,2 kg 22,7 kg 4,3 % RGA 85,9 kg 79,9 kg 6,0 kg 7,0 % BIOASHES 78,7 kg 96,6 kg 17,9 kg 22,7 % RADIOACTIVE 3,9 kg 6,9 kg 3,0 kg 76,9 % Page 15 CONSUMPTION OF FUEL The consumption of fuel represents the diesel, such as our off-road diesel, does company's main environmental problem. not require the addition of This consumption comes from nonbiocomponents.

Page 28 SUPPORT FOR GROUPS IN SOCIETY Over the years we have helped to support many different stakeholders in society – sports organizations, environmental organizations, social organizations and many others. In 2017, we also sponsored a number of projects and associations. This applies, among other things to Brabrand If, where we are a Gold sponsor and Brabrand IF Soccer where we have established a sponsorship for Brabrands soccer team. We spent a total of DKK 53,873 in 2017on such activities.

WE HAVE A SOUND FINANCIAL BALANCE, AND WE AIM IN THE FUTURE TO ACHIEVE A RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI), WHICH IS BETWEEN THE INDUSTRY'S THREE HIGHEST IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE. FINANCIAL RESULTS & EXPECTATIONS In 2017, we reversed the previous year's deficit into a positive net profit of 2.8 million. It must be considered as satisfactory. We have experienced a record turnover in the current year, which is now approaching 100 million. DKK. Equity is increased with around 20%, so that it now represents 17.1 million DKK. These are positive trends. It is also reflected in our key performance indicators, so that the return on equity now represents 18%, operating margin is at 4%, while our solidity, measured as the proportion of equity, is at 37%. Return on investment (ROI), calculated as operating profit (before amortization of goodwill)/total assets accounted for a total of 12.7% in 2017. This may also be regarded as satisfactory, if compared with the market rates. We have thus been able to achieve a satisfactory profitability of the total invested capital. The economic expectations for 2018 is on par with the result in 2017. On the other hand, we have slightly lower expectations as to the total turnover. We have completed a number of projects, but there is still a strong economic growth in the Aarhus area, which means that the market is moving in the right direction.

MØLLER BRDR. MØLLER HAS ATTEMPTED TO QUANTIFY ITS 2017 ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS. THESE ARE THE COSTS THAT ARISE, PARTLY AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERNAL ACTIVITIES (INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND HEALTH AND SAFETY COSTS) AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, COSTS THAT OCCURS IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AS A RESULT OF OUR ACTIVITIES (EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS). SOME OF THESE COSTS ARE EASY TO DETECT THROUGH INVOICES, OTHERS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. HOWEVER, AS WE CONSIDER IT IMPORTANT ALSO TO ESTABLISH FINANCIAL GOALS FOR THE RESOURCES WE USE, AND THE IMPACT OUR ACTIVITIES HAVE WE THEREFORE CONSIDER IT IMPERATIVE TO WORK WITH ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AS A MEANS IN OUR TOOLBOX. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS – FUEL ETC. In 2016, we focused on assessing our environmental ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS COMMUTING costs. We also do so in the CSR report for 2017.
