Likewise, the CDP climate ranking awarded HOCHTIEF a positive assessment for its sustainability performance. We aim to cement our industry-leading position in sustainability and innovation and expand it in a targeted manner. We are actively developing our Group as a global infrastructure provider.

Despite this, the process of building new or extending existing routes creates construction sites that result in temporary inconveniences, such as noise, dust, and road closures. As part of our project work, we do our best to minimize the effects, although sometimes we cannot eliminate them completely. To ensure that we involve all those affected as fully as possible, we inform stakeholders about current construction work at an early stage and engage them in the process. That’s exactly what CPB Contractors is doing with Melbourne’s CityLink Tulla Widening project to upgrade a section of the freeway leading to the airport. Regular information events are staged in addition to meetings for residents within the project’s core area. Community managers not only address residents directly but also make use of public communication channels. In this way, obstacles can be overcome before construction gets under way. 28 Group Report 2017 Strategy Positioned for the future This is the foundation on which our workforce makes HOCHTIEF is a global infrastructure group with leading HOCHTIEF’s success possible.

HOCHTIEF aims to afford shareholders their commensurate share in the Group’s positive earnings performance.

Group Report 2017 47 Group Management Report MOVING PEOPLE Expanding Copenhagen’s infrastructure, especially its local public transport system, is an ambitious large-scale project. It includes building a subway ring, parts of which have already been completed, to further ease the city’s strained traffic situation. As part of a joint venture, HOCHTIEF is responsible for constructing the Nordhavn connector. The work includes building two tunnel tubes approximately 1,600 and 1,800 meters long, plus the Nordhavn subway station, to be delivered on a turnkey basis by 2020. Space constraints due to the construction site’s downtown location pose logistical challenges. But HOCHTIEF is right on track: In the reporting year, excavation of the second tunnel was also successfully completed. In the future, driverless trains will glide through the tunnels, transporting several thousand people at three-and-a-half-minute intervals. 48 Group Report 2017 Financial Review Overview change rate effects the increase would have even HOCHTIEF’s financial performance in 2017 has continued amounted to 12%. the very positive development seen in the last years.

Group Report 2017 57 Financial events 2017—CIMIC Group Ltd. CIMIC continues to have a good standing in the international capital market. One indicator of this is the improved classification of CIMIC Group Limited in the investment grade rating segment. External rating agency S&P upgraded CIMIC’s rating by one level from BBBto BBB. In August 2017, rating agency Moody’s likeGroup Management Report wise raised the rating by one level from Baa3 to Baa2. The rating agencies gave the continued strong liquidity and solid market position in the Australian infrastructure construction and contract mining business as the reason for their decisions. As before, borrowing activities are carried out by the holding company on a bilateral or syndicated basis. The HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division, whose operating activities are conducted by the CIMIC Group, successfully refinanced and expanded its existing syndicated working capital cash facility in September 2017 as part of its long-term financing strategy. The new syndicated working capital cash facility is for EUR 1.7 billion (AUD 2.6 billion), split across two tranches of three and five years. It replaces the existing EUR 652 million (AUD 1 billion) facility, which matured in December 2017, as well as a portion of the CIMIC Group’s bilateral cash facilities and some maturing U.S. dollar debt. The refinancing was heavily oversubscribed due to a strong response from lenders in Australia and Asia, allowing the facility to be upsized. 58 Group Report 2017 Group Management Report: Financial Review Summary assessment of the business situation Report on relations with affiliated companies by the Chairman of the Executive Board in accordance with Section 312 of the German HOCHTIEF increased its earnings significantly in 2017 Stock Corporations Act (AktG) and improved operational net profit (excluding one-off As there is no control agreement with our major shareimpacts) to EUR 452 million, raising it EUR 90 million or holder ACS Actividades de Construcción y Servicios S. 25% year on year.

SupGroup Management Report plementary to this, the Supervisory Board has reserved the right, in addition to the fixed annual salary and the variable compensation components, to grant at its own discretion a one-off payment for exceptional perform­ ance. The contracts also provide for normal fringe benefits (private use of company car, accident insurance, etc.). There is no cap on the amount of any one-off payment for exceptional performance or on the value of fringe benefits because it does not appear necessary for such amounts to be capped in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Code recommendation and, in our legal appraisal, the Code recommendation does not extend to this. For the same reason, such payments and benefits are not covered by any cap on the amount of overall compensation.

This is a project like no other in the world: HOCHTIEF has built a tunnel system to accommodate the European XFEL X-ray laser deep under the city of Hamburg, 36 meters underground. Every millimeter of its 3.4 kilometers had to be built precisely to specification, as the high-tech equipment does not tolerate deviations. The HOCHTIEF team completed the tunnel system ahead of schedule and under budget, so the world’s largest and most powerful X-ray laser was up and running in 2017. It produces ultra-short light flashes—27,000 per second. Designed to help scientists tap into new research possibilities and gain insights into previously unseen processes, the laser is to make atomic details of viruses and cells visible. This is expected to yield new findings for fields such as cancer research. 98 Group Report 2017 This chapter is part of Focus Area Sustainable Products and Services Research and Development Innovative power adds value The use of virtual reality tools on construction sites > For further information on R&D and innovation Most of the infrastructure projects we carry out for our therefore is one of HOCHTIEF’s long-term goals. projects, please see clients worldwide are unique and require us to develop www.hochtief.com/rd and implement project-specific proposals.

Group Report 2017 103 Group Management Report PRACTICING SAFETY Safety and health protection are the top priorities in all HOCHTIEF’s activities—so our employees and those of our subcontractors can get home safe and sound at the end of each day. To keep this issue at the forefront of everyone’s minds, numerous initiatives, from Occupational Safety Day through health and safety inspections all the way to healthcare fairs, are held during the course of the year. In 2017, a rescue-at-heights training session was conducted in Frankfurt in collaboration with the city’s fire department. The drill on the HOCHTIEF Marienturm project in Frankfurt was an impressive demonstration of how fast a person can be rescued from a height of 60 meters—provided that all those involved are thoroughly trained and the process can proceed in a controlled manner. This is yet another area that highlights the vital importance of good organization at construction sites. 104 Group Report 2017 This chapter is part of Focus Area Attractive Working Environment Employees The foundation of our success Human resources strategy Number of employees at HOCHTIEF by division Our business segments’ success is built fundamentally (as of the reporting date)1) Footnotes to chart:  HOCHTIEF Group 1) Total workforce: All persons on our employees’ expertise, skills, dedication, and  HOCHTIEF Americas who are employed by a fully teamwork in a spirit of trust.

This is why a number of waterways in Germany are currently being upgraded and modernized. The Moselle River is a case in point. HOCHTIEF is working on a second lock chamber in Trier that will be larger than the existing one, to be completed by 2019. Due to water traffic bottlenecks, upgrading the infrastructure on the Moselle is a top transport policy priority as it will offer major benefits for the economy and the environment. The project is on schedule—good news for improving tomorrow’s carbon footprint.

Group Report 2017 119 Overall assessment of future developments The positive outlook for 2018 is also reflected in our expectations for HOCHTIEF’s key performance indicators. For the HOCHTIEF Group, we additionally expect an operational net profit in the range of EUR 470­– 520 million for 2018. This represents an increase of 4–15% on 2017, with all our divisions likely driving this further Group Management Report improvement in our Group performance. We aim for a solid increase in our net cash position, subject to capital allocation. Once again in 2018, we will maintain our focus on safety as the precondition unterlying HOCHTIEF’s guiding principles. In this way, we want to further improve the lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) and achieve a target of 0.9 over the long term. Dividend HOCHTIEF retains its policy of affording shareholders their commensurate share in the success of the business. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft are proposing to distribute an ordinary dividend of EUR 3.38 per share for 2017.

The Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft released the financial statements for publication on February 20, 2018. They will be approved at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 21, 2018. Consolidated Financial Statements Scope of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements generally include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft as well as all German and foreign subsidiaries that are controlled directly or indirectly. This generally goes hand in hand with a majority shareand Notes holding. Ten companies are fully consolidated by virtue of contractual arrangements. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Companies in which HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft holds a majority of voting rights but over which it exercises joint control by contractual arrangement with other parties are likewise accounted for using the equity method unless classified as joint operations. Holdings in subsidiaries or associated companies or joint ventures deemed to be of minor overall significance from a Group perspective are not consolidated and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39. A number of the subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements make partial use of the exempting provisions in either Section 264 (3) or Section 264b of the German Commercial Code. A list of the companies that make use of these exemptions is included in Note 44. 164 Group Report 2017 The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 include HOCHTIEF Aktien­ gesellschaft and a total of 51 German and 401 foreign consolidated companies as well as four special-purpose investment funds (Spezialfonds). The number of consolidated companies decreased by 33 compared with the previous year. The number of special-­purpose investment funds stayed the same. A total of one German and 27 foreign companies were consolidated for the first time in the reporting year. The additions were in the HOCHTIEF Americas division (16), the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (11), and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (1). A total of five German and 56 foreign companies were removed from the consolidated group. The companies removed from the consolidated group related to the HOCHTIEF Americas division (34), the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (16), and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (11). An entity is generally added to or removed from the consolidated group at the time the equity stake in the entity is acquired or disposed of. Thirty-two affiliated companies of minor overall significance to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were not consolidated. Their combined sales represented less than 1% of consolidated sales. Eighteen domestic and 134 foreign associates were accounted for using the equity method. This number declined by a total of 20 companies, with 14 companies added and 34 removed. The additions were in the HOCHTIEF Americas division (7), the HOCHTIEF Europe division (4), and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (3). The removals related to the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division and the HOCHTIEF Americas divisions (17 each). Due to their minor overall significance, a further eleven companies were not accounted for using the equity method. A total of 67 joint operations from the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in relation to the interest in these joint operations. In the reporting year, eleven entities were added and seven removed. Acquisition—UGL Limited On October 10, 2016, the CIMIC Group, through its subsidiary CIMIC Group Investments No. 2 Pty Limited (CGI2), acquired 13.84% of the issued shares in the Australian services company UGL Limited (UGL) and announced in a takeover offer its intention to acquire the shares in UGL that it did not already own at a price of AUD 3.15 per share. CIMIC’s holding was increased to over 50% and UGL consolidated effective November 24, 2016. The holding was subsequently further increased and the acquisition completed on January 20, 2017, with CIMIC thus obtaining Consolidated Financial Statements 100% ownership. The Group’s 2016 consolidated financial statements included provisional fair values for assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination. Purchase price allocation was completed in the second quarter of 2017. Relative to and Notes December 31, 2016, the acquisition date fair value of trade payables increased by EUR 41.1 million, while deferred tax assets rose by EUR 12.3 million. Goodwill increased by EUR 14.4 million and equity decreased by EUR 14.4 million. Group Report 2017 165 Consolidation policies The financial statements of German and foreign companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting principles. All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Business combinations are measured at the acquisition date by allocating the consideration given to the acquired subsidiary’s net assets measured at fair value. Transaction costs arising in connection with such acquisitions are recognized directly as expense. All assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of an acquired subsidiary that satisfy the recognition criteria are measured at full fair value regardless of any non-controlling interest. In accordance with the optional treatment under IFRS 3, non-controlling interest is measured at the acquisition date at either fair value or the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if they are separable from the reporting entity or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Any remaining positive difference is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is not subjected to scheduled amortization, but is tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that the value may be impaired. A remaining negative difference arising from the initial measurement is recognized in profit and loss. On divestment, a pro rata share of the divesting division’s goodwill is taken into account when measuring disposal proceeds. Income, expenses, receivables, and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Unrealized intercompany profits and losses are eliminated unless they are of minor significance. Any impairment losses recognized for consolidated companies that are included in the consolidated financial statements are reversed. The same policies apply to equity-method investments. These include the Group’s associates and joint ventures. Any goodwill is part of the carrying amount of an investment. Like other goodwill, goodwill on equity-method investments is not subject to scheduled amortization. Reductions in carrying amount due to impairment are included in the share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures. The financial statements of all equity-­ method investments are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting policies. Non-current assets held for sale In view of the intention to sell, mining assets of PT Thiess Contractors Indonesia (HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division) are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 as assets held for sale. Accordingly, the assets are classified presented Consolidated Financial Statements separately in the balance sheet. The table below shows the major classes of assets held for sale.

Exchange gains or losses up to the reporting date on the measurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets or liabilities are included in other operating income or other operating expenses at the average exchange rate on the reporting date. Currency translation differences relating to a net investment in a foreign company are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income until the company is sold. This includes foreign currency receivables from fully consolidated Group companies for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which therefore resemble equity. Financial statements of foreign companies are translated by applying the functional currency approach. As all companies outside the euro zone operate autonomously in their own national currencies, their balance sheet items are translated into euros using the average exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date in accordance with official requirements. The same method is used to translate the shareholders’ equity of equity-method foreign associates following equity-method adjustment. Differences from the previous year’s translated amount are recognized in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on sale of the equity interest. Goodwill of commercially independent foreign Group entities is translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated into euros using the annual average exchange rate. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2017 167 Accounting policies Intangible assets are reported at amortized cost. All intangible assets have a finite useful life with the exception of company names recognized as assets on initial consolidation and of goodwill. Intangible assets include concessions and other licenses with useful lives of up to 30 years. These are amortized according to the pattern of consumption of economic benefits. They also include future earnings from additions to the order backlog arising from business acquisitions; these are amortized over the period in which the corresponding work is billed. Intangible assets further encompass software for commercial and engineering applications, which is amortized on a straightline basis over three to five years, and entitlements to various financing arrangements with banks amortized over a maximum of seven years in accordance with the term of the arrangement. Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually. Company names and goodwill are not subject to scheduled amortization. They are tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that they may be impaired. The company names recognized in the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific divisions were classified as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life as they do not have a product life cycle and are not subject to technical, technological, or commercial depletion or any other restriction. Capitalized development costs are reported in intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over five years. Property, plant and equipment is stated at its cost less accumulated depreciation. Only amounts directly attributable to an item of property, plant or equipment are included in its cost. Borrowing costs are included in cost in the case of qualifying assets. Property, plant and equipment is normally depreciated on a straight-line basis, except in the contract mining business, where depreciation is mostly recognized on an activity basis. Items of property, plant, machinery, and equipment typically encountered in the HOCHTIEF Group are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following Group-wide uniform useful lives: No. of years Buildings and investment properties 20–50 Consolidated Financial Statements Technical equipment and machinery; transportation equipment 3–10 Other equipment and office equipment 3–8 Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually. and Notes Items of property, plant and equipment classified as finance leases are recognized at fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or over a shorter contract term if applicable. 168 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the consolidated financial statements Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Transaction costs are included on initial measurement. The fair values of investment properties are disclosed in the Notes. The fair values are measured using internationally accepted valuation methods, such as taking comparable properties as a guide to current market prices or by applying the discounted cash flow method. As with property, plant and equipment, investment properties are normally depreciated using the straight-line method. Impairment losses are recognized for intangible assets (including goodwill), property, plant and equipment, or investment properties if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is defined as fair value less cost of disposal or value in use, whichever is higher. Impairment testing may require assets and, in some cases, liabilities to be grouped into cash-generating units. For goodwill, impairment testing is performed on cash-generating units corresponding to the HOCHTIEF divisions that feature in segmental reporting. For any asset that is part of an independent cash-generating unit, impairment is determined with reference to the recoverable amount of the unit. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit falls below its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to any goodwill belonging to the unit and then to the unit’s other assets, normally pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. Except in the case of goodwill, impairment charges are reversed (up to a maximum of amortized cost) when the impairment ceases to exist. A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. The parties to a joint arrangement classify it as a joint operation or a joint venture depending on their respective rights and obligations. In a joint operation, the parties have direct rights to the assets and direct obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Each party recognizes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, in relation to its interests in a joint operation, relative to the HOCHTIEF Group’s rights and obligations. In a joint venture, where the parties have rights to the net assets arising from the arrangement, the parties each account for their interests in the joint venture using the equity method. Equity-method investments are stated at cost, comprising the acquired equity interest in an associate or joint venture plus any goodwill. The carrying amount is increased or decreased annually to recognize the Group’s share of after-tax profits or losses, any dividends, and other changes in equity. The full carrying amount is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. If the recoverable amount Consolidated Financial Statements of an equity-method investment is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss. and Notes Group Report 2017 169 All other financial assets, comprising interests in non-consolidated subsidiaries, other participating interests, and non-current securities, are classed as available for sale and are measured at fair value where a fair value can be reliably estimated. In the case of publicly listed financial assets, fair value is determined as the market price. If there is no active market, fair value is calculated using the most recent market transactions or a valuation method such as the discounted cash flow method. In cases where fair value cannot be measured reliably, financial assets are reported at cost (less any impairments). Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date. Unrealized gains or losses are accounted for, after adjusting for deferred taxation, in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on disposal of the asset. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an asset is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost. Long-term loans are stated at amortized cost. Loans yielding interest at normal market rates are reported at face value, and non-interest-bearing and low-interest-bearing loans are discounted to present value. Discounting is always done using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Receivables and other assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). An impairment loss is recognized if there is any objective material evidence that a financial asset may be impaired. Objective evidence for impairment includes, for example, downgrading of a debtor’s credit rating and related interruptions in payment or potential insolvency. Impairment losses are recognized according to actual credit risk. “Receivables” comprise financial receivables, trade receivables, and other receivables. Sales are shown net of VAT and other taxes and expected reductions such as trade discounts and rebates. Sales of goods are recognized when: • The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer • The HOCHTIEF Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold • The amount of revenue and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably • It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the HOCHTIEF Group. Revenue from transactions involving the rendering of services is recognized by reference to the stage of completion. Consolidated Financial Statements Revenue under construction contracts is recognized as described in the following. and Notes 170 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the consolidated financial statements Construction contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion (POC) method. Cumulative work done to date, including the Group’s share of net profit, is reported under sales on a pro rata basis according to the percentage completed. The percentage of completion is measured by reference to the stage of completion; that is, as the ratio of performance delivered up to the end of the reporting period to total contract performance. Construction contracts are reported in trade receivables and trade payables, as “Gross amount due from/to customers for/ from contract work (POC).” If cumulative work done to date (contract costs plus contract net profit) on contracts in progress exceeds progress payments received, the difference is recognized as an asset and included in amounts due from customers for contract work. If the net amount after deduction of progress payments received is negative, the difference is recognized as a liability and included in amounts due to customers from contract work. Anticipated losses on specific contracts are accounted for on the basis of the identifiable risks. Construction contracts handled by construction joint ventures are also accounted for using the POC method. Trade receivables from construction joint ventures include pro rata entitlements to contract net profit. Anticipated losses are immediately recognized in full in contract net profit. Contract income on construction contracts undertaken by the Group independently or in construction joint ventures is recognized in accordance with IAS 11 as the income stipulated in the contract plus any claims and variation orders. Construction contract receivables are realized within one operating cycle at the HOCHTIEF Group. In accordance with IAS 1, they are therefore included in current assets even though they are not expected to be realized in full within twelve months of the balance sheet date. The POC method is primarily used in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and contract mining. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the IFRS accounts and tax base of individual Group companies or as a result of consolidation are recognized as separate assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax refund entitlements resulting from the anticipated use of existing tax loss carryforwards in subsequent years provided it is sufficiently certain that they will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset within each company or tax group. Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of tax rates applying or expected to apply in each country when they are realized. For domestic operations, as in the prior year, a tax rate of 31.5% is assumed, taking account of corporate income tax plus the German “solidarity surcharge” and the average rate of municipal trade tax faced by Group companies. For all other purposes, deferred taxes are measured on the basis of the tax regulations in force or enacted at the reporting date. Consolidated Financial Statements Inventories are initially stated at cost of purchase or production. Production cost includes costs directly related to the units of production plus an appropriate allocation of materials and production overhead, including production-­ related depreciation charges. Borrowing costs for inventories that are qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost. and Notes Most materials and supplies are measured using first-in-first-out, the rest using weighted average. Inventories are written down to net realizable value if their recoverable amount is less than their carrying amount at the reporting date. Should the recoverable amount of inventories subsequently increase, the resulting gain must be recognized. This is done by reducing materials expense. Group Report 2017 171 Marketable securities are primarily classed as available for sale and measured at fair value. They mainly comprise securities held in special-purpose and investment funds as well as fixed-income securities with a residual term of more than three months at the time of acquisition and where there is no intention to hold the securities to maturity. Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date and includes any transaction costs directly ­attributable to the acquisition of the securities. Unrealized gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on disposal. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an asset is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost. Cash and cash equivalents consist of petty cash, cash balances at banks, and marketable securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition that are subject to insignificant fluctuations in value only. Non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities are measured in accordance with IFRS 5 and presented separately in the current section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. To be classed as assets held for sale, assets must be available for immediate sale and their sale must be highly probable. Assets held for sale can be individual non-current assets, groups of assets held for sale (disposal groups), or discontinued operations. A component of an entity is a discontinued operation if it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a major line of business or geographical area of operations, or if it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Liabilities disposed of with assets in a single transaction are part of a disposal group or discontinued operation. Non-current assets held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortized, and are measured at their carrying amount or at fair value less costs to sell, whichever is lower. Gains or losses arising on the measurement of individual assets held for sale or of disposal groups are reported in the Statement of Earnings under profit or loss from continuing operations until their ultimate disposal. Conversely, gains or losses arising on the measurement of discontinued operations at fair value less costs to sell, profits or losses of discontinued operations, and gains or losses on their disposal are presented sepa­ rately in the Statement of Earnings under profit or loss from discontinued operations. Share-based payment transactions are measured in accordance with IFRS 2. Stock option plans are accounted for Group-wide as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. Provisions for obligations under the Long-term Consolidated Financial Statements Incentive Plans and Top Executive Retention Plans are recognized in the amount of the expected expense that is or was spread over the stipulated waiting period. The fair value of stock options is measured using generally accepted financial models, the value of the plans being determined with the Black/Scholes option pricing model. The specific problem of valuing the plans in question is solved using binomial tree methods. The computations are performed and Notes by an outside appraiser. 172 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the consolidated financial statements Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognized for current and future benefit payments to active and former employees and their surviving dependants. The obligations primarily relate to pension benefits, partly for basic pensions and partly for optional supplementary pensions. Varying from one country to another, the individual benefit obligations are determined for the most part by length of service and pay scales. The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are likewise included in pension provisions due to their pension-like nature. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are computed by the projected unit credit method. This determines the present value of future entitlements, taking into account current and future benefits already known at the reporting date plus anticipated future increases in salaries and pensions and, for the Turner Group, in healthcare costs. The computation is based on actuarial appraisals using biometric accounting principles. Plan assets as defined in IAS 19 are shown separately as deductions from pension obligations. Plan assets comprise assets transferred to pension funds to meet pension obligations, shares in investment funds purchased ­under deferred compensation arrangements, and qualifying insurance policies in the form of pension liability insurance. If the fair value of plan assets is greater than the present value of employee benefits, the difference is­ ­reported—subject to the limit in IAS 19—under other non-current assets. Amounts ensuing from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans are recognized directly in equity in the period during which they arise. The current service cost is reported under personnel costs. The net interest component, comprising the interest element of the increase in pension obligations less the anticipated returns on plan assets (each calculated using the discount factor for the pension obligations), is reported in net investment and interest income. Tax provisions comprise current tax obligations. Income tax provisions are offset against tax refund entitlements if they relate to the same tax jurisdiction and are congruent in nature and timing. Other provisions account for all identifiable obligations as of the reporting date that result from past business transactions or events but are uncertain in their amount and/or settlement date. Provisions are stated at the estimated settlement amount, i.e. after making allowance for price and cost increases, and are not offset against any rights to reimbursement. For obligations with a settlement probability exceeding 50%, the amount set aside is calculated on the basis of the most likely settlement outcome. A provision can only be recognized on the basis of a legal or constructive obligation toward third parties. Non-current provisions are stated at the present value of the Consolidated Financial Statements estimated settlement amount as of the reporting date and reported under non-current liabilities. Liabilities are reported at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). Finance lease liabilities are initially recognized at fair value at the inception of the and Notes lease or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower. Group Report 2017 173 Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value regardless of their purpose and reported under other receivables and other assets or other liabilities. Initial measurement is as of the settlement date. All derivative financial instruments are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. The recognition of changes in fair value depends on the purpose for which a derivative is held. Derivatives are only ever used in the HOCHTIEF Group for hedging purposes. Hedges are structured for maximum effectiveness. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows from a hedged item, as with the hedging of variable rate loans to counter variations in payment amounts due to interest rate changes. Unrealized gains and losses are initially recognized in equity, taking account of deferred taxes. The portion of the changes in value initially recognized in equity is reclassified to income or expense as soon as the hedged item is recognized in income or expense. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are reclassified to income or expense in the period when the financial asset or financial liability affects income. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a nonfinancial asset or liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are taken out of equity and subtracted from or added to the initial cost of the asset or liability. In the cases described, only the portion of changes in value that are determined to be effective for hedging purposes are recognized in equity. The ineffective portion is recognized directly as income or expense. In the HOCHTIEF Group, only cash flow hedges are entered into. Derivatives are also used for economic hedging purposes where no hedge accounting is applied, and as call options. In such cases, changes in fair value are recognized in income or expense. Contingencies, commitments, and other obligations are possible or current obligations, based on past transactions, that are unlikely to lead to an outflow of resources. These are disclosed separately and not included in the Balance Sheet unless assumed in the course of a business combination. The amounts stated for contingent liabilities reflect the extent of the liability as of the reporting date. Judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies primarily relate to the following ­issues: • Leases must be assessed to determine whether the substantial risks and rewards of beneficial ownership transfer to the lessee. • Marketable securities may be grouped in different categories. • Assets earmarked for sale must be assessed to confirm that they are available for immediate sale and their sale Consolidated Financial Statements is highly probable. If the result of this assessment is positive, those assets and any liabilities to be disposed of in the same transaction must be reported and accounted for as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale. • It is necessary to determine whether revenue, and notably construction revenue is accounted for under IAS 11 or and Notes IAS 18. The decision made by the HOCHTIEF Group for general application in each instance is set out under Accounting Policies in these Notes. 174 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the consolidated financial statements Preparation of the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements requires Group management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures of contingencies, commitments, and other obligations. The main estimates and assumptions relate to the following: • Assessing projects on a percentage of completion basis, in particular with regard to accounting for change orders, the timing of profit recognition, and the amount of profit recognized. • Estimating the economic life of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and of investment properties. • Accounting for provisions. • Testing goodwill and other assets for impairment. • Testing deferred tax assets for impairment. All estimates and assumptions are based on current circumstances and appraisals. Forward-looking estimates and assumptions made as of the balance sheet date with a view to future business performance take account of circumstances prevailing on preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and future trends considered realistic for the global and industry environment. Actual amounts can vary from the estimated amounts due to changes in the operating environment that are at variance with the assumptions and lie beyond management control. If such changes occur, the assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of affected assets and liabilities are revised accordingly. Financial reporting standards applied for the first time in 2017 Adoption by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) of revised or new IFRS pronouncements has resulted in changes to accounting policies in those instances where the pronouncements have been adopted by the EU and their application is mandatory for the reporting period January 1 to December 31, 2017. These changes relate to the following IFRS: • Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: Disclosure Initiative • Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses The additional notes disclosures required by the amendments to IAS 7 are provided in an additional table in the Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments to IAS 12 did not require any changes in the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements.

The “Other” item includes losses from foreign Group companies for which no deferred taxes have been recognized as well as tax income from prior-year business transactions. This also includes the impact of the December 2017 U.S. tax reform, Public Law No. 115–97 (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), mainly comprising non-cash measurement adjustments on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the net amount of minus EUR 16,188 thousand. These adjustments reflect the outcome of lower corporate tax, with the corporate tax rate applicable to HOCHTIEF Americas falling from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. Also, as part of the tax reform, a “Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax” (BEAT) Consolidated Financial Statements and a “Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income” (GILTI) were introduced. Pending detailed appraisal of the expected impacts and any clarifications, HOCHTIEF does not currently expect that BEAT and GILTI will have a significant effect on our effective tax rate over the long term. and Notes 11.

Development costs in the amount of EUR 250 thousand (2016: EUR 313 thousand) were capitalized in the reporting year. 182 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Intangible assets include EUR 43,728 thousand (2016: EUR 54,895 thousand) for company names recognized on initial consolidation, comprising EUR 39,818 thousand (2016: EUR 45,303 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Americas division and EUR 3,910 thousand (2016: EUR 9,592 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. The company names are not subject to systematic amortization, but are tested for impairment annually and if there is any indication of impairment. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with IAS 36 as described below for goodwill. The changes relative to the prior year relate to exchange rate adjustments and to a EUR 5,407 thousand impairment on the Devine name in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. Goodwill recognized for consolidated companies on initial consolidation is allocated to cash-generating units at segment level for the purposes of impairment testing as described in the following. The cash-generating units correspond to the divisions used in segment reporting. Annual impairment testing of goodwill at segment (division) level is performed at HOCHTIEF in the fourth quarter of each year. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of a division is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe cash-generating units is measured separately for each unit as value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from a cash-generating unit. It is determined from an internal Group perspective using the discounted cash flow method. This is applied on the basis of cash flow budgets derived as a rule from the three-year budget for the detailed planning horizon as approved by the Executive Board and current at the time of impairment testing. The forecasts incorporate past experience and expected future market developments. Cash flows are assumed to remain constant in subsequent years. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used for cost of capital figures. Value in use is first measured on an after-tax basis by discounting the cash flows with an after-tax WACC determined separately for each cash-generating unit. The pretax discount rate is then found by iteration for the purposes of the Notes disclosures. The discount rates used for cash-generating units in impairment testing are between 7.91% and 9.31% before tax (2016: between 9.44% and 9.66%). The recoverable amount of the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific cash-generating unit is measured at fair value based on CIMIC’s stock market valuation. As in the prior year, comparison of the divisions’ recoverable amounts with their carrying amounts did not reveal any impairment of goodwill.

The total term of the plan was ten years. The waiting period after the granting of each tranche was three years. The exercise period was between five and seven years, depending on the tranche. The conditions stipulated that, after the waiting period, entitled individuals received for each stock award either a HOCHTIEF share or, at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion, a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date.

The first tranche was exercised in full in 2015, the third tranche in 2016, and the second tranche in 2017. Long-term Incentive Plan 2010 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2010 (LTIP 2010) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2010 and is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affiliates.

The plan conditions differed from those of LTIP 2012 in only one point: The performance target for RONA was replaced with a performance target for adjusted free cash flow. The number of SARs that could be exercised depended on attainment of the planned value range for adjusted free cash flow. This value range was set in the business plan for each exercise year. The gain was limited to EUR 24.61 per SAR and EUR 73.83 per stock award. The plan was exercised in full in 2017.

The size of the annual pension component depends on employee income and age (resulting in an annuity conversion factor) and a general pension contribution reviewed by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesell­ schaft every three years and adjusted as necessary. The future pension amount is the sum total of the pension components earned each year. In isolated instances, length-of-service and final salary pension arrangements are in existence for executive staff, although except at Executive Board level such arrangements have no longer been offered since 1995. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension, and in almost all cases are granted as a life-long annuity. Up to December 31, 2013, employees in Germany additionally had the option of deferred compensation in a company pension plan. The deferred compensation was invested in selected investment funds. The pension amount is based on the present value of acquired fund units at retirement, subject to a minimum of the deferred compensation amount plus an increment that is guaranteed by HOCHTIEF and ranges from 3.50% down to 1.75% p.a. There is a choice at retirement between a lump sum payment and an annuity for five or six years. Outside of Germany, there are defined benefit plans at Turner in the USA and HOCHTIEF (UK) in the United Kingdom. The plan at Turner was frozen as of December 31, 2003, and no new entitlements can be earned under it. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. There is a choice at retirement between a life-long annuity and a lump-sum payment. Commitments at Turner also include post-employment benefits in the form of medical care for pensioners. HOCHTIEF (UK) has a length-of-service, final salary pension plan. For each year of service, 1/75th of the eligible final salary is granted as a monthly pension. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. Defined benefit obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are made up as follows: Dec. 31, 2017 (EUR thousand) Germany USA UK Active members 119,864 80,884 10,822 Final salary [18,702] – [10,822] Not final salary [101,162] [80,884] – Vested benefits 157,757 39,090 17,467 Retirees 497,150 90,180 16,706 Consolidated Financial Statements Similar obligations 96 53,383 – Total 774,867 263,537 44,995 Duration in years (weighted) 14.0 9.6 18.1 and Notes Dec. 31, 2016 (EUR thousand) Germany USA UK Active members 128,813 94,097 15,249 Final salary [17,861] – [15,249] Not final salary [110,952] [94,097] – Vested benefits 184,463 44,877 19,177 Retirees 505,168 109,053 14,849 Similar obligations 95 60,470 – Total 818,539 308,497 49,275 Duration in years (weighted) 14.6 8.7 19.0 200 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Plan assets Germany There are no statutory or regulatory minimum funding requirements for pension plans in Germany. Domestic pension obligations are fully funded. The funded plans take the form of a contractual trust arrangement (CTA). The transferred assets have been administered since January 1, 2015 by an external trustee and serve exclusively to fund domestic pension obligations. The transferred cash is invested in the capital market in accordance with investment principles set out in the trust agreement and the investment guidelines. Investment decisions are not made by the trustee but by an investment committee. The investment guidelines and decisions are based on the findings of an asset liability matching (ALM) study compiled by outside specialists at regular intervals of three to five years. This uses Monte Carlo simulation to model the development of the pension liabilities and other key economic factors over a very long forward horizon and in numerous combinations. Based on the ALM study, a range of criteria are then applied to determine the optimum asset allocation in order to ensure that pension liabilities can be met in the long term. To assure an optimum conservative risk structure, we have also established risk overlay management using the services of an external overlay manager who is given a fixed annual risk budget and works fully autonomously in a clearly structured risk overlay management process. HOCHTIEF aims to ensure full funding of pension obligations and to fund new vested benefits on the basis of current service cost annually or at least on a timely basis. The companies pay in additional amounts from time to time in the event of any shortfall. Pension commitments in Germany in excess of the contribution assessment ceiling applied in the statutory pension insurance scheme are additionally covered using pension liability insurance. Pension liabilities from deferred employee compensation offered up to December 31, 2013 were funded by the purchase of retail fund units. Funding of the obligations served by HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e. V. as of December 31, 2017 is about 56% (2016: 55%); the figure for Germany as a whole is about 62% (2016: 60%). It should be noted in this connection that pension obligations have increased significantly in recent years due to the low level of market interest rates and that the funding ratio is expected to significantly increase again when interest rates recover. USA The frozen defined benefit obligations in the Turner Group are likewise managed in a pension fund. Plan assets are administered in trust by BNY Mellon and serve exclusively to fund the plan. Investment decisions are not made by the trust but by a special committee. The investment of plan assets is based on a regularly compiled ALM study. The investment objectives are to maximize the funding ratio and reduce volatility in the funding ratio. With the pension obligations fully funded, high-risk investConsolidated Financial Statements ments in equities are to be reduced in favor of fixed-interest bonds. These ideally perform in line with plan liabilities, thus ensuring full funding. There is no statutory minimum funding requirement, but low funding levels result in higher contributions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, and limits to lump-sum payments, hence maximum funding is aimed for. The funding of obligations covered by Turner’s pension fund as of December 31, 2017 is and Notes about 100% (2016: 86%); funding at Turner overall is about 79% (2016: 69%). Group Report 2017 201 UK Funding of plan assets at HOCHTIEF (UK) is likewise on a trust basis. Statutory minimum funding requirements apply. If funding is insufficient to make up a funding shortfall, an additional restructuring plan is drawn up. Plan funding is reviewed at least once every three years. Funding of pension obligations at HOCHTIEF (UK) is about 74% (2016: 69%). Defined benefit obligations are covered by plan assets as follows: Coverage of defined benefit obligations by plan assets Dec. 31, 2017 Dec. 31, 2016 Defined benefit Plan assets Defined benefit Plan assets (EUR thousand) obligations obligations Uncovered by plan assets 54,552 – 61,858 – Partially covered by plan assets 961,696 648,497 1,046,057 667,669 Not fully covered by plan assets 1,016,248 648,497 1,107,915 667,669 Fully covered by plan assets 67,151 72,615 68,396 70,971 Total 1,083,399 721,112 1,176,311 738,640 Actuarial assumptions The size of pension provisions is determined on an actuarial basis. This necessarily involves estimates. Specifically, the actuarial assumptions used are as follows: 2017 2016 (Percent) Germany USA UK Germany USA UK * Weighted average Discount factor* 2.00 3.68 2.55 1.75 4.04 2.65 Salary increases 2.75 – 2.00 2.75 – 2.30 Pension increases* 1.75 – 3.27 1.75 – 3.53 Health cost increases – 5.00 – – 5.00 – The discount factors are derived from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (MPDYC) model, taking into account the company-specific duration of pension liabilities. Salary and pension increases ceased to be taken into account in the USA (Turner Group) in 2004 due to the changeover in pension arrangements. Mortality assumptions are based on published country-specific statistics and experience. The following mortality tables were used in the actuarial calculation of pension obligations: Consolidated Financial Statements Germany Heubeck Richttafeln 2005 G USA RP 2014 mortality table projected generationally with MP2017 RP 2017 mortality table projected generationally with MP2017 (Healthcare costs) UK S2PxA CMI_2016 [1,25 %] year of birth and Notes 202 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The present value of defined benefit obligations and the market value of plan assets have changed as follows: Changes in the present value of defined benefit obligations 2017 2016 (EUR thousand) Domestic International Total Domestic International Total Defined benefit obligations at start of year 818,539 357,772 1,176,311 759,459 339,509 1,098,968 Current service cost 7,928 2,004 9,932 5,943 1,764 7,707 Past service cost (1,504) – (1,504) – – – Interest expense 13,991 12,432 26,423 18,495 13,265 31,760 Remeasurements Actuarial (gains)/losses arising from changes in demographic assumptions – (15,098) (15,098) – 3,537 3,537 Actuarial (gains)/losses arising from changes in financial assumptions (27,979) 9,771 (18,208) 81,203 14,565 95,768 Actuarial (gains)/losses arising from ­experience adjustments 1,320 (801) 519 (8,060) 1,326 (6,734) Benefits paid from Company assets (330) (2,879) (3,209) (442) (3,264) (3,706) Benefits paid from funds assets (37,040) (16,176) (53,216) (38,004) (16,055) (54,059) Employee contributions – 132 132 – 162 162 Effect of transfers (58) – (58) (55) – (55) Currency adjustments – (38,625) (38,625) – 2,963 2,963 Defined benefit obligations at end of year 774,867 308,532 1,083,399 818,539 357,772 1,176,311 Changes in the market value of plan assets 2017 2016 (EUR thousand) Domestic International Total Domestic International Total Plan assets at start of year 491,451 247,189 738,640 506,877 244,857 751,734 Interest on plan assets 8,560 8,279 16,839 12,618 9,290 21,908 Plan expenses paid from plan assets recog­ nized in profit or loss – (1,499) (1,499) – (1,369) (1,369) Remeasurements Return on plan assets not included in net interest expense/income 7,713 22,784 30,497 4,521 8,240 12,761 Difference between plan expenses expected and recognized in profit or loss – (1) (1) – (176) (176) Employer contributions 8,441 9,461 17,902 5,439 835 6,274 Employee contributions – 132 132 – 162 162 Consolidated Financial Statements Benefits paid (37,040) (16,176) (53,216) (38,004) (16,055) (54,059) Currency adjustments – (28,182) (28,182) – 1,405 1,405 Plan assets at end of year 479,125 241,987 721,112 491,451 247,189 738,640 and Notes Group Report 2017 203 Investing plan assets to cover future pension obligations generated actual returns of EUR 47,336 thousand in 2017 (2016: EUR 34,669 thousand).

Before deferred taxes, the cumulative amount is actuarial losses of EUR 441,963 thousand (2016: EUR 527,496 thousand). and Notes The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are included in pension provisions due to their pension-like nature. The defined benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 came to EUR 53,383 thousand (2016: EUR 60,470 thousand). Healthcare costs accounted for EUR 1,642 thousand (2016: EUR 1,532 thousand) of the current service cost and EUR 2,483 thousand (2016: EUR 2,397 thousand) of the interest expense. Group Report 2017 205 Sensitivity analysis Pension obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are subject to the following material risks: Interest rate risk For defined contribution plans, (notional) contributions are translated into benefits using a table of fixed interest rates, independent of the current market interest rate. HOCHTIEF thus bears the risk of general capital market interest rate changes with regard to the determination of benefits. Pension obligations have increased significantly in recent years due to the generally low level of capital market interest rates. The correspondingly strong impact is due to the relatively long term of the obligations. Inflation risk By law, company pensions in Germany must be raised level with the inflation rate at least every three years. German company pensions under the 2000+ plan rise at a fixed 1% p.a., hence there is only minor inflation risk in the pension phase. Turner plans are free from inflation risk as the main defined benefit plan is frozen and no more adjustments to the company pension are made. Longevity risk The granting of life-long pensions means that HOCHTIEF bears the risk of pensioners living longer than actuarial calculations predict. This risk normally averages out across all pension plan members and only comes into play if life expectancy is greater than expected. The impact of the stated risks on the defined benefit obligations under a corresponding change in actuarial ­assumptions is shown in the sensitivity analysis that follows.

The main reason for this is an extraordinary contribution to the Turner pension fund which is included in the 2017 fi­ gures and as a result of which the pension plan is close to fully funded. Defined contribution plans Under defined contribution plans, the Company pays into a state or private pension fund voluntarily or in accordance with statutory or contractual stipulations. It has no obligation to pay further contributions. There are defined contribution plans at Turner, Flatiron, and E.E. Cruz in the USA as well as at CIMIC in Australia. Depending on length of service and salary level, Turner pays between 3% and 6% of an employee’s salary into an external fund. In addition, Turner employees have an option to pay up to 25% of their salaries into an investment fund as part of a 401 (k) plan. Turner matches the first 5% of the deferred compensation by up to 100% depending on length of service. All employees can join the plan immediately, and are vested in the company’s contributions after three years’ service. Tax relief is granted on most payments into the fund, although it is also possible to pay contributions from taxed income and receive the investment earnings free of tax; the investment risk is borne by employees. The defined contribution plans at Flatiron and E.E. Cruz are similar to 401 (k) plans. All non-union employees are entitled. Flatiron pays a contribution in the amount of 6.0% of the wage or salary, while E.E. Cruz doubles one-third of employee contributions, in each case up to the statutory maximum. Since July 1, 2014, CIMIC in Australia has paid 9.50% (previously 9.25%) of the wage and salary total into the statutory pension (superannuation) scheme. The contribution rate is expected to rise incrementally up to 12.0% by 2025. Employees have a choice of investment funds and bear the investment risk. They are able to pay top-up contributions on a voluntary basis. Tax relief is granted on top-up contributions.

The entire proceeds from the issue were used to refinance a 2012 bond issue for the same amount that matured in March 2017. The notes have staggered terms of five, seven, and ten years with variable and fixed interest rates. A syndicated five-year credit facility originally due to expire in April 2019 comprising a EUR 1.5 billion guarantee facility tranche and a EUR 0.5 billion credit facility tranche was successfully refinanced ahead of schedule at significantly improved terms in August 2017. The new syndicated facility for a total of EUR 1.7 billion with a term to August 2022 and extension options of up to two more years consists of a guarantee facility tranche totaling EUR 1.2 billion and a credit facility tranche for EUR 0.5 billion that can be drawn on a revolving basis. As in the prior year, there are no drawings on the credit facility tranche as of the reporting date. Group Report 2017 209 CIMIC successfully refinanced and expanded an existing syndicated working capital cash facility in September 2017 as part of its long-term financing strategy. The new syndicated working capital cash facility is for AUD 2.6 billion, split across two tranches with terms of three and five years. It replaces an existing EUR 1 billion facility, which matured in December 2017, as well as a portion of the CIMIC Group’s bilateral cash facilities and some maturing U.S. dollar debt. Drawings on the working capital cash facility stand at AUD 245.0 million (2016: AUD –) as of the reporting date. Financial liabilities due to equity-accounted companies are EUR 15,203 thousand (2016: EUR – thousand).

Other disclosures 33. Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the consolidated net profit attributable to the Company’s shares by the average number of shares in circulation. This indicator can become diluted as a result of potential shares (mainly stock options and convertible bonds). HOCHTIEF’s share-based payment arrangements do not have any dilutive effect. Diluted and basic earnings per share are consequently identical. 2017 2016 Profit after tax attributable to HOCHTIEF shareholders (EUR thousand) 420,736 320,483 Consolidated Financial Statements Number of shares in circulation in thousands (weighted average) 64,253 64,294 Earnings per share attributable to HOCHTIEF shareholders (EUR) 6.55 4.98 Dividend per share (EUR) 2.60 and Notes Proposed dividend per share (EUR) 3.38 Group Report 2017 211 34. Reporting on financial instruments Financial instruments include financial assets and liabilities as well as contractual claims and obligations relating to exchanges and transfers of financial assets. Financial instruments can be derivative or non-derivative. Non-derivative financial assets mostly comprise cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and other financial assets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. The fair values of available-for-sale financial assets are established with reference to market prices or, in the absence of such prices, determined using accepted valuation methods. Non-derivative financial liabilities are mostly current liabilities measured at amortized cost. According to their fair value, derivative financial instruments are reported either in other receivables and other assets or in other liabilities. Derivatives are used in the HOCHTIEF Group exclusively for the hedging of existing transactions and in asset management. Holdings of non-derivative and derivative financial instruments are carried on the balance sheet; the maximum risk of loss or default is equal to the total value of financial assets. Any such risk identified in respect of financial assets is accounted for with an impairment loss. Risk management All finance activities in the HOCHTIEF Group are conducted on the basis of a Group-wide financial directive. This is complemented by function-specific operating work instructions on issues such as currency and collateral management. These lay down principles for dealing with the various classes of financial risk. Management of liquidity risk HOCHTIEF uses largely centralized liquidity structures—notably cash pooling—to pool liquidity at Group level, among other things to avoid cash flow bottlenecks at the level of individual entities. The central liquidity position is calculated at regular monthly intervals and budgeted in a bottom-up process over a rolling 18-month period. Liquidity budgets are supplemented with monthly stress testing. HOCHTIEF uses liquidity budgets in active management of the marketable securities and loans portfolios. The tables below show maximum payments. The tables show the worst-case scenario for HOCHTIEF, i.e. the earliest possible contractual payment date in each case. Creditors’ rights of termination are taken into account. Foreign currency items are translated using the closing rate as of the balance sheet date. Interest payments on variable rate items are translated uniformly using the last interest rate fixed prior to the balance sheet date. Both derivative and Consolidated Financial Statements non-derivative financial instruments (for example, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps) are taken into account. Credit facilities granted but not yet drawn in their full amount are also included, as are financial guarantees issued by the Group. and Notes 212 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The maximum payments shown in the following tables (worst-case scenario) are offset by contractually fixed receipts in the same periods that are not shown here (for example, from trade receivables). These cover most of the cash outflows shown.

The authorized capital in the amount of up to EUR 82,000 thousand Consolidated Financial Statements and conditional capital in the amount of up to EUR 46,080 thousand provide appropriate scope for raising additional capital as needed. and Notes Group Report 2017 213 Financial assets and financial liabilities are presented net in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts. There must also be an intention either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. In the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division, under a legally binding arrangement with banks, financial assets in the amount of EUR 31,664 thousand (2016: EUR 17,402 thousand) and financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 3,179 thousand (2016: EUR 17,334 thousand) are offset and presented in the balance sheet with their net amount of EUR 28,485 thousand (2016: EUR 68 thousand). Management of currency risk HOCHTIEF is exposed to currency risk (transaction risk) arising from receivables, liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and pending transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group company concerned. Currency derivatives, mainly forward exchange contracts, are used to hedge against fluctuations in these payments or items caused by exchange rates. HOCHTIEF normally hedges all currency risk. Hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—are administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. Binding guidelines clarify their use as well as separate controls and responsibilities for all Group companies. Currency derivatives are normally only used to hedge risk. Any form of speculation is ruled out under a binding, Group-wide financial directive. The counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating. The following table shows the fair values of currency derivatives, changes in their fair values, and their maximum remaining maturities: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2017 Dec. 31, 2016 Assets Forward exchange contracts/currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 5,938 1,168 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 321 3,807 6,259 4,975 Liabilities and s ­ harehold­ers’ equity Forward exchange contracts/currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 1,451 4,211 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 2,647 24 4,098 4,235 Changes in fair value Consolidated Financial Statements of derivatives held for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized in other comprehensive income 7,530 (4,920) of derivatives held for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized immediately in profit or loss (6,109) 5,342 Maximum remaining maturity and Notes (months) for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 26 31 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 22 18 214 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Where hedge accounting is used, unrealized gains and losses on hedges are initially recognized in other comprehensive income, taking into account deferred tax. Gains and losses are not realized until a hedged item affects income. Derivatives are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. When interpreting positive or negative fair value changes relating to derivatives, it is important to remember that they balance hedged items whose values move in the opposite direction. The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate what material impact on HOCHTIEF Group equity and profit would result from a 10% fluctuation in foreign currencies relative to each Group company’s functional currency.

Two approaches are used to minimize this risk. Firstly, the Company uses natural hedging, meaning that it eliminates contrary interest rate risk from non-derivative financial instruments on the asset and liabilities side. The second method is to use interest rate derivatives. These generally take the form of interest rate swaps used in accordance with the Group annual financing strategy to manage cash flow risk from changes in interest rates for variable-rate financial items. As with currency derivatives, hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group— are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. There are also parallel regulations and guidelines, and derivatives are used solely for hedging (i.e. not speculatively) as a matter of principle. As a fundamental rule the counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating. The following table shows the fair values of interest rate derivatives, changes in their fair values, and their maximum remaining maturities: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2017 Dec. 31, 2016 Assets Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 397 165 397 165 Liabilities and s­ harehold­ers’ equity Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 23 – 23 – Changes in fair value of derivatives held for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized immediately in profit or loss 209 63 Maximum remaining maturity (months) for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 363 363 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 216 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact that a one percentage point change in the respective market interest rate would have had on equity and profit.

In addition, price risk stems from participating interests that are classified as available for sale, to the extent that they are measured at fair value. Such items are shown in the following table. Participating interests measured at amortized cost because their fair value cannot be reliably measured are not included.

Continuous monitoring and analysis of the markets make it possible to marshal investments at short notice. This allows the Company to detect negative developments on the capital market at an early stage and take appropriate action. The changes relative to the prior year result from ongoing active portfolio management as part of Group-wide risk management. Derivatives are used to control price risk only in exceptional instances.

HOCHTIEF performs risk management for operations by continuously monitoring trade receivables at divisional level. If a specific credit risk is detected, it is countered by recognizing an individual impairment in the necessary amount. The HOCHTIEF Group has given third parties financial guarantees and loan commitments in respect of Group companies. Financial guarantees and loan guarantees are only given in respect of companies with top credit standing, restricting to a minimum the probability of the guarantees being drawn upon. The maximum credit risk exposure of financial assets is equivalent to their carrying amounts in the balance sheet. However, the actual credit risk exposure is lower due to collateral given in favor of the HOCHTIEF Group. The maximum risk exposure on financial guarantees issued by HOCHTIEF is the maximum amount to be paid by HOCHTIEF. The maximum credit risk for loan commitments is the amount of the commitment. As of December 31, 2017, the maximum credit risk from financial guarantees and loan commitments amounted to EUR 80,844 thousand (2016: EUR 97,509 thousand). No recourse has ever been made to these guarantees provided by HOCHTIEF and, in light of the financial circumstances, none is currently anticipated for the future. HOCHTIEF accepts collateral to secure contract performance by subcontractors, subcontractors’ warranty obligations, and claims to remuneration. Such collateral includes guarantees relating to warranty obligations, contract performance, advance payments, and receivables. Acceptance of collateral is governed by a HOCHTIEF work instruction. Among other aspects, this covers the contractual drafting, implementation, and management of all agreements. The detailed rules vary according to factors such as the country jurisdiction and applicable case law. In the case of credit risk, HOCHTIEF examines the credit rating of the party providing the collateral for all guarantees accepted. HOCHTIEF uses external specialists (such as rating agencies) to assess credit standings where possible. The fair values of accepted collateral are not disclosed as they regularly cannot be measured reliably as a rule.

Receipt of payment depends on acceptance of the contract works (inspection) and invoice checking, which can often take a relatively long time, especially for large-scale projects. Most of the unimpaired financial assets that are past due are from public-sector clients and industrial companies with top credit ratings.

The Group keeps the cost of capital as low as possible by optimizing the balance between equity and debt as the need arises. These measures primarily serve to secure the best possible credit standing as well as to maximize shareholder returns. The Group’s capital structure consists of the balance sheet items comprising net debt (defined as current and non-current liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) and shareholders’ equity. The Risk Reporting Committee assesses and examines the Group’s capital structure at regular intervals, taking into account the risk-adjusted cost of capital. The overall capital risk management strategy did not change in the reporting year compared with the prior year.

Group Report 2017 223 As current financial instruments have short remaining maturities and are measured at market value, their carrying amounts generally correspond to market value as of the balance sheet date. Non-current securities in the availablefor-sale category are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI); as such, their carrying amounts also correspond to fair value. Shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participating interests are measured at fair value if fair value can be reliably determined. Otherwise, such items are measured at cost in the available-for-sale category. In the disclosures on the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value as set out below, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price). For non-financial assets, fair value is measured assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. The following three-level hierarchy is applied that reflects the observability of the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; e.g. quoted securities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); e.g. interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. Level 3: No relevant observable inputs available, hence unobservable inputs are determined as an exit price from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability; e.g. investments measured at fair value determined by business valuation.

This means that there were likewise no changes in Level 3. 224 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements In Level 3, the fair value of investments in unlisted entities is measured using generally recognized valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow analysis. The unobservable inputs used for this purpose are an internal rate of return of 9%, growth rates of between 2.5% and 3.0%, and required discount rates of between 10% and 15%. Call options are measured using Monte Carlo simulation. Assumed inputs are an expected exercise period of one to ten years, an EBITDA multiplier of six to twelve times, and a 15% discount factor. Changes in the unobservable inputs have no material effect on total comprehensive income, total assets and liabilities, or equity.

A., HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft furnished the Spanish Securities Market Commission, CNMV, with a bank guarantee in the amount of the EUR 15 billion loan provided for the financing of the takeover. This commitment to CNMV is required under Spanish law stipulating that on announcement of a takeover offer, a guarantee must be given for the cash needed in the transaction in order to secure the cash tranche of the offer. The guarantee lapses as soon as the takeover offer is accepted and the loan is thus drawn or if the takeover offer expires. The EUR 1.2 billion syndicated guarantee facility continues to be a central long-term financing instrument for HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. A syndicated five-year credit facility originally due to expire in April 2019 comprising a EUR 1.5 billion guarantee facility tranche and a EUR 0.5 billion credit facility tranche was successfully refinanced ahead of schedule at significantly improved terms in August 2017. The new syndicated facility for a total of EUR 1.7 billion with a term to August 2022 and extension options of up to two more years consists of a guarantee facility tranche totaling EUR 1.2 billion and a credit facility tranche for EUR 0.5 billion that can be drawn on a revolving basis. The facility permits the furnishing of guarantees for ordinary activities, mainly of the HOCHTIEF Europe division. Group order exposure from awarded capital expenditure projects is EUR 92,183 thousand (2016: EUR 55,707 thousand) and mostly relates to the CIMIC Group in the amount of EUR 91,881 thousand (2016: EUR 55,448 thousand). There are cash call commitments in the amount of EUR 10,100 thousand (EUR 2016: EUR 10,607 thousand) to non-consolidated entities in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2017 227 The term breakdown of minimum lease payments under operating leases is as follows: Operating leases Dec. 31, 2017 Dec. 31, 2016 (EUR thousand) Nominal value Nominal value Due within 1 year 215,680 198,043 Due in 1–5 years 438,180 421,346 Due after 5 years 131,739 183,142 The obligations from operating leases mainly relate to plant and machinery leased by the CIMIC Group. Lease payments under operating leases came to EUR 262,085 thousand in 2017 (2016: EUR 282,874 thousand). Several companies in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division have a number of leasing arrangements. These companies concerned are financed by third parties and HOCHTIEF itself holds neither interests in their equity nor assets such as loans or receivables. Relevant activities are managed by third parties under contractual agreement and therefore they are not consolidated. The minimum lease payments under operating leases come to EUR 123,486 thousand (2016: EUR 129,693 thousand). Amounts due under long-term tenancies are EUR 116,716 thousand (2016: EUR 146,725 thousand). The term for which such tenancies cannot be terminated is between two and ten years (2016: two and eleven years). The amounts due under tenancies are partly offset by anticipated rental income of EUR 48,937 thousand (2016: EUR 61,174 thousand). Other financial obligations include EUR 40,690 thousand (2016: EUR 69,314 thousand) in commitments relating to shareholder loans and under long-term contracts for the supply of goods and services. Legal disputes HOCHTIEF Group companies are involved in various legal disputes and arbitration proceedings in the context of their operating activities. As currently assessed, however, HOCHTIEF does not anticipate that the disputes and arbitration proceedings will have any material adverse impact on the Group’s business and financial situation.

They are transacted on an arm’s length basis. External sales mainly comprise revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and contract mining. The sum of external sales and intersegment sales adds up to total sales revenue for each division. The definition of operational earnings/EBIT and EBITDA was harmonized in 2017 and brought into line with the definition in use at our Group company CIMIC. Profit before tax is derived from operational earnings/EBIT and EBITDA as follows: 2017 2016 (EUR thousand) (restated) Profit before tax 823,619 620,711 – Investment and interest income (87,091) (87,415) – Investment and interest expenses 204,912 210,160 – Net expense relating to long-term loans to equity interests (37,294) (27,900) Operational earnings/EBIT 904,146 715,556 – Ordinary depreciation and amortization 390,214 280,988 EBITDA 1,294,360 996,544 Ordinary depreciation and amortization relates to intangible assets with finite useful lives, property, plant and equipment, and investment properties. The share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures comprises income and expenses from the equity-method associates and joint ventures, including impairment losses, relating to equity-method ­investments. The non-cash expenses consist of additions to provisions. Purchases comprise additions to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, equitymethod investments (excluding equity-method adjustments), subsidiaries, and other participating interests. Net cash is made up as follows: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2017 Dec. 31, 2016 Cash and cash equivalents 3,094,924 2,847,426 Consolidated Financial Statements Marketable securities 428,759 463,424 Current financial receivables 144,183 55,985 Current tax receivables (excluding income taxes) 10,583 7,730 Financial assets included in net cash 3,678,449 3,374,565 and Notes Bonds or notes issued, and amounts due to banks 2,382,010 2,647,237 Lease liabilities 4,102 23,232 Financial liabilities to associates 15,203 – Sundry other financial liabilities 11,288 223 Financial liabilities included in net cash 2,412,603 2,670,692 Net cash 1,265,846 703,873 The non-current assets comprise intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and the carrying amounts of equity-method investments. 232 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 37. Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows classifies cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities. Exchange rate effects are eliminated and their influence on the cash position is disclosed separately. Changes in cash and cash equivalents due to acquisitions and disposals of consolidated companies are shown separately under cash flow from investing activities. The EUR 163,986 thousand increase in cash and cash equivalents due to consolidation changes in the prior year comprised EUR 164,555 thousand in cash and cash equivalents from acquisitions and EUR 569 thousand in cash and cash equivalents in disposals. The EUR 3,094,924 thousand (2016: EUR 2,847,426 thousand) year-end total for cash and cash equivalents shown on the cash flow statement matches the cash and cash equivalents item on the balance sheet. The total comprises EUR 728 thousand (2016: EUR 728 thousand) in cash in hand, EUR 2,323,094 thousand (2016: EUR 2,209,678 thousand) in cash balances at banks, and EUR 771,102 thousand (2016: EUR 637,020 thousand) in marketable securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents to the value of EUR 196,404 thousand are subject to restrictions (2016: EUR 137,745 thousand). Cash flow from operations was EUR 1,372,090 thousand in 2017. Cash flow changes as a result of capital expenditure and asset disposals resulted in a net cash outflow from investing activities of EUR 392,429 thousand. The EUR 465,394 thousand negative cash flow from financing activities mainly comprises dividend payments and debt repayments. Including exchange rate changes, cash and cash equivalents increased overall by EUR 247,498 thousand. All non-cash income and expense and all income from asset disposals or arising on deconsolidation is eliminated in cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations included: • Interest income of EUR 50,633 thousand (2016: EUR 49,381 thousand), • Interest expenses of EUR 158,166 thousand (2016: EUR 161,793 thousand), • Income tax paid amounting to EUR 86,613 thousand (2016: EUR 83,995 thousand). After deducting the non-cash component of income from equity-accounted interests, net income received (as dividends) from such interests was EUR 175,492 thousand (2016: EUR 319,585 thousand). Divestments relate to the deconsolidation of fully consolidated subsidiaries. This reduced non-current assets by EUR 2,719 thousand (2016: EUR 23,981 thousand) and current assets by EUR 85,747 thousand (2016: EUR 24,853 thousand). Non-current liabilities decreased by EUR 2,248 thousand (2016: EUR 21,765 thousand) and current liabil­ ities by EUR 38,298 thousand (2016: EUR 12,633 thousand). Of the sale proceeds totaling EUR 54,076 thousand Consolidated Financial Statements (2016: EUR 36,655 thousand), EUR 29,076 thousand were settled in cash and cash equivalents as of the reporting date (2016: EUR 36,655 thousand). Dividends of EUR 167,044 thousand (2016: EUR 128,473 thousand) were paid to HOCHTIEF’s shareholders in the and Notes reporting year. Dividends paid to non-controlling interest totaled EUR 93,808 thousand (2016: EUR 96,902 thousand), of which EUR 73,048 thousand (2016: EUR 68,796 thousand) relates to the CIMIC Group.

New Accounting Pronouncements The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) have issued new accounting pronouncements in the form of standards and interpretations that affect the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements but do not have to be applied for the 2017 year and in some cases have not yet been endorsed by the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The new standard on financial instruments is divided into several phases and was published by IASB in its final version in July 2014. The new standard notably introduces major changes relating to the classification and meas­ urement of financial assets, with classification to be based on the type of business model as well as on contractual cash flows. In the same connection, impairment assessment is extended from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. A new hedge accounting model is also introduced that aims to bring hedge accounting more closely into line with the risk management activities of the entity. The complete overhaul of IAS 39 with the publication of IFRS 9 results in additional disclosures. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Initial application is retrospective, although transitional provisions apply. The standard was endorsed by the EU in November 2016. Accordingly, the HOCHTIEF Group has undertaken an assessment of the impacts of the new standard on classification and measurement as well as on hedge accounting, and estimated the following impacts: • The HOCHTIEF Group does not expect the new standard to have a significant impact on the classification of its financial assets; • The HOCHTIEF Group does not hold any financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss and as such there is no impact of the new standard on financial liabilities; • As a general rule, more hedge relationships may be eligible for hedge accounting. Existing hedge relationships would appear to qualify as continuing hedge relationships upon adoption of the new standard; • IFRS 9 will require extensive new disclosures, in particular surrounding hedge accounting, credit risk and expected credit losses; • The HOCHTIEF Group plans to adopt the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 for selected financial instruments (“overlay approach”); • Based on the HOCHTIEF Group’s analysis, an adjustment in reserves attributable to shareholders and to non-controlling interests will be recognized in the opening balance at January 1, 2018. The change in method from recognition of incurred losses to recognition of expected credit losses for impairment of financial assets might lead to a currently expected adjustment of equity in an amount of around EUR 400 million (after tax). This adjustment mainly relates to non-current loan receivables from HLG Contracting, having utilized external indeConsolidated Financial Statements pendent advice in determining the estimated expected credit loss when applying IFRS 9; • In addition to the above management is currently assessing whether any specific project finance obligations would require the recognition of expected credit losses; • Otherwise the increase in the loss allowance on financial assets is not expected to be significant. and Notes Group Report 2017 235 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for ­determining the timing and amount of revenue recognized. It replaces existing guidance, primarily including IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognizes revenue when control of a good or service transfers to a customer. The standard will become mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. It was endorsed by the EU in September 2016. Significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the impact, such as assessment of the probability of customer approval of variations and acceptance of claims, estimation of project completion date, and assumed levels of project execution productivity. In making this assessment we have considered, for applicable contracts, the individual status of legal proceedings, including arbitration and litigation. The implementation project is ongoing and therefore all impacts are current estimates subject to finalization prior to final implementation. Based on current analysis, the HOCHTIEF Group expects the following significant impacts on its financial statements from the first-time application of IFRS 15: The contractual terms and the way in which the HOCHTIEF Group operates its construction contracts are predominantly derived from projects containing one performance obligation. Contracted revenue will continue to be recognized over time. However, IFRS 15 provides new requirements for variable consideration such as incentives, as well as accounting for claims and variations as contract modifications, which all impart a higher threshold of probability for recognition. Revenue is currently recognized when it is probable that work performed will result in revenue, whereas under the new standard, revenue is recognized when it is highly probable that a significant r­ eversal of revenue will not occur for these modifications. Service revenue arises from maintenance and other services supplied to infrastructure assets and facilities, which may involve a range of services and processes. Under IFRS 15, these are predominantly to be recognized over time with reference to inputs on satisfaction of performance obligations. The services that have been determined to be one performance obligation are highly inter-related and fulfilled over time. Revenue therefore continues to be recognized over time. As with construction revenue, incentives, variations and claims exist which are subject to the same higher threshold criteria of only recognizing revenue to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not happen. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 236 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Currently, under IAS 11, construction contracts costs incurred during the tender process are capitalized within net contract debtors when it is deemed probable the contract will be won. Under the new standard, costs can only be capitalized if they are both expected to be recovered and either would not have been incurred if the contract had not been won or if they are intrinsic to the delivery of a project. Other contract costs and fulfilment costs are not expected to be material. With regard to revenue recognition for fully consolidated companies, the increased revenue recognition requirements under IFRS 15 would, on current estimates, necessitate adjustments to equity in the amount of around EUR 550 million (after tax). In the case of equity-method joint ventures, the carrying amount of the investment in a joint venture reflects the Group’s share of equity including the revenue from construction contracts recognized by the joint venture and accounted for by the Group as its share of profit or loss. While the joint ventures are not controlled entities, an analysis of the impact that might be expected has been performed due to the adoption of IFRS 15, based on the information currently available. In light of this analysis, an adjustment will be recognized to the book value of the joint ventures in the opening balance as of January 1, 2018. Equity is currently estimated to be reduced by an amount of around EUR 300 million (after tax). This includes an adjustment in an amount of around EUR 160 million (after tax) on HLG. The HOCHTIEF Group does not expect that first-time application of IFRS 15 will result in further significant changes in its financial statements. This notably applies to the recognition of revenue from mining and mineral processing. Transition The HOCHTIEF Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method as of January 1, 2018. As a result, under IFRS 15, there will be an adjustment to the opening balance of the HOCHTIEF Group’s equity. Other impacts of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 Tax impacts and equity adjustments Adjustments under the two new standards are subject to tax effect accounting and, therefore, the net deferred tax position will also be impacted by the adjustments discussed above, which are shown net of tax. The current position outlined above will lead to a net increase in deferred tax assets of around EUR 150 million. The equity adjustments of first-time application of the two standards are expected to reduce equity by an amount of around EUR 1,250 million, with the impact on equity attributable to non-controlling interests amounting to around EUR 250 million. Impact on cash flows and guidance Consolidated Financial Statements Adjustments arising on application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 are not expected to have an impact on the cash flows to be derived by the HOCHTIEF Group. Operational net profit guidance for 2018 takes into account the application of the new accounting standards. and Notes Group Report 2017 237 IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 specifies how to recognize, measure, and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for almost all leases. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard—i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases. IFRS 16 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 and replaces IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations. IFRS 16 was endorsed by the EU in October 2017. As of the reporting date, the HOCHTIEF Group has non-cancelable operating lease commitments of around EUR 755 million. The Group manages its owned and leased assets to ensure there is an appropriate level of equipment to meet its current obligations and to tender for new work. The decision as to whether to lease or purchase an asset is dependent on a broad range of considerations at the time including financing, risk management, and operational strategies following the anticipated completion of a project. Some of the operating leases currently held expire prior to the implementation of the standard, and decisions on future leases will be made as projects are tendered for. As such, the HOCHTIEF Group has not finalized its quantification of the effects of the new standard. The following impacts are, however, currently expected: • The total assets and liabilities on the balance sheet will increase with a decrease in total net assets, due to the reduction of the capitalized asset being on a straight line basis, whilst the liability reduces by the principal amount of repayments. Net current assets will show a decrease due to an element of the liability being disclosed as a current liability; • The straight-line operating lease expense will be replaced with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities; • Interest expenses will increase due to the unwinding of the effective interest rate implicit in the lease. Interest expense will be greater earlier in a lease’s life due to the higher principal value, causing profit variability over the course of a lease life. This effect may be partially mitigated due to the number of leases held in the HOCHTIEF Group at different stages of their terms; and • The principal portion of all lease liabilities will be classified as financing activities. IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts This standard published by the IASB in May 2017 will supersede the current IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. It provides for various approaches in accounting for insurance contracts. First-time application is expected for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021. EU endorsement is still pending. The implications of the new standard for the HOCHTIEF Group are currently still being analyzed. In addition, as part of its annual improvements process, the IASB published an omnibus standard, Annual ImproveConsolidated Financial Statements ments Cycle 2014–2016, in December 2016 and a further omnibus standard, Annual Improvements Cycle 2015–2017, in December 2017. This involved minor but necessary changes to various standards. The 2014–2016 cycle contains amendments to IFRS 1, IFRS 12, and IAS 28. The 2015–2017 cycle contains amendments to IFRS 3, IAS 12, and IAS 23. Only the Annual Improvements Cycle 2014–2016 has so far been endorsed by the EU. From and Notes ­today’s perspective, the changes are not expected to have any material impact on the presentation of the HOCHTIEF Group’s financial position and financial performance. 238 Group Report 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The remaining new pronouncements adopted by the IASB and the IFRS IC are not expected to have any major relevance to the HOCHTIEF Group. Potential implications for the Consolidated Financial Statements are currently still being assessed and cannot be conclusively determined until transposed into European law: • Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions • Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation • Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement • Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures • Amendments to IAS 40 Investment Property: Transfers of Investment Property • IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration • IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2017 239 39.

Essen, February 20, 2018 HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft The Executive Board Marcelino Fernández Verdes Peter Sassenfeld Consolidated Financial Statements José Ignacio Legorburo Escobar Nikolaus Graf von Matuschka and Notes 248 Group Report 2017 Independent auditors’ report To HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report Audit opinions We have audited the consolidated financial statements of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2017, the consolidated statement of earnings, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2017, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, which was combined with the management report of the Parent, for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2017. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the combined management report specified in the “Other information” section of our auditors’ report. In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, • the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2017, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2017, and • the attached combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of the group management report specified in the “Other information” section of our auditors’ report. Pursuant to Section 322 (3) Sentence 1 German Commercial Code (HGB), we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report. Basis for the audit opinions Konzernabschluss We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in accord­ ance with Sec. 317 German Commercial Code (HGB) and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014; referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report” section of our auditors’ report. We are independent of the Group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) Point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided Group Report 2017 249 non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2017. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters. In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit: 1. R  ecognition of construction revenue and recovery of related receivables from customer-specific construction contracts, in particular the claims concerning the project Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures 2. Recovery of carrying value of goodwill 3. Recovery of carrying value of investment in and loans receivable from HLG Our presentation of this key audit matter has been structured as follows: a) Description of the fact (including reference to corresponding information within the consolidated financial statements) b) Auditor’s response c) Key observations 1. R  ecognition of construction revenue and recovery of related receivables from customer-specific construction contracts, in particular the claims concerning the project Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures a) A material part of the business activity of the HOCHTIEF Group refers to the handling of customer-specific construction contracts. These primarily relate to the core construction business, construction project management and contract mining. Here, the rendered service, including the proportionate result, is disclosed under the revenue according to its stage of completion. The stage is measured as the percentage of completion of work performed up to the reporting date with respect to the total anticipated work to be performed. Revenue is recognized as soon as the Executive Board members have assessed all factors relevant to each contract, including specifically assessing the following as applicable: Consolidated Financial Statements • Determination of stage of completion; • Estimation of the total contract revenue and the total costs including estimation of cost contingencies; • Determination of contractual entitlement and assessment of the probability of the customer approval of variations and the acceptance of claims; and Notes • Estimation of the project completion date. The construction contracts are disclosed under the trade receivables and/or trade payables. The components exceeding the contract price (claims and variations) may bear uncertainties with regard to their recognition and measurement. The recognition of the contract receivables is based on the Executive Board members’ assessments about the expected recovery of the amounts. Furthermore, a margin of discretion arises in assessing the recovery of outstanding receivables. 250 Group Report 2017 Konzernabschluss: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The realization of revenue and the recovery of receivables from customer-specific construction contracts were classified by us as key audit matter since these are, on the one hand, complex facts that are strongly based on estimations and assessments of the Executive Board members and are, on the other hand, disclosed within the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2017 with a material amount in form of claims. In November 2009, the subsidiary CIMIC Group Limited (CIMIC) and its consortium partners were selected by Chevron as preferred contractors for the project Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures. The initial acceptance of the projects took place on August 15, 2014. Major contract modifications arose in course of the project. The respective claims to the principal have been negotiated since 2015. In connection with the claims at the project Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures, an amount of AUD 1.15 billion (EUR 749.4 million) was capitalized as receivables on the balance sheet at the end of the past financial year. Included therein are not only the claims but also the costs incurred in this context as well as interest (“total receivables”). The Executive Board members hold the opinion that CIMIC may claim these total receivables. In line with the relevant accounting standards, CIMIC has recorded revenue in the amount of the costs incurred so far. In February 2016, CIMIC was initiating, together with its business partners, a private arbitration process according to the contractual rules to enforce the open receivables towards the principal Chevron. This process is still running and, since the contractual rules do not stipulate any time limit for a private arbitration process, the date of completion of these negotiations is not foreseeable at present. In addition to these private arbitration proceedings, CIMIC commenced proceedings against Chevron within the U.S. in August 2016 to claim the amounts arisen from the project Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures also by taking legal action. The information provided by the Executive Board members on the realization of the revenue and recovery of the receivables from customer-specific construction contracts, in particular the information on the project Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures, is included in the chapter “Accounting and valuation principles” of the consolidated notes and “Risks from projects, investments, litigations, authority proceedings and claims of third-parties” in the opportunity and risk reporting. b) Our audit procedures in particular comprised: • Evaluating material processes from project acceptance to project handling including the audit of the respective accounting-related key controls, • Selection of a sample of contracts – in parts for the inspection on-site in Germany and abroad – on the basis of a risk-orientated and random-based selection; material criteria here were in particular the history of issues identified, significant unapproved changes, variations and claims, the amount of recognized claims as well as the project result, Consolidated Financial Statements •W  ith regard to the projects selected as sample: Obtaining an understanding of the contract terms and conditions, testing of cost to date and forecast costs by means of respective evidence, testing contractual entitlement for changes, variations and claims recognized within contract revenue to supporting documentation, evaluating significant exposure to liquidated damages for late delivery as well as evaluating the probability of recovery of and Notes outstanding receivables on the basis of the negotiation state as well as historical information, • With regard to the project Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures: Audit of the recovery of the outstanding receivables through estimation of the probability and the date of receipt of payments on the basis of the negotia­ tion state discussed with internal and external lawyers as well as historic information, • Assessment of the completeness and correctness of the relevant disclosures within the consolidated notes. Group Report 2017 251 c) T  he Executive Board members have determined the project-related degrees of completion required for the customer-­specific construction contracts based on detailed project calculations. When assessing the recovery of claims, the Executive Board members have considered the project-related information gained from negotiations with the respective customers and, if on hand, juristic statements. 2. Recovery of carrying value of goodwill a) Within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, goodwill of EUR 1.0 billion (i.e. 7.7% of the balance sheet total) is disclosed and is subject to an impairment test performed by the entity. The recoverable amount was determined as a value in use by applying a discounted cash flow model. The impairment test is subject to a high estimation uncertainty in particular with regard to the applied discounting factors, the expected new projects and growth rates as well as the future cash flows. This estimation uncertainty goes hand in hand with a significant margin of discretion on part of the Executive Board members. In doing so, the recovery of the goodwill disclosed within the consolidated balance sheet was determined by us to be a key audit matter. The disclosures made by the Executive Board members with regard to the recovery of the goodwill, disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet, are provided within the chapters “Intangible assets” and “Impairments” within the “Accounting and valuation principles” as well as within the chapter “Intangible assets” under the “Explanations to the consolidated balance sheet” in the consolidated notes. b) W  e performed the following audit procedures on the recovery of the carrying value of goodwill, disclosed within the consolidated balance sheet, under involvement of experts from the Valuation Services segment. • Audit of the discounted cash flow model applied by the Executive Board members of the respective division for the measurement of the recoverable value, determined as value in use, of the goodwill, disclosed within the consolidated balance sheet, including a critical assessment of the following assumptions: – Discounting factor for the respective division; – Forecast of the future cash flows and capital expenditure of the respective division; – Growth rates by reference to recent bid wins and pipeline of prospective projects; and – Terminal growth rates. In doing so, we have corroborated – to the extent possible – market-related assumptions by reference to external data. • Sample-based audits of the mathematical accuracy of the discounted cash flow model used for the respective Consolidated Financial Statements division, • Comparison with the target figures for the single division that were approved by the Executive Board members as well as performance of a plausibility check for these target figures, • Assessment of the Group’s historical accuracy of forecasting cash flows of the single division (adherence to and Notes budget), • Performance of sensitivity analyses for material assumptions for the respective division, • Understanding of the assumptions on the discounting factor as well as of the profitability forecast, • Assessment of the completeness and correctness of the relevant disclosures within the consolidated notes, • Reconciliation of the market price used for the listed subsidiary CIMIC with externally available data. 252 Group Report 2017 Konzernabschluss: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements c) T  he discounted future cash flows assigned to the goodwill of the respective cash-generating units considerably exceed the respective carrying values. The valuation parameters and assumptions used by the Executive Board members are within the range of the industry-specific market expectations. 3. Recovery of carrying value of investment in as well as of the loans receivable from HLG a) The consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2017 includes the investment in HLG Contracting LLL, Qatar, Oman, Saudi-Arabia and United Arab Emirates, measured at equity, with a book value of AUD 245.6 million (EUR 160.1 million; corresponding to 1.2% of the balance sheet total). Furthermore, loan receivables, including interest, from HLG of AUD 1.05 billion (EUR 681.8 million; corresponding to 5.1% of the balance sheet total) are disclosed. When determining the recoverable amount of the total investment at HLG, the Executive Board members have a considerable margin of discretion with regard to the numerous assumptions to be made, e.g. on the discounting rates, current work in hand, future contract wins, the recovery of certain legacy contract receivables as well as the growth rate of HLG and foreign currency exchange rates. The recovery of the shares in as well as of the loan receivables from HLG have been classified as key audit matter, since the testing of the recovery of these material items bears a considerable margin of discretion on part of the Executive Board members, in particular with regard to the future cash flows and the assumption to be made in addition. The information provided by the Executive Board members on the book value of the shares in as well as the loan receivable from HLG is provided in the chapter “Financial assets measured at-equity” within the “Accounting and valuation principles” as well as under the explanations to the consolidated balance sheet within the chapter “Financial assets measured at-equity” in the consolidated notes. b) W  ith the assistance of valuation services experts, we have performed the following audit procedures on the recovery of the total investment at HLG: • Audit of the discounted cash flow model used by the Executive Board members for measuring the recoverable amount, determined as value in use, of the shares and the loan receivables, including a critical assessment of the following assumptions: – Discounting rate; – Forecast of the future cash flows and capital expenditures; – Forecast realizability of certain legacy contract receivables; – Terminal growth rate; Consolidated Financial Statements – Foreign currency exchange rates. In doing so, we have corroborated – to the extent possible – market-related assumptions by reference to external data. and Notes • Sample-based audit of the mathematical accuracy of the discounted cash flow model. • Assessment of the historic forecasts on HLG as regards its reliability (adherence to budget). • Performance of sensitivity analyses for selected assumptions, including the deferral of cash receipts on certain legacy contract receivables, and the assumptions concerning the revenue of HLG. • Assessment of the appropriateness of the relevant disclosures within the consolidated notes. Group Report 2017 253 c) T  he recoverable amount of the investment and/or the loan receivables determined by the Executive Board members is above the book value. The valuation parameters and assumptions used in determining these values are within the range of the industry-specific market expectations. Other information The Executive Board members are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises: • the statement on corporate governance pursuant to Section 315d German Commercial Code (HGB) included in the Chapter “Corporate Governance und Compliance” of the combined management report, • the Corporate Governance Report pursuant to No. 3.10 of the German Corporate Governance Code, referred to in the Chapter “Corporate Governance und Compliance” of the combined management report • the consolidated non-financial statement included in the combined Annual Financial Report and Sustainability Report pursuant to Sections 315b to 315c German Commercial Code (HGB), • the Executive Board members’ confirmation relating to the consolidated financial statements and to the combined management report pursuant to Section 297 (2) Sentence 4 and Section 315 (1) Sentence 5 German Commercial Code (HGB) respectively, and • the remaining parts of the combined Annual Financial Report and Sustainability Report, with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements and combined management report and our auditors’ report Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information • is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or • otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Executive Board members and the Supervisory Board for the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report Consolidated Financial Statements The Executive Board members are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and Notes and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the Executive Board members are responsible for such internal control, as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Executive Board members are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. 254 Group Report 2017 Konzernabschluss: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Furthermore, the Executive Board members are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the Executive Board members are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report. The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report. Auditor’s responsibility for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditors’ report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 German Commercial Code (HGB) and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or taken together, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal conConsolidated Financial Statements trols. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on and Notes the effectiveness of these systems. • Evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies used by the Executive Board members and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Executive Board members. • Conclude on the appropriateness of the Executive Board members’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. Group Report 2017 255 • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB). • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions. • Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. • Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the Executive Board members in the group management report. Based on sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the Executive Board members as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 256 Group Report 2017 Konzernabschluss: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Other legal and regulatory requirements Further information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation We were elected as group auditor by the annual general meeting on May 10, 2017. The Supervisory Board engaged us on May 10, 2017. We have been the group auditor of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, without interruption since the financial year 2006. We declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditors’ report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report). German public auditor responsible for the engagement Prof. Dr. Holger Reichmann is the auditor responsible for the audit.

The Company is now also operating the concession. MAKING TIME FOR MORE QUALITY OF LIFE Thanks to the cutting-edge Elefsina-Patras a toll highway, road users’ travel time has been reduced by up to 40%, resulting in a significant increase in quality of life for the population in the rural regions of Achaia and Elis. The safe, ­direct route notably provides better links between the northwestern Peloponnese and the Greek capital, Athens. As with all HOCHTIEF PPP projects, communicating with residents and keeping all those affected by the construction informed comprehensively was of great importance.
