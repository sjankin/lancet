No impairment losses were recognised in profit or loss during prior periods of financial instruments from for these investments. The Group will apply the option to present fair value changes in OCI. LKAS 39. Therefore, the application of SLFRS 9 will not have a significant impact. Debt securities are expected to be measured at fair value through OCI under SLFRS 9 as the Group expects not only to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell a significant amount on a relatively frequent basis. Loans as well as trade receivables are held to collect contractual cash flows and are expected to give rise to cash flows representing solely payments of principal and interest. The Group analysed the contractual cash flow characteristics of those instruments and concluded that they meet the criteria for amortised cost measurement under SLFRS 9. Therefore, reclassification for these instruments is not required. Impairment SLFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities, loans and trade receivables, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. The Group will apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables. Hedge accounting The Group determined that all existing hedge relationships that are currently designated in effective hedging relationships will continue to qualify for hedge accounting under SLFRS 9. As SLFRS 9 does not change the general principles of how an entity accounts for effective hedges, applying the hedging requirements of SLFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements. 210 John Keells Holdings PLC .
