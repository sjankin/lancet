Traffic growth is expected to average 1% and 1.5% for lorries and passenger cars respectively. Operating expenses assume annual efficiencies of 2% per annum over the next five years whereafter they are expected to rise in line with inflation. Moreover, there is some uncertainty as regards the size and timing of reinvestments in the rail link.

Additional Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports are laid down in the IFRS order issued pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act and NASDAQ Copenhagen. The accounting policies are in accordance with those applied in the Annual Report 2016. The companies have elected to use the so-called Fair Value Option under IAS 39. Consequently, all financial assets and liabilities (loans, placements and derivatives) are measured at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised in the comprehensive income statement. Loans and cash at bank and in hand are measured at fair value on initial recognition in the balance sheet whereas derivative financial instruments are always measured at fair value, c.f. IAS 39. The rationale for using the Fair Value Option is that the companies consistently apply a portfolio approach to financial management, which means that the anticipated exposure to financial risks is managed through different financial instruments, both primary and derivative financial instruments. Accordingly, when managing financial market risks, the companies do not distinguish between, for example, loans and derivatives, but solely focus on the total exposure. Using financial instruments to manage financial risks could, therefore, result in accounting inconsistencies were the Fair Value Option not used. Hence this is the reason for exercising it. It is the companies’ opinion that the Fair Value Option is the only principle under IFRS that reflects this approach as the other principles lead to inappropriate inconsistencies between otherwise identical exposures depending on whether the exposure relates to loans or derivative financial instruments or requires comprehensive documentation as in the case of hedge accounting. As derivative financial instruments, financial assets and loans are measured at fair value, recognition in the financial statements will produce the same results for loans and related derivatives when hedging is effective. Thus, the company will achieve accounting consistency. Loans without related derivative financial instruments are also measured at fair value in contrast to the main rule laid down in IAS 39 pursuant to which loans are measured at amortised cost. This will naturally lead to volatility in the profit/loss for the year as a result of value adjustments. The consolidated accounts and the parent company accounts are presented in DKK, which is also the Group’s functional currency. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are disclosed in DKK million. In order to assist users of the Annual Report, some of the disclosures required under IFRS are also included in the Management’s Report. Similarly, information that is not considered material to the financial reader is omitted. New accounts adjustment The new and revised IFRS standards and interpretations implemented in 2017 have not resulted in any changes in accounting policies. The following amendments to existing and new standards and interpretations have not yet come into force and are not applicable in connection with the preparation of the Annual Report for 2017: IFRS 9, 15 and 16. The new standards and interpretations will be implemented when they become effective. The implementation of IFRS 9 changes, among other things, the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The Group does not currently use hedge accounting which is why the introduction of the new regulations on hedge accounting are not expected to have any effect. Only to a limited extent does the Group have financial assets in the form of debt instruments, which is why it is expected that the new regulations concerning provision for future credit losses will not have a significant effect. According to IFRS 9, a company can continue to recognise financial liabilities at fair value (fair value option). According to IFRS 9, the impact of changes attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income instead of currently in the income statement. On the basis of preliminary analysis, it is deemed that the guarantees provided by the Danish and Swedish states for the Group’s infrastructure companies will not significantly change the credit risk. The effect of IFRS 15 is expected to be insignificant as revenue from road traffic and issuer fees are included when passage has been undertaken. The implementation of the other standards and interpretations are not expected to have any financial effect on the Sund & Bælt Group's results, assets and liabilities or equity in connection with financial reporting. Consolidation The consolidated accounts cover the parent company Sund & Bælt Holding A/S and the wholly-owned subsidiaries A/S Storebælt, A/S Øresund, Sund & Bælt Partner A/S, Femern A/S, BroBizz A/S, BroBizz Operator A/S and A/S Femern Landanlæg. Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S is recognised in the consolidated accounts according to the equity method whereafter the Group’s share of the annual results and equity, corresponding to 50 per cent, are included in the consolidated accounts. Any negative equity is recognised as a provision since Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S is structured as a partnership with joint and several liability. The consolidated accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounts for Sund & Bælt Holding A/S and the subsidiaries by the addition of items of a uniform nature. \\Sv-data2-hals\transfer\Aarsrapport alle selskaber\ÅR_2017_UK.xlsx Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 39 The accounts on which the consolidation is based are submitted in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. On consolidation, elimination is made of internal income and expenses and internal balances. The parent company’s participating interests in the subsidiaries are offset against the corresponding equity. Newly established companies are included in the consolidated accounts from the time of establishment. Operating income Income from sales of services is included as the services are supplied and if the income can be reliably calculated and is expected to be received. Income is measured excluding VAT, taxes and discounts relating to the sale. Other income comprises accounting items of a secondary nature in relation to the company’s activities, including income from the use of fibre optic and telephone cables. Public subsidies Public subsidies are recognised when it is reasonably probable that the subsidy conditions have been fulfilled and that the subsidy will be received. Subsidies to cover expenses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement proportionally over the periods in which the associated expenses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement. The subsidies are offset in the costs incurred. Public subsidies related to the settlement of the road and rail links are deducted from the asset’s cost. Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment, investments and intangible fixed assets are subject to an impairment test when there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable (other assets are covered under IAS 39). Impairment losses are recognised by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount, i.e. the higher of an asset's net selling price or its value in use. Value in use is the present value of expected future cash flows from the asset using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market return. In determining impairment, assets are grouped in the smallest group of assets that generate separate identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). See also note 24: Profitability. Impairment losses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement. Tax on the year's result The company is covered by the Danish regulations concerning compulsory group taxation of the Sund & Bælt Group's companies. The subsidiaries are included in the Group taxation from the time they are included in the consolidation in the consolidated accounts and until such time when they may be omitted from the consolidation. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S is the administrating company for joint taxation and therefore settles all corporation tax payments with the tax authorities. Balances under corporation tax legislation’s interest deduction limitation rules are distributed among the jointly taxed companies in accordance with the joint taxation agreement. Deferred tax liabilities relating to these balances are recognised in the balance sheet while deferred tax assets are recognised only if the criteria for recognition of deferred tax assets are met. Current Danish corporation tax is duly apportioned through payment of the joint taxation contribution between the jointly taxed companies in relation to their taxable incomes. In conjunction with this, companies with tax losses receive joint taxation contribution from companies that have been able to use such losses against their own taxable profits. Tax for the year, which comprises the year’s current corporation tax, the year's joint taxation contribution and changes to deferred tax – including the change in the tax rate is included in the comprehensive income statement with the proportion attributable to the year’s results and directly in the equity with the proportion attributable to the items directly in the equity. Current tax and deferred tax Sund & Bælt Holding A/S and the jointly taxed companies are liable for income taxes, etc. for the jointly taxed companies and for any obligations for withholding tax on interest, royalties and dividends for the jointly taxed companies. Current tax liabilities and tax receivable are recognised in the balance sheet as computed tax on the year's taxable income, adjusted for tax on previous year's taxable income as well as for paid taxation on account. Tax owed and joint tax contribution receivable are included in the balance sheet under balances with affiliated companies. Deferred tax is measured in accordance with the balance-sheet oriented liability method of all interim differences between the carrying value and the tax value of assets and liabilities. In cases where the computation of the tax value can be carried out on the basis of the various taxation rules, the deferred tax is measured on the basis of the management's planned utilisation of the asset or the disposal of the liability. 40 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax losses entitled to be carried forward are recognised under other non-current assets at the value at which they are expected to be used, either through the setting-off of tax on future earnings or by the offsetting of deferred tax liabilities, within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. Balances under corporation tax legislation’s interest deduction limitation rules are distributed among the jointly taxed companies in accordance with the joint taxation agreement. Deferred tax liabilities relating to these balances are recognised in the balance sheet while tax assets are recognised only if the criteria for deferred tax assets are met. Adjustment of deferred tax is carried out relating to eliminations made of unrealised intra-group profits and losses. Financial income and expenses Financial income and expenses comprise interest income and expenses, realised inflation indexation, foreign exchange gains and losses on cash at bank and in hand, securities, payables, derivatives and transactions in foreign currencies as well as realised gains and losses relating to derivative financial instruments. The fair value adjustment at the balance sheet date equals total net financials which, in the comprehensive income statement, are split into financial income, financial expenses and value adjustment. Financial income and expenses comprise interest income, interest expenses and realised inflation indexation from payables and derivatives. Foreign exchange gains and losses and foreign currency translation for financial assets and liabilities are included in the value adjustment. Financial expenses for financing assets in progress are recognised in the cost of the assets. Financial assets and liabilities Initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities takes place on the trading date. Cash at bank and in hand, which includes bank deposits, are recognised at fair value on initial recognition in the balance sheet as well as on subsequent recognition. Differences in the fair value between balance sheet dates are included in the income statement under Financial income and expenses. On initial recognition, all cash at bank and in hand items are classified as assets measured at fair value. Holdings and returns on treasury shares are set off against equivalent bond loans issued and are therefore not recognised in the consolidated accounts’ comprehensive income statement and balance sheet. Loans are initially and subsequently measured at fair value in the balance sheet. On recognition, all loans are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through comprehensive income. Irrespective of the scope of interest rate hedging, all loans are measured at fair value with value adjustments being recognised regularly in the income statement, calculated as the difference in fair value between the balance sheet dates. The fair value of loans is calculated as the market value of future known and expected cash flows discounted at relevant rates, as there are no quotations available for unlisted bond issuers and bilateral loans. The discounting rates used are based on current market rates considered to apply to the Group as a borrower. Real rate loans consist of a real rate plus an allowance for inflation indexation. The expected inflation is recognised in the determination of the fair value on the real rate loans and is determined from the equilibrium inflation from the so-called break-even inflation swaps where a fixed inflation rate payment is exchanged against realised inflation, which is unknown at that time. Danish equilibrium inflation is calculated by a spread to Europe's break-even inflation swaps with HICPxT as reference index. Discounting follows from the general principles referred to above. The fair value of loans with related structured financial instruments is determined collectively and the market value of any options for payment of interest or instalments on the loans are measured using generally accepted standard valuation methods (locked formulas) with the volatility of reference rates and foreign currencies being included. Loans that contractually fall due after more than one year are recognised as non-current liabilities. Derivative financial instruments are recognised and measured at fair value in the balance sheet and on initial recognition in the balance sheet, they are measured at cost. Positive and negative fair values are included in Financial Assets and Liabilities respectively, and positive and negative values on derivatives are only set off when the Group has the right and intention to settle several financial instruments collectively. Derivative financial instruments are actively used to manage the debt portfolio and are therefore included in the balance sheet as current assets and current liabilities respectively. Derivative financial instruments include instruments where the value depends on the underlying value of the financial parameters, primarily reference rates and currencies. All derivative financial instruments are OTC derivatives with financial counterparties. There are no listed quotations for such transactions. Derivative financial instruments typically comprise interest rate swaps and currency swaps, forward exchange contracts, currency options, FRAs and interest rate guarantees and swaptions. The market value is determined by discounting known and expected future cash flows using relevant discount rates. The discounting rate is determined in the same way as loans and cash at bank and in hand, i.e. based on current market interest rates that are expected to be available to the Group as borrower. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 41 As with real rate loans, Inflation swaps contain an allowance for inflation indexation. The expected inflation is recognised in the determination of the fair value on the inflation swaps and is determined from the equilibrium inflation from the so-called break-even inflation swaps, where a fixed inflation rate payment is exchanged against realised inflation, which is unknown at that time. Danish equilibrium inflation is calculated by a spread to Europe’s break even inflation swaps with HICPxT as reference index. Discounting follows from the general principles referred to above. For derivative financial instruments with an option for cash flows, e.g. currency options, interest rate guarantees and swaptions, fair value is determined using generally accepted valuation methods (locked formulas) where the volatility of the underlying reference rates and currencies are included. Where derivative financial instruments are tied to several underlying financial instruments, total fair value is calculated as the sum of the individual financial instruments. According to IFRS 13, financial assets and liabilities, which are recognised at fair value, should be classified in a 3-layer hierarchy for valuation methodology. Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy includes assets and liabilities recognised at quoted prices in active markets. At level 2 assets and liabilities are valued using active quoted market data as input to generally accepted valuation methods and formulas. Finally, level 3 includes assets and liabilities in the balance sheet that are not based on observable market data, and therefore require separate comment. Foreign currency translation On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates at the transaction date. Foreign exchange differences arising between the exchange rates at the transaction date and the rates at the date of payment are recognised in the comprehensive income statement as financial income and financial expenses. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The difference between the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the rates at the date at which the receivable or payable arose, or the rates recognised on the previous balance sheet date,are recognised in the comprehensive income statement as financial income and financial expenses. Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, which have not been revalued to fair value, are translated at the time of transaction to the rate of exchange at the transaction date. Translation of financial assets and liabilities are recognised in value adjustments and translation of receivables, payables etc. are assigned to financial income and expenses. Intangible fixed assets On initial recognition, intangible fixed assets are measured at cost. Subsequently, the assets are measured at cost less depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life, not exceeding more than 5 years. Property, plant and equipment On initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price and any expenses directly attributable to the acquisition until the date when the asset is available for use. Subsequently, the assets are measured at cost less depreciation and impairment losses. During the construction period, the value of the road and rail links was determined using the following principles:  Expenses related to the links are based on concluded contracts, and contracts are capitalised directly  Other direct expenses are capitalised as the value of own work  Net finance expenses are capitalised as construction loan interest  EU subsidies received are set off against the cost price Significant future one-off replacements/maintenance work are regarded as separate elements and depreciated over the expected useful life. Ongoing maintenance work is recognised in the comprehensive income statement as the costs are incurred. Depreciation Depreciation on the road and rail links commences when the construction work is finalised and the facilities are ready for use. The facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives. For the road and rail links across Storebælt and Øresund, the facilities are divided into components with similar useful lives.  The main part of the links comprises structures designed with minimum expected useful lives of 100 years. The depreciation period for this part is 100 years  Mechanical installations, crash barriers and road surfaces are depreciated over useful lives of 20-50 years  Software and electrical installations are depreciated over useful lives of 10-20 years  Technical rail installations are depreciated over 25 years Other assets are recognised at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the assets’ expected useful life: 42 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Administrative IT systems and programmes (software) 0-5 years Leasehold improvements, the lease period, but max. 5 years Acquired rights 7 years Other plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 5-10 years Port facilities and buildings at the ports 25 years Buildings for operational use 25 years Wind turbine facilities 25 years Amortisation and depreciation are recognised as a separate item in the income statement The depreciation method and the expected useful lives are reassessed annually and are changed if there has been a major change in the conditions or expectations. If there is a change to the depreciation method, the effect on depreciation going forward will be recognised as a change of accounting estimates and judgements. The basis of depreciation is calculated on the basis of residual value less any impairment losses. The residual value is determined at the time of acquisition and is reassessed annually. If the residual value exceeds the carrying amount, depreciation will be discontinued. Profits and losses in respect of disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the difference between the sales price less sales costs and the carrying amount at the time of sale. Profits and losses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement under other operating expenses. Other operating expenses Other operating expenses include expenses relating to technical, traffic-related and commercial operations of the links. These comprise, inter alia, expenses for operation and maintenance of technical plant, marketing, insurance, IT, external services, office expenses and expenses for office premises. Staff expenses Staff expenses comprise overall expenses for employees, the Management Board and the Board of Directors. Total expenses include direct payroll costs, pension contributions, training expenses and other direct staff-related expenses. Staff expenses as well as payroll taxes, holiday allowance and similar costs are expensed in the period in which the services are performed by the employee. Operating leases Operating leases are recognised in the comprehensive income statement on a straight-line basis over the leasing contract’s leasing term unless another systematic method would give a better view of the leases during their term. Leasing contracts have been entered into with a leasing period of 1-9 years. Operating leasing comprises office premises and vehicles. Participating interests in subsidiaries Participating interests in subsidiaries are measured at cost or lower recovery value. Participating interests in jointly managed company Participating interests in the jointly managed company are measured in the balance sheet according to the equity method after which the proportion of the company’s carrying value is recognised. Any losses on the participating interest are recognised under provisions in the balance sheet. Securities Listed securities are recognised under current assets and measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Holdings of treasury shares are set off against equivalent issued bond loans. Inventories Inventories are measured at cost determined by the FIFO method or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost of merchandise, raw materials and consumables includes cost plus delivery costs. Net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the sales price less costs of completion and costs incurred to effectuate the sale, and determined with regard to marketability, obsolescence and development in the estimated sales price. Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at the amortised cost. Trade receivables comprise amounts owed by customers and balances with payment card companies. Write-down is made for expected bad debt. Receivables also comprise accrued interest in respect of assets and costs paid concerning subsequent financial years. Other receivables Other receivables are measured at the current value of the amounts expected to be received. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 43 Prepayments and accrued income Prepayments and accrued income comprise expenses paid concerning subsequent financial years. Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand comprise cash holdings and short-term bank deposits and securities which have a term of less than three months at the acquisition date, and which can readily be converted to cash and which only involve an insignificant risk of changes in value. Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost which usually corresponds to the nominal value. Pension obligations The Group has established defined contribution schemes and similar agreements for its employees. Defined contribution schemes are recognised in the comprehensive income statement in the period to which they relate, and any contributions outstanding are recognised in the balance sheet as Trade and other payables. Any prepayments are recognised in the balance sheet under Receivables. Deferred income and accruals Deferred income and accruals comprise payments received concerning income in subsequent years. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of events in the financial year or previous years, and it is probable that the obligation will require drawing on the Group’s financial resources. Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the expenses necessary to settle the liabilities on the balance sheet date. Provisions with an expected maturity later than one year from the balance sheet date are measured at present value. With planned restructuring of the Group’s operations, provision is made solely for the liabilities relating to the restructurings, which, on the balance sheet date, have been decided in accordance with a specific plan, and where the parties concerned have been informed about the overall plan. Cash flow statement The consolidated cash flow statement has been prepared in accordance with the indirect method based on the comprehensive income statement items. The Group’s cash flow statement shows the cash flow for the year, the year's changes in cash and cash equivalents as well as the Group’s cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the year. Cash flow from operating activities is calculated as the profit/loss for the year before net financials adjusted for non-cash income statement items, computed corporation taxes and changes in working capital. The working capital comprises the operating balance sheet items recognised in current assets and current liabilities. Cash flow from investing activities comprises the acquisition and disposal of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments. Cash flow from financing activities comprises the raising of loans, dividend to the shareholder, repayment of debt and financial income and expenses. Cash at bank and in hand comprises cash and short-term marketable securities with a term of three months or less at the acquisition date less short-term bank loans. Unused credit lines are not included in the cash flow statement. Segment information According to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities per segment must be disclosed. Sund & Bælt's assessment is that the Group consists of a segment that is divided into the following activities, Road, Railway, Ports and Ferry Services, Wind Turbines, Consultancy and Issuer Activities, as stated in the Management Report. Internal reporting and senior management's financial control take place on the basis of an overall segment. The reported segment information has been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. The segment's revenues and expenses comprise items directly attributable to the individual activity and the items that can be allocated to the individual activity on a reliable basis. Allocated revenue and expenses mainly comprise the Group's administrative functions, income taxes, etc. Financial ratios The financial ratios have been prepared in accordance with the Danish Society of Financial Analysts' Recommendations and Financial Ratios 2015 . The following financial ratios provided under financial highlights are calculated as follows: 44 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Profit ratio: Operating profit (EBIT) in percentage of turnover. Rate of return: Operating profit (EBIT) in percentage of total assets Return on facilities: Operating profit (EBIT) in percentage of investment in road and rail link Note 2 Significant accounting estimates and judgements Determining the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities requires an estimate on how future events will affect the value of such assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Estimates which are significant for financial reporting are, for instance, made by computing depreciation of, and impairment losses on, road and rail links and by computing the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities. Depreciation of the road and rail links is based on an assessment of the main components and their useful lives. An ongoing estimate of the assets’ useful life is undertaken. Any change in these assessments will significantly affect the profit/loss for the year, but will not affect cash flows. For certain financial assets and liabilities, an estimate is made of the expected future rate of inflation when calculating the fair value. The calculation of fair value on financial instruments is based on estimates of the relevant discounting rate for the Group, volatility of reference rates and currency for financial instruments with an option for cash flows and estimates of future inflation for real rate loans and swaps. Estimates for determining fair values and the need for impairment are, as far as possible, based on observable market data and continuously adjusted to actual price indications, see note. 1. With regard to the calculation of deferred tax, an estimate is made of the future utilisation of tax losses carried forward, which is based on the projected future earnings of the Group and the projected lifetime of the assets. In addition, an estimate is made of gains on financial items that can be used for recovery of the interest rate cap constraints within a 3 year period. As far as possible, the estimates are based on observable market continuously adjusted in line with inflation indexation and current price indications. See note 13. A/S Øresund and Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S’ facilities are deemed to be cash generating units in that the companies’ road and rail link function as one overall unit. A/S Storebælt facilities are deemed to be a cash generating unit in that the company’s road and rail link functions as one overall unit. Note 3 Segment information Segment information is based on the Group's internal reporting, and thus reflects the basis that senior management uses to monitor and evaluate the segments’ financial performance, including making financial decisions on allocating resources to operating activities. Reporting-based segment information is prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. The Group reports internally as one segment, but specifies operating activities: Road, Rail, Ports and Ferry Services, Wind Turbines, Consultancy and Issuer Activities. The operating activities are reviewed in the Management Report. A specification of turnover is part of the segment reporting, which corresponds to the specification in note 4, Operating income. Income and costs from operating activities comprise those items that are directly attributed to the individual activity as well as those items that can be allocated to the individual activity on a reliable basis. Allocated income and costs primarily comprise the Group’s administrative functions, tax on income, etc. Note 4 Operating income Operating income comprises revenue from the road and rail links, charges for use of port facilities and sale of electricity generated by the wind turbines. Revenue is measured excluding VAT, charges and discounts in connection with sale. Revenue from the road links comprises tolls collected in cash at the point of passage or by subsequent invoice as well as income from the sale of pre-paid journeys. Pre-paid journeys are recognised as they are undertaken. Income from the rail links comprises fees from Banedanmark for use of the rail facilities. Toll charges on the Storebælt link and the rail fees are set by the Minister of Transport, Building and Housing. Other income comprises items secondary to the Group’s activities, including income from the use of fibre optic and telephone cables.

Deferred tax will be offset as the underlying assets and liabilities are realised, including that the companies in the joint taxation under Sund & Bælt Holding A/S achieve positive taxable income. The Group managed the construction of the fixed links across Storebælt and Øresund and during the construction phase, the companies realised tax losses in that the income base could only be realised when the links were ready for use. The use of the companies’ losses carried forward extends over a period longer than five years, but since the main components of the companies’ property, plant and equipment have an estimated service life of 100 years, it is deemed prudent to recognise the tax value of the losses carried forward without impairment. The Group recognises interest deduction restrictions through interest cap regulations under deferred tax. The management believes that the restrictions under the interest cap can be recovered within 3 years.

Value adjustments comprise realised and unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities and foreign exchange gains and losses.

Net financing expenses for the Group are DKK 62.8 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016. This is primarily related to a number of early onlending repayments expiring in 2017 at an effective rate that was significantly higher than the market rate at which the loans were refinanced. The Danish rate of inflation was significantly higher in 2017, which resulted in increased inflation indexation, which had a reverse effect. Note 17 Receivables Trade receivables and services comprise amounts owed by customers, outstanding balances with payment card companies and receivables relating to the rail fee (DKK 45 million). As at 31 December 2017, payment card companies represent approximately 9% of total trade receivables. As at 31 December 2017, of the total amount owed by customers of DKK 385 million, there is a provision for unsecured receivables of DKK 4 million, which constitutes the assessed risk from customer losses. The book value of receivables thus represents the expected realisable value. There are no significant receivables due that are not impaired. Receivables also comprise accrued interest in respect of assets, receivables in respect of affiliated companies and other receivables.

The Board of Directors determines an overall financial policy and an annual financing strategy, which regulates borrowing and liquidity reserves for specific years and sets the framework for the companies’ credit, foreign exchange, inflation and interest rate exposure. Financial risk management is also supported by operational procedures. The overall objective is to achieve the lowest possible financing expenses for the infrastructure facilities over their useful lives with due regard for an acceptable risk level as acknowledged by the Board of Directors. A long-term perspective has been applied in the balancing of economic performance and the risks associated with financial management. The following describes the companies’ funding in 2017 as well as the key risks. Funding All loans and other financial instruments employed by the companies are underwritten by the Danish state. In general, this means that the companies can achieve capital market terms equivalent to those available to the State, even if the companies do not have an explicit rating from the international credit rating agencies. The adopted financial strategy seeks to maximise funding flexibility in order to take advantage of developments in the capital markets. However, all loan types must adhere to certain criteria partly because of the demands from the guarantor and partly because of internal guidelines set out in the companies’ financial policy. In general, the companies’ loan transactions should consist of common and standardised loan constructions that, as far as possible, limit the credit risk. The loan transactions do not contain any special terms that require disclosure with reference to IFRS 7. In certain cases, lending itself can profitably occur in currencies in which the companies cannot expose themselves to currency risks (see below). In such cases, the loans are translated through currency swaps into acceptable currencies. Thus, there is no direct link between the original loan currencies and the companies’ currency risk. A/S Storebælt has established a standardised MTN (Medium Term Note) loan programme in the European bond market with a maximum borrowing limit of USD 5 billion of which USD 0.6 billion has been utilised. Thus, an available credit limit of USD 4.4 billion remains. In addition, the company has a Swedish MTN programme of SEK 5 billion of which SEK 0.6 billion has been utilised. A/S Øresund has also established a standardised MTN (Medium Term Note) loan programme in the European bond market with a maximum borrowing limit of USD 1 billion of which USD 37 million has been utilised. Thus, an available credit limit of USD 963 million remains. Since 2002, the companies have had access to on-lending, which is a direct loan from Danmarks Nationalbank on behalf of the State to the companies based on a specific government bond, and subject to the same conditions under which the bond is traded in the market. In 2017, funding requirements were mainly covered by on-lending from Danmarks Nationalbank, which was a particularly attractive source of funding. A/S Storebælt raised on-lending to a nominal value of DKK 5.6 billion and A/S Øresund to a nominal value of DKK 2.5 billion. The extent of A/S Storebælt’s funding in any individual year is largely decided by the size of the repayments on the existing debt (refinancing) and the impact from operations. In 2018, such refinancing will amount to approx. DKK 3.5 billion, and the expected net borrowing requirements will be around DKK 5.3 billion. This is beyond what is needed for the financing of any extraordinary repurchase of existing loans and the debt issued to cover collateral demands. The extent of A/S Øresund’s funding in any individual year is largely decided by the size of the repayments on the existing debt (refinancing) and the impact from operations. In 2018, such refinancing will amount to approx. DKK 1.7 billion and the expected net borrowing requirements will be around DKK 1.8 billion. This is beyond what is needed for the financing of any extraordinary repurchase of existing loans and the debt issued to cover collateral demands. The companies have the flexibility to maintain a liquidity reserve of up to 6 months’ liquidity consumption with the objective of reducing the risk of borrowing at times when the general loan terms in the capital markets are temporarily unattractive. Financial risk exposure The companies are exposed to financial risks inherent in the funding of the infrastructures and linked to financial management as well as operational decisions, including bond issuance and loans from credit institutions, the use of derivatives and deposit of liquid funds for liquidity reserve, receivables from customers and trade payables. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 59 Risks relating to these financial risk exposures primarily comprise:  Currency risks  Interest rate risks  Inflation risks  Credit risks  Liquidity risks Financial risks are identified, monitored and controlled within the framework approved by the Board of Directors as determined in the companies’ financial policy and strategy, operational procedures and in accordance with the guidelines from the Danish Ministry of Finance/Danmarks Nationalbank, which has issued guarantees for the companies’ liabilities. Currency risks The companies' exposure to currency risks primarily relates to the part of the net debt denominated in currencies other than the base currency (DKK). Financial derivatives and liquid funds are recognised in the disclosure of the currency risk measured at fair value.

The companies’ currency risks are managed within the limits of the composition of the currency allocation and can be distributed with no constraint between DKK and EUR. Based on the stable Danish fixed exchange rate policy and the relatively narrow fluctuation band vis-a-vis EUR +/2.25 per cent in the ERM2 agreement, exposure to EUR is not considered to represent any substantial risk. The currency distribution between DKK and EUR will, over the coming years, depend on the exchange rate and interest rate relationship between the two currencies. The proportion of other currencies comprise AUD, JPY, NOK, SEK and USD and are attributed to the hedging of bond loans in these currencies where premium/discounts in the currency swap result in an exposure based on market-to-market values although the cash flows are completely hedged. Foreign exchange sensitivity for A/S Storebælt amounted to DKK 28 million in 2017 (DKK 46 million in 2016) calculated as Value-at-Risk. Foreign exchange sensitivity for A/S Øresund amounted to DKK 10 million in 2017 (DKK 16 million in 2016) calculated as Value-at-Risk. Value-at-Risk for foreign exchange sensitivity expresses the maximum loss as a result of an unfavourable development in the exchange rate within one year, with a 95 per cent probability. Value-at-Risk has been calculated based on historical volatility and correlations within one year in the currencies that pose a risk. Interest rate and inflation risks The companies’ financing expenses are exposed to interest rate risks because of the ongoing funding for the refinancing of debts maturing, refixing of interest rates on floating rate debt and deposit of liquidity from operations and investments. The uncertainty arises as a consequence of fluctuations in market interest rates. The companies’ interest rate risk is managed by several lines and limits, and the combination of these limits the interest rate risk on the net debt. For A/S Storebælt, the following framework for 2017 was applied in the interest rate risk management:  Interest rate refixing risk may not exceed 40 per cent of the net debt  Duration target on net debt is 3.25 years (variation limit: 2.5-4.0 years)  Limits for interest rate exposure with fluctuation bands. For A/S Øresund, the following framework for 2017 was applied in the interest rate risk management:  Interest rate refixing risk may not exceed 45 per cent of the net debt  Duration target on net debt is 9.0 years (variation limit: 8.0-10.0 years)  Limits for interest rate exposure with fluctuation bands. The companies' interest rate risk is actively managed through the use of interest rate and currency swaps and other derivative instruments. Floating rate debt or debt with a short remaining maturity imply that the loan must have the interest rate reset at market interest rates within a given time frame, which typically involves higher risks than fixed rate debts with long maturity when fluctuations in the current interest expenses form the basis of the risk management. By contrast, financing expenses are usually a rising function of the maturity, and the choice of debt allocation is thus a question of balancing financing expenses and risk tolerance. The debt allocation between fixed and floating rate nominal debt and real rate debt in conjunction with the maturity profile (maturity on the fixed rate debt) and the currency distribution comprise the uncertainty on the financing expenses. Besides representing an isolated balancing of financing expenses and interest refixing risk on the net debt, the companies’ risk profile is also affected by linkages to the operations. This means that a balancing of risk is targeted across assets and liabilities with the aim of achieving a lower risk by combining the debt mix so that there is a positive correlation between operating revenue and financing expenses. This relationship was evident in the downturn that followed the financial crisis, when a sluggish trend in traffic revenues was offset by lower financing expenses. Typically, floating rate debt and real rate debt have a positive correlation with general economic growth because monetary policy will often seek to balance the economic cycle by hiking interest rates when economic growth and inflation are high – and vice versa. The economic relationship between operating revenue and financing expenses justifies some proportion of floating rate debt. Developments in road traffic revenue, which is the primary income source, are particularly dependent on economic conditions and low economic growth typically entails low traffic growth, and thus a less favourable development in revenue. This revenue risk can, to a certain extent, be offset by a high proportion of floating rate debt in that adverse economic trends normally lead to lower interest rates, notably at the short end of the maturity spectrum. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 61 Fixed rate debt may, on the other hand, serve as a hedge against stagflation, with low growth and high inflation, which cannot be passed on to the tolls for crossing the bridge. Furthermore, the companies have a strategic interest in real rate debt where the financing expenses comprise a fixed real rate plus indexation dependent upon general inflation. The reason is that operating income, by and large, can be expected to follow inflation developments as both road tolls and rail revenue are normally indexed. Real rate debt, therefore, represents a very low risk and functions as a hedge of operating revenue and the companies’ long-term project risk. Based on the overall financial management objective to attain the lowest possible financing expenses within a risk level approved by the Board of Directors – the companies have established a strategic benchmark for the debt portfolio’s interest rate allocation and the nominal duration. This benchmark serves as an overall guideline and a financial framework for the debt management and implies that the companies target a real rate debt allocation of 25-45 per cent and for 2017, the duration on the nominal debt was set at 3.25 years for A/S Storebælt and 9.0 years for A/S Øresund. The calculation of the duration will be assessed without discounting. Maximum variation limits for the interest rate allocation and duration target are established. The basis for determining the strategic benchmark in the debt management is economic model simulations that estimate the outcome and expected earnings development of the companies’ assets and liabilities on a large number of relevant portfolio combinations with different interest rate allocations and maturity profiles and consists of a balancing of financing expenses with revenue risk. Besides the above-mentioned strategic elements, the interest rate risk is also managed on the basis of the expectations for short-term interest rate developments and an isolated balancing of financing expenses and interest rate refixing risk on the nominal debt. For A/S Storebælt, the target for the duration on the nominal debt was 3.25 years for 2017 and the actual duration was between 2.9 years to 4.9 years. In respect of the Storebælt toll fee reduction, the target for the duration has been temporarily suspended. The duration of the strategic benchmark for 2018 has been temporarily overridden for A/S Storebælt as a consequence of the political agreement on a toll fee reduction, which extends the repayment period. The aim is to cover two-thirds of Storebælt’s debt development and the final determination of the framework awaits the mix between nominal and real interest coverage. For A/S Øresund, the target for the duration on the nominal debt was 9.00 years in 2017 and the actual duration was between 9.2 years and 9.8 years and was predominately overweighted in relation to the benchmark. The existing interest rate hedging on the nominal debt was extended in tandem with the debt refinancing and the maturing fixed rate exposure. For A/S Øresund, the duration on the strategic benchmark for 2018 is maintained at 9.00 years and the target for the real rate debt ratio remains unchanged. The long-term interest rates were fairly stable in 2017. The companies are exposed to interest rates in DKK and EUR, and interest rates on long maturities have risen by 0.15-0.30 percentage points. The development in interest rates has led to an unrealised gain of DKK 405 million for A/S Storebælt. The development in interest rates has led to an unrealised gain of DKK 263 million for A/S Øresund. The management of the interest rate risk aims at attaining the lowest possible longer-term financing expenses with no specific regard for the annual fluctuations in the fair value adjustment. The fair value adjustment has, however, no impact on the companies’ economy, including the repayment period. The yield exposure on the net debt is based on the nominal value (the notional) split in time buckets at the earliest of the time to maturity or the time to the next interest rate refixing. Thus, the floating rate debt is included in the next financial year and shows the cash flow exposure to the interest refixing risk. The companies use derivatives to adjust the allocation between floating and fixed rate nominal debt and real rate debt, including, primarily, interest rate and currency swaps, FRAs and interest rate guarantees. 62 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Yield exposure disclosed in nominal notional amounts 2017, A/S Storebælt 0-1 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 >5 Nominal Fair Yield buckets years years years years years years value value Cash at bank and in hand 186 968 0 0 0 0 1,154 1,168 Bond loans and other loans -3,275 -4,579 -2,205 -2,251 0 -7,847 -20,157 -21,662 Interest rate and currency swaps -3,629 1,639 716 959 0 -650 -965 -1,463 Forward exchange contracts 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -3 Other derivatives 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -110 Credit institutions -110 0 0 0 0 0 -110 0 Net debt -6,828 -1,972 -1,489 -1,292 0 -8,497 -20,078 -22,070 Of this, real rate instruments: Real rate debt 0 -1,634 -549 0 0 -1,578 -3,761 -4,062 Real rate swaps 0 -3,306 549 0 0 -2,749 -5,506 -6,284 Real rate instruments total 0 -4,940 0 0 0 -4,327 -9,267 -10,346 Yield exposure > 5 years is allocated as follows: 5-10 10-15 15-20 > 20 Yield buckets years years years years Net debt -4,637 -3,860 0 0 Of which real rate instruments -3,980 -347 0 0 Yield exposure disclosed in nominal notional amounts 2016, A/S Storebælt 0-1 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 >5 Nominal Fair Yield buckets years years years years years years value value Cash at bank and in hand 558 371 0 0 0 0 929 936 Bond loans and other loans -6,774 -3,245 -4,559 -1,273 -1,522 -3,985 -21,358 -23,387 Interest rate and currency swaps -489 2,501 1,686 -214 232 -4,458 -742 -1,333 Forward exchange contracts 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -2 Other derivatives 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -5 Credit institutions 192 0 0 0 0 0 192 192 Net debt -6,513 -373 -2,873 -1,487 -1,290 -8,443 -20,979 -23,599 Of this, real rate instruments: Real rate debt 0 0 -1,609 -555 0 -1,557 -3,721 -4,114 Real rate swaps 0 0 -3,264 555 0 -2,708 -5,417 -6,364 Real rate instruments 0 0 -4,873 0 0 -4,265 -9,138 -10,478 Yield exposure > 5 years is allocated as follows: 5-10 10-15 15-20 > 20 Yield buckets years years years years Net debt -7,928 -515 0 0 Of which real rate instruments -3,922 -343 0 0 The fixed-rate nominal debt beyond five years is primarily exposed to yield exposure in the 7 to 10-year yield segment.

The financing expenses’ sensitivity to an interest rate or inflation rate change of 1 percentage point can be estimated at DKK 20 million and DKK 45 million respectively, and the impact will be symmetrical since there is no optionality in the hedging of the variable interest rate and with the current inflation level, the lower limit from a sold “floor” on the inflation indexation (principal EUR 190 million) is not effective. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 65 When interest rates change, this affects the market value (fair value) of the net debt and, in this respect, the impact and risk are greater on fixed rate debt with long maturities. This is primarily owing to the discounting effect and offsets the alternative cost or gain relating to fixed rate debt obligations in comparison to financing at current market interest rates. The duration denotes the average remaining maturity on the net debt. A long duration implies a low interest rate refixing risk since a relatively small proportion of the net debt needs to be reset to the current interest rate. The duration also expresses the interest rate sensitivity on the net debt stated at market value.

A/S Storebælt’s duration totalled 4.4 years at the end of 2017, of which 4.7 years relates to the nominal debt and 4.1 years to the real rate debt. Rate sensitivity can be calculated at DKK 9.7 million, when the yield curve is shifted in parallel by 1bp. This will imply a positive fair value adjustment in the income statement and balance sheet when interest rates rise by 1bp, and vice versa. As regards A/S Storebælt, the fair value adjustment’s sensitivity to an interest rate change of 1 percentage point can be calculated as a fair value loss of DKK 1,022 million with an interest rate fall and a fair value gain of DKK 930 million with an interest rate rise.

A/S Øresund’s duration totalled 9.7 years at the end of 2017 of which 7.9 years relate to the nominal debt and 12.2 years to the real rate debt. Rate sensitivity can be calculated at DKK 12.3 million, when the yield curve is shifted in parallel by 1bp. This will imply a positive fair value adjustment in the income statement and balance sheet when interest rates rise by 1bp, and vice versa. As regards A/S Øresund, the fair value adjustment’s sensitivity to an interest rate change of 1 percentage point can be calculated as a fair value loss of DKK 1,393 million with an interest rate fall and a fair value gain of DKK 1,172 million with an interest rate rise. The calculated sensitivity to interest rate changes on the fair value adjustment takes account of the convexity of the debt portfolio. The sensitivity calculations have been made on the basis of the net debt on the balance sheet date, and the impact is similar in result and balance sheet as a result of the accounting policies where financial assets and liabilities are recognised at fair value. Credit risks Credit risks are defined as the risk of losses arising as a result of a counterparty not meeting its payment obligations. Credit risks arise in connection with the deposit of excess liquidity, receivables from derivative transactions and trade receivables. The credit policy for the deposit of excess liquidity has continuously been tightened with increased requirements for rating, credit limits and maximum duration. The companies have, to the greatest possible extent, limited excess liquidity and have only had deposits in banks with high credit ratings or invested liquidity in German government bonds for pledging collateral. There have been no incidents of overdue payments as a result of credit events. Companies' derivative transactions are regulated by an ISDA master agreement with each counterparty, and it is explicitly set out that netting of positive and negative balances will apply. The credit risk on financial counterparties is managed and monitored on a daily basis through a specific line and limit system which has been approved by the Board of Directors in respect of the companies’ financial policy and determines the principles for calculating these risks and limits for acceptable credit exposures. The allocation of limits for acceptable credit exposures is determined on the basis of the counterparty’s long-term rating by either Standard and Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) or Fitch Ratings. 66 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S The credit risk is limited to the greatest possible extent by diversifying the counterparty exposure and reducing the risk exposure to individual counterparties. The financial counterparties must adhere to high standards for credit quality and agreements are only entered into with counterparties that have a long-term rating above A3/A-. At year end, the rating requirement was relaxed to BBB/Baa2, provided that a number of strict collateral requirements were met and that the counterparty is resident in a country with a minimum AA/Aa2 rating. The companies have entered into collateral agreements (CSA agreements) with the majority of the financial counterparties and since 2005 have only entered into derivative contracts that are regulated by such agreements. The CSA agreements are two-way and imply that both the company and the counterparty must pledge collateral in the form of government bonds or mortgage bonds with high credit quality when the balance is in favour of one of the parties. The parties have title of right to the collateral with mandatory return of income and securities in the absence of bankruptcy. Credit exposure is effectively limited by low threshold values for unhedged receivables and greater collateral is required for counterparties with lower credit quality, i.e. with a requirement for supplementary collateral for lower ratings. The bonds, provided as collateral, must have a minimum rating of Aa3/AA-. The companies are not covered by EMIR's central clearing obligation for derivative transactions. The IFRS accounting standard stipulates that the credit risk is calculated gross excluding netting (the offsetting of positive and negative balances for each counterparty), even though such agreements exist. Net exposure is given as additional information and constitutes a better measure of the companies' actual credit risk.

Repayments, principal amounts and interest payments are disclosed for the net debt and neither refinancing nor cash flows from operating activities is included, c.f. IFRS 7. 70 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Note 24 Profitability A/S Storebælt A/S Storebælt’s debt will be repaid from the revenue from road and rail traffic. As a basis for calculating the repayment period in the long-term profitability calculations, the company uses a real rate of 3.0% on the part of the debt that is not hedged, whereas the interest-hedged debt is included in the agreed interest rate terms. As part of the Finance Act 2016, the annual fee payable by the rail companies for their use of the fixed links across Storebælt and Øresund was adjusted downwards. With respect to A/S Storebælt, the reduction was in the order of DKK 270 million in 2016. From and including 2016, the amount depends on actual train traffic whereas previously, it was a fixed amount determined by the Finance Act. On 21 September 2017, a political agreement was entered into concerning a toll fee reduction on the Storebælt fixed link. Moreover, that A/S Storebælt shall contribute to the financing of the expansion of the Funen Motorway between Nr. Aaby and Odense Vest in the sum of DKK 2.1 billion. The fees will be reduced by 15 per cent on 1 January 2018 increasing to 25 per cent when the expansion of the Funen Motorway is complete in 2022. Seen in isolation, the consequences of the toll fee reduction and the co-financing of the Funen Motorway for A/S Storebælt's economy mean an extension of the repayment period by 5 years. However, this should be counterbalanced by the operational efficiency of the Storebælt link as well as lower interest expenses. The repayment period is 34 years in total, which means that the debt is expected to be repaid in 2032. This will extend the repayment period by four years compared to the previous financial statements. Co-financing of the political agreement, “A Green Transport Policy , from 29 January 2009 is included in the repayment period calculation. With this, the company pays dividends to the State of DKK 9.0 billion (in 2008 prices) up to the financial year 2022 and ceases to do so after fulfilment of the agreement. A/S Storebælt’s contribution to the co-financing of the Funen Motorway in the sum of DKK 2.1 billion (2018 prices) will be covered by the dividend to the State. After distribution of an expected dividend of DKK 1,452 billion to the State for the 2017 financial year, the company will have distributed a total dividend of DKK 5,652 billion to the shareholder The main uncertainties in the profitability calculations relate to the long-term traffic development and the real rate. Traffic growth is expected to average between 1 and 1.5 per cent for lorries and passenger cars respectively. Operating expenses are based on assumed annual efficiencies of 2 per cent per annum over the next five years whereafter they are expected to rise in line with inflation. Moreover, there is some uncertainty in relation to the size and timing of reinvestments in the rail link. A/S Øresund The investment in the Øresund fixed link’s landworks will be repaid in part through payment from Banedanmark for use of the Øresund rail line and in part through dividend payments from Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S of which A/S Øresund owns 50 per cent. A/S Øresund has also been affected by the above-mentioned changes in the 2016 Budget where the annual payment for the railway companies’ use of the fixed links will be gradually reduced over the coming years. In addition, A/S Øresund is obliged to pay the Danish state’s rail contribution to Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S until 2024 on a gradual basis. As a basis for calculating the repayment period in the long-term profitability calculations, the company applies a real rate of 3.0% on the part of the debt that is not hedged, whereas the interest-hedged debt is included in the agreed interest rate terms. Moreover, as a result of the joint taxation with the Group’s other companies, A/S Øresund obtains a cash flow advantage. This is because joint taxation with A/S Storebælt means that A/S Storebælt can immediately offset A/S Øresund’s tax loss against paying the proceeds of the tax savings to A/S Øresund. A/S Øresund can thus forward the use of its tax loss over time. The repayment period for A/S Øresund is now calculated at 50 years, which is 1 year less than last year, primarily due to lower financing expenses. The repayment period for A/S Øresund is sensitive to changes in the economics of the Øresund project and in the joint taxation and divided policy of the Group. Fehmarnbelt project On 11 February 2016, Femern A/S published a new financial analysis of the Fehmarnbelt project’s overall economy (coast-to-coast link and the Danish landworks). The analysis shows that the total construction budget amounts to DKK 62.1 billion (2015 prices) which includes total reserves of DKK 9.5 billion. The budget is divided as follows: the coast-to-coast link DKK 52.6 billion of which reserves of DKK 7.3 billion and the Danish landworks of DKK 9.5 billion of which reserves of DKK 2.2 billion. The repayment period is calculated at 36 years from the date of commissioning. An analysis of reserves and risk apportionment for the Fehmarnbelt link, which was carried out by the consultancy firm, EY, was published on 8 February 2016. It confirms that the size and proportion of the reserves are appropriate.

At year end, work under contracts amounted to DKK 333 million (DKK 384 million in 2016). In connection with Femern A/S entering into conditional contracts for the construction of the Fehmarnbelt tunnel, the company has a contingent liability of DKK 197 million (2015 prices) relating to the conditional contracts. The Act on construction and operation of a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt with associated landworks in Denmark was adopted by the Danish Parliament on 28 April 2015. The Act authorises A/S Femern Landanlæg to build and operate the Danish landworks associated with a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt. With the issue of the statutory order on the delegation of certain tasks and powers concerning the construction and operation of a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt with associated landworks in Denmark on 17 September 2015, client responsibility was assigned to Banedanmark while A/S Femern Landanlæg remains responsible for the ownership and financing of the landworks. The notes to the Construction Act stipulate that a reassessment of the overall economics of the project, including an updated risk assessment, are to be submitted to the political parties behind the Fehmarnbelt project before construction work can begin. The total cost of the upgrading of the Danish landworks is budgeted at DKK 9.5 billion (2015 prices). Based on the political agreement by the political parties behind the Fehmarnbelt link of 4 March 2016, the company is authorised to begin work on the Ringsted-Nykøbing Falster railway line so that the section is upgraded to dual track with new signalling systems by 2021 and electrified by 2024. The section between Nykøbing Falster and Holeby near Rødby will be extended, so that the section will be complete before the opening of the coast-to-coast link. These works are budgeted at DKK 7.5 billion (2015 prices) and contractual obligations are primarily assigned to Banedanmark. Operating leasing comprises contracts with a maturity of between 1-7 years. The leasing liability totals DKK 131.6 million (DKK 203.7 million in 2016) of which DKK 27.5 million falls due in 2018. In accordance with the Act on Ferry Operations, A/S Storebælt is required, within a specified extent, to maintain car ferry operations between Zealand and Jutland across Kattegat and between Spodsbjerg and Tårs. For the Spodsbjerg and Tårs service, this means that the company has signed a contract with Danske Færger A/S concerning the operation of the service until 30 April 2018. In 2016, the Spodsbjerg-Tårs service was put up for tender. Danske Færger A/S won the tender and will thus remain the operator of the Spodsbjerg-Tårs service after expiry of the current contract. The contract becomes effective from 1 May 2018 and applies for 10 years with the option of a further two years. In 2018, costs are expected to amount to DKK 35 million. As part of the authorities’ approval of Sprogø Offshore Wind Farm, A/S Storebælt is obliged to dismantle the wind turbines 25 years from the date of establishment. At the present time, considerable uncertainty is attached to estimating the financial implications. In October 2014, the EU Commission ruled on the complaint concerning state subsidies to Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S. The Commission found that Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S is covered by the rules on state subsidies, and that the specific state subsidy in the form of state guarantees and, in Denmark's case, the special tax rules, are compatible with the EU Treaty. In February 2015, Scandlines Øresund etc. took the EU Commission's decision on Danish state subsidies to Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S to the General Court of the European Union. The case has now been argued before the Court and a decision is awaited. The case also includes the tax regulations to which the Sund & Bælt Group is subject. At present, it is not possible to estimate the financial consequences. As previously stated, Scandlines filed a complaint with the European Commission concerning alleged unlawful state subsidies for the Fehmarnbelt project, primarily because of the state guarantees in respect of the Fehmarnbelt project’s borrowing, etc. In July 2015, the EU Commission rejected the complaint and declared that the guarantees etc. are fully compatible with EU state subsidy rules. In the event that the Fehmarnbelt project needs to raise state-guaranteed loans 55 years after the opening of the fixed link, the Commission must be notified accordingly. Scandlines and others have challenged this decision before the European Court of the First Instance. Scandlines has subsequently filed two further cases against the Commission before the Court partly concerning annulment of a ruling of September 2016 relating to a a number of other objections, partly concerning alleged inactivity relating to lack of evaluation of other objections. The Fehmarnbelt project is not aware of when the Court will rule on the cases. The Court’s decisions may be appealed to the European Court of Justice. At present, it is not possible to estimate the financial consequences. A/S Storebælt, A/S Øresund and A/S Femern Landanlæg have entered into two-way collateral agreements (CSA agreements) with a number of financial counterparties and must pledge collateral in the form of government bonds for outstanding exposure from derivative contracts in the counterparties’ favour. A/S Storebælt has currently pledged collateral for DKK 945 million to hedge outstanding exposure from derivative transactions in favour of three counterparties. A/S Øresund has currently pledged collateral for DKK 289 million to hedge outstanding exposure from derivative transactions in favour of two counterparties. A/S Femern Landanlæg has received collateral for EUR 54 million as security for outstanding exposure from derivative contracts with two financial counterparties in its favour. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S is the management company in a Danish joint taxation agreement. According to corporate tax legislation, the company is jointly and severally liable, from and including 2013, with the other jointly taxed companies for corporation tax of DKK 42 million and from and including 1 July 2012 for any liabilities for holding tax on interest, royalties and dividend for the jointly taxed companies. Otherwise, the Group’s companies have not pledged any collateral.

Companies are usually rated with a short The exchange of payments between two counterparties – typically and a long rating that expresses the company’s ability to settle its a company and a bank. A company may, for example, raise a fixed liabilities in the short-term and the long-term respectively. The interest loan and subsequently enter a swap with the bank by rating follows a scale, with AAA being the best rating, AA the which the company receives fixed interest corresponding to the second best etc. The Danish state, which guarantees the liabilities interest on the loan and pays variable interest +/a premium. The of Storebælt and the Øresund fixed link, has the highest credit company’s net obligation will be the payment of the variable rating: AAA. The largest credit rating agencies are Moody's and interest +/the premium. Such transactions are called swaps. In a Standard & Poor's. currency swap, payments in two different currencies are Real rate exchanged. Interest rate and currency swaps may also be The nominal interest rate minus inflation. combined. Denominated ... issued in ... A bond can be issued (denominated) in EUR, but carry interest related to an amount in DKK. Cap/floor structure A cap is an agreement that allows a borrower to choose the maximum interest rate payable over a set period. A floor is the opposite of a cap. A floor restricts the interest rates from falling below a certain level. Accordingly, if a cap/floor has been entered into, the maximum and minimum interest to be paid has been fixed (interest can only fluctuate within a certain interval). Collar structure Another term for a cap/floor structure. A zero-cost collar, for example, is purchase of a cap financed by the sale of a floor. If the market rates increase, a cap has been set for the amount of interest to be paid. By contrast, there is no benefit if interest rates fall below the floor. Cap hedge Hedging of significant interest rate increases on the variable rate debt against payment of a premium. Is used as an alternative to entering a fixed rate for the entire loan period. Interest-bearing net debt The interest-bearing net debt comprises financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost, excluding interest due and receivable under accruals and deferred income. Fair value Fair value is the accounting term for market value and expresses current purchase and selling rates on financial assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value can be primarily attributed to developments in the level of interest rate, exchange rates and inflation. Fair value adjustment An accounting principle in financial reporting requiring the value of assets/liabilities to be determined at their market value (fair value) i.e. the value at which an asset could be sold or a liability settled in the market. In the period between the raising and repayment of loans the fair value will change as interest rates change.
