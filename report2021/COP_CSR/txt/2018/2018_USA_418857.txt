Our quality nutrients play an important role in nourishing farmers’ soil, growing healthy plants, and improving global food security. PHOSPHATES We are the largest integrated phosphate producer in the world and one of the largest producers and marketers of phosphate-based animal feed ingredients in the United States. We sell phosphate-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients throughout North America and internationally. We account for approximately 14 percent of estimated global annual production and 75 percent of estimated North American annual production of concentrated phosphate nutrients. POTASH We are one of the four largest potash producers in the world. We sell potash throughout North America and internationally, principally as fertilizer, but also for use in industrial applications and, to a lesser degree, as animal feed ingredients. We account for approximately 13 percent of estimated annual global potash production and 39 percent of estimated North American annual potash production. INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTION Our International Distribution segment consists of sales offices, crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities, port terminals, and warehouses in Brazil, Paraguay, India and China. We also have a single superphosphate (SSP) plant in Brazil that produces crop nutrients by mixing sulfuric acid with phosphate rock. Our international distribution segment serves as a distribution outlet for our Phosphates and Potash segments, but also purchases and markets certain products from other suppliers, generally to complement sales of our own product. See our website for a full list of our phosphate, potash, premium crop nutrient and animal feed products. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 11 GENERAL STANDARD DISCLOSURES 102-4 Location of Operations We mine phosphate rock in Florida and process rock into finished phosphate products at facilities in Florida and Louisiana. We mine potash in Saskatchewan and New Mexico. We have other production, blending and distribution operations in Brazil, China, India and Paraguay, as well as strategic equity investments in a phosphate rock mine in the Bayovar region in Peru and a joint venture formed to develop a phosphate rock mine and chemical complexes in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Mosaic conducts business through wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as businesses in which we own less than a majority or a non-controlling interest. In 2017, we were organized into three reportable business segments: Phosphates, Potash and International Distribution. Additional information about our business and operating segments is provided in our Form 10–K. GLOBAL OPERATIONS POTASH PHOSPHATE DISTRIBUTION CENTER JOINT VENTURE OFFICE 102-8 Information on employees and other workers As of December 31, 2017, Mosaic employed 8,225 regular employees.

See our 2017 Form 10-K for more information about our supply chain. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 13 GENERAL STANDARD DISCLOSURES 102-10 Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain •  In January 2017, Mosaic's Colonsay facility resumed potash production after idling production in 2016 in response to market conditions. Employees returned to their positions on or before December 2016 to perform maintenance and ramp up projects. • In July 2017, Kimberly Bors joined Mosaic as Senior Vice President—Human Resources. • In October 2017, we announced the temporary idling of our Plant City, Florida phosphate manufacturing facility for at least one year. Approximately 150 employees were transferred to positions at other facilities. In 2017, we also restructured our Phosphates and Corporate operations, reducing our workforce by approximately 280 positions as part of an ongoing cost savings initiative. Additionally, as a result of these changes, approximately 120 employees accepted offers of early retirement. Employees who were impacted by job loss were provided notice, severance packages and career transition services. •  We discontinued operations at our Houston, TX facility in 2017 and expect to sell the facility in 2018. Of the 12 employees that worked at that facility at the time of its closure, one was transferred to another facility, one is still employed at the Houston facility while it remains in caretaker status, and 10 were notified that they no longer have employment with Mosaic and provided severance packages. 102-12 External initiatives Mosaic recognizes the importance of being active in industry associations and cross-sector business forums.

A team of employees, overseen by a Vice President of Public Affairs, manages sustainability initiatives on a day-to-day basis. The Mosaic Company Senior Leadership Team (SLT), led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, is primarily responsible for managing profit and loss and delivering growth. Implementation and delivery of Mosaic’s business strategy and plan are monitored by SLT members. The SLT is supported in matters of sustainability by leading vice president and director-level employees who are accountable for ensuring goals are achieved through site-specific, business segment and companywide implementation.

Reporting Practice 102-46 Defining report content and Topic Boundaries 102-47 List of material topics 103-1 Topics and Topic Boundaries As a global, publicly traded company, we are continually exploring what it means to be responsible and accountable to Mosaic’s diverse stakeholders. From employees, customers, shareholders and industry partners to trade unions, community organizations, government officials and academics, we seek ongoing dialogue with individuals and representatives of stakeholder organizations that impact—or are impacted by—Mosaic’s business activities. Topics and indicators that reflect Mosaic’s significant economic, environmental and social impacts or that would substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders are deemed by us to be “significant” for sustainability reporting purposes. Accountability’s AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard guided the review process that reflects our company’s commitment to more fully inform all stakeholders on matters that influence our business and society. In addition to analyzing peer sustainability reports, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and the Mining and Metals sector supplement, as well as other reports and frameworks, our ongoing analysis includes: • Reviewing Mosaic’s public financial reports, sustainability reports, GRI tables, policies and commitments as well as an internally conducted survey of senior management, customers and employees • Scanning media reports, social media and blogs for issues raised for public concern • Engaging leaders of local, regional, national and global community organizations • Comparing sustainability materiality determination practices to peer companies • Cataloging issues identified by stakeholder surveys, sustainability indexes, principles of the United Nations Global Compact, regulatory and policy trends, industry associations and cross-sector partnerships • Reviewing marketing research and customer satisfaction survey results • Analyzing investor insights • Compiling community perceptions through social media activity and brand awareness surveys 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 18 GENERAL STANDARD DISCLOSURES Significant issues are structured around and summarized in five areas of our sustainability focus: Food, Environment, People, Company and Community. Please see our 2017 State of the Business Report for relevant updates in each of these areas. Mosaic team members originally evaluated the significance of more than 50 issues based on their relevancy and importance to stakeholders, the likelihood of impact and the connection to Mosaic’s business strategies and values. We monitor these issues on an ongoing basis as part of the process described above. Our goals and reporting continue to evolve as we refine our understanding and identify further material issues. Full disclosures of management approach precede the disclosure of the respective topic. Boundaries for each topic are listed below.

Our report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. The content of this report has been shaped by the issues identified through a significance study, the results of which we analyze on an ongoing basis. This report primarily summarizes the activities occurring in the period of calendar year 2017 and, unless otherwise noted, all data is presented on a calendar year (CY) basis. In 2013, Mosaic changed our fiscal year-end to December 31 from May 31. Accordingly, some historical data is presented on a fiscal year (FY) basis. We encourage readers to refer to our Form 10–K and the remainder of our 2017 State of the Business Report for additional information about Mosaic. This report covers our global operations, including entities over which Mosaic exercises majority control, including all its operations and departments that have the potential to generate significant impacts. Except for financial and select environmental data, this report does not specifically reflect equity-method investments, including joint ventures. Please see our Form 10–K (page F-57) for more information about those investments. A revision was made in the 2017 State of the Business Report to our 2016 Criteria Air and Other Pollutants data. These values now accurately reflect our reported emissions for our Potash and Phosphate operations in North America. Reporting and transparency have been integral parts of our sustainability journey. In response to evolving stakeholder needs, we have made a few significant changes to our report. • We moved our full GRI index and Standards report to a PDF for easier navigation.We also aligned our content index to many of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) metrics for the Metals & Mining and Chemicals industries. • Key 2017 sustainability highlights in the focus areas of Food, Environment, People, Company and Community are available within the pages of Mosaic's 2017 State of the Business Report. Mosaic commissioned iCompli, a division of BPA Worldwide, to provide independent third-party assurance over the sustainability content within the Mosaic 2017 sustainability disclosure (the “Report,” covering activities occurring in the period of calendar year 2017). This engagement has been managed in accordance with AccountAbility’s AA1000AS (2008) assurance standard, where the format of the engagement was structured to meet the AA1000AS Type I (Moderate) requirements. Mosaic authorized Trucost Plc to perform a third-party verification of waste, energy, water withdrawals and greenhouse gas emissions data and calculations of Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions for 2017. Trucost evaluated Mosaic’s data, methodologies and calculations, and provided a statement of assurance to the AA1000AS standard. Throughout the report, “tonnes” refers to the metric ton unit of measurement equaling approximately 2,204.6 pounds, whereas the occasional reference to “tons” refers to the unit of measurement equaling 2,000 pounds. References to sulfur are in “long tons,” which is equal to 2,240 pounds. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 20 ECONOMIC Management Approach: Economic Performance Since forming in 2004, Mosaic has grown to be a global leader in phosphates and potash crop nutrition. We are proud to be a competitive, low-cost producer with strong customer relationships and the financial strength to invest in growth. We’ve led the industry in developing high-quality premium products that help growers succeed. We are focused on executing against our strategic priorities: developing, engaging and empowering our people; growing and strengthening our business; and creating value for stakeholders. Mosaic’s sustainability targets are closely aligned with our operational and financial goals. We respond annually to CDP and use the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework with the Mining and Metals Sector Disclosure to report on our environmental and sustainability performance. This year we've aligned our sustainability disclosure index to many of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) metrics for the Metals & Mining and Chemicals industries. We believe it is our responsibility to utilize our financial resources, technical expertise and innovative spirit to help the world sustainably grow the food it needs through strategic partnerships with leading organizations. Our community investments are focused in the areas of food, water and local initiatives. • FOOD: Mosaic is committed to supporting organizations that advance global agricultural development, agricultural research and education, and hunger relief for community members in need. These programs, respectively, include: The Mosaic Villages Project in India; micronutrient deficiency research and mobile soil testing labs; and food drives, food distribution trucks and school backpack programs. • WATER: Mosaic supports organizations that work in watershed restoration, habitat conservation and nutrient stewardship. These programs, respectively, include: shoreline restoration and oyster reef installations; improved land management practices and wildlife protection; and 4R nutrient stewardship, which is best management practices for fertilizer application, minimizing field runoff and improving farmer yields. • LOCAL: Mosaic supports philanthropic or civic partnerships that enrich the long-term strength of communities in which Mosaic has offices and operations. These programs, respectively, include: local schools, health care institutions, museums; special projects and sponsorship of events; and housing and disaster relief. For more information on our management approach and financial progress, please see our Form 10–K and the remainder of our 2017 State of the Business Report. We support a variety of formal and informal Mosaic channels through which stakeholders can submit concerns, including communicating with the Board of Directors. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 21 ECONOMIC 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE (IN MILLIONS) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Revenue $9,021.4 $9,055.8 $8,895.3 $7,162.8 $7,409.4 OPERATING COSTS (IN MILLIONS) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Cost of Goods Sold $7,006.0 $7,129.2 $7,177.4 $6,352.8 $6,566.6 Selling, General and $393.5 $382.4 $361.2 $304.2 $301.3 Administrative Expenses Less: Unrealized Gain/Loss on $(0.4) $32.0 $31.9 $(70.0) $12.4 Derivatives Less: Depreciation, Depletion $655.6 $750.9 $739.8 $711.2 $665.5 and Amortization *Less: Wages and Benefits $927.8 $1,429.3 $1,441.5 $1,358.1 $1,435.2 Total Operating Costs $5,816.5 $5,299.4 $5,325.4 $ 4,657.7 $ 4,754.8 Wages and Benefits $927.8 $1,429.3 $1,441.5 $1,358.1 $1,435.2 *Mosaic Cost of Goods Sold and Selling, General and Administrative expenses from the Form 10–K include wages and benefits.

Establishing a standardized grant making system with stated guidelines and policies online has provided greater transparency to our partners, shareholders, employees and communities. Through this system, grantees provide reports on their outcomes, enabling Mosaic to evaluate the effectiveness of each grant. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 23 ECONOMIC 201-2 Financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organization’s activities due to climate change Mosaic’s “Commitment on Climate Change” acknowledges that global climate change creates uncertainty for our business and poses challenges for the health and well-being of the world’s populations—ecologically, socially and economically. The potential financial implications with regard to the physical changes associated with climate change, as well as potential regulatory response changes, are discussed in Mosaic’s 2017 CDP Climate Change Response and in Mosaic’s Form 10–K. 201-3 Defined benefit plan obligations and other retirement plans BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATION (IN MILLIONS) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Pension Plan Obligation $728.0 $828.4 $731.2 $713.5 $766.1 Fair Value of Plan Assets $736.9 $812.1 $726.7 $715.6 $793.2 NOTE: Please refer to the discussion of our defined benefit pension plans in our Form 10–K.

Our operating communities are also our homes—where we live, work and raise children. We strive to be a thoughtful and engaged neighbor, investing carefully and generously as we seek long-term partnerships with organizations that are making a difference. Mosaic is dedicated to advancing the many ways that our business contributes to the sustainable development of the communities where we operate: investing in communities; hiring employees and contracting vendors from local communities; offering competitive wages and benefits to our workforce; and developing our future workforce. INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES The Mosaic Company, The Mosaic Company Foundation and The Mosaic Institute in Brazil partner with industry associations, nonprofit groups and stakeholders focused on food, water and local initiatives. We are especially committed to the strength and prosperity of the communities where we have offices and operations, including North America, South America and Asia. Our financial support is magnified by employee volunteerism and community involvement. HIRING EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTING VENDORS FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES As a matter of practice, and in accordance with Mosaic’s global job posting policies, we will “hire from within wherever possible.” In addition, Mosaic initiates and conducts its search for qualified candidates locally, before the search is broadened. Mosaic’s mining and production operations take place in communities of varying size throughout North America. Mosaic does not have a written policy for giving preference to locally-based suppliers, but we do encourage and support local suppliers of all sizes. As a global company, the vendor screening process we have in place ensures that we maintain strict ethics, quality and safety standards, which can be challenging for small companies to meet. In an effort to support more local suppliers, we engage them, build partnerships, and explore opportunities to build capacity. Our Supplier Code of Conduct and Ethics outlines the standards of business integrity to which we hold ourselves and our suppliers accountable. OFFERING COMPETITIVE WAGES AND BENEFITS TO OUR WORKFORCE Our global talent investment philosophy is to provide competitive compensation and benefits, with flexibility to choose programs that best meet our employees’ needs. DEVELOPING OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE Skilled labor is a key priority in the geographies where we operate. We work with governments and institutions to help train skilled labor to develop the knowledge required to support Mosaic’s future workforce. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 26 ECONOMIC 202-1 Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage at significant locations of operation Mosaic offers competitive compensation and benefits in each of the company’s significant locations of operation. As shown below in local currency, the standard entry-level wage range is higher than the prevailing local minimum wage for each location presented. For Mosaic, minimum wages are generally not relevant since the majority of entry-level Mosaic positions require a higher level of skills or knowledge than jobs to which the minimum wage rate would apply. 2017 MOSAIC LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE COMPARED TO LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE MOSAIC ENTRY LEVEL WAGE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE MOSAIC ENTRY-LEVEL WAGES* RELATIVE TO LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE $15.58 – $28.55 (hourly) U.S. Range/hr (USD) $7.25 – $9.50 157% $11.35 – $18.08 (salaried) $29.98 – $32.78 (hourly) Canada Range/hr (CAD) $10.96 145% $15.94 – $24.04 (salaried) Brazil Range/hr (BRL) $4.50 – $7.27 $5.44 – $12.71 149% China Range/hr (CNY) $9.48 – $11.49 $20.70 – $34.48 218% India Range/hr (INR) $47.75 – $57.29 $173.16 – $287.60 363% Paraguay Range/hr (PGY) $8,291.16 $9,009.61 $9,835.05 114% *Mosaic does not set starting wages based on gender. 202-2 Proportion of senior management hired from the local community at significant locations of operation As a matter of practice, we will “hire from within wherever possible.” For senior leader roles, if no internal candidates are identified, a search will be conducted externally to find the best candidate for the leader role. The hire may or may not come from one of the communities where we have a local presence. These candidates are also supported with relocation assistance. In 2017 our operations hired 13 senior leaders—eight of whom were hired externally and five hired internally. Six of the eight external hires came from local communities. For the purpose of this indicator, “significant locations of operation” refers to United States, Canada and Brazil. “Senior leader” is defined as those individuals who are responsible for a business unit, corporate function, business unit function, country or operations site. These employees represent less than three percent of our total workforce. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 27 ECONOMIC 203-1 Development and impact of investments in infrastructure and services supported Livable communities require stable infrastructure and connectivity. As part of our community investment focus on local communities, Mosaic responds to community needs for welcoming public spaces, hospitals and emergency services, and entertainment and sports facilities that bring additional revenue to local economies. Our investments in this category in 2017 totaled approximately $5 million. Here are examples of some of our recent community investments in infrastructure. • In Central Florida, The Mosaic Company Foundation supported Arcadia Rodeo’s $6 million capital campaign for a new multipurpose complex with a $3 million investment in 2014. The 8,000 seat Mosaic Arena, which opened in early 2018, will serve as a community gathering place and promote new economic opportunities for local businesses and civic organizations. • In 2017 we made an in-kind donation of 335 acres of formerly mined land in Central Florida to Polk County Parks and Recreation. Valued at over $500,000, the land will be used by local residents as a park for all terrain vehicles. • In 2017 Mosaic announced continued funding for the STARS Air Ambulance in Saskatchewan—an organization that provides emergency transport for critically ill and injured people in rural southern Saskatchewan—where travel time and remoteness create challenges for emergency responders. Mosaic's initial contribution of $5.5 million in 2011 helped establish a Regina base and purchase the helicopter. STARS flew more than 1,000 missions in western Canada in 2017. • Mosaic’s Krishi Jyoti project in India aims to improve livelihoods in villages in rural India by enhancing farm productivity. In partnership with the project's implementing partner, The Sehgal Foundation, six check dams have been constructed since 2008, increasing water storage capacity to 30 million gallons. The project also promotes education among children in these remote villages by providing them a healthy and safe school environment. Krishi Jyoti has supported the renovation of 21 government schools in the project villages, benefiting nearly 5,000 children. • Mosaic committed $75,000 plus engineering and design analysis costs to build a new arbor for the Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan. The arbor, which replaced a previous one that had been damaged by a wind storm, celebrates the unique culture of the First Nation and will be used for community gatherings and the annual pow-wow—a celebration of music, song, food, dance and storytelling. • The Mosaic Institute in Brazil recognizes the importance of public spaces and social centers to a community’s wellbeing and invests in them locally. It renovated its first school in Candeias, State of Bahia, in 2013. In 2015, it renovated two public schools in Sorriso and Rondonópolis, State of Mato Grosso do Sul; in 2016 it renovated the schools in Paraguay and Rondonópolis; and in 2017, it renovated schools in Rondonópolis and Uberaba in the State of Minas Gerais. In 2017, combined contributions by The Mosaic Company, The Mosaic Company Foundation and The Mosaic Institute in Brazil through philanthropic funding, employee engagement and in-kind donations totaled more than $12 million. View our global and local community investments on Mosaic’s Giving Map. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 28 ECONOMIC 203-2 Significant indirect economic impacts, including the extent of impacts Mosaic has diverse and varied indirect economic effects on communities across the world. Due to the complex nature of the business and philanthropic activities in which Mosaic engages, we do not attempt to estimate our full indirect economic impact by using a measurement of currency. Here are some of the ways Mosaic contributes indirectly to economies around the globe: • Farmers who produce enough food to support a profitable business bring economic benefits through their hiring and spending practices. Likewise, the dealers who distribute our fertilizers and the vendors who support our operations are meaningful contributors to the economic vitality of the rural and regional communities where they operate. • The Mosaic Villages Project works with smallholder farmers in India to help break the cycle of poverty, moving farmers from survival to surplus. Agronomic training is essential for these farmers, as they suffer from depleted soils and lack the land-management knowledge necessary to farm productively and sustainably. Mosaic’s agronomists provide expertise to teach these farmers modern methods that increase yields and protect the local ecosystem. Additionally, participants in The Mosaic Villages Project in India receive no-interest loans to buy fertilizer at planting, and repay the loans through the sale of surplus yield at harvest. Fertilizer acts as an injection of capital to the region, helping farmers break the cycle of poverty that has gripped these developing regions of the world. • In Brazil, The Mosaic Transforms program, in collaboration with municipal Departments of Social Welfare and other institutions, supports vocational training to expand participants’ employment opportunities in Paranaguá, Rondonópolis and Sorriso. In 2017, the program continued in Rondonópolis and was expanded to Catalão, Goiás. • Many of Mosaic’s community investments are focused on supporting hunger relief in communities and providing access to emergency food systems. Studies show that children who have sustained hunger have reduced abilities and capacity to learn in school. Access to regular food improves educational outcomes. Through work with the United Way and other local charities, Mosaic’s community investments help families achieve greater economic independence and improve educational outcomes for children. • A 2015 economic study by The Fertilizer Institute estimates that the United States fertilizer industry contributes $162 billion to the United States economy. The study estimates that fertilizer producers, wholesalers and retailers, and the businesses that serve them, support 519,900 United States jobs with total annual compensation of $36 billion. • Additionally, many of Mosaic’s partnerships with community organizations continue to support positive healthcare, education, housing and recreational opportunities for our neighbors. Please see 203-1 and Mosaic’s Giving Map for more information. 204-1 Proportion of spending on local suppliers at significant locations of information We report on purchases in the United States, Canada and Brazil. For the purposes of this indicator, operations in these areas are considered “significant” since they are in key geographies where most of our supply chain activities take place. LOCAL SUPPLY CHAIN (PERCENT) OPERATIONAL LOCATIONS 2017 Phosphate (United States Only) 80.3 Potash (Canada and United States) 61.2 International (Brazil) 99 NOTE: Excludes governmental, raw materials, clubs and organizations, employee-related and freight and warehouse expenditures. Includes as locals in the Phosphates segment all vendors with addresses in Louisiana and Florida, and in the Potash segment all vendors with addresses in New Mexico, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Brazil totals include all vendors whose addresses are within the country. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 29 ECONOMIC Management Approach: Anti-corruption and Anti-competitive Behavior Mosaic operates in a regulated industry and in areas throughout the world with varying degrees of perceived corruption. Mosaic also has routine interactions with foreign government officials and agencies related to obtaining licenses and approvals, customs, land use and other matters. The risk of corrupt practices exists in the countries where we operate as government officials and agencies are inherently involved in the production, sale, and distribution of our fertilizer products through the related laws and regulations governing these activities. Mosaic must comply with all applicable laws of the United States, and all other countries in which we do business, that are designed to prevent bribery and corruption. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics demands strict compliance from our employees and requires any employees who have been assigned a company computer user ID—which is more than 3,000 employees—to complete online code of conduct training and certify compliance with the code annually. Mosaic also maintains a 24-hour independently administered, confidential and anonymous incident reporting hotline for all Mosaic employees. In addition, our company conducts a robust risk assessment to identify risks related to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). A robust fraud risk assessment is also completed in the Sarbanes-Oxley compliance efforts. We recognize the significance of the FCPA and have established a Worldwide Anti-corruption Policy. We conduct periodic FCPA audits of selected geographic locations and respective individuals-including but not limited to: country managers, sales representatives, accounting/finance personnel and supply chain-whose job responsibilities require a keen awareness of and compliance with the FCPA. 205-1 Total number and percentage of operations assessed for risks related to corruption and the significant risks identified The total number of business segments analyzed for risks related to corruption in 2017: three (Potash, Phosphates and International Distribution). The percentage of business segments analyzed for risks related to corruption in 2017: 100 percent (all three business segments). We also review select joint ventures including Miski Mayo in Peru and the Wa’ad al Shamal Phosphates Company in Saudi Arabia. We do not have production facilities in any of the 20 most corrupt countries in the world, as defined by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 30 ECONOMIC 205-2 Communication and training on anti-corruption policies and procedures Mosaic requires all salaried employees (which includes all management employees) to complete the online Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) training. In addition to the online training, instructor-led training is also provided to certain employees based on their location and job responsibilities. As part of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics certification process, which is required annually of all employees who have been assigned a company computer user ID, employees are specifically asked to certify as to their compliance with the FCPA in the past year. Most recently, the 2017 Code certification, completed in early 2018, had a 100 percent completion rate. View 404-1 for more information. Board members receive the Code of Conduct training and are recertified annually, most recently with a 100 percent completion rate in 2018. In regards to business partners, Mosaic’s service agreements generally require suppliers to agree to follow the Mosaic Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, a section of which addresses Preventing Bribery and Corruption. The code states that suppliers must adhere to the same level as required by Mosaic employees. Mosaic’s purchasing policy requires suppliers to acknowledge Mosaic’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics biannually in writing. Mosaic’s Worldwide Anti-Corruption Policy and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics are both publicly available on our website. 205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken As of the date of this report, Mosaic had not identified any material violations of our anti-corruption policy and had not dismissed or disciplined any employee for corruption, nor declined to renew a contract with a business partner due to violations related to corruption. 206-1 Total number of legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices and their outcomes In 2017, there were no legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust or monopoly practices. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 31 ENVIRONMENT Management Approach: Materials We use various mineral resources and materials to make our crop nutrition products. For example, limestone is used to produce our animal feed products and for water treatment. Sulfur, a byproduct of crude oil and natural gas de-sulfurization, is used to produce steam, electricity and sulfuric acid, which is used to produce phosphoric acid. We use byproduct heat from sulfuric acid production to generate steam that we use in our operations and to generate electricity. Sulfur is also used in the production of our MicroEssentials® product line. Various micronutrients, including boron, zinc, sulfur and cupric oxide, are key ingredients in our MicroEssentials product line. Ammonia is used in our finished products, diammonium phosphate (DAP), monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and MicroEssentials, and to neutralize the pH of the stack gases at our Esterhazy potash mine. In line with Mosaic’s principle of responsibility, we strive to be good stewards of natural resources, using them as efficiently as possible. Mosaic products, predominantly fertilizer and animal feed ingredients, are used in agricultural operations. To the extent possible, bulk transport is used to minimize the need for extensive packaging—and therefore packaging waste—throughout the supply chain. Mosaic supports and helps promote The Fertilizer Institute’s (TFI) Bulk Blend Workshops and Manual, which eliminates the need for packaging of major raw materials or the final product. 301-1 Materials used by weight or volume MATERIALS MINED OR CONSUMED (MILLION TONNES) MATERIALS 2017 Ammonia 1.5 Limestone 0.2 Phosphate Rock 15.0 Potash Ore 29.9 Sulfur (Long Tons) 4.1 NOTE: Ammonia purchases depicted in the table above are for production of phosphate crop nutrients. Sulfur value represents long tons purchased in 2017. 301-2 Percentage of materials used that are recycled input materials Sulfur is the most significant recycled raw material in our manufacturing processes. The sulfur used is recovered from crude oil and natural gas processing and then recycled in our plant operations to produce sulfuric acid, which we use to make phosphoric acid, steam and electricity. Our use of this product prevents an excess of sulfur that otherwise could be disposed of in landfills. In 2017, sulfur made up approximately 8 percent by weight of our total raw materials. 301-3 Percentage of products sold and their packaging materials that are reclaimed by category Mosaic products, predominantly fertilizer and animal feed ingredients, are used in agricultural operations. To the extent possible, bulk transport is used to minimize the need for extensive packaging throughout the supply chain. Mosaic supports and helps promote The Fertilizer Institute’s (TFI) Bulk Blend Workshops and Manual, which eliminates the need for packaging of major raw materials or the final product. In 2017, approximately 74 percent of the sales volumes (tonnes) from our business were sold in bulk. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 32 ENVIRONMENT Management Approach: Water, Energy, Emissions, Biodiversity, Effluents and Waste, Environmental Compliance, and Supplier Environmental Assessment Respect for the natural environment is essential to the sustainability of our business. From our potash mines in Saskatchewan to our Florida phosphate operations and distribution and blending facilities in Brazil, we strive to optimize our production processes and reduce our environmental impact. Our management of water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions and waste is guided by our Environmental, Health & Safety Policy and commitment to the United Nations Global Compact. Our sustainability targets, progress toward which we report annually, help focus our efforts and track our progress on these key issues. We support a variety of formal and informal Mosaic channels through which stakeholders can submit concerns. Beyond outreach directly to Mosaic, the public has an opportunity to comment on state or federal rules and permits through Public Notice and formal comment periods. Please see 413-1 for more information. Our management approach for the topic of Environmental Compliance is addressed in the sections below. WATER We recognize water is a critical natural resource that is essential to the sustainability of our operations, as well as the communities and ecosystems in which we operate. In our direct operations, we consume significant volumes of water in the mining and production of our phosphate and potash crop nutrient products. The primary sources of water for our operations are surface water; rainwater, used as alternative water supply; and groundwater. Our facilities monitor and evaluate water use to confirm it is minimized, and water recycling and reuse are maximized. Secondary sources of water include water supplied by local authorities and partially treated industrial and domestic reclaimed water, also supplied by local authorities. Surface water withdrawals include once-through cooling water used by our Louisiana operations. Discharges from Mosaic’s Florida and Louisiana phosphate operations to downstream water bodies are highly regulated through federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (permits that are administered by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ). Discharges are monitored, sampled and analyzed regularly by Mosaic, with reports provided to regulatory agencies to demonstrate compliance with permit limitations. The limitations are based on the water quality standards that protect the designated uses of the receiving water body. Mosaic’s Saskatchewan facilities maintain a “zerodischarge” approach. When the discharge of freshwater is warranted following a high precipitation event, it is approved in advance by multiple regulatory agencies. As it relates to the use of our products, crop nutrient products like those Mosaic manufactures have the potential to run off farmland and into waterways, which can impact water quality. By preserving the quality of water, minimizing our own water use, and supporting and promoting agricultural practices that achieve the crop yield benefits of fertilizer while reducing nutrient losses to the environment, we are reducing the environmental impact of fertilizers on the global food supply. Broadly, our water stewardship efforts are focused on: • Preserving and maintaining the quality of the water we use in the communities where we operate; • Promoting the 4R Nutrient Stewardship framework to minimize the impact of crop nutrients on waterways; • Maximizing water recycling and reuse; • Monitoring and evaluating our water use and driving facility-level conservation efforts; • Developing partnerships with industry and government to use alternative water sources; • Reporting performance and communicating with stakeholders 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 33 ENVIRONMENT ENERGY AND EMISSIONS Fertilizer production is an energy-intensive activity. We use energy and generate direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in the mining, production, distribution and use of our phosphate and potash crop nutrient products. Since our company’s formation in 2004, we have invested in initiatives aimed at reducing energy use and emissions—efforts that have resulted in operating cost savings and improvements in environmental performance. By improving the efficiency of our operations and promoting sustainable agricultural practices, we are adapting to the potential threats of climate change and reducing the environmental impact of fertilizers on the global food supply. Our approach to managing energy and greenhouse gas emissions includes: • Emphasizing operating efficiency • Investing in energy-efficient technologies and evaluating alternative energy sources, including generating virtually GHG-free electricity at our Phosphates concentrates through a process called cogeneration • Leveraging our agronomic expertise to promote efficiencies in agricultural systems, which have the potential to enhance customers’ productivity • Advocating for balanced clean energy policy that encourages the generation and consumption of existing, low-cost resources, such as waste heat recovery • Reporting our energy and GHG performance and communicating with stakeholders BIODIVERSITY Protection of biodiversity is critical to global sustainable development and a significant component of Mosaic’s sustainability efforts. In both our Phosphate and Potash operations in the United States and Canada, prior to the start of mining—or when extending or expanding a mine—permits are secured from local, regional, state and federal government agencies. This detailed planning and approval process protects water, air, ecology, threatened and endangered species, transportation, safety and other environmental, health, and public welfare considerations. We work with multiple parties to evaluate ecological resource preservation opportunities and to avoid and minimize any harm to state and federally protected wildlife species found on mine properties. Phosphate mining represents a temporary disturbance of ecological resource. Once mining is complete, we conduct acre-for-acre reclamation and return mined lands to productive uses for wildlife and people. To ensure biodiversity, Mosaic may introduce certain species into reclaimed lands, such as the gopher tortoise, that may have previously resided on the parcel but moved prior to mining. All introductions and relocations of protected species are directed by federal and state requirements and guidelines. Potash mining operations in Canada and the United States use shaft and solution mining techniques. Because of the limited footprint on surface features, such as surface infrastructure and tailings management areas, impacts to wildlife and habitats are also highly localized and relatively small in scale. Prior to surface development, Mosaic’s Saskatchewan facilities consult multiple stakeholders as part of best management practices that are protective of wildlife and habitats. Phosphates and potash operations’ interaction with wildlife in the United States is regulated by state and federal agencies such as the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. These agencies maintain lists of protected species for which Mosaic develops species-specific habitat management plans to ensure the proper protection measures are in place. Protection of these species is also reviewed and approved through the Federal, State and local permitting processes for our Florida phosphate mines. In our potash facilities located in Saskatchewan, Canada, our approach to evaluating potential impacts to wildlife includes biological assessments for projects located in new or expanded footprint areas. Since potash mining is underground, such impacts are rare once a facility is in operation. Assessments include field surveys to identify rare species of plants, birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians of special concern that may be impacted. Survey methods follow the recommendations of the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment. Biological assessments for all expansion areas at the potash facilities follow this approach. We work closely with regulators to not only address compliance with all applicable regulations and agency-approved management plans, but to fund or conduct research that promotes the goal of wildlife and habitat conservation. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 34 ENVIRONMENT WASTE Large quantities of byproduct materials generated as a result of mining and processing of potash and phosphate— referred to in this report as “mining wastes”—are managed during the operation of a facility, and upon its closure. We apply industry best practices to manage and reuse overburden, tailings and byproducts associated with our mining and production practices. Potash tailings, consisting primarily of salt and clay, are stored in tailings management areas. A portion of the excess salt generated from potash mining is processed and then used for commercial purposes, including road salt, water softener salt, and use in food grade products and industrial uses. Phosphate clay residuals from mining are deposited in clay settling areas (CSAs) located within the approved mine boundaries. These CSAs are eventually dewatered and reclaimed. Overburden and sand tailings produced at our phosphate mines are used in reclamation and mitigation conducted at the mines. Wet phosphogypsum, a byproduct of our phosphate manufacturing process, is managed in permitted phosphogypsum management systems (“gypstacks”). We store the process water that separates from phosphogypsum during the dewatering process in gypstacks. We are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and local standards related to these materials. Certain solid wastes generated by our phosphates operations are subject to regulation under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and related state laws. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules exempt “extraction” and “beneficiation” wastes, as well as 20 specified “mineral processing” wastes, from the hazardous waste management requirements of RCRA. Phosphogypsum and process wastewater nonetheless still are subject to extensive regulation. Mosaic’s operations generate a variety of nonhazardous solid wastes, including domestic refuse, construction and demolition debris, and waste lubricants. Our waste management program provides assurance that all of our locations have a process in place to minimize waste generation and that waste management practices do not adversely affect the environment or health and safety of employees and the public. We endeavor to choose on-site process chemicals that are the least hazardous, thereby seeking to lower risk to occupational health and safety and minimizing waste management implications. Mosaic facilities generate hazardous waste during production and maintenance operations. The types of hazardous waste generated at Mosaic’s United States facilities typically include spent cleaning solvents, paint-related wastes and some spent laboratory chemicals. At concentrate facilities, wastes generated during production and maintenance operations include waste that is characteristically hazardous for corrosivity or toxicity (e.g., low pH or metals content). Each location has an appropriate hazardous waste management system to ensure that the waste is properly and safely disposed. No hazardous wastes are shipped internationally for disposal. We continue to improve our comprehensive waste management strategy, which complies with federal, state and local requirements and aligns to the Mosaic environmental health and safety management system. SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT Mosaic’s success is rooted in our commitment to high quality products and supported by strong supplier relationships. We foster supplier relationships based on trust, fairness and mutual respect. We hold our suppliers, their employees and subcontractors to the same high standards of business integrity and behavior to which we hold ourselves. Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines the principles that we consider when deciding on competing suppliers, including safety and environmental stewardship 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 35 ENVIRONMENT 303-1 Total water withdrawal by source GLOBAL WATER WITHDRAWALS (,000m3) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Groundwater 67,277 64,380 68,270 65,085 78,846 Municipal 133 781 730 914 1,050 Reclaimed Water 1,167 3,429 7,515 9,247 9,249 Surface Water 250,427 240,780 224,168 233,512 232,393 Total 319,004 309,370 300,683 308,758 321,721 Note: Due to a data error discovered following the close of our third-party audit by Trucost, the groundwater data in this table differs from the figures listed on our assurance statement by approximately 1%. Surface water figures include once-through cooling water. Approximately 34 percent of Phosphates business segment surface water withdrawls are used for once-through cooling. The increase in use of reclaimed water in 2014 was primarily due to our acquisition of the Florida Phosphate assets of CF Industries, Inc. In alignment with our Sustainability Targets, we have modified our water intensity reporting to reflect a freshwater intensity measurement. In setting a water target, our intent is to drive water efficiency improvements across our business and to increase the use of alternative sources. Mosaic’s freshwater withdrawals per tonne of dry product crop nutrient and animal feed production are as shown below: FRESHWATER INTENSITY (m3/TONNE) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Mosaic 5.07 4.59 4.86 4.76 4.90 For withdrawals and total intensity broken down by business segment, please see our Environment Metrics Supplement. 303-2 Water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water Mosaic’s Central Florida fertilizer production facilities operate using recycled or reused water when possible. We use captured rainfall as an “alternative water supply.” Groundwater use is heavily regulated and is used by Mosaic to supplement captured rainfall. Local regulations promote the use of available alternative water supplies, such as reclaimed water from municipalities, before groundwater use. Mosaic Florida sites received reclaimed water from six municipal waste water treatment plants in 2017 at an average rate of 6.6 million gallons per day (MGD). Mosaic Florida Phosphates operations do not withdraw water from nationallyor internationally-protected surface water sources. Mosaic's Florida operations have one surface water withdrawal point from a roughly 800 acre area of unreclaimed mine cuts, mined prior to the 1975 adoption of mandatory reclamation rules. This withdrawal is affiliated with the South Pierce facility. In 2017, this withdrawal averaged about 235,000 gallons per day. In addition, Mosaic has two withdrawal points from springs: Lithia Springs and Buckhorn Springs. This water is used at Mosaic’s Riverview facility. In 2017, an average of 2.7 MGD was pumped from these spring water sources, representing less than 8 percent of the annual average spring flow for Lithia Springs, and less than 2 percent for Buckhorn Springs. The State of Florida has over 700 springs, 30 of which have been designated as Outstanding Florida springs and are afforded extra protection. Neither Lithia nor Buckhorn Springs are on the Outstanding Florida spring list, however, Lithia Springs is a valuable recreational asset to the local community. Mosaic and its predecessors have leased Lithia Springs as a 160 acre recreational park to Hillsborough County since 1957. In the Potash segment, water use, including source and allocated volumes, are subject to site-specific regulations and permits. Water used in the operations process is recycled or reused, when possible. Our Saskatchewan potash operations withdraw from provincially-regulated surface water and groundwater sources. Many of these sources also provide drinking water for nearby communities, and the surface water sources, including Cutarm Creek, Buffalo Pound Lake and Zelma Reservoir, are also used for recreational purposes. None of these sources are designated as national or international conservation areas. Please see 303-1 and 303-3 for additional context. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 36 ENVIRONMENT 303-3 Total volume of water recycled and reused Figures are based on total water used by facility, less freshwater withdrawals.

Belle Plaine is a solution mine and therefore, water use and methodology for recycle/reuse rate differs from shaft mining operations. However, recycled volumes from that facility are included in the totals for Potash. Mosaic operations capture rainfall, a portion of which is impounded and used in the various production processes, with some discharged through permitted outfalls at Phosphates facilities. 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization Mosaic’s worldwide total direct energy consumption in 2017 was 95.45 million gigajoules (GJ). ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY SOURCE Approximately 91.4 percent of Mosaic’s worldwide total direct energy consumption in 2017 was from two sources: waste heat from sulfuric acid production and natural gas. The remaining portion was made up of petroleum products and propane.

STEAM FROM CAPTURED HEAT Due to a calculation error, the sum of 2015’s Total Direct Energy Consumption has been NATURAL GAS restated to reflect use of 102.62 million GJ, not 96.25 million GJ as previously reported. The COGENERATED ELECTRICITY previous total inadvertently excluded cogenerated electricity. Individual source totals were PETROLEUM PRODUCTS reported correctly and have not been changed. In 2017, our phosphates operations used a portion of steam energy from the sulfuric acid manufacturing process to produce 6.3 million GJ of electricity through a process called cogeneration, approximately 88 percent, or 5.57 million GJ, of which was used internally. We consider the waste heat from sulfuric acid production to be a direct primary energy source for our operations. We exported approximately 720,000 GJ of power to the local utility grid in Florida in 2017. Mosaic looks for opportunities to improve the efficiency and expand the electricity output of our cogeneration assets. In 2016, Mosaic brought another turbo generator online at our Uncle Sam facility that added approximately 15 megawatts of low-greenhouse gas (GHG) electrical generation capacity. Mosaic could have additional opportunities for harnessing emissions-free power under a more supportive regulatory construct in the United States. We advocate for a balanced renewable energy policy that incentivizes and expands the generation and consumption of existing, low-cost renewables, such as waste heat recovery, and promotes fairer pricing for third-party renewable producers when selling power back to the electrical grid. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 37 ENVIRONMENT DIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY BUSINESS SEGMENT (%) INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTION <1% POTASH 20% PHOSPHATE 80% NOTE: The Phosphates segment uses a significant amount of waste heat energy from the sulfuric acid manufacturing process, which is accounted for here.

This plan includes strategies for lowering purchased energy consumption through more efficient processes and maximizing use of cogenerated energy. We also emphasize energy efficiency in our office facilities. Mosaic’s Florida headquarters in FishHawk maintains its ENERGY STAR certification. Mosaic’s leased Regina, Canada, offices were built to Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) standards and included the purchase of interior design elements, furniture and products, as well as other energy efficiencies associated with LEED. The Regina offices were LEED certified in 2017. Similarly, Mosaic’s Colonsay mill dry building in Saskatchewan was designed and constructed according to LEED standards. The LEED certification process for this building is underway. We estimate savings of approximately 400,000 GJ due to conservation and efficiency improvement projects that were executed in 2017, including energy efficient lights and solar installations, equipment upgrades, process improvements, and increased internal use of cogenerated energy. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 39 ENVIRONMENT 302-5 Reductions in energy requirements of products and services Innovation is one of Mosaic’s guiding principles. It influences our long-term business strategy and our companywide efforts to reduce energy use and GHG emissions. Through process and product innovation, we’re driving greater value for customers and stakeholders. In addition to developing products and services that enhance customers’ productivity and positively impact their energy efficiency, Mosaic maintains active partnerships with industry-leading research centers, targeting agriculture efficiency and productivity improvements. In 2017, we conducted 410 small plot trials in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Canada, India, Northern Latin America (Mexico to Peru) and the United States. In 2017, energy efficient or renewable energy-based initiatives resulted in almost 300,000 GJ of energy savings. 305-1 Direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1) 305-2 Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) WORLDWIDE GHG EMISSIONS (MILLION TONNES CO2e ) BUSINESS SEGMENT/EMISSION TYPE 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Phosphates 2.54 2.87 2.83 2.69 2.30 Direct Emissions 1.80 1.91 1.97 1.92 1.50 Indirect Emissions 0.73 0.96 0.86 0.76 0.81 Potash 1.80 1.80 1.90 1.80 1.81 Direct Emissions 0.93 0.95 0.95 0.97 0.90 Indirect Emissions 0.87 0.85 0.95 0.83 0.91 International Distribution 0.07 0.06 0.05 0.07 0.05 Direct Emissions 0.06 0.04 0.04 0.05 0.03 Indirect Emissions 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 Total 4.41 4.73 4.78 4.56 4.17 NOTE: Direct emissions include Mosaic’s consumption of natural gas, diesel, other fuels, process related activities, water treatment and refrigerants.

Ammonia purchases depicted in the table above are for production of phosphate crop nutrients. Emission factor for purchased ammonia was revised for 2013 and prior years to align with IPPC 2013 guidance for ammonia production with modern, natural gas ammonia plants. In 2014 we accounted for emissions totals from one of our trucking partners, and in 2016, we accounted for emissions from two trucking partners. These figures, which represent a portion of our total trucking emissions, are not available prior to 2013. The increase in rail transport emissions is due to expanding our reporting boundary and collecting data from an additional rail vendor in Canada. Information differs slightly from third party assurance statement due to a late correction from our rail vendor. Emissions associated with product use are addressed as part of our product stewardship programs.

GHG emissions reductions resulting from the initiatives reported in 302-4 equal approximately 50,000 tonnes of CO2e, the equivalent of taking more than 10,000 average United States cars off the road for a year. For more information on Mosaic’s efforts to reduce GHG emissions and address climate change, please see our 2017 CDP Climate Change response. The results of a value chain exercise conducted by a third party to complete in 2016 confirmed that the GHG impacts associated with the application of our products—primarily potash and phosphate crop nutrients—are minimal. However, Mosaic promotes the use of best agricultural practices, including research and practices to minimize GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with the use of crop nutrient products. Further, Mosaic supports the minimization of GHG emissions and other environmental impacts from the global food supply by encouraging stakeholders to enhance their understanding, adoption and promotion of 4R Nutrient Stewardship. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 41 ENVIRONMENT 305-7 NOx, SOx and other significant air emissions CRITERIA AIR AND OTHER POLLUTANTS (,000 TONNES) BUSINESS SEGMENT/ NORMALIZED EMISSION TYPE 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2016 NOX 4.56 3.06 3.55 4.20 3.27 0.19 CO 1.77 4.02 2.26 1.39 1.43 0.08 PM 3.66 3.87 5.09 5.73 6.05 0.35 SO2 13.11 13.65 17.04 15.97 16.55 0.95 VOC 2.61 0.25 0.66 0.25 0.24 0.01 NH3 1.10 1.40 1.86 1.82 1.84 0.11 F 0.15 0.14 0.15 0.13 0.11 0.00* H2S 0.11 — — — 0.01 0.00* SAM 0.12 0.13 0.15 0.16 0.16 0.00* HF 0.45 0.04 0.39 — 0.13 0.00* NOTE: All business segments included.

As of December 31, 2017, Mosaic owned or maintained mineral interests in about 359,000 acres of land in Florida related to our phosphates mining operations. As part of the mine permitting process, Mosaic preserves and protects unmined land as well as land restored through mitigation that are important areas of high biodiversity. All of the mitigation areas identified in our federal and state permits are permanently protected through conservation easements recorded against title to the property. Such protection areas are designed to create or connect to wildlife corridors to facilitate wildlife use, and to preserve in perpetuity high quality waters and wetland systems. Through December 2017, Mosaic owns or controls more than 22,500 acres in Florida that are designated as non-impacted floodplain, high-quality wetlands, and other preservation for which Mosaic has granted conservation easements. Mosaic operates three Canadian potash facilities, all located in the southern half of the province of Saskatchewan, including our solution mine at Belle Plaine, two interconnected mine shafts at our Esterhazy shaft mine and our shaft mine at Colonsay. Mosaic has mineral rights to approximately 594,000 acres in Saskatchewan for potash mining and surface rights to approximately 35,000 acres. Mosaic’s United States potash operations include a shaft mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico, with mineral rights to approximately 77,000 acres for potash mining and approximately 7,186 acres of surface rights. Since shaft mining in Saskatchewan occurs at more than 3,000 feet below surface, and solution mining requires limited acreage for pipeline and cluster infrastructure, the only surface areas that are disturbed are the actual footprint of the mine shaft and the adjacent above-ground processing facilities and tailings management areas. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 42 ENVIRONMENT 304-2 Descriptions of significant impacts of activities, products and services on biodiversity in protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas Mosaic phosphate mines are surface mine operations that involve land clearing. During the permitting process, multiple local, regional, state and federal permitting authorities review the application and conduct independent approval processes to ensure environmentally sensitive, biodiverse areas are avoided, minimized and mitigated. Further, site specific Wildlife and Habitat Management Plans are developed for each mine, which outline measures to be implemented to protect and manage wildlife, listed species and their habitats, including provisions for preclearing surveys and species relocation for less mobile species, such as the gopher tortoise. Ongoing monitoring activities such as the Horse Creek Stewardship and Peace River Monitoring programs, provide assurances to downstream parties that mining does not significantly impact the water quality, water quantity and biodiversity on riverine systems within or outside of our property boundaries. Mining impacts are considered by the State of Florida to be temporary impacts. When mining is complete, mined areas are backfilled and restored to native habitat areas, which is often completed within 5 to 10 years of disturbance. Such habitats are designed to be connected to wildlife corridors to facilitate re-entry of wildlife. Please see our website for more information. Potash mining operations in Canada and the United States use shaft and solution mining techniques. Because of the limited footprint on surface features, such as surface infrastructure and tailings management areas, impacts to wildlife and habitats are also highly localized and relatively small in scale. Prior to surface development, Mosaic’s Saskatchewan facilities consult multiple stakeholders as part of best management practices that are protective of wildlife and habitats. MM1 Land disturbed or rehabilitated Mosaic reports our Florida mining and reclamation activities to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Mining and Mitigation program. As of the date of this publication’s release, 2016 and 2017 figures have not been fully validated and deemed complete by FDEP. We provide estimates of mined and reclaimed acres for those years in the table below. Once we have satisfied all reclamation obligations with respect to mined and disturbed lands, and the regulatory agencies “release” those reclaimed lands, they are considered “released acres.” Accordingly, a drop in annual reclaimed acreage may be the result of our satisfaction of those reclamation obligations and agency release with respect to reclaimed acres.

Accordingly, these figures are estimates only and may be revised in future reports. ***Represents estimates of the annual changes to total unreleased reclaimed acreages. A drop in acreage indicates more acres were released than reclaimed during that year. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 43 ENVIRONMENT MM2 Number and percentage of sites identified as requiring biodiversity management plans All active mine sites within the United States and Canada are required to operate pursuant to federal, state/provincial and local regulations related to management of habitat and wildlife. Mosaic has four operating mines in Florida; all (100 percent) have Wildlife and Habitat Management Plans (WHMP) that cover areas of biodiversity sensitivity. These plans are linked to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) review of permit applications, associated wildlife survey data, and corresponding Biological Opinions. Our WHMPs outline management techniques that rely on FWS/FWC guidance and from applied biological practices we have used in the past that have been proven to be successful. FWS and FWC require subsequent surveys and reporting to gauge wildlife response to our activities. 304-3 Habitats protected or restored In our phosphates mining operations, we restore or reclaim every acre of land we mine or disturb, with an emphasis on habitat. Consequently, there are at least as many acres in upland and wetland habitat after mining as before. In addition, environmentally sensitive lands—typically about 15 percent of a project site—are set aside for preservation, with additional reclaimed wetlands and some uplands (such as gopher tortoise recipient sites) protected through conservation easements. (Gopher tortoise recipient sites must contain at least 250 acres of contiguous habitat.) For example, a typical 10,000 acre mine site may be composed of about 25 percent wetland and 30 percent upland habitat before and after mining. Frequently—prior to mining—much of this habitat is fragmented or unconnected. Thus, holistic mitigation plans allow restoration to be consolidated and intertwined to promote wildlife migration as well as buffers for streams and flowways. Success of these restoration efforts is determined by standards imposed by regulatory agencies, and independent assessments by third party ecological professionals. Mosaic planted more than 650,000 trees in 2017, reclaiming uplands, significant upland habitats and wetlands. Please see MM1 for information on our reclamation activities in 2017. Mosaic has fostered partnerships with, and funding for, a variety of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and academic institutions to advance our understanding of the habitats we manage through reclamation. Examples of these groups include Tampa Bay Watch, The Nature Conservancy, Archbold Biologic Station and Audubon of Florida. Mosaic’s Potash business segment is similarly committed to habitat restoration. For example, in 2012, Mosaic made a grant to Ducks Unlimited for $2 million that will restore at least 500 acres of wetlands over a 10-year period in Saskatchewan. 2017 marked the sixth year of this agreement. To date, approximately 384 acres have been restored as part of this initiative. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 44 ENVIRONMENT 304-4 Total number of IUCN Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations, by level of extinction risk Mosaic does not specifically manage wildlife species per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) List designations, but rather in accordance with rules established for threatened or endangered species by regulatory agencies with authority in the regions in which we operate.

The analysis included suppliers to which approximately 90 percent of our supply chain expenditures in North America were made, representing more than 3,500 suppliers. Through this exercise we determined that the environmental impacts associated with our supply chain are primarily associated with the purchase of manufactured ammonia. We report those emissions in 305-3. We will continue to expand the scope of our engagement with suppliers in order to evaluate and report their performance, while identifying opportunities to mitigate and reduce their environmental impacts. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 49 SOCIAL Management Approach: Employment, Labor/Management Relations, Diversity and Equal Opportunity At Mosaic, the strength of our business relies on the commitment of an exceptional global team of employees. Whether working in our mines, distribution facilities or offices, our more than 8,000 employees are part of a global Mosaic team that is richly diverse in skills, experiences and backgrounds. Together, we are responsible, innovative, collaborative and driven. Mosaic aims to be the employer of choice for a diverse and inclusive workforce. Our global talent investment philosophy is to provide competitive compensation and benefits, with flexibility to choose programs that best meet our employees’ needs. Mosaic offers health, welfare and retirement benefits to all full-time employees and eligible dependents. Mosaic measures employee satisfaction biennially in a comprehensive survey of employee engagement, an indicator of productivity and a force that drives business outcomes. Our engagement score in 2017 was 74 percent, which means a majority of employees recommend Mosaic as a great place to work, are proud to work for Mosaic, rarely think about looking for a new job with another company, and are satisfied with Mosaic as a place to work. We are addressing areas of improvement, including process efficiencies and teamwork and collaboration, to further drive engagement. Mosaic offers competitive compensation and benefits in each of the company’s significant locations of operation. Within each of the countries in which Mosaic operates, benefits provided or offered to our full-time employees may differ for various reasons, including: • State or country mandated benefit laws that apply to Mosaic employees in a specific geography • Labor agreements between Mosaic and labor organizations acting on behalf of represented employees • Market-specific benefit programs or practices that exist within an area that Mosaic competes for labor • The impact to employees of local or national tax laws regarding the treatment of company-sponsored benefits Mosaic values and encourages employee engagement at all of our locations. Where employees have elected union representation, Mosaic views the collective bargaining process as an important form of collaborative employee engagement. In addition, Mosaic is sensitive to the needs of its employees, and much consideration is placed on applicable notice periods for any such changes that may impact employees. Mosaic’s Equal Employment Opportunity and Nondiscrimination Policy, signed by our Chief Executive Officer, provides equal employment opportunities to all Mosaic employees, applicants and other qualified persons without regard to race, religion, color, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital status, citizenship status, military or veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, or any other legally protected status under applicable laws in countries where Mosaic has operations. The policy also provides that Mosaic is committed to maintaining a work environment free of discrimination. Mosaic’s commitment applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including: recruiting and hiring, training and education, transfers, promotions, compensation and benefits, performance assessments, terminations, layoffs or recall from layoff, leaves of absence, and company-sponsored training and education. Retaliation or reprisal toward an employee who has exercised their rights under this policy is strictly prohibited. Mosaic’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics reinforces this policy. Our Commitment to Inclusion reinforces that Mosaic is focused on building a representative workforce that embraces the opportunities that diversity brings to the workplace. Mosaic actively recruits transitioning military through our advertising, networking and recruitment events. In Brazil, there are programs aimed at actively recruiting disabled professionals through methods such as advertising, investing in technical and professional education in local communities, and conducting workshops with leaders and employees that reinforce inclusivity. Mosaic supports and participates in a variety of formal and informal channels through which employees can submit concerns or grievances, including an EthicsPoint hotline, biennial engagement survey, mediation, arbitration, and/ or through other formal administrative tribunal such as the National Labor Relations Board. Our collective bargaining agreements contain procedures for resolving grievances over the application or interpretation of such agreements, and Mosaic resolves labor grievances in accordance with the procedures outlined in those respective agreements. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 50 SOCIAL 401-1 Total number and rates of new employee hires and employee turnover by age group, gender and region EMPLOYEES BY AGE GROUP, GENDER AND REGION <30 30-50 >50 TOTAL COUNTRY FEMALE MALE FEMALE MALE FEMALE MALE FEMALE MALE Australia 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 Brazil 82 372 150 639 10 89 242 1,100 Canada 65 257 188 1,126 49 520 302 1,903 China 6 13 41 87 0 8 47 108 India 2 0 3 45 0 1 5 46 Paraguay 5 30 5 44 0 2 10 76 United States of America 50 399 348 1,748 235 1,605 633 3,752 Subtotal 210 1,071 735 3,689 294 2,226 1,239 6,986 Total 1,281 4,424 2,520 8,225 NOTE: Excludes long-term leaves, co-ops, seasonal and temporary employees.

In most locations the exact notice requirement varies depending on circumstances surrounding the changes. In the United States, we adhere to federal and state Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) laws that require a 60-day notification of plant closings and mass layoffs. In Canada, Mosaic adheres to or exceeds the minimum notice requirements set by the Saskatchewan Employment Act. In China, Mosaic adheres to or exceeds the minimum notice requirements set by Article 41 of the Employment Contract Law (ECL). In Brazil, Mosaic adheres to the minimum 30-day notice requirement for dismissals without cause required by Brazilian Labor Law. In the other regions where we operate, Mosaic meets and usually exceeds the minimum notice required, which varies by local legislation and collective bargaining agreements. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 52 SOCIAL MM4 Number of strikes and lock-outs exceeding one week’s duration, by country Mosaic has not been subject to organized labor actions, including strikes or lockouts of any duration, at any of its locations in the 2017 reporting period.

We are committed to providing the environment, development opportunities and compensation to ensure that Mosaic is a company where employees are proud to work and grow. We are an equal opportunity employer, and our recruiting practices focus on matching the best possible candidate to the position. Mosaic uses salary ranges that are competitive with market pay ranges for positions of comparable responsibility, functional knowledge, impact and other compensable factors. Gender is not a factor when determining compensation. Each salary range has a minimum or threshold salary for a new hire, although Mosaic typically sets the actual salary above this minimum. Management Approach: Occupational Health and Safety We are dedicated to preserving a safe, healthy and respectful work environment for an engaged, inclusive workforce. Mosaic’s Environmental Health and Safety Management System, aligned to ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ANSI-Z10, integrates internationally regarded best management practices into our operations while affirming our ongoing safe and environmentally responsible performance. Mosaic has a safety management system in place that is designed to identify, evaluate and control risks. This proactive approach allows us to understand the risks, take action and prevent incidents from occurring in the first place, which results in fewer injuries. Our updated Sustainability Targets include a goal to reduce incidents and injuries, and improve year-over-year performance. Globally, all Mosaic employees, service providers and contractors are held to the same high standards outlined in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 53 SOCIAL 403-1 Percentage of total workforce represented in formal joint management-worker health and safety committees that help monitor and advise on occupational health and safety programs Mosaic has safety committees at a majority of our global operations, representing more than 95 percent of employees. All Brazil facilities and nearly all Mosaic United States and Canada locations have formal joint safety committees, with the exception of small locations, such as warehouses, with 15 or fewer employees. The role of these committees, which are composed of employees from all levels, is to promote safety awareness and reinforce a working environment that promotes connectivity, teamwork and productivity among employees while supporting Mosaic’s pursuit of an incidentand injury-free workplace. 403-2 Type of injury and rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost days and absenteeism, and total number of work-related fatalities, by region 403-3 Workers with high incidence or high risk of diseases related to their occupation Mosaic follows United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards to calculate recordable injury frequency rates (RIFR) on a global basis. An OSHA recordable injury is an occupational injury that requires medical treatment that is more than simple first aid. The most common injuries are: cuts/lacerations/ avulsions; fractures; sprains/strains; pain; and bruises/contusions. Lost time incident frequency rate (LTIFR) calculates the frequency rate of lost time injuries. This measure is an indicator of incident severity. Lost days begin the day after the lost time incident occurs and calendar days are counted, with no exception for weekends, holidays, vacation or scheduled time off. Employees who work in areas with elevated noise in the operational environment are at potential risk for hearing loss. To mitigate this risk, Mosaic uses engineering controls to reduce the noise of our equipment; where this cannot feasibly be accomplished, Mosaic requires the use of hearing protection or even double hearing protection. Contractor safety is also a priority. We select, screen and audit contractors using the ISNetworld Rating—a global system in which contractors and suppliers report their safety performance and conformance to regulatory and internal health, safety and procurement requirements. In 2017 Mosaic adopted more stringent ISNetworld safety performance standards that emphasize proactive safety measures in order to drive further improvements in performance. There were no work-related fatalities in 2017.

Topics covered include supply of personal safety equipment, medical examinations, accident reporting and investigation, rights to refuse unsafe work and health and safety committees. Though rare, emergencies can occur in our business, and the ability to respond promptly and effectively is critical. Mosaic’s overarching approach to crisis management includes risk anticipation and mitigation, site-specific emergency response plans, and routine crisis simulation drills involving Mosaic employees from various functions and emergency response professionals from the communities where we operate. We also test our skills by participating in emergency response competitions with other companies. Our internal crisis management intranet site outlines response plan specifics, including roles, procedures, guidelines and protocols for handling crises and communicating with stakeholders. Management Approach: Training and Education One of Mosaic’s strategic priorities is to invest in people, and we are committed to providing the environment, development opportunities and compensation to ensure that Mosaic is a company where employees are proud to work and grow. Mosaic employees are encouraged to continuously learn and improve their skills. With management support, we offer a companywide educational reimbursement program to help employees in each of our operating countries better meet their current job responsibilities, as well as prepare for future career opportunities within our company. Our internal training opportunities also support the continuous development of Mosaic employees at all levels: • Leadership • Professional and career development • Environmental, health and safety (EHS) training • Equipment and maintenance training • Continuous improvement 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee by employee category TRAINING AND EDUCATION 2017 (TRAINING HOURS BY EMPLOYEE GROUP) TOTAL TRAINING COURSE TITLE HOURLY SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP STRATEGIC IN HOURS Leadership, Professional Development and Function Training 3,897 1,606 11,699 6,165 372 23,739 (HR, IT, Finance and Commercial for all EEs) Legal Compliance Training 1,238 467 2,210 1,079 128 5,122 EHS and Operations Training Phosphates 198,727 4,817 19,359 5,945 653 229,501 Potash 108,633 1,711 30,335 14,455 1,797 156,931 International and 105,058 2,448 9,176 2,694 183 119,559 Corporate Headquarters Total Hours 534,852 Hours per employee (8,225 number of EEs) 65 NOTE: Training hours in topics including Anti-Corruption, FCPA and Business Conduct and Ethics totaled 4,669 hours in 2017. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 55 SOCIAL 404-2 Programs for skills management and lifelong learning that support the continued employability of employees and assist them in managing career endings Mosaic provides employees with helpful planning tools, calculators, articles, videos and webcasts, in addition to optional services provided by our third-party vendors to help plan for retirement. Mosaic also provides support and training for employees during transitional career stages. When a reduction in our workforce occurs, we provide comprehensive career transition services to employees to help ease the stress that accompanies job loss. View 102-10 for more information on these efforts in 2017. 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews, by gender and employee category As part of our strategic priority to develop, engage and empower our people, we have a performance management process called EDGE: Evaluating, Developing and Growing Excellence. Our performance management process has evolved to include scaled competencies, goal alignment, and an emphasis on employee and career development. In addition, we offer tuition reimbursement programs to support continued education for Mosaic employees. More than 160 employees are currently enrolled in Mosaic’s tuition reimbursement program.

Management Approach: Non-discrimination, Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, Child Labor, Forced or Compulsory Labor and Rights of Indigenous Peoples As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, Mosaic is committed to the protection and advancement of human rights. Mosaic’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics forms the basis of our Commitment to Human Rights. 406-1 Total number of incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken In 2017 there were a total of five complaints of discrimination that were filed with external agencies: • United States four discrimination complaints filed with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Two were dismissed by the EEOC for failure to establish violations; one was settled without an admission of wrongdoing by Mosaic; and one is pending (in which Mosaic asserts no discrimination occurred and the employee voluntarily resigned). • Canada one complaint filed with the Saskatchewan Occupational Health and Safety Division that was found in favor of Mosaic. The decision was appealed by the complainant and is currently pending. In 2017, there was one substantiated incident of protected category discrimination (religious) reported through Mosaic’s internal complaint process. The individual was verbally counselled. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 56 SOCIAL 407-1 Operations and suppliers identified in which the right to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining may be violated or at significant risk, and measures taken to support these rights Mosaic does not have any operations in which the right to exercise freedom of association and collaborative bargaining are identified as a significant risk. Mosaic does not discriminate based on association, per our Commitment to Human Rights, which is guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the most widely recognized definition of human rights and the responsibilities of national governments; the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declarations on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Per our Commitment to Human Rights, Mosaic aims to strengthen and enforce human rights in our policies and operations globally, including in our supply chain. 408-1 Operations and suppliers identified as having significant risk for incidents of child labor, and measures taken to contribute to the effective abolition of child labor 409-1 Operations and suppliers identified as having significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labor, and measures to contribute to the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor Mosaic does not have any operations that are identified as a significant risk for child labor or forced or compulsory labor practices. Mosaic abides by all applicable child labor laws, as well as our global hiring and employment policies. In the United States and Canada, we do not employ anyone under the age of 18. We do not tolerate forced or compulsory labor. Mosaic complies with all statutory requirements in the locations where we operate, as well as our own employment policies, including our Commitment to Human Rights, which is guided by the UDHR, the most widely recognized definition of human rights and the responsibilities of national governments; the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Per our Commitment to Human Rights, Mosaic expects all of our business partners to comply with labor and employment laws in the countries where we operate, including laws pertaining to child labor and forced labor. 411-1 Total number of incidents of violations involving rights of indigenous peoples and actions taken MM5 Number of operations taking place in or adjacent to indigenous peoples’ territories Although Mosaic does not conduct any operations on, or immediately adjacent to, any lands of Indigenous Peoples, certain First Nations have acquired land parcels near our mining operations in Saskatchewan. In addition, Mosaic may from time to time enter into agreements to lease mineral rights that have been acquired by First Nations from other parties. Mosaic has had no reported incidents related to violations involving rights of Indigenous Peoples for the period covered in this report. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 57 SOCIAL Management Approach: Local Communities Our local communities are our homes, and we have a vested interest in their sustainability. We understand that for Mosaic to prosper, so must our communities. We support formal and informal communication channels to connect our employees, communities, partners and customers. Examples include our Community Advisory Panels (CAPs) in Central Florida, as well as regional and international microsites intended as open lines of communication between Mosaic and local communities. TOPIC BOUNDARY Internal Whole organization External Local communities; Civil Society Organizations 413-1 Percentage of operations with implemented local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs In alignment with Mosaic’s Environment, Health and Safety policies, we are committed to conducting all business activities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees, our contractors, our customers and the public. Our principles—which state that we are responsible, innovative, collaborative and driven—define how we conduct business, how we interact with colleagues, and how we treat our communities and planet. Accordingly, 100 percent of our operations have impact assessment and development programs. We employ a variety of approaches to systematically assess and manage the diverse impacts of industry on the various communities in which we operate. SUSTAINING OUR GLOBAL AND LOCAL OPERATIONS We serve customers in approximately 40 countries. We mine phosphate rock in Florida and process rock into finished phosphate products at facilities in Florida and Louisiana. We mine potash in Saskatchewan and New Mexico. We have other production, blending or distribution operations in Brazil, China, India and Paraguay, as well as strategic equity investments in a phosphate rock mine in the Bayovar region in Peru and a joint venture formed to develop a phosphate rock mine and chemical complexes in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. View a list of our locations (64 as of the date of this report). Although Mosaic continues to refine and adapt community investment programs throughout South America and Asia, due to the nature of our business and potential impact, this report heavily emphasizes Central Florida in the United States, Saskatchewan, Canada and Brazil. Our operations in Saskatchewan, Central Florida and Brazil work diligently to engage local communities. Mosaic’s engagement within local communities includes monthly meetings with a series of CAPs, civic organizations, elected officials, civil servants and other opinion leaders. Mosaic reaches the broader community through print, broadcast, billboard and digital ads, news and social media outlets, direct mail, and public education initiatives. When the business plans to expand operations, we host community forums and participate in public hearings convened by local and regional governments. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 58 SOCIAL ASSESSING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Mosaic is committed to conducting and reporting the results of environmental impact assessments. In April 2013, the final Areawide Environmental Impact Statement (AEIS) on Phosphate Mining in the Central Florida District was released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) for public review. In August 2013, the AEIS for continued phosphate mining in the Central Florida Phosphate District was finalized. Administered by the ACOE in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, this process analyzed the environmental scope and potential impacts of phosphate mining in Central Florida. Additionally, as it becomes available, information about our permit applications is posted online on microsites targeted to each permitting county in Central Florida. This transparency provides the public with a clearer view of the regulatory process for permitting and gives local residents the ability to communicate directly with the experts overseeing a given project. The Mosaic Potash segment conducts regular environmental impact assessments, reporting the findings to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment. All environmental impact assessments have been submitted and approved to date. Additionally, the Mosaic Potash facilities in Saskatchewan conduct thorough biological assessments of proposed expansion sites, such as the assessments for the tailing expansion at the Colonsay and Esterhazy mines, as well as the K3 site at Esterhazy. Each of these assessments includes field surveys to identify rare species of plants and animals of special concern to determine if mitigation programs are required. DEVELOPING AND CONSULTING IN OUR COMMUNITIES Each year, Mosaic targets investing one percent of profits over a three-year rolling average into our communities. The Mosaic Company, The Mosaic Company Foundation and The Mosaic Institute in Brazil make investments in our global communities through philanthropic grants, employee engagement and in-kind donations. Combined contributions in 2017 reached more than $12 million. In 2017, Mosaic operations in Florida committed more than $5.9 million, and operations in Saskatchewan committed more than $2.9 million to enrich and improve communities where we have offices and operations. Mosaic employs regional, full-time public affairs (PA) staff to support all communities where we have an operating footprint. Mosaic PA staff are committed to maintaining an open dialogue with the people in our communities, assessing local needs and building partnerships designed to improve community vibrancy for local residents. Independent CAPs help facilitate this work. Underwritten by Mosaic, CAPs serve as a forum for open discussion among representatives of the local community, and provide a place for companies to discuss community response to industry developments and plans. RECOGNIZING INDIGENOUS RIGHTS In some locations, there are cultural implications to our business that Mosaic addresses through community engagement. Mosaic recognizes the significance of building relationships with First Nation and Métis organizations throughout Saskatchewan. For example, Mosaic partners with the Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technologies’ Mining Industry Prep Programs, which are based in Saskatoon, Yorkton and Regina, to prepare Saskatchewan’s Indigenous workforce for careers in mining. We strive to be a thoughtful and engaged neighbor who invests carefully and generously, and, through working with First Nations and Métis communities, we identify strategic opportunities to target grant funding to initiatives and projects that are important to the growth and sustainability in the areas where we operate. In 2016, the potash business segment realigned aboriginal engagement internally by merging the function within Public Affairs in order to create a more holistic outreach approach. Today, our engagement with aboriginal communities blends community investment initiatives with information on career opportunities, environmental responsibility, and opportunities for suppliers by connecting one-on-one with aboriginal communities and organizations, ensuring the right connections within Mosaic are made. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 59 SOCIAL ENGAGING OUR STAKEHOLDERS Mosaic is committed to stakeholder engagement and public outreach efforts. Through face-to-face meetings, social media, government relations, facility tours and more, Mosaic connects with stakeholders to keep them well informed and engaged with our mission to help the world grow the food it needs. • Mosaic employees conduct tours of mines and manufacturing facilities for local, state and federal elected officials and staff, customers, investors, students, community leaders, the media, and nonprofit and civic groups throughout the year. • Mosaic has an engaged social media presence (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube). These media enable us to share information with the general public and engage in conversations about our business, making thousands of impressions on users and community members. • Additionally, Mosaic manages micro websites in support of future permitting, with the goal of being transparent with the general public. These sites invite the public to be engaged with the permitting process, review maps of the proposed mining areas, ask an expert, and submit questions about our activities in and around their communities. • In Canada, Mosaic is engaging the public in education on the importance of potash mining, fertilizer and global food security. In partnership with Saskatchewan Association of Ag Societies and Exhibitions, Mosaic is part of the “Food for Saskatchewan—Food for the World” educational display that tours the province. Mosaic’s own educational display was launched in 2014 and features interactive learning on Mosaic’s role in contributing to the province’s economy and the larger role of potash in feeding the world. • Mosaic is committed to being an engaged business partner. Mosaic regularly engages its customers in crop nutrient education and business management principles through various events, such as Mosaic’s AgCollege, which hosts 250 of Mosaic’s strategic customers from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Chile, China and India for the premier education, personal growth and leadership development event for fertilizer retailers. • As a member of The Fertilizer Institute, Fertilizer Canada, the Saskatchewan Mining Association and the Saskatchewan Potash Producers Association, Mosaic presents important information to government groups and decision-makers who directly impact operations, our current expansions, and our investments in our communities. • Individually, Mosaic participates in ongoing consultation with both the provincial Government of Saskatchewan and the federal Government of Canada. Topics discussed with key stakeholders include the need for transportation infrastructure, regular consistency surrounding tax and the ability to work in partnership with the government to approach environmental sustainability. • Stakeholders may reach Mosaic in several different ways: Send comments or questions regarding this report to: mosaic.sustainability@mosaicco.com  Contact our Board of Directors via written communication in care of the General Counsel at the address of the Company’s executive offices, or by e-mail: directors@mosaicco.com 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 60 SOCIAL 413-2 Operations with significant actual and potential negative impacts on local communities Mosaic provides a great number of economic and social benefits to the local communities in which it operates. However, as with all mining activities, the extraction and beneficiation of phosphate and potash to meet the global demand for mineral fertilizer has the potential to cause environmental impacts. One such impact at our mining facilities in Central Florida is the loss of farm output due to farmland being used for mining. The AEIS noted that Mosaic’s mining operations, as forecast for 2011 to 2050, will have a net positive economic impact on the local economy. Any economic effects from losses in farm output would be more than made up for by higher paying employment and economic activity resulting from mining. Mosaic operates in a highly regulated and monitored industry. We work closely with state/provincial and federal officials on operations, expansions and sales to ascertain the environmental impact of industry activities on local communities. Through this collaboration, Mosaic has identified and implemented mitigation opportunities that safeguard local communities from potential negative impact. For more information on actual or potential impacts, please see the discussion of risk factors in our Form 10–K, page 21. MM6 Number and description of significant disputes relating to land use, customary rights of local communities and indigenous peoples MM7 The extent to which grievance mechanisms were used to resolve disputes relating to land use, customary rights of local communities and indigenous peoples, and outcomes In our Potash segment, there were no disputes related to the land use or customary rights of local communities and indigenous people in 2017. We rely on numerous permit approvals to expand our operations or extend operations into new areas. Occasionally, counties and other parties oppose the issuance of some of those required permits by providing comments and live testimony at public hearings, or initiating administrative or legal action. We proactively engage in an interactive dialogue with stakeholders, including local communities and interest groups, through means such as our Internet site and community microsites, tours of plants and mines, community advisory panels, town halls, and/or open houses. When significant disputes arise—defined here, for our Phosphates segment, as administrative challenges to stateissued permits and litigation filed in federal and state courts—we resolve them through the appropriate channels. For more information on operating requirements and impacts, and the phosphate mine permitting process in Florida, please see our 2017 Form 10-K. MM9 Sites where resettlements took place, the number of households resettled in each, and how their livelihoods were affected in the process Mosaic’s potash and phosphate operations are well established mining regions with 50-plus years of operations. Mosaic purchased private properties in the vicinity of our operations in 2017, but no resettlements of communities took place. Mosaic has community relations managers who ensure potential impacts from our operations are communicated effectively to community associations. Community relations managers also work in conjunction with our land management office to address any questions or concerns raised by the community. Our Potash segment’s Land and Minerals Department works with individual landowners to ensure the appropriate level of consultation is employed, as is required by provincial legislation and internal policy. MM10 Number and percentage of operations with closure plans Mosaic’s phosphate mining is a land intensive operation. As such, our mine sites have to go through a detailed permitting process that involves determination and approval of ultimate closure, post-closure care and/or reclamation of our facilities. Mosaic has plans in place as required by governmental regulations for the closure and post-closure care of our phosphogypsum management systems at eight former and current phosphoric acid manufacturing plants in Florida and Louisiana. Similarly, Mosaic has plans in place as required by governmental regulations for the closure and post-closure care of all its Carlsbad and Saskatchewan mining operations. For specific details on our estimated asset retirement obligations, refer to our Form 10–K (F-19). 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 61 SOCIAL Management Approach: Public Policy As one of the world’s leading crop nutrient companies, Mosaic has a responsibility to be actively engaged in the promotion of sound and sustainable public policies. We proactively educate all levels of our employees and government officials on the key issues our company and operations face, our value to operating communities, and our vital role in the world’s food production. Mosaic supports elected officials, candidates for public office, and political committees that are supportive of Mosaic’s mission and share our views on important issues, such as maintaining a strong North American manufacturing and mining base, recognizing the importance of crop nutrients in maintaining domestic and global food security, and supporting reasonable science-based regulation with responsible environmental stewardship. Mosaic is a member of organizations such as The Fertilizer Institute, which represents the public policy needs of the fertilizer industry in the United States. Please see 102-12 and 102-13 for a list of the industry organizations of which we are members. 415-1 Total value of political contributions by country and recipient/beneficiary Amounts of political contributions are reported based on when Mosaic issued the check, which in some cases may be in a different year than when the check was delivered and reported by the receiving candidate or organization.

Management Approach: Customer Health and Safety and Marketing and Labeling In December 2013, Mosaic’s Belle Plaine facility received Product Stewardship Excellence certification from the International Fertilizer Association’s (IFA) Protect & Sustain Product Stewardship initiative. This certification covers the product life cycle including: management systems, product development and planning, sourcing and contracting, manufacturing techniques, and supply chain to the customer. Communications are directed up and down the value chain, such as supplier certification requirements as part of sourcing and procurement of inputs, (material) safety data sheets (M/SDS), labels, registrations, quality/traceability information, training and educational materials. Mosaic’s research and development processes include internal and external research and science-based data generation to advance product advocacy and customer results.

In 2017, we conducted 410 small-plot trials in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Canada, Europe, India, Northern Latin America (Mexico to Peru) and the United States. EDUCATIONAL TOOLS Mosaic supports an educational initiative to help the industry understand fertilizer best management practices as a way of reducing the impact of fertilizers on the environment. CropNutrition.com is a resource for retailers, growers and media members seeking to better understand soil science, grow healthier crops, and increase productivity and yield—sustainably. Retailers and growers benefit from Mosaic sharing information that will allow them to think progressively about crop fertility. INDUSTRY INITIATIVES 4R Nutrient Stewardship (4Rs) is about doing everything “right” in regards to applying fertilizer and effectively reducing agriculture’s potential for negative externalities. 4R Nutrient Stewardship encompasses science-based fertilizer best management practices to achieve specific cropping system goals, including environmental protection. To achieve those goals, the 4Rs framework promotes a focus on the Right nutrient source, at the Right rate, at the Right time, and in the Right place. Please see 4R Nutrient Stewardship for more information. PARTNERSHIPS Mosaic established and continues to fund the Mosaic Fertiliser Technology and Research Centre at the University of Adelaide, Australia. The centre focuses on soil chemistry and fertilizer technology, and uses the latest technology to develop innovative fertilizer formulations to improve nutrient use efficiency. Mosaic also has a long-term partnership with a globally recognized plant nutrition expert at Sabanci University in Turkey, whose research focus is balanced crop nutrition and nutrient interactions conducted through greenhouse experiments. 417-1 Requirements for product and service information and labeling One hundred percent of Mosaic’s products are subject to labeling requirements. We comply with safety, environmental, labeling and registration required by country and local governments where we sell and distribute fertilizer, animal feed and industrial products. Where United States standards are more stringent, we follow those more rigorous standards on the products that we produce both in the United States and for export. Mosaic provides the required country, state and local product documentation for all shipments. This includes detailed labels, data specification sheets and a safety data sheet (SDS) for all products. These documents provide information about proper product handling, safety precautions and guaranteed analysis. Situations requiring disposal are also addressed in the SDS. For product undergoing vessel transport, the SDS includes certification that the discharge of cargo hold rinsate is not harmful to the marine environment. As it relates to safe use of our products, Mosaic promotes customer education following the 4R Nutrient Stewardship framework of the Right nutrient source, applied at the Right rate, at the Right time and at the Right place. Our agronomists share this message worldwide 417-2 Incidents of non-compliance concerning product and service information and labeling Mosaic has automated systems to manage, track and monitor incidents related to noncompliance with regulations and voluntary codes concerning product and service information and labeling. We are committed to quality and responsible labeling. We investigate all questions or claims about the labeling or guaranteed analysis of our products and work with the customer and/or appropriate agency to resolve any claims that arise. In 2017, the sum of claims that resulted in penalties totaled less than $5,000. 2017 Mosaic Sustainability Disclosure 63 View online. mosaicco.com/2017stateofthebusinessreport Learn more.
