SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 Fiscal Year: 1 April 2017 31 March 2018 — Alcantara S.p.A. Dear Stakeholders, This year, Alcantara has once again confirmed its long lasting commitment to all three pillars of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) and to the ongoing struggle against climate change, demonstrating that the Company continues to hold steadfastly to the principles outlined in the objectives it set for itself over the last few years. To underscore how dedicated we are to this important issue, in Fiscal Year 2018 we rejoined the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and the Global Compact Network Italy Foundation (GCNI) – the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiatives operating at both international and local levels – and we presented our first Communication on Progress (CoP), which describes our actions and policies related to human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. This is a strong sign of the Company’s determination to continue along the path of responsible management by respecting and promoting the Ten Principles of the UNGC and by taking strategic actions to contribute to the advancement of global goals, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These principles and goals were at the heart of our Company even before we adhered to the Global Compact; in 2009 we were one of the few companies in our sector worldwide to achieve carbon neutral status. In Fiscal Year 2018, we undertook many activities: • achieved for 9th year in a row carbon neutral status; • launched the factory’s expansion project, which will double the overall production capacity, while increasing sales and employment and reducing the Company’s environmental impact (creating at the soonest, by 2020, a totally bio-based product consistently with available technologies); THE • further strengthened responsible procurement policies throughout our supply chain, getting additional suppliers involved in the measurement and neutralization of CO2 emissions CHAIRMAN’S through offset projects sponsored by the United Nations; LETTER • constantly researched and invested in developing processes and products of biological origin and lowering the environmental impact; • joined additional UN-sponsored offset projects to spread the use of renewable energy sources in the poorest and most disadvantaged areas of the world; • joined the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) with the aim of continuing to measure and report our CO2 emissions. For the purpose of fostering and spreading a genuinely shared culture, stakeholder engagement on topics related to sustainability remain of the utmost importance. To this end, in Fiscal Year 2018 Alcantara S.p.A. partnered with Venice International University (VIU) to organize and promote the 4th edition of the International Symposium on Sustainability entitled “Coping with Change: Global Warming and Decarbonization”. This symposium involved about thirty world-class scientists, economists, academics, managers of leading corporations, and science writers from both the East and the West. In addition, on the occasion of the G7 Environment held in Bologna, the Company hosted the exhibition “Alcantara Sustainability Renaissance” to raise awareness on sustainability. This Sustainability Report includes information on all the initiatives undertaken in recent years and it represents an act of transparency for the Company since we voluntarily disclose “what we do and what we do not do and what our future plans are”. Firmly believing sustainability is a necessary factor that is consistent with our long-term objective of increasing the economic and financial value of the Company, it is and it will remain a core value of our corporate culture, an important growth driver and a spur to developing our business strategy. Now, more than ever, we are convinced that sustainability is a value beyond cost: a value for our Company, our brand, our people and our stakeholders. A value for the future.

On the walls were displayed three-dimensional developments of some designs that the architect had represented only in drawings.
