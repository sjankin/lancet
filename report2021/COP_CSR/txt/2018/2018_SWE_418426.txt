Telia Company is moving quickly too, daring to innovate in order to sustainably improve society and meet new customer needs. We connect the unconnected, the smallest devices to the biggest enterprises, from care workers to the car, from individual homes to hospitals. We are able to do this because we have proven to our customers that they can trust Telia Company. We are building Telia Company even stronger for the future. During the past year we have focused on strengthening our core business through acquiring strategic assets such as Phonero and Nebula and continued to build out fiber and 4G throughout the Nordics and Baltics. At the same time, we have been able to show that our presence in Eurasia has decreased through the sale of stakes in Tcell, MegaFon and Turkcell. This lays the foundations for a strong long-term position in our home markets. Telia Company is transforming to future-proof our superior networks. In a world with increased threats of hacking and even cyber warfare, resilience in networks is of increased importance to keep customers, and the societies we live in, secure. Coupled with the advent of ambiguous connections we are cementing our position as the preferred choice of customers looking for reliability, quality and value. We pride ourselves in delivering best-inclass services to our customers. This includes leading the transition into future technology and enhancing the core by ensuring that our customers are the first with the latest. We are also improving the competitiveness of all our operations through a cost reduction program. This will provide increased cash flows which will ensure that Telia Company can deliver growing returns to our shareholders at the same time as we invest in future technology. Through the global settlement with the US Department of heartfelt thank you to all our colleagues for their hard and Justice and others earlier this autumn the aftermaths relatcommitted work and I would also direct a heartfelt thank ing to the transactions in Uzbekistan could finally come you to our shareholders for their confidence in us to lead to a close.

We have left another eventful year behind us and on Marie Ehrling behalf of the Board of Directors I would like to direct a Chair of the Board 12 Annual and Sustainability Report 2017 Our Company Directors’ Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements GRI Index Other COMMENTS BY THE CEO THE JOURNEY CONTINUES. PLEASE JOIN US! The past year has been very important in our transition from old Telia to the new, from fragmented to focused, from uncertainty to more comfort, from a weak balance sheet to a strong one and, most importantly, from question marks to exclamation marks in our strategy execution. At Telia Company, we are proud of our services and we are pleased with the recognition we receive from others. Over the past year, we have got confirmation that our networks maintain a higher standard than our competitors in five of seven markets. Keeping the highest quality in everything we do is becoming even more important. As digitalization transforms our society, our customers become more and more dependent on their connection having high availability without interruption. The digitalization has many possibilities and we have an important role and responsibility in it. In recent years, we have invested heavily and thanks to this we are well equipped. Together with our new and more efficient investing model we can look forward to a lower investment pace going forward. This does not mean that we will neglect development, the opposite. Telia Company will always strive to have the best networks and offer the most up-to-date services. WE ARE SIMPLIFYING Equally important as offering the best product is to do it the best way. In an industry with low growth, efficiency is crucial to meeting expectations of customers and shareholders. Just as we digitalize our customers, we now digitalize ourselves.

We have now reached a legal settlement that ends the processes following the company's incorrect conduct Stockholm, March 7, 2018 in Uzbekistan. It became an expensive lesson that shows that it is expensive to make mistakes but the experience has also made us better. In recent years, we have invested Johan Dennelind significant amounts of effort to correct historical errors and President and CEO ensure that we have what it takes to drive the company in a responsible manner. But let me repeat, we will never be able to eliminate the risk of mistakes, we can only say with conviction that we have reduced it and that we will continue to reduce it. We took further steps to align our strategy with our commitment to the UN’s sustainable development goals. We firmly believe that contributing to society will also create 14 Annual and Sustainability Report 2017 Our Company Directors’ Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements GRI Index Other TRENDS AND STAKEHOLDERS Three major inputs are the cornerstones for how we develop and formulate the strategy, namely megatrends, stakeholders’ opinions and our capabilities and resources. Exploding number of connected devices Quality of Data services Internet of things Future Artificial network – intelligence high capacity, for predictive low latency analytics Our society is changing more rapidly through digitalization. Three mega­trends are driving the telecom business. MEGATRENDS Our society is changing more rapidly through digitalization. This is a shift as big as the industrial revolution. The shift is enabled by the radically reduced cost for storage and computing, exponentially increasing number of connected devices combined with advanced analytics and artificial intelligence. This is what will lead to the tipping point. As other technologies are becoming generally available the digitalization will take further steps. The sweet spot will be the intersection of these trends. At the same time, we have a number of trends that are the legacy of how we implemented industrialization. Climate change, increased inequality and rapid urbanization. This requires societal attention and drives the need for a sustainable approach to all that we do. As we also live longer than ever, medical advances give cure, and relief from more and more deceases we will have a pressure on our social security systems but also a risk of a health inequality that might further challenge our social structure. 15 Annual and Sustainability Report 2017 Our Company Trends and stakeholders KEY TRENDS AFFECTING TELIA COMPANY 1 Exponential technology 2 Digitalization 3 Urbanization 4 Aging population development everywhere An exponential technoDigitalization that will As more and more people The aging population will logical development that affect every company, move to larger cities, the drive increased healthwill be the facilitator for individual and socipressure on infrastruccare need but also create new advances and create ety and drive changes ture and sustainability a target market with new ways for sharing in most, if not all, areas. will be enormous.

The second step consisted of building leaders’ competence and confidence through external training and by an in-depth analysis of the difficult individual cases of shortand long-term sick leave. The third step focused on follow-up through close dialog between every employee with over five percent sick leave in the last six months and the manager, HR, company healthcare and NAV.

In seven months, this new approach reduced sickness absence to less than half in the customer service center. 63 Annual and Sustainability Report 2017 Directors’ report Responsible Business HUMAN RIGHTS Our responsibility We acknowledge our responsibility to respect human rights, as laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and other international standards.

Risk management is an integrated part of Telia Company’s business planning process and monitoring of business performance.

Further, Telia Company normally has to pay fees to acquire new telecom licenses and spectrum permits or to renew or maintain existing ones. Potential impact Success in business transformation and growth will depend on a variety of factors beyond Telia Company’s control: the cost of acquiring, renewing or maintaining telecom licenses and spectrum permits, the cost of new technology, availability of new and attractive services, the costs associated with providing these services, the timing of their introduction, the market demand and prices for such services, and competition. Failing to reach the targets set for business transformation, customer attraction and future growth may negatively impact the results of operations. 66 Annual and Sustainability Report 2017 Our Company Directors’ Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements GRI Index Other Strategic and emerging risks Risk Description Mitigating activities Emerging Telia Company has made significant investments in telecom • A decision has been made to dispose markets operators in Eurasia (Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, our operations in Eurasia.

Foreign exchange restrictions or administrative issues may effectively prevent Telia Company from repatriating cash, e.g. by receiving dividends and repayment of loans, or from selling its investments. Another risk is the potential establishment of foreign ownership restrictions or other formal or informal possible actions against entities with foreign ownership. Such negative developments or weakening of the local economies or currencies may have a significantly negative effect on Telia Company’s results of operations. The nature of these markets with significant uncertainties and complexity may affect the sales process regarding both expected outcome and timing.

As per March 31, 2017, a final resolution had not yet been reached, but in light of recent developments to that date in those discussions, the estimate of the most likely outcome was revised and the provision was adjusted to USD 1.0 billion (SEK 8.9 billion at that point in time). As per June 30, 2017, the provision remained unchanged at USD 1.0 billion corresponding to SEK 8.5 billion (the change was related to changed foreign exchange rate). On September 21, 2017, Telia Company announced that a global settlement had been reached with the US Department of Justice (DoJ), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Dutch Public Prosecution Service (Openbaar Ministerie, OM) relating to previously disclosed investigations regarding historical transactions in Uzbekistan. The US and Dutch authorities concluded that Telia Company’s conduct was in violation of the FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and Dutch legislation and that corrupt payments of approximately USD 330 million were made by the Company. As part of the settlements, Telia Company agreed to pay fines and disgorgements to the SEC, DoJ and OM in an aggregate amount of USD 965 million (SEK 7.7 billion at that point in time), whereof USD 757 million (SEK 6,129 million) were paid during the third quarter. In addition, Telia Company’s subsidiary in Uzbekistan, Coscom LLC, has simultaneously entered a guilty plea with the DoJ. The disgorgement amount will be offset by up to USD 208.5 million against any future disgorgement obtained by the Swedish Prosecutor. Based on the Company’s remediation and the state of its compliance program, the authorities determined that an independent compliance monitor was unnecessary. 72 Annual and Sustainability Report 2017 Our Company Directors’ Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements GRI Index Other Legal and regulatory risks Risk Description Mitigating activities Review of Telia Company has committed to continue to cooperate with Eurasian the authorities in any other related investigation. Further, Telia transactions Company has committed to during a three-year period report continued any potential corruption and to continue to enhance its compliance program and internal controls. If the Company does not fulfill its commitments, an extension of the term may be imposed for up to one year. The authorities have agreed not to bring any criminal or civil case against Telia Company in the future based on historical events. Also, the global settlement brings an end to all known corruption related investigations or inquiries into Telia Company. The settlement does not provide any protection against prosecution for any future conduct by the company. The bank guarantee that was requested by the Dutch authorities from Telia Company of EUR 10 million as collateral for any financial claims against one of its Dutch subsidiaries has been released, as part of the global settlement. On September, 22, 2017, the Swedish Prosecution Authority announced that it has decided to prosecute a number of former Telia employees. The authority has also decided to initiate legal proceedings against Telia Company for a disgorgement. The disgorgement amount in the Swedish proceedings is already included in the global settlement of USD 965 million that Telia Company has reached with US and Dutch authorities. The Swedish prosecutor is not seeking a corporate fine against Telia Company (which under the Swedish Criminal Act can be levied up to a maximum amount of SEK 10 million per instance). With regard to the Swedish Prosecution Authority’s decision, Telia Company will continue to consider all possibilities to protect the rights and interests of the Company. The Swedish prosecutor made a public statement in May 2016 that it had decided not to investigate any other of Telia Company’s operations in Eurasia. There is of course always a risk that actions may be taken by the police, prosecution or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions against Telia Company’s operations or transactions, or against third parties, whether they be Swedish or non-Swedish individuals or legal entities, and that this might directly or indirectly harm Telia Company’s business, results of operations, financial position, cash flows or brand reputation. However, the global settlement that has now been reached and brings an end to all known corruption related investigations or inquiries into Telia Company by the Dutch and US authorities. 73 Annual and Sustainability Report 2017 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Statement CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT STATEMENT OF MATERIALITY AND SIGNIFICANT AUDIENCES Telia Company AB is registered in Sweden and is bound by the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).
