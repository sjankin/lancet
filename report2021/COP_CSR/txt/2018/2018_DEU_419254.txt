As we mark the third year of reporting against our Better Holidays Better World strategy, I am struck by the power of tourism as a catalyst for change. Our industry has a critical role to play in helping to conserve unique destination habitats, promote political stability and develop destinations. The groupwide TUI Care Foundation builds on the potential of tourism as a force for good by supporting and initiating partnerships and projects worldwide. By working with other sectors of society on shared objectives like the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we can accelerate progress in the most effective and impactful way. The tourism industry is an excellent platform for innovative solutions that make a real impact on the ground and I’m proud of how TUI has once again led the way during 2017. As a driver for economic development tourism supports infrastructure, education, jobs and prosperity in emerging and developed markets around the globe. But sustainability must be a key component of that growth. That’s why I’m delighted that in the first three years of our strategy we have delivered over 20 million ‘greener and fairer’ holidays. Some 80% of our hotels now hold sustainability certifications and we are driving positive change throughout our supply chain. I was proud to take delivery at Brussels Airport of the first 737 MAX aircraft. TUI Group has ordered 72 new aircraft in total to renew its narrow-body aircraft fleet by 2023, according to current planning. With 14% lower kerosene consumption and therefore 14% less carbon emissions than previous comparable aircraft; the 737 MAX aircraft will help us continue to operate Europe’s most carbonefficient airlines. Of course delivering our strategy depends on the dedication and commitment of our people. It is our colleagues around the world who are the change agents who realise TUI’s vision of travel that broadens horizons, celebrates diversity and puts us at the forefront of sustainable tourism. This report reflects their achievement and commitment.
