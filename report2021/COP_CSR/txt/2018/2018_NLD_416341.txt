United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress Covering Calendar Year 2017 April 1, 2018 To our Stakeholders: I am pleased to confirm that once again this year AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. ( AMG ) reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”) in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and AntiCorruption. Our Code of Business Conduct and Policy on Human Rights, both of which are available on our website, set out our commitments to act ethically and uphold the ten UNGC principles in all of our business activities. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication, primarily the AMG website www.amg-nv.com. Sincerely yours, Dr. Heinz C. Schimmelbusch Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer 20180401 Communication on Progress 1 HUMAN RIGHTS  Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group explicitly supports the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and refers to this commitment in its annual report to Shareholders. Although always an integral part of AMG, our formal commitment in this area started in 2009 with the publication of our Code of Business Conduct. 20180401 Communication on Progress 2 This was augmented in 2011 by the publication of our Policy on Human Rights. Both of these documents can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the AMG website, and the Human Rights Policy is shown below: A review of this policy in 2017 determined it to still be adequate to articulate AMG’s commitments and it remains relevant to the current business climate. A network of Compliance Officers under the oversight of a Chief Compliance Officer and a core Compliance team monitors the commitments made in these publications. The core Compliance team meets typically twice per year to review Compliance and Ethical issues and is supported by an independent external consultant. This consultant has assisted in the development of policies, procedures and training programs and in responding to enquiries from stakeholder groups with interests in human rights issues. There is an ongoing program of employee surveys to gauge the 20180401 Communication on Progress 3 workforce’s perceptions about AMG’s commitments to ethical business practices and human rights and reviewing AMG’s programs against the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises. To date the results of these surveys has been positive. In 2017 there were no reported incidents of breaches of the AMG Code of Business Conduct related to human rights abuses.  Principle 2 Make sure businesses are not complicit in human rights abuses The aim of the presence of an AMG business unit in a community is to strengthen and be part of the community, fostering sound relationships and avoiding conflicts. We respect the dignity and rights of our employees, their families and the communities in which we operate and others who might be affected by our operations and actively involving ourselves and supporting those communities. AMG also contributes through philanthropic donations to support local community needs including to schools, colleges and hospitals with a focus on education in STEM subjects. AMG sustains a network of Code of Business Conduct Compliance Officers covering all sites and based in countries and at major sites where AMG companies are operating to locally identify any potential human rights abuses. In instances where this needs to be done independently and confidentially, a Speak Up & Reporting Policy is in force allowing any employee to come forward and report issues. The Speak Up & Reporting Policy can be accessed through the Governance section of the AMG website. The Chief Compliance Officer and their team carefully review all Speak Up & Reporting Policy complaints. AMG also has a Supplier Conduct Charter, shown below, which is part of a process to ensure the standards relating to Human Rights which AMG holds itself to, are expanded to our suppliers as well. This policy states that: “AMG’s suppliers should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and ensure they are not complicit in human rights abuses.” This Supplier Conduct Charter was reviewed during 2017 and remains adequate under AMG’s current business climate. 20180401 Communication on Progress 4 LABOR  Principle 3 Businesses should uphold freedom of association & effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining AMG respects the freedom of its individual employees to join, or choose not to join, legally authorized association or organizations. AMG continues to use the Global Reporting Initiative 20180401 Communication on Progress 5 (GRI) indicator 102-41 (Collective Bargaining Agreements) to monitor this principle. In our 2017 Annual Report we state: “The rights and freedoms for individual employees to join, or choose not to join, unions, as described in Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are fully respected by AMG. Across AMG, 1,981 employees (66%) were covered by such collective bargaining agreements. 72% of AMG Critical Materials are covered by these arrangements, while AMG Engineering, which includes a higher proportion of professional salaried staff, has 51% of its employees covered. Once again in 2017, AMG facilities had no strikes or lockouts.” Additionally, we utilize indicator 102-41 (Collective Bargaining Agreements). In the 2017 Annual Report we state: “Protection of internationally proclaimed human rights is an area in which AMG is both highly aware and fully committed, and the Company strives to make sure it is not complicit in human rights abuses. Each AMG site is assessed during site visits and internal audits to identify if there is the possibility of freedom of association or collective bargaining being put at risk because of political or business factors. In 2017, it was found that no sites were at risk, with the exception of China, where the formation of unions remains restricted. Similarly, the Company has reviewed sites to ensure that they are not at risk for employing child labor or exposing young workers to hazards. No sites have been identified that pose a risk at this time. AMG also aims to ensure rights are protected in our supply chain through its Supplier Code of Conduct. Our policy on human rights is included in the Company Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and detailed in the Company’s human rights policy; all are available on the AMG website. Further, with the development and implementation of our Supplier Conduct Charter we begin to hold our suppliers to the same standard stating: “AMG’s suppliers should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor”  Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor All AMG employees work for the company as a result of need or want. Nobody is forced to work for AMG and we prohibit the use of any forced labor, including slavery, servitude, or prison labor. This is reflected in the widespread presence of unionized labor across AMG. Currently most of the locations and environments AMG facilities are present in are stable and advanced democracies, assisting in ensuring human rights abuses of this type are not occurring. AMG has development projects which may expand the boundaries of the company into countries with more challenging environments and AMG recognizes this may bring an increased level of diligence. Again, our Supplier Conduct Charter adopted in 2014 introduces our commitment to this principal to our suppliers stating: “AMG’s suppliers should support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor.” 20180401 Communication on Progress 6  Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labor As stated in our Human Rights Policy, AMG does not employ children and strongly rejects the use of child labor, and expects our suppliers to do the same through the requirements of our Supplier Conduct Charter. AMG does actively support the creation of educational programs for young people including apprenticeships combined with formal education, particularly in the areas of science and engineering. In our annual report we utilize the Global Reporting Initiative indicator 408-1 “Operations identified as having significant risk for incidents of child labor”. In its 2017 annual report AMG reported that it has reviewed 29 of its operating sites across the world to ensure that they are not at risk for employing child labor or exposing young workers to hazards. It was found that no sites posed a risk at this time. AMG is at the root of the supply chain for several of its products and is proud to be able to supply metals such as Tantalum and Tin, commodities historically fraught with human rights abuses, from mining operations with strong ethical practices and not utilizing child labor. In particular our Tantalum supply chain in Brazil is certified as Conflict Free by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC).  Principle 6 Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation AMG’s Code of Business Conduct states that the Company views as unacceptable any form of harassment or unfair or unlawful discrimination based on race, age, gender, color, sexual orientation, disability or national origin, whether by employees, temporary employees, managers, customers, vendors or AMG companies’ visitors. The size of AMG’s workforce has been relatively stable over the last year and at year-end 2017, AMG Critical Materials had 2,210 employees and AMG Engineering had 772. For the facilities covered by this report, the total AMG workforce was 2,982 (other facilities not yet covered in this section employ a further 119 people). Geographically, these were located in Asia (299), Europe (1,695), North America (425) and South America (563). In addition to direct employees, a further 270 directly supervised contract workers were employed at AMG sites in 2017. AMG assesses the diversity of its workforce in terms of gender and age, but not ethnicity. The multinational, and therefore multicultural, nature of AMG’s business means that ethnic diversity is significant, but it is not possible to define minority employees in such an environment. Of the total employees, 16% are female; 18% are under 30 years of age, 54% are between 30 and 50, and 28% are over 50. The Management Board is 100% male. The Supervisory Board is 78% male and 22% female. All Supervisory Board members are over 50 years of age. AMG is continuing to work to improve the diversity of its Boards. On page 29 of our 2017 Annual Report we note: “Gender Diversity: The Supervisory Board recognizes the importance of a diverse composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board in general, and in terms of gender in particular. In line with the Diversity Policy of the Company which was adopted in 2017, AMG pursues a policy of having at 20180401 Communication on Progress 7 least 30% of the seats on the Supervisory Board and the Management Board be held by each gender. The company will continue to take its key diversity objectives, including maintaining a proper balance of nationalities to reflect the transatlantic structure of AMG, and the gender allocation of seats as outlined above, into account in connection with recruitment, retention of employees and succession planning for both the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. In 2017, the Management Board deployed measures to attract and maintain a diverse workforce at its units, including linking incentive payments for unit managers to meaningful progress toward diversity targets. At the end of 2017, AMG did not meet its diversity objectives in terms of gender as outlined above, although with regard to the composition of the Supervisory Board after May 2, 2018, its composition will meet the diversity targets regarding gender, as outlined above. The Supervisory Board will continue to look for suitable female candidates for both the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in order to meet all of its diversity objectives as outlined in its Diversity Policy. ENVIRONMENT  Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges All AMG facilities have a strong awareness and knowledge of their environmental impact and the company utilizes the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines to measure and report environmental impacts in a number of areas including raw material use, energy consumption, greenhouse gas generation, water use and discharge and waste generation and disposal. Collection of this data is vital to help sites focus on improving efficiencies – including reducing energy use and concurrent greenhouse gas emissions, but also reducing solid and liquid wastes and reducing water consumption. AMG is transitioning to the latest GRI guidelines. These environmental impacts are reported annually to our stakeholders in the Company annual report. Additionally AMG reports its greenhouse gas emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Many of AMG’s activities focus on technologies to address fossil fuel efficiencies and reduce greenhouse gas generation, where we believe a precautionary approach is vital given the potential adverse effects. Many of the technologies that AMG produces, which we refer to as “enabling technologies” contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation and buildings sectors. The contribution of those technologies is outlined in the CEO letter on page 10 and 11 of the 2017 Annual Report to Shareholders: “As stated repeatedly, we perceive the environment to be our most important stakeholder, as environmental health is the basis for universal long-term existence. Our business model is constructed around energy-efficient products—this is the common denominator of our offerings. For many years, we have applied a methodology of not only describing what we do in this space, but also measuring the impact of our products on CO2 emissions. The list of such products and services includes graphite formulations for energy-saving insulation materials; titanium alloys that reduce the weight of aerospace engines; advanced surface treatment of automotive engine parts and thermal treatment of aerospace turbine blades (both enabling higher operating temperatures); and aluminum structures for light weighting in cars. In 2017, the combined impact of those activities added up to an astonishing 37.4 million metric tons of net CO2 reduction (enabling CO2 reductions less total CO2 emissions of 0.6 million metric tons in our plants) when compared to applying conventional technologies. Measured against total assets of $956.6m, this yields a ratio 20180401 Communication on Progress 8 of 39 metric tons of CO2 reduction per $1,000 of assets. While far from perfect, this measurement methodology provides excellent guidance in illustrating AMG’s enormous progress over time. Over time, we have begun to realize that the concept of providing our customers with new material solutions, enabling them to implement fuel efficiency improvements and develop new energy saving products, would lead to a new, very important metric — namely how we, as a company, impact the global industrial and societal complex around us. We can trace the impact of selected product areas with respect to the CO2 reduction these products enable. Based on our estimates, if AMG and its products had not existed in 2017, we would have approximately 37.4 million metric tons (up from 28.4 million metric tons in 2016) of additional CO2 in the atmosphere. This compares to AMG’s CO2 emissions of roughly 600,000 metric tons. We are extremely proud of this fact and we track our enabling impact, year by year, to monitor our performance. Of course, we are aware of the imperfections of measuring the enabled CO2 reduction, but it is a powerful instrument in capital allocation decisions. There will hopefully be a time when awards will also be presented for a company’s impact on CO2 emissions, as well as for financial performance. We would most happily participate in that race.” Additionally, the relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP).  Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility The principles outlined by AMG’s CEO and founder referred to above eloquently describe AMG’s broader approach to the environment. In terms of detailed environmental management at local sites, twelve of the larger AMG manufacturing facilities now have ISO 14001 environmental management system certification in place. Formalized management systems are seen as a key tool to maintaining focus on environmental responsibility. Additionally AMG has invested in projects including hydroelectric generation, solar generation and heat recovery systems. It is also promoting energy management initiatives to improve efficiencies, with several larger energy users, including the largest, holding ISO 50001 energy management certification. The relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP).  Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies As described above, AMG’s businesses continue to focus on environmentally friendly technologies. In 2017 AMG continued its investment in the production of titanium aluminides used in the aerospace industry. Investments in the plant in Cambridge, Ohio that produces the steel strengthening alloy ferrovanadium from byproducts of the oil refining and power generation industries, eliminating landfill, has resulted in significant capacity increase, with minimal increase in carbon footprint. Further, this technology reduces energy in the manufacturing process and by strengthening steel, significantly reduces the tonnages required in end user applications. AMG is also actively supporting the automotive industry as it moves to more fuel efficient turbo charged, low displacement engines, through heat treatment of fast moving, high temperature parts such as 20180401 Communication on Progress 9 turbo chargers and piston heads. Similar applications have been seen in next generation aviation jet engines which contribute to the fuel efficiency of next generation aircraft and where AMG’s ceramic coating technologies further enable fuel efficiency savings. AMG continues to believe that nuclear power is required as part of the short and medium term solution to anthropogenic CO2 emissions and continue to supply products and engineering expertise to support this sector. ANTI CORRUPTION  Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. In 2009 AMG introduced (and published) its Code of Business Conduct to all of its staff which sets out guiding principles in its ethics and business conduct as adopted and approved by the Company’s Management Board and Supervisory Board. The Code of Business Conduct was reviewed and updated in 2016, adding safety as a core value, and it discusses in detail the ethical conduct and business practices which AMG expects from all employees, covering area’s like conflicts of interest, anti-bribery, insider dealing, policies on corporate entertainment and acceptance of gifts, and the integrity of our record keeping and reporting. AMG also has a standalone policy on Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption. This is available under the Corporate Governance section of the AMG-NV website. Training in these aspects is carried out on an ongoing basis. AMG further promotes these values throughout the Company with multi lingual posters prominently displayed at operational sites to raise awareness of the Code of Business Conduct and various ethically based programs. 20180401 Communication on Progress 10 20180401 Communication on Progress 11 ATTACHMENT 1 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SECTION FROM THE 2017 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS 20180401 Communication on Progress 12 S U S TA I N A B L E DEVELOPMENT This section provides our tenth annual sustainability report, which e v a l u a t e s a n d c o m p a r e s A M G ’s s o c i a l and environmental performance to previous years.

AMG will continue to assess the boundaries of this report based on the corporate 1.04 2016 ownership structure on an ongoing basis. All locations report their performance at the end of the fourth quarter and no forecast data are used. However, sales and administrative offices and some smaller engineering sites (typically with fewer than 10 employees or with environmental impacts <1% in all aspects) have been determined to be immaterial to the report, and therefore estimated data have been used for these in 2017. Those sites utilizing estimated T O TA L I N C I D E N T R AT E data are indicated in the table on page 38.

AMG resource usage data comprise raw materials, associated process materials, semi-manufactured goods and parts and packaging, by weight. 6 Given that AMG Engineering predominantly provides furnace technology and engineering services, including furnace assembly 2,365 Indirect operations and heat treatment services, this segment utilizes relatively limited amounts of resources. Resources used are mainly complex component parts for furnaces, which are 186 routinely measured in units rather than by mass. Unlike the chemicals and alloys business units, this means only limited data are available on resource mass. In 2017, AMG Engineering reported using 4,160 mt of resources, all of which were classified as primary. AMG Critical Materials uses a much more diverse range of AMG Critical Materials resources, including mined ores for tantalum, lithium and 2015 graphite production, power plant wastes and spent refinery AMG Engineering catalysts to produce vanadium alloys, and metal salts for 783 Direct aluminum alloy production. The segment uses recycled iron, steel, aluminum and titanium in processes when possible. 13 The segment utilized 842,150 mt of resources in 2017, of which 47,410 mt were secondary or recycled materials. 2,410 Indirect EN ER GY CO N SU M P T IO N GRI STANDARDS 302-1 AND 302-2 187 Energy remains a major area of focus for AMG for both environmental and economic reasons.

In 2017, the total water disposed to water courses by AMG 0 Critical Materials equaled 2,984,000 cubic meters, compared to 3,257,000 cubic meters, in 2016. This decrease is attributed to improvements in efficiencies at the AMG Mineração mine, 367 Indirect production levels and product mix. Of the total amount, 1,629,000 cubic meters of water were discharged to the same 27 water body from which it was drawn at the mine site in Brazil, a 17% reduction from 2016. After mining activities, most of AMG Critical Materials’ water is used for cooling purposes and therefore produces clean water discharges, and some of the wet chemical processes generate aqueous waste streams. This included cooling water used by the silicon metal furnaces as well as mine water from 2016 dewatering pumps.
