These decisions were not taken lightly, but were necessary to enable us to better serve our patients while maintaining the highest standards of quality, ethics, and compliance. In these times of change, our commitment to Social Impact has not wavered. Social Impact is inherently embedded in our business, as Teva is uniquely positioned to improve health by offering accessible treatments to millions worldwide.

Teva 2017 Social Impact Report Contributing to healthy communities 23 Reducing the spread of communicable diseases Communicable, or infectious, diseases are caused by microorganisms that spread from one person to another and include tuberculosis (TB), influenza, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). While deaths from communicable diseases have been reduced by vaccines and treatment advancements, their ability to spread widely and, in some cases, become chronic, poses a global health threat. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (target 3.3: end the epidemics of AIDS, TB, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases, and other communicable diseases), in 2017, Teva delivered novel treatments and preventive medicines for patients suffering from, or at risk of, infectious diseases. Tuberculosis Human immunodeficiency virus TB is an airborne bacterial infection affecting the lungs. HIV is a virus spread through bodily fluids that attacks When it doesn’t respond to the two most powerful the immune system by destroying cells that fight anti-TB drugs, it can become multidrug-resistant disease and infection.

Without effective antibiotics, infectious diseases can become deadly outbreaks, not just in humans, but also in our global food supply. In the U.S. alone, more than two million people will develop an infection caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year, resulting in about 23,000 deaths.13 Partnering to address antimicrobial resistance with industry leaders Addressing antibiotic effectiveness and understanding how alternative approaches can treat and prevent infections is a top priority. Teva is committed to being a part of the solution. We work to improve hygiene, vaccination, and preventive treatments to reduce the spread of infections needing antibiotic treatment as well as support programs to promote appropriate antibiotic use. Following the 2016 World Economic Forum, global pharmaceutical companies and health organizations, including Teva, created the AMR Industry Alliance. The Alliance provides multifaceted, sustainable solutions to reduce AMR, invest in R&D to meet public health needs, and improve access to antibiotics, vaccines, and diagnostics. Encouraging and supporting immunization programs The spread of AMR can be limited through immunization, preventing noncritical use of antibiotics. In Canada, where legislation enables pharmacists to administer immunizations and injectable drugs, we maintain a comprehensive pharmacist and pharmacy technician training program. This advanced Canadian program helps pharmacists deliver immunizations safely and competently.

Migraine is the third most common disease in the world, with an estimated global prevalence of 14.7%,17 more than diabetes, epilepsy, and asthma combined.18 Discovering breakthroughs in headache relief Through targeted research and clinical trials, we have been advancing a preventive treatment for migraine headaches. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the Biologics License Application for our chronic and episodic migraine treatment. We also initiated a Phase II clinical program for treatment of post-traumatic headache disorder, which affects many of the 1.7 million people who suffer traumatic brain injuries each year in the U.S. alone. Our online forum enables patients to learn more about migraine, seek advice surrounding lifestyle modifications to avoid common migraine triggers, and use mobile apps to track the status of their migraines. Co-creating with patients for better outcomes Together with consumer insights experts, we created My Brain for Migraine Square™—a community of patients with migraine who collaborate with Teva.

Every role at Teva was assigned a risk designation based on interactions with members of the healthcare community or government officials, and received relevant training. To continue to support our compliance activities, we rolled out a new Health Care Interactions portal in 14 languages for all employees in late 2017. The portal provides information on the entire healthcare engagement lifecycle—from hiring healthcare professionals to funding healthcare organizations. Expanding compliance In 2017, we widened the scope of our Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors to oversee Teva’s commitment to corporate responsibility, including community outreach, academic relations, Social Impact programs, and stakeholder management. Collaborating to improve compliance At the end of 2016, Teva was fined for committing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act offenses in Ukraine, Mexico, and Russia in three instances of improper dealings with government officials. In addition to paying a financial settlement, Teva entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement that required an independent compliance monitor. We have taken all possible steps to prevent recurrence of these incidents, and in 2017, worked with the compliance monitor to remediate any identified compliance risks.
