On the Centenary of the Company’s Founding Stakeholder I feel that it is wonderful how you have sincerely responded to the results of the dialog during the past two years through evaluation and execution. Also, in the lead-up to commemorating your centennial in 2018, you are instilling your corporate philosophy. To achieve this, it is necessary to be linked to specific actions and to clarify what links the corporate philosophy to the concrete actions of employees. Doing this will enable each and every employee to contribute to society through his or her actions. Katsuhiko Kokubu Professor, Graduate School of Business Administration, Kobe University 2. The Need for CSR in the Midst of Global Expansion Stakeholder In order to promote CSR on a global basis, it is important to cooperate with local companies and with society. Toward that end, it is also useful to “identify materiality (issue of particular importance among wide range of CSR initiatives)” in addition to instilling the corporate philosophy, so please consider that aspect. From a management perspective, “promoting diversity” is also an important factor. For the global expansion, promoting diversity is required with the understanding of executive officers. Yoko Hiyama Lawyer admitted in Japan and New York, 3. Environmental Initiatives Ethos Law Office, Ethos LPC Stakeholder I believe that you have positioned itself at a fairly high level in terms of reducing the environmental impact of its business operations. In the future, I would expect to see initiatives involving different aspects than in the past through the establishment of an environmental strategy with a long-term perspective. This could involve reducing the environmental impacts and other innovations in the scope of supply chain. In such a case, it would be necessary to develop indicators, such as the environmental contribution, that could be understood by a third-party, what it means the objectivity of data. I believe that products that contribute to society — not only from your own company but also developed in collaboration with Kazuhiko Shiratori other companies — will be essential for the sustainable society.
