Operational facilities also deem locations close to transport links to be highly important, but in this case the road The labour market network is the most relevant factor. Sweden has a strong economy which grew 3.2 percent in 2017. Demand has been strong in Wihlborgs’ regions, though The situation is better on the Danish side than it has been for primarily on the Skåne side of the Öresund, with Malmö seeing many years, with growth in the economy of around 2 percent. strong growth and continuing to attract new companies from According to forecasts by Arbetsförmedlingen (Sweden’s other regions to set up there. public employment agency), labour market conditions in Skåne are positive. The rate of employment increased by 12,500 peoSources: Örestat, Swedish Property Federation, News Øresund, City of Malmö, Newsec, Arbetsförmedlingen, Öresund Bridge. ple in 2017, while the forecast for 2018 estimates that a further 9,600 will find work. The Swedish side of the Öresund region therefore continues to represent a driver of the labour market, with an upturn distributed over most sectors. Despite the strong economy and a robust labour market, unemployment is high in Skåne. In December 2017, 9.9 percent of the population was openly unemployed. An explanation of this high figure is that the supply of labour is increasing faster than demand, which is due to a high level of immigration. This means that unemployment in Skåne is more structural than economy-related. On the Danish side of the Öresund, conditions are positive with an unemployment rate of around 4 percent in 2017. Employment has increased for several years in a row, particularly in the capital region of Copenhagen. During the first six months of 2017, the number of people employed in Denmark rose by 0.8 percent. Efficient infrastructure The Öresund region has well-developed infrastructure that encourages cross-border travel. The Öresund Bridge dominates in terms of journeys across the strait with its 7.5 million vehicles and frequent train services, while the Helsingborg-Helsingør ferry route handles some 1.6 million journeys by vehicle. On the Danish side, central Copenhagen can be traversed by metro, local trains (S-trains) and regional buses. There are also plans to develop public transport to the suburbs by way of a high-speed tram line, known as the Ring 3 Light rail, which is expected to be completed around 2023–2024. It is easy to commute for work across Skåne using the Pågatåg (regional commuter trains) and regional buses, as well as the Öresundtrains that also traverse the Öresund Bridge. Copenhagen Airport is northern Europe’s largest airport, with over 29 million passengers per year. In order to manage the increasing demand for travel, the airport will expand and increase its capacity to 40 million passengers. The project, which is already under way, is expected to cost approximately Peter Nielsen is responsible for Wihlborgs’ operations in Denmark. 26 Our operations | Property portfolio Property portfolio and Industrial/ Warehousing Projects/Land Copenhagen Malmö transactions 21% 1% 19% 42% Rental value Rental value per property per area category 78% 16% 23% Office/Retail Lund Helsingborg Industrial/ Warehousing Projects/Land Copenhagen Malmö Since 2005, Wihlborgs’ property value has increased from 15% 5% 18% 45% SEK 7.2 to 38.6 billion.

New suppliers are assessed from a comprehensive viewpoint and we require them to sign Wihlborgs’ Code of Conduct. We also run a check on their financial status. In 2017, we implemented the Code of Conduct in our Danish operations as well. We will establish procedures in 2018 that ensure suppliers in project activities adhere to the Code of Conduct even in cases where we sign separate project agreements. We will also continue to conduct random checks in which we interview suppliers at their premises about areas such as environment, work environment, quality and ethics.

Responsibility at every stage As the market leader, Wihlborgs has a responsibility to be ethically correct in its business affairs and to serve as a positive example. Our business relationships and working methods are to be consistently characterised by our values: knowledge, honesty, action and community. We conduct business on the basis of our core values and our organisation has short decisionmaking paths. We work continuously on our work environment, culture and skills to retain and develop our positive business climate. Our hope is that this may have a positive effect on both tenants and suppliers. However, our ability to exert influence varies across different parts of our value chain. In the course of direct contact with tenants, suppliers and contractors, we have greater influence than with contacts further back in the value chain – such as subcontractors to our contractors. Responsible customer relationships We manage our own properties, which immediately entails a close relationship to the customers. This enables us to pursue Christina Spångäng works as a purchaser at Wihlborgs’ head office in Malmö. a continuous dialogue with them and to be keenly aware of any needs that arise. In addition to continuous dialogue with our tenants, a customer survey is conducted biennially through which environment.

The overall score in the customer survey conducted in Wihlborgs’ purchasing function is responsible for ensuring 2016 was 4.13 on a five-point scale, which was the best result the company has a professional purchasing process, that we achieved since Wihlborgs began surveying in 2003.

Collaboration with universities Wihlborgs collaborates with universities in different ways. The mission of the Miljöbron organisation in Lund is to provide a link between students and the business community. Wihlborgs is one of the financiers and sponsors the initiative by providing office space in one of our buildings at Ideon. Various sets of students have linked essays about the environment to Wihlborgs’ operations. Case studies in the areas of ecosystem services and climate adaptation were carried out in 2017. The year also saw students from the International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) at Lund University carry out a study which analysed the way digitisation can contribute to sustainable buildings and resource efficiency at Wihlborgs. Image: Diego Cattolica from the International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) presents the results of the study he carried out with Marie Jäppinen and Michael Port. 62 Our operations | Sustainable business criteria concern the indoor climate of the building, for example acoustics, lighting and air quality. An environmental certification is verified two years after the original certification, so it is important to follow up on established criteria and maintain a strong environmental performance in the building over time. In 2017, one building was awarded a preliminary SGBC environmental certification. We also carried out an obligatory twoyear verification of two buildings. Ten ongoing projects are working towards preliminary environmental certification, of which eight are at SGBC Gold level. We also launched a pilot project during the year in which we environmentally certify three older properties based on the English BREEAM In-Use certification. We certify both the building and our management/governance. This initiative highlighted areas in which we have the potential to improve our property management – for example by way of joint procedures and templates. The results of the certification will be announced in early 2018. In total, our certified properties comprise nine percent, or 189,000 m2, of Wihlborgs’ total property portfolio. The market value of these properties is estimated at SEK 7,375 million, corresponding to 19 percent of the total property value. Demand for environmentally certified buildings is increasing and Wihlborgs has received procurement requirements in which tenants were seeking environmentally certified premises. In 2017, we conducted an energy-saving initiative at the Uven 9 property and began Bronze-level SGBC certification linked to a renovation. Thanks to efforts relating to property technology, we have reduced the need for heating by approximately 25 percent and consumption of electricity in properties by some 40 percent. This entails a saving of Project-adapted environmental 210,000 kWh, which means financial savings of some SEK 200,000 per year. programme We implemented Wihlborgs’ new environmental programme Wihlborgs participated in an innovation project linked to circular for new-build and redevelopment projects in 2017.

Changes in property values Property expenses Description of risk The property portfolio directly affects both income and key ratios. Description of risk The extent of changes in value is partly determined by Wihlborgs’ own capacity, through alteration and upgrading of properties, as Major operating cost items are tariff-based costs for heating, well as by lease contracts and client structures, to increase the electricity, water and waste management. Other costs include properties’ market value, and partly by external factors that affect property tax, property upkeep, repairs and maintenance and adsupply and demand in Wihlborgs’ property markets. ministration. Under many of the leases, the bulk of these costs are passed on to the tenants. As a result, the impact of any change in the costs is relatively limited. Unforeseen repairs on a major scale may have a negative effect on profit, with the risk of this increasing if ongoing maintenance is inadequate. Climate changes increase the risk of storm and water damage in the future. 78 Financial information | Administration Report via agreements with contractors and partly via regular internal Risk management follow-ups versus budget to identify and address any deviations For information on estimates and judgements in property in good time.

No deduction may be made for input VAT relating to operating costs or investments in premises that have not been registered for voluntary liability for VAT. In 2017, non-deductible input VAT on operating costs totalled SEK 6 million (6). This amount was recognised as an operating cost in the annual accounts. In 2017, non-deductible input VAT on investments totalled SEK 6 million (11) and was recognised as investment in property. Stamp duties The sale of real property in Sweden is subject to stamp duty (transfer of title) of 4.25 percent on the purchase price or tax assessment value, whichever is the higher. In Denmark, the tax rate is 0.6 percent and the tax is charged in the same way. In the case of intra-Group property transactions, it is possible to be granted deferral of stamp duty until the property is sold outside the Group. If properties are purchased or sold as companies (packaged in holding companies) no stamp duty is payable. In 2017, SEK 4 million (11) was paid as stamp duty on the transactions in which Wihlborgs was involved. Stamp duty of 2 percent (1.5 percent in Denmark) was also payable on mortgages taken out on properties. This tax amounted to SEK 28 million (17) in 2017. Energy taxes In 2017, Wihlborgs procured energy at a cost of SEK 141 million (134) for use in its properties, primarily for heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting. Of this cost, energy taxes accounted for SEK 19 million (19). Wihlborgs is striving actively to reduce its energy consumption, which in the long term, and assuming an unchanged tax rate and property portfolio, will lead to lower energy tax costs.

When leases expired, rents were adjusted to market levels while consideration was given to the property-specific, longterm vacancy risk. The long-term rent trends for office and commercial premises in their existing state is assumed to be no more than the rate of inflation. Operating and maintenance costs are expected to rise by 0.5 percentage points above the rate of inflation during the calculation period. Standardised operating and maintenance costs are applied when assessing values, and the specific characteristics of the property are also taken into account. These estimates are based on analyses of historical outcomes and budgeted costs at both property and aggregated level for the market segments and property categories concerned. Over the calculation period, it is assumed that the CPI will be 1.9 percent in 2017 and that inflation will follow Riksbanken’s (the Swedish Central Bank) long-term target of 2 percent. 84 Financial statements | Consolidated Right next to Lund Central Station, Wihlborgs is building the Posthornet office building, which will be ready for occupancy in spring 2018.

As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company’s situation. We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’ proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss we examined the Board of Directors’ reasoned statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.
