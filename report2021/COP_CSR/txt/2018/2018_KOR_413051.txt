Major criteria for appointment include general knowledge of the capital market, relevant experience and professionalism of KSD’s business, sense of ethics and responsibility. Management proposals made by non-executive directors are reviewed by the relevant departments to determine whether to adopt them or make them available for further reference, and are then reported to the supervising directors. Non-executive directors are also invited as instructors to management strategy meetings and manager workshops so as to fully benefit from their extensive experience and expertise. Independence of the BOD KSD guarantees the independence of the BOD so that it can fully carry out its role of exerting checks and balances within the company.

Through our risk management efforts, we seek to secure a globally competitive level of stability and reliability in our business management, thereby fulfilling our responsibilities as a comprehensive manager of the public’s investment assets. Objective Ensure Globally Competitive Stability and Reliability Enterprise-wide Comprehensive Preemptive Well-structured Stable corporate Strategies perspective response identification system culture Risk Management Organization In an effort to strengthen our execution of risk management at an enterprise-wide level, KSD operates the Risk Management Committee separately from the Board of Directors. We control risks through a three-step approach consisting of the department in charge, the Risk Management Department and the Auditing Department.

The Risk Clinic, which is composed of in-house expert groups in areas such as IT, law, practical affairs and tax can rapid respond based on expertise when complex risk factors occur in various fields. 16 Company Profile Governance Sustainable Management Human Rights Risk Management Enterprise-wide Risk Management System In response to rising demands for a stronger capacity to manage and respond to internal and external risks, KSD has established and is operating the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system by expanding the company’s existing risk management system which was built and further developed to better address operating risks. Since 2014, KSD established a compliance management system to expand the scope of compliance and enable better control of compliance risks. The system was further advanced by being connected to the ERP system for consistent and stronger control activities. Accordingly, they comprise the Governance, Risk Management, Compliance (GRC) system, a comprehensive system based on risk management and compliance, monitoring our overall management activities in line with our management objectives.

First of all, in the face of increasing information security risks, we reformed our policy on access authority to our website, making it mandatory to regularly inspect access authority on a semi-annual basis and reducing the number of websites subject to access. Through these changes, we were able to prevent information security risks and strengthen website compliance. Moreover, we published a revised edition of our compliance manual, raising awareness of compliance among our employees. Furthermore, aging voice-recording devices were entirely replaced with high-performance devices, contributing to greater business stability. KSD plans to make further improvements soon by establishing a comprehensive operating scheme for voice recording systems.

In this regard, we reformed our financial risk management system in 2016 in consultation with the relevant departments, by expanding the scope and strengthening the monitoring of credit risk management and changing risk calculation methods. Furthermore, by adopting the risk management methods of the International Central Securities Depository (ICSD), KSD was able to enhance flexibility and profitability in fund management under low-interest rate conditions while securing stability through consistent monitoring. Strengthening the Enterprise-wide Work-related Risk Monitoring System KSD operates an internal control system which incorporates real-time monitoring and preemptive alerts of financial and operating risks through Key Risk Indicators (KRI) and Risk & Control Self Assessment (RCSA), as well as regular reporting of monitoring results. In 2016, an emergency risk assessment system was established within the internal control system in order to promptly assess work-related risks in case of emergency situations such as a financial crisis. By extracting major crisis indicators from the seven departments in charge and enabling their automatic appearance on internal control system screens, the specificity of the indicators can be analyzed. Such computerization of the emergency risk assessment process not only enables effective response to risks and regular monitoring for signs of crisis but also serves as useful statistical references. Internalizing Risk Management Awareness in Employees In an effort to strengthen our risk management ability at the enterprise-wide level, we actively share risk-management information with our employees, in addition to publishing and distributing relevant publications such as compliance operation manual and privacy breach case book. • ‌Gathering of opinions on restructuring the financial risk management Information system sharing • ‌Announcement of the reformed policy on access authority to the website • ‌Publication and distribution of the compliance operation manual Publications • ‌Publication and distribution of privacy breach cases 19 Korea Securities Depository 2017 Sustainability Report Sustainability Sustainability Management Strategy Framework Management KSD has established a new sustainability management strategy framework to creating social valStrategy ues while grow together with stakeholders.
