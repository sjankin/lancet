CREATING TOMMOROW’S SOLUTIONS GLOBAL COMPACT PROGRESS REPORT 2018 1 Statement of Continued Support (Message from the CEO) Ladies and Gentlemen, In 2017, WACKER continued on its grow th trajectory. Sales climbed by more than 6 percent to €4.92 billion. We established the basis for WACKER’s future success w hen w e introduced our five-point strategy. It outlines our clear targets and visions for developing WACKER. These have not changed. We remain firmly on course, alw ays trying to seize every opportunity that arises. Sustainability w ill become an ever more crucial factor in all our business processes – from the optimal use of raw materials and greater process efficiency through to the development of sustainable products that reduce CO2 emissions. As a company dedicated to sustainability, w e are aw are that becoming sustainable is an ongoing process. We have not yet reached w here w e w ant to be in every respect. Although w e have been recording few er reportable w orkplace accidents than the German chemical-industry average for several years, w e still have not achieved the goal w e set ourselves regarding occupational accidents w ith w orkdays missed. To improve WACKER’s record here, w e are focusing on our new occupational safety programs. Today, a significant proportion of our products goes into sustainable applications, such as polysilicon for solar installatio ns, additives for adhesives used in w ind turbines, high-performance silicones for electric cars, and dispersible polymer pow der for external thermal insulation composite systems. The strong grow th experienced by photovoltaics show s that solar energy has a great future. Solar pow er is one of the most cost-efficient and environmentally friendly energy sources on earth. Renew able energy is also one of the 17 goals set by the United Nations in 2015 for sustainable development. It is both an honor and a source of inspiration for WACKER to help bring about the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One topic that is high on every company’s agenda at the moment is digitalization. WACKER is no exception. The key question is w hat approach to take. Digitalization w ill not happen overnight. It w ill be our constant companion in the years ahead as w e make our w ay into the digital era. Our approach is to take the initiative – not in a rush, but w ith all due care. Clearly, the w ealth of expertise and experience gained in the pre-digital age is still valuable. Digitalization underscores a basic fact: the w orld is changing. And w e must rise to this challenge. We have proven again and again that w e can. Throughout the 104 years of our company’s history, adaptability and the w ill to change have stood out as characteristic strengths. And, above all, w e think and act for the long term. That is w hat pays off over time. In this regard, it is particularly important to involve people. One of the measures w e are taking to meet this goal is the employee survey, w hich w e w ill be holding once more in 2018. Similarly, w e are placing greater focus on our shared corporate values, w hich w e w ant to communicate clearly to employees throughout the company. We w ill also be emphasizing the part played by every single employee in achieving these values. This approach contributes to the key topic of “human rights w ithin the company.” After all, individuals remain at the heart of our policy. WACKER has done over the past tw o years to make the w orld more sustainable. We w ill continue to play our part – w ith determination, drive and perseverance. 2 1 Statement of Continued Support (Message from the CEO) ________________ 2 2 Governance ________________________________________________________ 4 SustainaBalance®: Strategic orientation for the future ________________________________________ 4 Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals _____________________________________________ 4 Responsible Care® and UN Global Compact _______________________________________________ 5 Principles of Corporate Ethics ___________________________________________________________ 5 Integrated Management System _________________________________________________________ 5 Sustainability report ___________________________________________________________________ 5 Analysis of Fundamental Sustainability Issues ______________________________________________ 5 3 Practical Actions ____________________________________________________ 7 Human Rights ______________________________________________________________ 7 Personell matters_____________________________________________________________________ 7 Basic and Advanced Training at High Levels _______________________________________________ 7 Diversity and Equal Opportunity _________________________________________________________ 7 Proportion of Women in Executive Positions ________________________________________________ 8 New Variable Compensation System _____________________________________________________ 8 Introduction of Family Leave ____________________________________________________________ 9 Employee Turnover ___________________________________________________________________ 9 Employee Representation ______________________________________________________________ 9 Labor Standards & Safety _____________________________________________________ 9 Plant Safety _________________________________________________________________________ 9 Safety Training and Inspections _________________________________________________________ 9 Product Safety ______________________________________________________________________ 10 Safe Transport of Hazardous Materials ___________________________________________________ 10 Workplace Safety ___________________________________________________________________ 11 Environment & Climate ______________________________________________________ 12 Environmental Protection _____________________________________________________________ 12 Assessment Using the Global Water Tool™ _______________________________________________ 13 Energy ____________________________________________________________________________ 13 Emissions _________________________________________________________________________ 14 Anti-Corruption and Bribery __________________________________________________ 16 Social Responsibility________________________________________________________ 16 Neihbors __________________________________________________________________________ 17 Schools and Universities ______________________________________________________________ 17 Donations and Sponsorship ___________________________________________________________ 17 4 Special Awards and Events __________________________________________ 18 Inclusion in Bavaria __________________________________________________________________ 18 Award for Idea Management ___________________________________________________________ 18 WACKER Again Gets Gold in EcoVadis Rating ____________________________________________ 18 Haiti: School is thriving _______________________________________________________________ 19 5 Principles of UN Compact and its relation to WACKER __________________ 20 3 2 Governance SustainaBalance®: Strategic orientation for the future Sustainability is one of WACKER’s five strategic corporate goals. As an industrial company, w e are answ erable to a variety of interest groups, first and foremost our customers and employees as w ell as our shareholders. In this regard, w e must find a sensible, sustainable balance – hence the name of our program: SustainaBalance®: find a sensible, sustainable balance – hence the name of our program: SustainaBalance®. We are enabling our customers We create efficient and safe As part of the society, we strive to serve more operations, using resources refor a more sustainable sustainable solutions.. sponsibly, eliminating waste value chain together and minimizing our footprint. with all our partners. . Alignm ent w ith Sustainable Developm ent Goals On September 25, 2015, the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” w as approved at the UN Summit in New York. WACKER is focusing on the fields of action on w hich w e can have the greatest influence. Therefore, WACKER is prioritizing the follow ing SDGs: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) describe  The global challenges that WACKER can help overcome  The significant opportunities for WACKER’s operations  The guiding principle for innovations at WACKER  The orientation for approaching these challenges and opportunities in a targeted and efficient manner. 4 It is important for us to align our strategic goal to the Sustainable Development Goals. Responsible Care® and UN Global Com pact Our actions are guided by tw o voluntary global initiatives that form the basis for sustainable corporate management at WACKER: the chemical industry’s Responsible Care® initiative and the UN Global Compact. WACKER has been an active member of the Responsible Care® initiative since 1991 and, as a program participant, the company must act to continually improve health, safety and environmental performance on a voluntary basis – even in the absence of statutory requirements. As a member of the UN Global Compact, w e actively support the goals of this, the w orld’s most important and extensive initiative for responsible corporate management. The Global Compact addresses the protection of human rights, social and environmental standards, and the fight against corruption. Principles of Corporate Ethics Beside our vision and goals, ethical principles form the third pillar of WACKER’s corporate policy guidelines. These principles are laid dow n in five corporate codes – including the Code of Sustainability – and are supplemented by a body of regulations and directives. They are mandatory for all employees w orldw ide. The codes can also be view ed on the WACKER w ebsite: Link Integrated Management System We control operational processes via our integrated management system (IMS). It stipulates uniform standards throughout the Group for issues of quality, environmental protection, health and safety. We have our Group management system certified by an international certification organization to ensure its compliance w ith ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental protection) standards, and w ith ISO 50001 (energy) at our German sites. In the reporting year, the regional sustainability management focus w as on Asia. The Chinese sites Nanjing, Shanghai and Zhangjiagang, as w ell as the Kolkata site in India, underw ent occupational health and safety inspections. In 2018, the regional focus w ill be on the Americas. Sustainability report Every tw o years, w e publish a sustainability report in order to inform our stakeholders about WACKER’s sustainability w ork in an open and comprehensive manner. In 2017, WACKER published its Sustainability Report for 2015/2016. Reasons for again publishing the report exclusively as an online version included minimizing resource consumption and thus serving the interests of environmental protection. The report w as compiled in accordance w ith GRI Standards (“Core” option). The Sustainability Report contains a detailed description of our non-financial performance indicators. Analysis of Fundam ental Sustainability Issues WACKER communicates regularly w ith a number of stakeholder groups: shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, journalists, scientists, neighbors and politicians, as w ell as representatives of associations and NGOs. For years, WACKER has conducted regular surveys of its stakeholders as part of its sustainability reporting. The global survey conducted in 2016 helped us determine w hich sustainability topics stakeholders and top managers consider to be material, and how they rate our sustainability efforts. The result w as that compliance, product safety and plant safety are the top three issues as seen by the company and stakeholders. 5 Top managers rated 25 out of 34 topics as important, w hile stakeholders rated 26 of them as important. Our threshold value for key topics, about w hich w e provide information in this report, w as at least 4.00 points (for both survey groups) on a scale of 1.00 (very low ) to 5.00 (very high). The top three topics as seen by the company and stakeholders w ith a value of 4.51 or higher are compliance, product safety and plant safety. These are follow ed by topics that are rated 4.51 or higher by either top management or the stakeholders: occupational health and safety, energy, sustainable products, transport safety, fair business practices, competitiveness, and value trends. For reasons of continuity, w e continue to report to a limited extent on topics that w ere rated by top managers and/or stakeholders as being of less relevance. You can find more details in our sustainability report: Link 6 3 Practical Actions Human Rights Respect for human rights, and the elimination of human rights abuses, are fundamental to our activities. We are explicitly committed to the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles, w hich includes supporting the protection of human rights and precluding human rights abuses. We condemn slavery and all other forms of forced or compulsory labor. In doing so, w e follow the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the ILO Core Labor Standards and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This means focusing not only on w orking conditions at the company itself, but also on upholding human rights in our supply chain. We expect our suppliers to comply w ith the principles of the Global Compact and the Responsible Care® initiative, and have made this part of our General Terms and Conditions of Procurement. As part of our Together for Sust ainability (TfS) initiative, w e use assessments and audits to check compliance . Personell m atters The people at WACKER are key to our success. WACKER requires committed and skilled w orkers if it is to remain innovative and competitive. In the spirit of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 8 – Decent Work and Economic Grow th – WACKER ensures that its employees can realize their potential, assume responsibility and contribute their ow n ideas. It does so by offering them basic and advanced training opportunities. To this end, w e w ant to provide secure jobs, generous employee benefits and a w ork culture that facilitates a positive w ork-life balance. We place great emphasis on offering all our employees equal opportunity. It is also our aim to permanently integrate employees w ho are disabled or suffer from long-term occupational disabilities. Vocational training has alw ays been a key focus of personnel development at WACKER. We offer our employees attractive compensation and promotion prospects and share our company’s success w ith them. In our Code of Conduct, w e explicitly commit ourselves to the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles. They include the principles on labor standards, namely upholding the freedom of association (Principle 3), eliminating all forms of f orced labor (Principle 4), abolishing child labor (Principle 5) and eliminating discrimination (Principle 6). We also make commitments to our customers to uphold these same labor standards. The sanctions w e impose for any proven misconduct in personnel matters are determined by the seriousness of the incident. There w ere no incidents of note in the reporting year.. Basic and Advanced Training at High Levels Vocational training is another key component of WACKER’s personnel development activities. In 2017, 188 young people began their training at WACKER or at the Burghausen Vocational Training Center (BBiW). In total, the company employed 601 trainees, slightly more than a year earlier (2016: 596). At 5.7 percent, the trainee ratio (trainees as a percentage of Group employees in Germany) w as higher than in the previous year because of the deconsolidation of Siltronic AG (2016: 4.7 percent). In 2017, WACKER offered jobs to virtually all suitable trainees – 144 graduates – hiring 110 of them on permanent contracts and 34 on temporary contracts. The Burghausen Vocational Training Center also provides training for 20 partner companies outside the WACKER Group. Overall, WACKER invested €7.9 million in personnel-development measures and advanced training in 2017 (2016: €7.2 million). Diversity and Equal Opportunity Equal opportunity: w e view human diversity as an asset. We oppose discriminatory or derogatory treatment on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, ideology, disability, sexual orientation or age. These principles are valid across the WACKER Group and, as part of our corporate culture, are embodied in our Code of Teamw ork & Leadership. Employees can report any discrimination to their supervisors, as w ell as to their compliance officer, employee council or designated HR contact person. Reports can be anonymous. The complaint w ill be investigated and the reporting employee informed of the results. Cases of potential discrimination are included in the monthly compliance reports submitted to the Executive Board 7 and form part of the regular reports submitted to the Supervisory Board. We require all employees at our German sites to complete an e-learning course to familiarize themselves w ith the country’s General Equal Treatment Act (AGG). Prom oting divers ity: in 2015, WACKER started a groupw ide initiative to promote diversity and inclusion in the w orkforce. The company also joined Germany’s Diversity Charter initiative. Every year since then, WACKER has focused on specific topics aimed at making employees aw are of the opportunities and challenges associated w ith a diverse w orkforce. The focus in 2017 w as on WACKER’s generational mix and on changes. The fact is that, in years to come, different generations w ill be w orking together some ten years longer than today, making the w orkforce more heterogeneous in this respect. In addition to this issue, diversity management at WACKER is placing greater emphasis on gender and cultural background. People from 65 different nations w ork for WACKER. At the end of 2017, 38 out of a total of 166 executive personnel groupw ide w ere of non-German nationality – w hich corresponds to 22.9 percent of the total. Overall, 15 nationalities (2016: 15) w ere represented at the executive level. In 2017, WACKER signed the Equal Opportunity Charter initiated by the German mining, chemical and energy labor union (IG BCE). The signatories to this initiative are underscoring their commitment to advancing equal opportunity w ithin their areas of responsibility. The areas in w hich WACKER has already show n its commitment by means of specific measures include life-phase-oriented w orking-time models, the promotion of w omen in managerial positions, and netw orks for w omen. Proportion of Wom en in Executive Positions We have set the goal of significantly increasing the proportion of w omen in middle and senior management positions in the medium to long term. WACKER’s talent-management project helps to systematically recognize and promote female management potential. The corporate governance report contains additional information about the proportion of w omen in management positions and, in particular, about how WACKER is implementing the German statute on equal opportunity for w omen and men in management that came into force on May 1, 2015. New Variable Com pensation System In the reporting year, WACKER completed negotiations w ith employee representatives on a new variable compensation system for its employees on standard and above-standard pay scales in Germany. Beginning in 2018, the new system w ill supersede the existing variable compensation components and replace them w ith a transparent, standardized, market -oriented methodology that is comparable to the method for calculating variable compensation for executive personnel (OFKs). 8 Introduction of Fam ily Leave Since 2017, WACKER has offered an additional option to help employees caring for children until their ninth birthday. This new form of support is called WACKER Family Leave. Depending on the w orking-time model, employees receive up to one w eek of paid family leave per calendar year. WACKER Family Leave corresponds to one of the options of the Demography Fund provided for under collective-bargaining agreements, w hich is to promote life-phase-oriented w orking-time models. Em ployee Turnover Good social benefits, competitive compensation and motivating tasks make WACKER an attractive employer, something our high level of employee loyalty confirms. The average length of service in Germany (permanent staff) w as 18.3 years (2016: 18.3 years). The average length of service of WACKER’s executive personnel is 20.5 years. Em ployee Representation Industrial union membership has alw ays been high among WACKER employees, especially at the German sites. All WACKER Group sites in Germany have employee representation. WACKER employees at sites outside Germany can also form unions. At non-German sites w ithout (statutory or voluntary) employee representation, HR staff members are the contacts for employee interests.. Labor Standards & Safety Operating plants and processes in a manner that poses no risk to people or the environment is an important objective at WACKER. To this end, w e have installed a groupw ide safety management system that addresses both w orkplace and plant safety. Plant Safety The first step in ensuring plant safety is to systematically identify risks and assess them. This includes analyzing how w ell w e control the energy present in a process (e. g. pressure, heat) and determining the effect that a single error might have o n a chain of events that could lead to the escape of a substance or to an accident. After completing this comprehensive analysis, w e specify safety measures to prevent undesirable incidents. Our safety management system focuses on prevention. Even so, safety -critical incidents cannot alw ays be prevented. This w as seen, for example, at our Charleston site (USA) in September 2017. A hydrogen explosion occurred there, resulting in an ongoing production shutdow n. In the w ake of this incident, tw o plant employees w ere taken to the hospital for examination but w ere discharged on the same day. Safety Training and Inspections WACKER attaches particular importance to providing its safety experts w ith ongoing training. We hold regular training sessions, for example, on plant safety and explosion-damage protection. During 2017, w e inspected the Nanjing, Shanghai and Zhangjiagang sites in China, as w ell as the Kolkata site in India. At WACKER, w e give special recognition to facilities that operate for sustained periods of time w ithout a reportable accident. 9 Product Safety WACKER provides information on the safe use of its products and is continually w orking to prevent or reduce the use in products of substances that are harmful to human health or the environment. WACKER markets its products only in countries w here it has a valid chemicals registration. As a guide for our product developers, w e maintain a list of about 550 substances that WACKER products may no longer contain. In addition to prohibited and restricted chemicals (such as materials listed in Annexes XIV and XVII to the REACH Regulation), the list also includes substances that are undesired by individual companies. We avoid substances that are on the European Chemicals Agency’s List of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC). The REACH Regulation, w hich came into force in 2007, governs the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals w ithin the European Union. REACH involves the collection of extensive data. REACH imposes high requirements on the manufacturers, importers and users of chemical products. All substances on the European market that are used or imported in annual quantities exceeding one metric ton must be registered and evaluated. The scope of evaluation w ork is largely determined by the quantity produced or imported and the expected risks. Particularly high-risk substances are subject to regulatory approval. As part of REACH, WACKER had submitted 220 registration dossiers to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) through the end of 2017. For some of the phas e-one and phase-tw o dossiers, submitted in 2010 and 2013, ECHA required additional information as part of its evaluation activity, all of w hich w e provided on time in 2017. WACKER’s close contact w ith its suppliers extends to matters relating to substances not yet registered under REACH. We make systematic requests for definitive statements from our suppliers concerning registration status and the further availability of raw materials, especially in view of the expiration of the final registration phase for phase-in substances (>1 metric ton/year) on May 31, 2018. The ICCA (International Council of Chemical Associations) has developed the Global Product Strategy (GPS), w hich is a guideline on how to assess chemical properties and provide product safety infor mation. In Europe, most GPS requirements are satisfied by REACH and by the CLP Regulation (Classification, Labeling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures). By the end of 2017, w e had published 75 Safety Summaries on the ICCA chemicals w ebsite for the substances w e have registered under REACH.. Safe Transport of Hazardous Materials WACKER ensures that its products are stored and transported safely, especially w here hazardous goods are involved. In 2017, w e had inspections carried out on over 11,000 trucks for outgoing shipments of hazardous goods at our sites and w arehouses in Germany (2016: over 9,500). We reject any that are defective. Failure rates have been low for years now . The rate for 2017 w as about 1.4 percent for hazardous goods shipments from Burghausen, our largest site in Germany (2016: 1.3 percent). WACKER regularly audits its hazardous goods shippers. We rely on w ell-trained personnel for transport safety, too. In the reporting year, our w orkforce in Germany alone completed over 1,400 classroom training courses on the safe transportation of hazardous goods and some 800 online courses about securing freight. We regularly review aspects of transport safety w ith our logistics providers, e. g. during the annual Supplier Day. If deficiencies are found, w e agree on improvements and then follow up on their implementation. WACKER uses in-house criteria and internationally recognized systems w hen selecting logistics providers and evaluating their performance. Through the use of standards and specifications, WACKER ensures that even its suppliers’ subcontractors meet our stringent safety requirements. For products w ith a high hazard potential, w e use packaging and tanks of the highest quality. 10 We recorded a total of eight transport incidents in the reporting year. This number includes not only accidents and incidents involving the distribution of our intermediates and products w here w e commissioned the transport, but also incidents that do not involve hazardous goods, as w ell as those that do not adversely impact people or the environment. These incidents, too, form part of our shipper assessments.. Im Berichtsjahr verzeichneten w ir insgesamt acht Transportvorkommnisse. Dazu zählen w ir Unfälle und Ereignisse, die sich bei der Distribution unserer Zw ischenprodukte und Produkte ereignen, sofern der Transport von uns beauftragt w ird. Mitgerechnet sind auch Zw ischenfälle ohne Gefahrgut und solche, die keine negativen Ausw irkungen auf Mensch und Umw elt haben. Diese Ereignisse fließen ebenfalls in die Spediteursbew ertung ein. Workplace Safety Workplace and plant safety are of vital importance for WACKER. That is w hy w e define safety goals in the annual performance review s together w ith our executive personnel and management employees in Germany. Our processes and standards relating to w orkplace safety are aligned w ith the international OHSAS 18001 standard. Systematic w orkplace safety includes regular evaluation of hazards and w ork-area monitoring. All our employees are given safety training specific to their individual w ork areas. WACKER Germany, for example, offers 42 online training courses on w orkplace safety. Topics range from general safety guidelines for office and laboratory w orkers to instruction on safe behavior in potentially explosive atmospheres and the classification of hazardous materials. We defined minimum health and safety standards for technical centers in 2017. The centers w ere tasked w ith making initial self-assessments and w ith eliminating any w eaknesses they identified. The new standards w ill also form the basis for future audits of the technical centers. Workplace accident performance is one of the most important non-financial performance indicators. One of our w orkplace safety goals is to ensure that the number of w orkplace accidents per 1 million hours w orked does not exceed 1.7 groupw ide in 2020. In terms of reportable accidents (accidents w ith more than three w orkdays missed), WACKER’s numbers are far better than the German chemical industry average. The reportable accident rate at WACKER in 2017 w as 1.4 per 1 million hours w orked; by contrast, Germany’s statutory employer liability insurance carrier of the basic materials and chemical industries (BG RCI) registered 9.4 reportable accidents per 1 million hours w orked in chemical companies in 2016. As in the previous year, WACKER did not record any fatal w orkplace accidents involving its employees during the reporting period. Very few of the accidents at WACKER involve chemicals. The most common causes are tripping, slipping and falling, and performing manual activities w ithout due care. Not satisfied w ith our accident rate, w e are stepping up our occupationalsafety efforts. In 2017, w e introduced a safety program to reduce personal-mobility accidents at our production sites in Germany. We are continuing to implement our WACKER Safety Plus (WSP) program, w hich builds on elements of successful safety strategies at sites w ith particularly low accident rates – such as safety patrols, discussions w ith the w orkforce and emergency drills. The goal of WACKER Safety Plus is to recognize and avoid unsafe behavior. 11 Environment & Climate By setting quantifiable environmental targets, w e intend to low er the environmental impact of our production activities. Environm ental Protection WACKER attaches particular importance to integrated environmental protection, w hich commences w ith product development and plant planning. WACKER constantly w orks to improve its production processes, w ith the aim of conserving resources. One of our main tasks is to close material loops and recycle byproducts from other areas back into production. It enables us to reduce or prevent energy and resource consumption, as w ell as emissions and w aste, and to integrate environmental protection into our production processes. The integrated production system is described in the “Group Business Fundamentals” section of the combined management report). Our Groupw ide environmental-protection standards apply to all our production sites and technical centers. The site managers ensure that our environmental-protection measures conform to legal requirements and that w e adhere to environmental 12 standards. The Group Coordinator for the Environment checks the implementation of environmental standards in practice at the sites and performs random checks to verify legal compliance. In 2017, WACKER invested €4.2 million in environmental protection (2016: €2.4 million). Environmental operating costs amounted to €78.3 million (2016: €78.4 million). Examples of investment in environmental protection at the Burghausen site are analysis technology in the w astew ater treatment plant and a process control system for the w aste disposal center. Assessment Using the Global Water Tool™ In 2013, w e used the Global Water Tool™ (GWT) developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to analyze the relative w ater stress index of the countries in w hich our main global production sites are located. This index provides information on the relationship betw een w ater consumption and the availability of renew able fresh w ater. The outcome of the analysis is that our most important production sites are located in regions w ith a low relative w ater stre ss index. These regions account for more than 97 percent of our annual w ater use and over 90 percent of our production volume. As part of the Bavarian Environmental Pact, w e joined w ith seven other companies from ChemDelta Bavaria to establish Naturnahe Alz (Natural Alz), an association through w hich w e support the state of Bavaria in renaturalizing the Alz river and enhancing its ecosystem long-term. Energy The chemical industry is one of the most energy-intensive sectors. WACKER’s sites in Germany consume 3,946 GWh of electricity, representing approximately 0.8 percent of the country’s electricity consumption. WACKER is continually improving the energy efficiency of its processes. This enables us to remain globally competitive w hile at the same time contributing to climate protection. 13 Many chemical reactions generate heat that can be put to use in other production processes. In addition to recovering heat from such chemical reactions, w e have been using integrated heat-recovery systems in Burghausen and Nünchritz for years and are continually improving them. In this w ay, w e can reduce the amount of primary energy (natural gas) consumed by our pow er plants. To enhance energy efficiency and reduce specific energy consumption (amount of energy per unit of net production output), the Executive Board has defined energy targets for WACKER Germany. We have set a goal of reducing specific energy consumption by 2022 to one-half of the 2007 level. Net production is calculated by subtracting the internal reuse of products from a plant or site’s gross production. Gross production corresponds to the total production (target products and byproducts) of a plant or site. Our primary source of energy is climate-friendly natural gas. At Burghausen, our largest site, w e produce steam and electricity using a cogeneration system. The highly efficient combined heat and pow er (CHP) plant operates at more than 85-percent fuel efficiency, w hich is significantly higher than that of conventional pow er plants. We also use hydropow er to generat e electricity in Burghausen, and our Norw egian site, Holla, generates its electricity mainly from hydropow er. WACKER’s German production sites accounted for 72 percent (2016: 71 percent) of its total electricity consumption. We have taken energy-efficiency measures to reduce specific energy consumption even further in 2017. The Group’s pow er plants – the hydroelectric and CHP plants in Burghausen and the cogeneration plant in Nünchritz – produced 1,481 GWh of electricity in 2017 (2016: 1,416 GWh). This means that WACKER covered about 38 percent of its total energy requirements in Germany from its ow n production. Groupw ide, carbon dioxide emissions from captive pow er plants subject to emissions trading rules and from silicon-metal production in Holla totaled about 1.0 million metric tons in the reporting period (2016: 1.0 million metric tons). WACKER is subject to the regulations of the EU emissions trading system because of its pow er plants at the Burghausen and Nünchritz sites. We have covered shortfalls since 2014 by buying emission allow ances for facilities subject to emissions trading. Em issions In 2017, direct emissions of carbon dioxide (Scope 1 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol) declined by 3 percent year over year, chiefly due to improvements in the utilization of steam at the Charleston, Tennessee site. The production shutdow n that occurred at this site in September 2017 w as another factor in the decline in CO2 emissions. The low er levels of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions w ere attributable mainly to the drop in production at the Holla site. Compared w ith the previous year, w e succeeded in reducing specific NOx emissions at our Holla site by almost 3 percent per metric ton of product. One of our environmental targets is to halve specific dust emissions per metric ton of gross production groupw ide betw een 2012 and 2022. This target primarily affects the production of silicon metal at the Holla site. The improvements made in recent years, especially to the baghouses, helped us achieve our target figure of 50 percent for the first time in the reportin g period. 14 Water use declined by around 5 percent groupw ide in 2017, mainly due to low er w ater use at the Burghausen site. Oning to the strong production-related increase in plant utilization at Burghausen, chemical oxygen demand (COD) rose by around 8 percent. The groupw ide increase of about 6 percent in w aste volume is predominantly the result of increased production in Burghausen and of construction activity at the Burghausen and Holla sites. Our indirect CO2 emissions from procured energy (Scope 2) rose to 1,606 kilotons (kt) in the reporting period (2016: 1,588 kt). This w as due to increased production volumes at the Burghausen, Charleston and Nünchritz sites. The strong reduction in the electricity to CO2 emissions conversion factors for pow er generation in Germany and the United States (data as per CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, 2017 Edition, International Energy Agency) more than compensated for the increase in emissions. We used energy-efficiency measures to also reduce w eighted specific energy consumption and related specific CO2 emissions – w hile maintaining a comparable product portfolio. Measuring the Group’s carbon footprint is an important tool for improving climate protection. That is w hy – in addition to our indirect greenhouse gas emissions from procured energy (Scope 2), w hich w e began tracking in 2011 – w e have been measuring, since 2012, all the emissions generated along our supply chain, e.g. by suppliers or through w aste disposal and the transport of products. In 2017, w e once again forw arded this emissions data to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), w hich WACKER joined in 2007. Wacker Chemie AG’s performance profile w as rated B (on a scale from A to D) in CDP’s annual sustainability ratings. 15 Anti-Corruption and Bribery Corruption and briber have no place in our business model. Our Code of Conduct contains corresponding principles in this area, and all WACKER employees are required to follow this code. Training courses on compliance raise employees’ aw areness of the relevant risks and convey binding rules of behavior for daily w ork routines. According to Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), WACKER is predominantly active in countries that have a low or very low risk of corruption.. Sustainable Supply-Chain Management With production sites in Europe, the Americas and Asia, our company procures goods and services from numerous countries. As a member of both the United Nations Global Compact and the chemical industry’s Responsible Care® initiative, it is important to us to verify that our suppliers comply w ith generally accepted sustainability principles as w ell. Potentially cr itical topics include w orking conditions, ethical standards, safety standards (especially w hen hazardous materials are being ha ndled) and the use of local resources (e. g. w ater use or energy consumption). That is w hy WACKER joined the TfS initiative in January 2015. This chemical-industry procurement initiative has developed a process to review the sustainability management of suppliers. Because results are standardized and accessible to all TfS members, the program is also attractive for suppliers. The results of the TfS audit and assessment are an integral part of our supplier evaluations. Especially w hen results are not satisfactory, w e discuss them w ith the supplier concerned, w ith the objective of defining measures for improvement. Reassessments or repeated audits are used to follow up on progress. Consistently poor results combined w ith an unw illingness to cooperate can have consequences, and may ultimately lead to termination of the business relationship. In raw material and energy procurement, w e aim to have the sustainability performance of all our key suppliers evaluated via TfS. Since joining TfS, w e have made good progress along this path. Suppliers evaluated via TfS already cover 80 percent of our raw -materials and energy procurement volume. The achievement of TfS goals is tracked in a monthly management report. We additionally expect our suppliers to use a management sy stem that meets the requirements of ISO 9001 (quality) or comparable specifications such as GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice), and also require our industrial suppliers to be certified to ISO 14001 (environmental protection). Social Responsibility WACKER sees itself as a corporate citizen – an integral part of the society in w hich w e live and w ork, w hich is w hy w e take our social responsibilities seriously, especially in communities around our sites. 16 Neihbors Corporate citizenship begins w ith a good relationship w ith municipalities and w ith our immediate neighbors. We speak openly about w hat goes on behind our plant gates. Our sites throughout the w orld w elcome questions from the public, w ith nearby residents receiving fast, comprehensible responses to their concerns. We maintain local hotlines and have central contact partners available to deal w ith questions. We inform the public about our sites by means of environmental reports and other publications, and w e issue invitations to open houses and to other events. These include the WACKER WISSENSFORUM (know ledge forum) and the Environment Information Days at our Burghausen site, as w ell as the annual community meetings at Nünchritz. At many sites, w e offer free services to surrounding communities including, f or example, health and eye checkups in India and a Household Hazardous Waste Day organized for neighbors of our Adrian site in the United States, w here nearby residents can bring in chemical household products not allow ed in trash cans.. Schools and Universities WACKER w ants to get children and young people excited about technology and the natural sciences. After all, as a chemical company, w e are going to need outstanding scientists in the future – a goal w e are pursuing in a variety of w ays. WACKER supports progressive teaching methods and modern school management systems. We are one of the founding members of the Bavarian Educational Pact, a foundation comprising 143 companies and the state of Bavaria. The pact has set itself the task of modernizing the Bavarian educational system. WACKER attaches considerable importance to fostering young scientific talent and maintaining close contacts w ith universities. Our researchers are frequently invited to give presentations and guest lectures at universities, and university groups visit our sites for an inside look at the w orkings of an industrial corporation. WACKER offers students plant jobs and internships, as w ell as opportunities to w rite doctoral theses and papers for bachelor’s and master’s programs. Donations and Sponsorship Our sponsorship activities focus on education, science and the SV Wacker Burghausen professional soccer team. Around half of our donations in the reporting period w ent to the SV Wacker Burghausen sports club (German-language version only) to promote popular sports, to “Die Arche” (The Ark; German-language version only), a German charity for the young, and to WACKER’s relief fund. 17 4 Special Awards and Events Inclusion in Bavaria The Bavarian State Government presented Wacker Chemie AG w ith the “Inclusion in Bavaria – We Work Together” emblem Special arrangements are in place to help and promote WACKER employees w ho suffer from disabilities or similar impairments, or from poor health. Thus, supervisors, staff, HR departments, employee representatives, representatives for employees w ith severe disabilities, and health services w ork hand in hand in the company’s integration management to provide targeted support for the employees concerned. The overarching goal is to provide people w ith job security. First, w e examine together w hether w e can provide support for the employees by, for example, ergonomic redesign or changing w ork routines at their w orkplace. If not, then w e try to offer them a different position. WACKER is committed to helping people w ith handicaps beyond the company boundaries, by w orking together w ith w orkshops for people w ith disabilities. Our Burghausen site, for instance, sources key products from the nearby charitable Ruperti w orkshops – from dunnage for securing freight to assembly parts for process engineering. Aw ard for Idea Managem ent On February 28, 2018, aw ards for top performance in seven categories w ere again presented at the ZI (Zentrum Ideenmanagement) annual congress in Fulda. A three-man team from WACKER w on the first prize in the Production and Technology category, demonstrating that the Group's corporate proposal system is not tormented by any signs of fatigue even in the 90th anniversary year. The ZI Ideas Aw ards recognize employees w ho have earned their ideas for the competitiveness and sustainability of their company. The Center Idea Management (ZI) is an interest group for the promotion and dissemination of ideas and innovation management in Germany. WACKER is one of 150 member companies. WACKER Again Gets Gold in EcoVadis Rating As a member of Together for Sustainability, WACKER not only evaluates its suppliers in terms of sustainably, but subjects its ow n performance as a supplier to external rating by EcoVadis. In 2018, the Group once again scored Gold in EcoVadis ratings. WACKER’s result has risen from 65 to 76 points. It now ranks among the top 3% of the highest-scoring companies. 18 Haiti: School is thriving Natural disasters are not uncommon in Haiti: In 2010 a catastrophic earthquake destroyed the Don Bosco School Riobé in Gressier. And hurricane Matthew left a trail of devastation in the south w est of the island in 2016. Recovery is slow . WACKER collaborates w ith the Don Bosco aid organization in Haiti, w hich implemented a four -phase plan to help the population in the aftermath of the hurricane. As a first emergency measure, food and clean drinking w ater w ere provided. In the reconstruction phase, Don Bosco supplied affected families w ith building materials to repair their homes. The third phase focused on agriculture, helping the Southw est restore their position as the bread basket of Haiti. Farmers received seedlings and agricultural equipment. The last phase w as aimed at the training needed for rebuilding the country. At the Don Bosco Vocational Training Center in Les Cayes, 300 young people w ere given grants for courses in farming, metalw ork, construction and carpentry. The school in Gressier assisted by the WACKER Relief Fund w as not directly affected by the hurricane. It has been grow ing steadily in recent years. There are 833 students, of w hich139 attend kindergarten, 309 are in elementary school and 385 in high school. Apart from regular lessons, the center offers sport and recreational activities, personal development programs, a vacation program and school meals made w ith home-grow n vegetables. To finance running costs, Don Bosco charges a small amount in school fees. This fosters appreciation for schooling and education among parents. 19 5 Principles of UN Compact and its relation to WACKER UNGC Principle Implementation at WACKER Page Principle 1: Businesses should support  Corporate philosophy and target setting 2, 4 and respect the protection of interna Principles of Corporate Ethics 5 tionally proclaimed human rights;  Participation in initiatives 5 and …  Orientation on standards 5 Principle 2: … make sure that they are  Corporate Citizenship 17, 18 not complicit in human rights abuses  Supply Chain Management 16 Principle 3:  Labor union 9 Businesses should uphold the freedom  global employee representation 9 of association and the effective recogni HR staff members for employees‘ interests 9 tion of the right to collective bargaining; … Principle 4:  We condemn slavery and all other forms of forced 7 … the elimination of all forms or compulsory labor as w ell as child labor. of forced and compulsory labour; …  social benefits, w orking time models 7, 9 and  Work safety 10, 11 Principle 5:  Supply Chain management 7, 16 …the effective abolition of child labour; and … Principle 6:  Equal treatment, trainings 7, 8 …the elimination of discrimination in re Compliance report 7 spect of employment and occupation.  Equal opportunity charter 8, 18  Proportion of Women in Executive Positions, 8 WACKER Women’s Circle  Idea management 18 Principle 7:  SustainaBalance® 4 Businesses should support a precau Environmental targets and transparent key figures 12, 15 tionary approach to environmental  Integrated environmental protection 12 challenges; …  Activities for more energy efficiency 14  Product, plant and transport safety 9, 10  Use of tools 13 6  Materiality Principle 8:  SustainaBalance® 4 … undertake initiatives to promote  Alignment to SDGs 4 greater environmental responsibility;  Product safety, trainings 10 and … Principle 9:  SustainaBalance® 4 … encourage the development of envi Innovation strategy 2 ronmentally friendly technologies.
