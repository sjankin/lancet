In to reported EBITDA 2015, the review of the investments and business portfolio primarily included the gains on disposal of Dailymotion in the amount of In 2017, the significant litigation-related expenses correspond to the 170 million euros (see Note 3.2) and the impact of the restructuring reassessment of the risk related to various disputes. The significant of the asset portfolio. litigation-related expenses in 2015 notably included a fine of 350 million euros relating to a dispute concerning competition in the The restructuring and integration costs are presented in Note 5.3. Enterprise market. The other specific items in 2016 included the costs of the The specific labor expenses predominantly reflect the impact of non-completed Bouygues transaction. changes in assumptions and experience adjustments of the various “part-time for seniors plans” (TPS) in France. In 2015, these mainly related to the one-year extension of the 2012 TPS plan (see Note 6.2). Change in the presentation of segment information in 2017 Change in operating segments in Africa and the Middle East With effect from 2017, decisions regarding the allocation of resources and the assessment of the performance of the various components of Orange will be made by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (main operational decision-maker) at the following levels in Africa and the Middle East: sub-group Sonatel (combining the Sonatel entities in Senegal, Orange Mali, Orange Bissau, Orange in Guinea and Orange in Sierra Leone), sub-group Côte d’Ivoire (combining the entities Orange Côte d’Ivoire, Orange in Burkina Faso and Orange in Liberia) and each of the other countries in Africa and the Middle East, which shall henceforth constitute operating segments. The segment information presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Group remained unchanged. This change has no impact with regard to goodwill testing. Management of the Enterprise market in France The presentation of segment information has been changed to better reflect the management of the Enterprise market in France. The operating income and expenses of mobile services and mobile equipment sales to businesses employing more than 50 people, until now included in the France operating segment, have been integrated within the activities of the Enterprise segment. This change had no impact on the Group’s income statement. Only the presentation of the revenues and operating expenses of the France and Enterprise segments has been amended, with an adjustment to the intragroup eliminations. At December 31, 2016, the impact of this transfer on revenues was (1,024) million euros for the France segment and 955 million euros for the Enterprise segment. At December 31, 2015, the impact of this transfer on revenues was (1,037) million euros for the France segment and 974 million euros for the Enterprise segment. This impact resulted in an increase in operating income of the Enterprise segment of 328 million euros in 2016 and 337 million euros in 2015. This change also affected the composition of the France and Enterprise Cash Generating Units (CGUs). For instance, the goodwill originally assigned to the France CGU was partially reassigned to the Enterprise CGU and estimated at 1 billion euros based on the future expected cash flows of the transferred activity. The presentation of previously presented 2016 and 2015 segment data has been amended to reflect these changes. Accounting policies Segment information Decisions on the allocation of resources and the performance assessment of Orange component parts (hereinafter referred to as “the Group”) are made by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (main operational decision-maker) at operating segment level, mainly consisting of the geographical locations. Thus, the operating segments are: – France (excluding Enterprise); – Spain, Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and each Central European country (with a subtotal combining the countries in that zone); – the sub-group Sonatel (combining the Sonatel entities in Senegal, Orange Mali, Orange Bissau, Orange in Guinea and Orange in Sierra Leone), the sub-group Côte d’Ivoire (combining the entities Orange Côte d’Ivoire, Orange in Burkina Faso and Orange in Liberia) and each of the other countries in Africa and the Middle East (with a sub-total combining the countries in that zone); – Enterprise; – activities of International Carriers and Shared Services (IC&SS), which comprise certain resources, mainly in the areas of networks and information systems, research and development and other shared competencies, as well as the Orange brand; – Orange Bank. The use of shared resources, mainly provided by IC&SS, is taken into account in segment results based either on the terms of contractual agreements between legal entities, or external benchmarks, or by allocating costs among all the segments. The supply of shared resources is included in other revenues of the service provider, and the use of the resources is included in expenses taken into account for the calculation of the service user’s EBITDA. The cost of shared resources may be affected by changes in contractual relationships or organization and may therefore impact the segment results disclosed from one year to another. Adjusted EBITDA and reported EBITDA are operating performance indicators used by the Group: – to manage and assess its operating and segment results; and – to implement its investment and resource allocation strategy. 152 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 The Group’s management believes that the presentation of these indicators is pertinent as it provides readers with the same management indicators as those used internally. Reported EBITDA corresponds to operating income before depreciation and amortization, effects associated with takeovers the reversal of translation reserves of liquidated entities, impairment of goodwill and fixed assets and share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to reported EBITDA, adjusted for significant litigation, specific labor expenses, review of the investments and business portfolio, restructuring and integration costs and, where appropriate, other specific elements. This measurement indicator allows for the effects of certain specific factors to be isolated from reported EBITDA, irrespective of their recurrence and the type of income or expense, when they are linked to: – significant litigation: Associated procedures are based on third-party decisions (regulatory authority, court, etc.) and occurring over a different period to the activities at the source of the litigation. By their very nature, costs are difficult to predict in terms of their source, amount and period; – specific labor expenses: Independently of the departure plans included under restructuring costs, certain changes in the working hours of employees may have a negative impact on the period during which they are agreed and implemented. This primarily relates to the various “part-time for seniors plans” (TPS) in France; – review of the investments and business portfolio: 3 The Group regularly reviews its investments and business portfolio: as part of this review, decisions to dispose of assets are implemented, which by their very nature have an impact on the period during which the disposal takes place. The corresponding gains (losses) on disposal affect either reported EBITDA or the net income from discontinued operations; – restructuring and integration costs: The adjustment of Group activities in line with changes in the business environment may also incur other types of transformation costs. These actions may have a negative effect on the period during which they are announced or implemented; for instance but not limited to, some of the transformation plans approved by the internal governance bodies; 4 – where applicable, other specific elements that are systematically specified in relation to income and/or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA and reported EBITDA are not financial aggregates as defined by IFRS and are not comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups. They are provided as additional information only and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income or cash flow provided by operating activities. CAPEX relate to the acquisition of tangible and intangible assets excluding telecommunication licenses and investments financed through finance leases and are used internally as an indicator to allocate resources. CAPEX are not a financial aggregate defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other companies. Inter-segment assets and liabilities are reported in each operating segment. Non-allocated assets and liabilities for the telecommunications business, mainly include external financial debt, external cash and cash equivalents, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as equity. Financial debt and investments between these segments are presented as non-allocated elements. For Orange Bank, the line “Other” includes the assets and liabilities listed above, as well as the loans and receivables and debts related to the Bank’s activity. The other accounting policies are presented within each note to which they refer.

Comparative figures are presented for 2016 and 2015 using the same basis of preparation. 2017 Registration Document / Orange 153 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements For the reported periods, the accounting standards and The principles applied to prepare financial data relating to the 2017 interpretations endorsed by the European Union are similar to the financial year are based on: compulsory standards and interpretations published by the – all the standards and interpretations endorsed by the European International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) with the exception Union compulsory as of December 31, 2017; of the carve-out of IAS 39 together with the standards and interpretations currently being endorsed, that have no effect on the – the recognition and measurement alternatives allowed by the Group accounts. Consequently, the Group financial statements are IFRSs: prepared in accordance with the IFRS standards and interpretations, as published by the IASB. Standard Alternative used IAS 1 Accretion expense on operating liabilities (employee benefits, environmental liabilities) Classification as financial expenses IAS 2 Inventories Measurement of inventories determined by the weighted average unit cost method IAS 7 Interest paid and received dividends Classification as net operating cash flows IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment Measurement at amortized historical cost IAS 38 Intangible Assets Measurement at amortized historical cost IFRS 3R Non-controlling interests At the acquisition date, measurement either at fair value or at the portion of the net identifiable asset of the acquired entity – accounting positions adopted by the Group in accordance with paragraphs 10 to 12 of IAS 8: Topic Note Presentation of consolidated financial statements Financial statements and segment information Operating taxes and levies 9.1 Income taxes 9.2 Non-controlling interests – Change in ownership interest in a subsidiary 3 and 13.6 – Commitments to purchase non-controlling interests In the absence of any accounting standard or interpretation, – fairly present the Group’s financial position, financial performance management uses its judgment to define and apply an accounting and cash flows; policy that will result in relevant and reliable information, such that the – reflect the economic substance of transactions; financial statements: – are neutral; – are prepared on a prudent basis; and – are complete in all material respects. 2.3 Standards and interpretations compulsory after December 31, 2017 with no early application elected by the Group Among these standards and interpretations, the following might affect the Group’s future consolidated financial statements are IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 which are subject to dedicated project within the Group: Standard/Interpretation (application date for the Group) Consequences for the Group IFRS 9 IFRS 9 modifies the recognition criteria for hedging transactions and main financial assets and Financial instruments liabilities categories: given the nature of the Group’s transactions, no major change is expected January 1, 2018 either for the telecom activities and Orange Bank activities. IFRS 9 also modifies the recognition of credit risk related to financial assets, moving from the incurred loss approach to an expected loss approach: this means that impairment will be recognized on trade receivables not yet due for the telecom activities and upon credit agreement for Orange Bank. The first application of this method will not affect materially the Group equity on January 1, 2018. 154 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 Standard/Interpretation (application date for the Group) Consequences for the Group IFRS 15 IFRS 15 implementation has been subject to a dedicated project within the Group. Work Revenue from Contracts with Customers completion confirms the expected effects of IFRS 15 first application. The effects on Group’s (January 1, 2018) accounts primarily relate to the mobile phone market in France and in Europe and notably to: – the accounting for arrangements which bundle the sale of a handset sold with a discounted price and with customer subscription to a communication service for a defined period of time: the cumulative revenue will not change but the allocation between the handset sold and the communication service will change (higher equipment revenues, with the exact same decrease in service revenues); – the accelerated recognition of revenues, when the equipment is sold, offset from the supply of the service during the enforceable period, will lead to the recognition of a contract asset in the statement of financial position which will be settled against an asset receivable as the communication service is provided; – the accounting treatment of non-monetary transactions between telecom operators; – some incremental subscriber acquisition and retention costs (i.e. payments to retailers directly attributable to the contract, excluding subsidies) will be recognized over the duration of the contractual relationship. The Group also paid particular attention to the concepts specified or introduced by IFRS 15 which will not change the principles currently applied: 3 – gross or net revenue recognition depending on whether the Group acts as principal or as agent; – the accounting treatment of material rights granted to customers under contracts in which the Group provides the customer additional optional goods or services; – the timing of revenue recognition related to services of which the Group operates in the build and run of IT platforms. The Group will retrospectively apply IFRS 15 on January 1, 2018, which means the restatement of 2016 and 2017 reported comparative periods. Based on evaluations carried out arrangement by arrangement, IFRS 15 first application will increase the net equity as of January 1, 2016 by approximately 0.8 billion euros which mainly results from the recognition of contract assets. IFRS 16 This standard introduces provisions that significantly affect the financial reporting of the leases Leases as well as the financial measures of the lessees. January 1, 2019 At the delivery date of the right of use granted by the lessor, the lessees will account for all of their leases, as an asset against a financial liability as for a financial lease under IAS 17. In addition to the effect on the statement of financial position, the income statement (depreciation and interest expense instead of operating expense) and the statement of cash flows (interest expense will continue to affect the operating cash flows, investment cash flows will not be impacted, financing cash flows will be impacted by the repayment of the debt) will also be affected. The financial reporting will be sensitive to: – the judgment required in applying the new qualification criteria for a lease; – the choice of whether to recognize certain capacity arrangements as intangible assets; – the legislation and practices applicable to each jurisdiction or line of business with regard to the non-cancellable lease term granted by lessors and the combination of fixed and variable contractual payments; – the policy used by each lessee when assessing the reasonably certain lease term; – the simplified alternatives elected for a retrospective application. The application of this standard will also affect the scope and the amount of the unrecognised commitments disclosed Note 14 under IAS 17. Furthermore, the differences between IFRS (IFRS 16) and US GAAP (ASU 2016-02) would result in different financial measures. The Group will apply IFRS 16 with a retrospective application on January 1, 2019, but with no restatement of comparative periods. 2017 Registration Document / Orange 155 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements 2.4 Use of estimates and judgment In addition to the alternatives or accounting positions abovementioned, Management exercises judgment in order to define the accounting policies for certain transactions: Topic Nature of accounting judgment Note 3 Control Requiring judgment in certain circumstances with respect to the control and continuous control assessment which can affect the perimeter of consolidation, as for instance when a shareholders’ agreement is revised or terminated, or when protective rights turn into substantive rights Note 4 Revenue Identifying separable components of a bundled offer Requiring judgment with respect to complex arrangements: single or separate transactions, assessment of the parameters when arrangements affect several reporting periods Notes 5, 9 Purchases and other expenses Litigations and tax: measurement of technical merits of the interpretations and legislative and 16 positions and qualification of the facts and circumstances Onerous supplier contracts: trigger event, nature of unavoidable costs Notes 5 Purchases and other expenses, Reverse factoring; distinguishing operating debt and financial debt and 11 financial assets and liabilities, net finance costs Note 8 Property, plant and equipment, Qualifying network, sites or equipment sharing among operators as joint operations intangible assets other than TowerCos arrangements: electing the unit of account (tower or used space) and analyzing goodwill the arrangements in order to determine whether they contain a lease Notes 11 Financial assets and liabilities, Distinguishing equity and debt: assessing specific contractual clauses and 13 net finance costs Equity Notes 12 Fair value of financial assets Models, selection of parameters, fair value hierarchy, non-performance risk assessment, and 15 and liabilities unit of account relating to investments accounted for under the equity method In preparing the Group’s consolidated financial statements, Orange’s evolve or in light of new information or more experience. management makes estimates, insofar as many elements included Consequently, the estimates made at December 31, 2017 may be in the financial statements cannot be measured precisely.

The goodwill mainly included the amount of future In 2017, Orange sold the remainder of its stake to Vivendi for synergies linked to the merger of Orange Espagne and Jazztel. These 26 million euros, without any effect on the income of the period. are mainly attributable to the optimization of network costs, the distribution of Jazztel offers through Orange stores, the cross-selling Acquisition of Jazztel of services and the reduction in the use of Telefónica’s fiber network.

When assessing control, IFRS 10 requires judgment and continuous assessment. Clarifications of when the ownership interest does not imply a de facto presumption are provided in Note 18 (which lists the main consolidated entities). Joint ventures and companies over which the Group exercises significant influence (generally corresponding to an ownership interest of 20% to 50%) are accounted for using the equity method. When assessing the level of control or significant influence exercised over a subsidiary or associate, the existence and effect of any exercisable or convertible potential voting rights at the closing date is taken into account. Material intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated. Takeovers (business combinations) Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method: – the acquisition cost is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including all contingent consideration, at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are accounted for either through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income, in accordance with the applicable standards; – goodwill is the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and is recognized as an asset in the statement of financial position. Considering the Group’s activity, the fair values of the identifiable assets relate mainly to licenses, to customer bases and to brands (which cannot be recognized as assets when internally developed), generating induced deferred taxes. The fair value of these assets, which cannot be observed, is established using commonly adopted methods, such as those based on revenues or costs (e.g.: the “Greenfield” method for the valuation of licenses, the “relief from royalty” method for the valuation of brands and the “excess earnings” method for customer bases). For each business combination with an ownership interest below 100%, non-controlling interest is measured: – either at its fair value: in which case, goodwill is recognized for the portion relating to non-controlling interests; – or proportionate to its share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets: in which case, goodwill is only recognized for the share acquired. Acquisition-related costs are directly recognized in operating income in the period in which they are incurred. When a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is re-measured at fair value at the acquisition date through operating income. The related other comprehensive income, if any, is fully reclassified to profit or loss. Internal transfer of consolidated shares IFRS do not address the accounting treatment for the transfer of consolidated shares within the Group resulting in changes in ownership interest. The Group applies the following accounting policy: – the transferred shares are carried at historical cost and the gain or loss on the transfer is fully eliminated in the acquirer’s accounts; – the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their share in the equity against Group retained earnings, with no impact on profit and loss and equity. Assets held for sale The Group qualifies an asset or group of assets as “held for sale” when: – the management is committed to a plan to sell; – the asset is available for immediate sale in its current state (subject to any conditions precedent that are usual in such disposals); and – the sale is highly probable, within 12 months. Thus, when the Group is committed to a plan to sell involving the loss of control or significant influence over one of its assets, it classifies all assets and liabilities of the entities concerned under a separate line in the statement of financial position: “Assets/Liabilities held for sale”, at a value equal to the lower of the net carrying value and the fair value net of disposal costs. In addition, when the asset or group of assets held for sale represents a major line of business, its contribution to the income statement is presented separately (below “consolidated net income of continuing operations”); its cash flow contribution is presented in the statement of cash flows. 160 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 Note 4 Sales 4.1 Revenues – data services: data services include data on a historical basis still offered by Orange Business Services (Frame Relay, Transrel, leased Revenue is presented in the segment information (see Note 1.1).

For the most part, shared services are rebilled to other operating segments – voice services: voice services include historical voice services through brand royalties, Group services fees and special (PSTN access), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) products, audio case-by-case rebilling. conference services, as well as incoming traffic for call centers; Accounting policies Revenues from the Group’s activities are recognized and presented as follows. Separable components of bundled offers and related offers: many service offers available on the Group’s main markets are comprised of two components: an equipment component (e.g. a mobile handset) and a service component (e.g. a talk plan). Hence, for bundled offers including a handset sold at a discounted price and a telecommunication service, revenues recognized for the handset sale are limited to the amount of the arrangement that is not contingent upon the rendering of telecommunication services, i.e. the amount paid by the customer for the terminal: this amount is usually the amount paid at the delivery, or the discounted amounts paid over a 12 or 24-month period with respect to the offers paid by installments. For offers that cannot be separated into identifiable components, revenues are recognized in full over the life of the contract. The main case for which this method is used is connection to the service: this is not a separately identifiable transaction from subscription and communications, and first connection fees are therefore recognized over the average expected life of the contractual relationship. Where separable, revenues from equipment sales are recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer. The provision of an Internet box does not constitute either a separable component of the Internet access service offer nor a rental because Orange maintains control of the box and its usage. When equipment – associated with the subscription of telecommunication services – is sold by a third-party retailer who purchases it from the Group and receives compensation for signing up the customer, the related revenues are: – recognized when the equipment is sold to the end-customer; – assessed by the Group taking into account the best estimate of the retail price to the end-customer and any subsidies granted to the retailer at the time of the sale and passed on to the end-customer in the form of a rebate on the equipment. Equipment for which a right of use is granted is analyzed in accordance with IFRIC 4 “Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease” in order to determine whether IAS 17 “Leases” is applicable. Equipment lease revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease agreement, except in the case of finance leases, which are accounted for as sales on credit. 2017 Registration Document / Orange 161 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements Services: with regards to the mass market and the corporate market, revenues from telephone subscriptions and Internet access are recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription period and revenues from charges for incoming and outgoing telephone communications, international roaming and data exchange invoiced to customers are recognized when the service is rendered. The Group offers customized solutions to its Enterprise customers: management of the telecommunication network, access, voice and data transmission and migration. The contingent commercial discounts granted under these arrangements are recorded as a deduction from revenues based on the specific terms of each arrangement. Migration costs incurred by the Group under these arrangements are expensed when incurred except when the arrangements include an early termination penalty clause. With regards to the operators, wholesale connection subscriptions are recognized on a prorata basis as this represents the best estimate of the consumption of the service, while wholesale voice or data transfers (termination on the Orange network, international traffic) are recognized when the service is rendered. Between the major transit carriers (“International Carriers”), transfers of minutes are invoiced and recorded gross (and often settled on a net basis) and transfers of data are not charged (“free peering”). Over-The-Top service providers (OTT) (like Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc.) are not charged for the data they send (“free peering” and “net neutrality”) and hence no revenues are recognized. Revenues from the sale of transmission capacity on terrestrial and submarine cables, as well as from offers providing access to the local loop, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. The gross or net accounting for revenue sharing arrangements and supply of content depends on the analysis of the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction. Thus, revenues are recognized on a net basis when the provider is responsible for supplying the content provided to the end-customer and for setting the price. This principle is notably applied for revenues and cost-sharing arrangements (special rate numbers, etc.), as well as for revenues from the sale or supply of content (audio, video, games, etc.) through the Group’s various communication systems (mobile, PC, TV, fixed-line telephony, etc.). The Group’s commercial arrangements incorporate service level commitments (delivery time, service reinstatement time). These service level agreements cover commitments provided by the Group under the order, delivery, and after sales services process. If the Group fails to comply with one of these commitments, then it pays compensation to the end-customer, which is usually a tariff reduction deducted from revenues. Such penalties are recorded when it is likely that they will be paid. Revenues are stated net of discounts. With respect to certain commercial offers where customers sign up for a fixed period, the Group offers a free service or temporary price reduction. When these free services are conditional upon a commitment for a certain period of time, the total revenues generated under the contract may be spread over the total period of the contractual agreement. Loyalty points awarded to customers are considered as a separable component to be delivered in the transaction that triggered the acquisition of these points. Part of the invoiced revenues are allocated to these points based on their fair value taking into account an estimated utilization rate, and deferred until the date on which the points are definitively converted into benefits. Fair value is defined as the excess in value of the benefit granted to the loyal customer over the sales incentive that would be granted to any new customer. This principle is applied for both types of loyalty programs that exist within the Group, those with and those without a contractual renewal obligation. The public-private service concession agreements are accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 12 “Service Concession Arrangements”. Revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method in accordance with IAS 11 during the construction period, and in accordance with IAS 18 during the operating and maintenance period. The Group has a right to receive a consideration from either the public entity or the users of the public service in exchange for its operator’s activities. This right is accounted for as: – an intangible asset, if the Group has a right to charge users of the public service. This asset is measured at the infrastructure fair value and depreciated over the agreement period; – a financial receivable, if the Group has an unconditional right to receive payments from the public entity. This asset is measured at the infrastructure fair value and accounted for at amortized cost. 4.2 Other operating income (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Income from universal service 8 10 18 Late-payment fees on trade receivables 32 58 45 Brand & management fees (1) 14 24 93 Tax credits and subsidies 40 70 39 Proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets 88 126 58 Net banking income 76 21 Other income 443 430 389 Total 701 739 642 (1) Invoiced to certain unconsolidated entities.

Those receivables which include deferred payment terms over 12 or 24 months for the benefit of customers are discounted and classified as current items. Receivables from financial lease offers on firms’ equipment are recognized as current operating receivables because they are acquired in the normal course of business. Impairment of trade receivables is based on two methods: – a collective statistical method: this is based on historical losses and leads to a separate impairment rate for each aging balance category. This analysis is performed over a homogenous group of receivables with similar credit characteristics because they belong to a customer category (mass-market, small offices and home offices); – a stand-alone method: the assessment of impairment probability and its amount are based on a set of relevant qualitative factors (ageing of late payment, other balances with the counterpart, rating from independent agencies, geographical area). This method is used for carriers and operators (national and international), local, regional and national authorities and for large accounts of Enterprise Communication Services. Impairment losses identified for a group of receivables represent the step preceding impairment identification for individual receivables. When information is available (clients in bankruptcy or subject to equivalent judicial proceedings), these receivables are then excluded from the statistical impairment database and individually impaired. The trade receivables may be part of securitization programs. When they are sold to consolidated special purpose entities, they are still recognized in the statement of financial position. Other sales to financial institutions may lead to receivables de-recognition. 4.4 Deferred income December 31, December 31, December 31, (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Prepaid cards 241 266 310 Service access fees 722 704 664 Loyalty programs 43 58 76 Other deferred revenue (1) 999 1,021 987 Other deferred operating income 76 85 99 Total 2,081 2,134 2,136 (1) Mainly includes subscription fees.

These receivables are offset by the liabilities of the same amount (see Note 5.7). Orange Money is a money transfer, payment and financial services solution provided via an electronic money (“e-money”) account linked 3 to an Orange mobile number. Since 2016, the Orange group has become an Electronic Money Issuer (“EMI”) in some of the countries in which it operates, via dedicated, approved, internal subsidiaries. Regulations state that EMIs, as last-resort guarantors for the reimbursement of e-money holders, are obliged to restrict the funds collected in exchange for the issue of e-money (obligation to protect holders). The e-money distribution model relies on Orange’s subsidiaries and third-party distributors. EMIs issue e-money (or units of value “UV”) at the request of these distributors in exchange for funds collected therefrom. The distributors then transfer the e-money to end holders. Within the Orange group, this restriction includes the protection of third-party holders (distributors and customers). These transactions have no impact on the Group’s net financial debt and are listed under the following headings: – assets restricted to an amount equal to the e-money in circulation outside of the Orange group (or UV in circulation); – UV in circulation under liabilities, representing the obligation to reimburse the third-party holders (customers and third-party distributors). These two headings are presented under “other assets” and “other liabilities” and under operating activities as “change in working capital requirement”. 4.6 Related party transactions The French State, either directly or through Bpifrance Participations, is one of the main shareholders of Orange SA. The communication services provided to the French State are done so as part of a competitive process held for each service according to the nature of the service. They have no material impact on consolidated revenues. Transactions with associates and joint ventures are presented in Note 10. Accounting policies Orange group’s related parties are listed below: – the Group’s key management personnel and their families (see Note 6); – the French State, and its departments in Bpifrance Participations and central State departments (see Notes 9 and 13); – associates, joint ventures and companies in which the Group owns a material shareholding (see Note 10). 2017 Registration Document / Orange 165 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements Note 5 Purchases and other expenses 5.1 External purchases (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Commercial expenses and content rights (7,087) (6,800) (6,549) o/w costs of terminals and other equipment sold (4,110) (3,970) (3,920) o/w advertising, promotional, sponsoring and rebranding costs (845) (894) (850) Service fees and inter-operator costs (5,252) (5,459) (5,228) Other network expenses, IT expenses (3,074) (2,999) (2,871) Other external purchases (3,062) (3,023) (3,049) o/w rental expenses (1,148) (1,156) (1,163) Total (18,475) (18,281) (17,697) Accounting policies Firm purchase commitments are disclosed as unrecognized contractual commitments. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs, other than loyalty programs costs, are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, that is to say on acquisition or renewal. In some cases, contractual clauses with distributors provide for incentives based on revenues generated and received: these incentives are recorded as expenses upon recognition of these revenues. Advertising, promotion, sponsoring, communication and brand marketing costs are recorded as expenses during the period in which they are incurred. Onerous contracts: during the course of a contract, when the circumstances that prevailed at inception change, some commitments towards suppliers may become onerous, i.e. the unavoidable costs of meeting the contractual obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it: this may be the case with leases that include surplus space following the release of space due to technological or staffing changes. The onerous criteria are accounted for when the entity implements a detailed plan to reduce its commitments. 5.2 Other operating expenses (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Expense from universal service (43) (47) (30) Allowances and losses on trade receivables – telecom activities (251) (275) (279) Litigations (278) (86) (506) Cost of bank credit risk (6) (2) Other expense (152) (133) (254) Total (730) (543) (1,069) Impairment and losses on trade receivables of telecom activities are Litigation-related expenses that were the subject of provisions or detailed in Note 4.3. immediate payments in 2017 mainly include the reassessment of the risk related to various disputes and in 2015 corresponded mainly to The cost of credit risk exclusively applies to Orange Bank and includes the fine of 350 million euros relating to a dispute concerning impairment charges and reversals on fixed-income securities, loans competition on the Enterprise market, as well as the effects of the and receivables to customers as well as impairment charges and asset portfolio restructuring. reversals relating to guarantee commitments given, losses on receivables and recovery of amortized debts. 166 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Provision for litigations in the opening balance 537 528 491 Additions with impact on income statement 354 24 478 Reversals with impact on income statement (34) (7) (56) Discounting with impact on income statement 2 4 4 Utilizations without impact on income statement (1) (37) (13) (402) Changes in consolidation scope (6) 1 Translation adjustment 7 (5) Reclassifications and other items (50) 12 12 Reclassification to assets held for sale Provision for litigations in the closing balance 779 537 528 o/w non-current provision 53 69 85 o/w current provision 726 468 443 (1) Included, in 2015, amend for the Enterprise Market litigation for 350 million euros reclassified in debts to be paid, and paid in 2016. Payments related to some litigation are directly recorded in other operating expenses. The Group’s significant litigations are described in Note 16. 3 Accounting policies Litigation In the ordinary course of business, the Group is involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings and administrative actions described in Note 16. The costs which may result from these proceedings are accrued at the reporting date when the Group has a present obligation towards a third party resulting from a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of that liability can be quantified or estimated within a reasonable range. The amount of provision recorded is based on a case-by-case assessment of the risk level, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk. Where appropriate, litigation cases may be analyzed as contingent liabilities, which correspond to: – probable obligations arising from past events that are not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Company’s control; or – present obligations arising from past events that are not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. 5.3 Restructuring and integration costs (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Restructuring costs (164) (428) (151) Departure plans (1) (67) (128) (80) Lease property restructuring (2) (58) (74) 36 Distribution channels (3) (4) (181) (98) Impairment of assets related to onerous contracts (6) (25) Other (29) (20) (9) Integration costs (3) (71) (21) Jazztel (4) (43) (21) Acquisition costs of investments (3) (23) Other (5) Total (167) (499) (172) (1) Mainly voluntary departure plans of Orange Espagne in 2016 (approximately 500 people) and Orange Polska in 2017 (approximately 2,700 people).

These actions may have a negative effect on the period during which they are announced or implemented; for instance but not limited to, some of the transformation plans approved by internal governance bodies and integration expenses of activities within 12 months of their acquisition. Provisions are recognized only when the restructuring has been announced and the Group has drawn up or started to implement a detailed formal plan prior to the end of the reporting period. The types of costs approved by the Group as restructuring costs primarily consist of: – employee departure plans; – indemnities paid to suppliers to terminate a contract (distribution networks, content operations, etc.); – cost of vacant buildings; – transformation plans for communication network infrastructures. Integration costs are a specific type of restructuring costs. These costs are incurred at the time of acquisition of legal entities (costs linked to the acquisition of the entity, consultancy fees, training costs for new staff, migration costs associated with customer offers, labor expenses associated with the transition). They are incurred over a maximum period of 12 months following the acquisition date. 5.4 Broadcasting rights and equipment inventories December 31, December 31, December 31, (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Handset inventories 583 594 554 Other products/services sold 32 29 26 Available broadcasting rights 68 45 50 Others supplies 198 205 185 Gross value 881 873 815 Depreciation (54) (54) (52) Net book value 827 819 763 (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Inventories in the opening balance 819 763 709 Business related variations 14 62 42 Changes in the scope of consolidation 0 3 (1) Translation adjustment (3) (9) 1 Reclassifications and other items (4) (0) 12 Reclassification to assets held for sale Inventories in the closing balance 827 819 763 168 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 Accounting policies Network maintenance equipment and equipment intended for sale to customers are measured at the lower of cost or likely realizable value.

They include those that have been financed by the supplier (with or without notification of transfer to financial institutions) under direct or reverse factoring, and those for which the supplier proposed an extended payment period to Orange and for which Orange confirmed the payment arrangement under the agreed terms. Orange considers these financial liabilities to carry the characteristics of trade payables, in particular due to the ongoing trade relationship, the payment schedules ultimately consistent with the operational cycle of a telecommunications operator in particular for the purchase of primary infrastructures, the supplier’s autonomy in the anticipated relationship and a financial cost borne by Orange that corresponds to the compensation of the supplier for the extended payment schedule agreed. For payables without specified interest rates, they are measured at nominal value if the interest component is negligible. For interest bearing payables, the measurement is at amortized cost. 5.7 Other liabilities December 31, December 31, December 31, (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Provisions for litigations (1) 779 537 528 Cable network access fees (URI) (2) 194 240 285 Submarine cable consortium (3) 157 235 410 Security deposit received 182 198 232 Orange Money – units in circulation (3) 408 319 Others (4) 738 610 1,032 Total 2,456 2,138 2,487 o/w other non-current liabilities 521 608 792 o/w other current liabilities 1,935 1,530 1,695 (1) See Note 5.2.

Its computation is based on external indices commonly used as reference for the eurozone, – actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits are fully recorded in other comprehensive income, – the Group’s defined benefit plans are generally not financed. In the rare cases where they are, hedging plan assets are set up by employer and employee contributions which are managed by separate legal entities whose investments are subject to fluctuations in the financial markets. These entities are generally administrated by joint committees comprising representatives of the Group and of the beneficiaries. Each committee adopts its own investment strategy which is designed to strike the optimum strategies to match assets and liabilities, based on specific studies performed by external experts. It is generally carried out by fund managers selected 3 by the committees and depends on the market opportunities. Assets are measured at fair value, determined by reference to quoted prices, since they are mostly invested in listed securities (primarily shares and bonds) and the use of other asset categories is limited. Other long-term benefits may be granted such as seniority awards, long-term compensated absences and French part-time for seniors plan (TPS) agreements. The calculation of the related commitments is based on actuarial assumptions (including demographic, financial and discounting assumptions) similar to those relating to post-employment benefits. The relevant actuarial gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when they arise. Termination benefits are subject to provisions (up to the related obligation). For all commitments where termination of employment contracts would trigger payment of an indemnity, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss for the period when modifications take place. 6.3 Share-based payment entitlement to final allocation will be a percentage based on the sum of performances assessed over the course of the vesting period.

Variations of the aggregated recoverable amount of the consolidated entities. Accounting policies Goodwill recognized as an asset in the statement of financial position comprises the excess calculated: – either on the basis of the equity interest acquired (and for business combinations after January 1, 2010, no subsequent changes for any additional purchases of non-controlling interests); or – on a 100% basis, leading to the recognition of goodwill relating to the non-controlling interests (for Orange Egypt in particular). Goodwill is not amortized. It is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when there is an indication that it may be impaired. Thus, the evolution of general economic and financial trends, the different levels of resilience of the telecommunication operators with respect to the decline of local economic environments, the changes in the market capitalization values of telecommunication companies, as well as actual economic performance compared to market expectations represent external indicators that are analyzed by the Group, together with internal performance indicators, in order to assess whether an impairment test should be performed more than once a year. These tests are performed at the level of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) (or group of CGUs). These generally correspond to operating segments or to each country in Africa and the Middle East. This is reviewed if the Group changes the level at which it monitors return on investment for goodwill testing purposes. 180 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 To determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized, the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the CGUs or groups of CGUs is compared to recoverable amount, for which Orange uses mostly the value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future expected cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on economic and regulatory assumptions, license renewal assumptions and forecast trading and investment activity drawn up by the Group’s management, as follows: – cash flow projections are based on three to five-year business plans and include a tax cash flow calculated as EBIT (operating income) multiplied by the statutory tax rate (excluding deferred tax and unrecognized tax loss carry forward impacts at the date of valuation); In the case of recent acquisitions, longer term business plans may be used; – post-tax cash flow projections beyond that timeframe may be extrapolated by applying a declining or flat growth rate for the next year, and then by a growth rate to perpetuity reflecting the expected long-term growth in the market; – post-tax cash flows are subject to a post-tax discount rate, using rates which incorporate a relevant premium reflecting a risk assessment for the implementation of certain business plans or country risks. The value in use derived from these calculations is identical to the one that would derive from discounting pre-tax cash flows at pre-tax discount rates. The key operating assumptions used to determine the value in use are common across Group’s business segments. These assumptions include: – key revenue assumptions, which reflect market level, penetration rate of the offerings and market share, positioning of the competition’s offerings and their potential impact on market price levels and their transposition to the Group’s offerings bases, regulatory authority decisions on pricing of services to customers and on access and pricing of inter-operator services, technology migration of networks (e.g. extinction of copper local loops), decisions of competition authorities in terms of concentration or regulation of adjacent sectors 3 such as cable; – key cost assumptions, on the level of marketing expenses required to renew product lines and keep up with competition, the ability to adjust costs to potential changes in revenues or the effects of natural attrition and committed employee departure plans; – key assumptions on the level of capital expenditure, which may be affected by the roll-out of new technologies, by decisions of regulatory authorities relating to licenses and spectrum allocation, deployment of fiber networks, mobile network coverage, sharing of network elements or obligations to open up networks to competitors. Tested net carrying values include goodwill, land, and assets with finite useful life (property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and net working capital requirements including intragroup balances). The Orange brand, an asset with an indefinite useful life, is subject to a specific test, see Note 8.2. If an entity partially owned by the Group includes goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests, the impairment loss is allocated between the shareholders of Orange SA and the non-controlling interests on the same basis as that on which profit or loss is allocated (i.e. ownership interest). Impairment loss for goodwill is recorded definitively in operating income. Note 8 Fixed assets 8.1 Depreciation and amortization increase in depreciation and amortization in 2017 was mainly due to the effect of the increase in investment on very high-speed broadband In 2017, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets amounted networks (4G and fiber optic) in France, Spain and Poland. In 2016, to 2,138 million euros as compared to 2,195 million euros in 2016 the 263 million euros increase in depreciation and amortization was and 2,062 million euros in 2015 (see Note 8.3) and depreciation and largely due to the effect of the acquisitions of Jazztel and Médi amortization of property, plant and equipment amounted to Telecom in July 2015 for 124 million euros and 65 million euros 4,708 million euros as compared to 4,533 million euros in 2016 and respectively. 4,403 million euros in 2015 (see Note 8.4). The 118 million euros 2017 Registration Document / Orange 181 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements Accounting policies Assets are depreciated to expense their cost (generally with no residual value deducted) on a basis that reflects the pattern in which their future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. The straight-line basis is usually applied. The useful lives are reviewed annually and are adjusted if current estimated useful lives differ from previous estimates. This may be the case for outlooks on the implementation of new technologies (for example, the replacement of copper local loop by fiber optic). These changes in accounting estimates are recognized prospectively.

Key assumptions and sensitivity of the recoverable amount of the Orange brand Key assumptions and sources of sensitivity used in the assessment of recoverable amount of the Orange brand are similar to those used for the goodwill of consolidated operations (see Note 7.3), which affect the sales base and potentially the level of brand fees. Other assumptions that affect the assessment of the recoverable amount are as follows: December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Basis of recoverable amount Value in use Value in use Value in use Source used Internal plan Internal plan Internal plan Methodology Discounted Discounted Discounted net fees net fees net fees Perpetuity growth rate 1.1% 1.3% 1.0% Post-tax discount rate 7.6% 7.8% 7.5% Pre-tax discount rate 8.9% 9.2% 9.0% December 31, December 31, December 31, (in billions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Excess at 100% of the recoverable amount over the carrying value tested 2.2 2.1 2.0 Effect at 100% on the recoverable amount of: a variation of 10% in cash flows of terminal year 0.4 0.4 0.4 a decrease by 1% in perpetuity growth rate 0.6 0.6 0.5 An increase by 1% in post-tax discount rate 0.7 0.7 0.7 182 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 Accounting policies Given the nature of its assets and businesses, most of the Group’s individual assets do not generate cash flow independent of the cash flows generated by Cash-Generating Units. The recoverable amount is therefore determined on the level of CGU (or CGU group) to which belong the assets, according to a method similar to the one for goodwill. The Orange brand has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. Its recoverable amount is assessed based on the expected contractual royalties (and included in the business plan) discounted in perpetuity, less the costs attributable to the brand’s owner. 8.3 Other intangible assets December 31, 2017 December 31, December 31, 2016 2015 Accumulated depreciation Gross and Accumulated Net book Net book Net book (in millions of euros) value amortization impairment value value value 3 Telecommunications licenses 10,557 (4,168) (156) 6,233 6,440 5,842 Orange brand 3,133 3,133 3,133 3,133 Other brands 1,093 (94) (911) 88 102 137 Customer bases 4,990 (4,425) (10) 555 703 729 Software 11,868 (7,890) (32) 3,946 3,781 3,815 Other intangible assets 1,743 (1,170) (189) 384 443 671 Total 33,384 (17,747) (1,298) 14,339 14,602 14,327 (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Net book value of other intangible assets in the opening balance 14,602 14,327 11,811 Acquisitions of other intangible assets 1,893 3,007 2,771 o/w telecommunications licenses (1) 318 1,521 1,285 Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (13) 144 1,805 Disposals (7) (3) (9) Depreciation and amortization (2,138) (2,195) (2,062) Impairment (2) (55) (183) (20) Translation adjustment (74) (363) 46 Reclassifications and other items 131 (132) (15) Reclassifications to assets held for sale Net book value of other intangible assets in the closing balance 14,339 14,602 14,327 (1) Relates to the acquisition in 2017 of licenses for 152 million euros in Mali.

Intangible assets are initially recognized at acquisition or production cost. The payments indexed to revenue, especially for some telecommunication licenses, are expensed in the relevant periods. Indefeasible Rights of Use (IRUs) acquired by the Group correspond to the rights to use transmission cable or capacity (mainly submarine cables) granted for a fixed period. IRUs are recognized as assets when the Group has the right to use identified optical fibers or dedicated wavelength bandwidth, and the right duration represents a major part of the economic life of the underlying asset. The operating rights granted under certain concession arrangements give right to charge users of the public service (see Note 4.1). 8.4 Property, plant and equipment December 31, 2017 December 31, December 31, 2016 2015 Accumulated depreciation 3 Gross and Accumulated Net book Net book Net book (in millions of euros) value amortization impairment value value value Land and buildings 7,777 (4,982) (260) 2,535 2,661 2,733 Networks and terminals 83,771 (60,608) (283) 22,880 21,984 21,194 IT equipment 3,949 (3,134) (13) 802 784 787 Other property, plant and equipment 1,595 (1,136) (11) 448 483 409 Total 97,092 (69,860) (567) 26,665 25,912 25,123 (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Net book value of property, plant and equipment in the opening balance 25,912 25,123 23,314 Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment 5,677 5,576 5,043 o/w finance leases 43 91 43 Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (1) 0 242 1,071 Disposals and retirements (35) (25) (39) Depreciation and amortization (4,708) (4,533) (4,403) Impairment (2) (135) (48) (18) Translation adjustment (44) (607) 63 Reclassifications and other items (2) 184 92 Reclassifications to assets held for sale Net book value of property, plant and equipment in the closing balance 26,665 25,912 25,123 (1) In 2016, mainly related to the acquisitions of entities in Africa (Liberia, Congo (DRC), Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone). In 2015, mainly related to Jazztel and Médi Telecom. (2) Includes impairment detailed in note 7.1. Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment mainly comprise network facilities and equipment. The gross value of property, plants and equipment is made up of their acquisition or production cost, which includes study and construction fees as well as enhancement costs that increase the capacity of equipment and facilities. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except where they serve to increase the asset’s productivity or prolong its useful life. The cost of property, plant and equipment also includes the estimated cost of dismantling, removing and restoring the site occupied due to the obligation incurred by the Group. The roll-out of assets by stage, especially for network assets, in the Group’s assessment, does not generally require a substantial period of preparation for the Group. As a consequence, the Group does not generally capitalize the interest expense incurred during the construction and acquisition phase for its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The assets acquired in form of finance lease do not affect the cash flow on acquisition. However, the subsequent rental payments during the leasing period represent interest payments (cash flow on operating activities) and capital repayments (cash flow on financing activities). The majority of the assets held under finance lease are network buildings. The land and buildings hosting radio sites may belong to the Group, or be held through a finance lease, or be available under an operating lease or be simply made available. The lease agreements of office buildings and points of sale are generally qualified as operating leases and the future lease payments are disclosed as unrecognized contractual commitments in Note 14. 2017 Registration Document / Orange 185 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements Simultaneously the equipment, very often generic, of which the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred from the Group to third parties via a lease, is considered as sold. In France, the regulatory framework governing the fiber optic network roll-out (Fiber To The Home – FTTH) organizes the access by commercial operators to the last mile of networks rolled-out by another operator on a co-funding basis (ab initio or a posteriori) or through a line access. The sharing of rights and obligations between the various operators co-financing the terminal section of networks is classified as a joint operation in accordance with IFRS 11 “Partnerships”: Orange only recognizes as an asset its share of the network assets self-built or purchased to other co-financing operators. The Group has entered into network sharing arrangements with other mobile operators on a reciprocal basis, which may cover passive infrastructure, active equipment or even spectrum. Accordingly, in Poland, the arrangements with Deutsche Telekom have been qualified as a joint operation: the access network infrastructures and related equipment are recognized as fixed assets for the Group’s share of assets installed by the Group or Deutsche Telekom in their own geographical area. In some African countries, the Group has also entered into sharing arrangements with TowerCos (companies operating telecom towers). These TowerCos enable mobile operators, including Orange, to share sites, passive infrastructure and related services (by managing the mobile operators’ sites and/or acquiring or building sites). The unit of account and the specific features of each arrangement lead the Group to generally qualify these transactions as a service. The long-term commitments resulting from these arrangements are presented as unrecognized contractual commitments (see Note 14).

For payables without specified interest rates, they are measured at nominal value if the interest component is negligible. For interest bearing payables, the measurement is at amortized cost. Trade payables also include those that the supplier may have sold with or without notifying financial institutions in a direct or reverse factoring arrangement (see Note 5.6).

The provision is assessed on the basis of the identified costs for the current year, extrapolated for future years using the best estimate of the commitment settlement. This estimate is revised annually and adjusted where appropriate against the asset to which it relates. The provision is present-discounted at a rate set by geographical area and equal to the average rate of risk-free investments in 15-year State bonds. 2017 Registration Document / Orange 187 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements Note 9 Taxes 9.1 Operating taxes and levies 9.1.1 Operating taxes and levies recognized in the income statement (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Territorial Economic Contribution, IFER and similar taxes (817) (729) (841) Spectrum fees (304) (294) (278) Levies on telecommunication services (296) (319) (259) Other operating taxes and levies (429) (466) (405) Total (1,846) (1,808) (1,783) Although comprising a directly identifiable counterpart, the periodic spectrum fees are presented within the operating taxes and levies as they are set by and paid to the States and Local Authorities. 9.1.2 Operating taxes and levies in the statement of financial position December 31, December 31, December 31, (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Value added tax 958 874 824 Other operating taxes and levies 87 44 69 Operating taxes and levies – receivables 1,045 918 893 Territorial Economic Contribution, IFER and similar taxes (100) (115) (214) Spectrum fees (40) (44) (60) Levies on telecommunication services (97) (100) (99) Value added tax (616) (560) (545) Other operating taxes and levies (409) (422) (400) Operating taxes and levies – payables (1,262) (1,241) (1,318) Operating taxes and levies – net (217) (323) (425) Developments in tax disputes and audits some municipalities sent out tax bills in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court.

The Group calculates the tax assets, liabilities and accruals recognized in the statement of financial position based on the technical merits of the positions it defends versus that of the tax authorities. 9.2 Income tax 9.2.1 Income tax (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 France tax group (574) (464) (360) 3 – Current tax (391) (318) 10 – Deferred tax (183) (146) (370) United Kingdom (57) (20) (4) – Current tax (57) (44) (66) – Deferred tax 0 24 62 Spain (57) (291) 30 – Current tax (46) (23) 18 – Deferred tax (11) (268) 12 Poland 3 (11) (8) – Current tax (2) 3 (19) – Deferred tax 5 (14) 11 Other subsidiaries (403) (184) (307) – Current tax (363) (362) (404) – Deferred tax (40) 178 97 Total Income tax (1,088) (970) (649) – Current tax (859) (744) (461) – Deferred tax (229) (226) (188) France tax group Deferred tax charge As part of the 2017 Amended French Finance Act, the Government The deferred tax expense mainly arises from the use of tax loss carry has introduced an exceptional surtax of 30% on the corporate tax forwards. rate.

The Group calculates the tax assets, liabilities and accruals recognized in the statement of financial position based on the technical merits of the positions it defends versus that of the tax authorities. Deferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax basis, as well as for unused tax losses, using the liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when their recovery is considered probable. A deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, interests in joint ventures and associates, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied: – the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference (e.g. the payment of dividends); and – it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, for fully consolidated companies, a deferred tax liability is only recognized in the amount of the taxes payable on planned dividend distributions by the Group. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. At each period end, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of the deferred tax assets carried by certain tax entities with significant tax loss carry forwards. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is assessed in the light of the business plans used for impairment testing. This plan may be adjusted for any tax specificities. Deferred tax assets arising on these tax losses are not recognized under certain circumstances specific to each company/tax consolidation group concerned, and particularly where: – entities cannot assess the probability of the tax loss carry forwards being set off against future taxable profits, due to the horizon for forecasts based on business plans used for impairment testing and uncertainties as to the economic environment; – entities have not yet begun to use the tax loss carry forwards; – entities do not expect to use the losses within the timeframe allowed by tax regulations; – it is estimated that tax losses are uncertain to be used due to risks of differing interpretations with regard to the application of tax legislation. 2017 Registration Document / Orange 193 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements Note 10 Interests in associates and joint ventures At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the interests in associates and joint ventures included the activities of Orange as an operator in various African and Middle Eastern countries, including in particular Tunisia and Mauritius.

Accounting policies The carrying amount accounted for under the equity method corresponds to the initial acquisition cost increased to recognize the share of the profit or loss in the period. If an associate incurs losses and the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero, the Group ceases to recognize the additional share of losses since it has no commitment beyond its investment. An impairment test is performed at least annually and when there is objective evidence of impairment, for instance a decrease in the quoted price when the investee is listed, significant financial difficulty of the entity, observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, or information about significant changes having an adverse effect on the entity. 194 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 An impairment loss is recorded when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the recoverable amount being the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. The unit of account is the whole investment. Any impairment is recognized as “Share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures”. Impairment losses shall be reversed once the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount.

Bonds, bank loans and loans from multilateral lending institutions Among financial liabilities, only the bond of 25 million euros maturing in 2020 and any commitments to redeem non-controlling interests are recognized at fair value in profit or loss. Borrowings are recognized upon origination at the present value of the sums to be paid and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability are deducted from the liability’s carrying value. The costs are subsequently amortized over the life of the debt, using the effective interest rate method. Some financial liabilities at amortized cost, mainly borrowings, are subject to hedging. This relates mostly to borrowings hedged against the exposure of their future cash flows to foreign exchange risk (cash flow hedge). 11.4 TDIRA further adjusted under the terms and conditions set out in the information memorandum.

This relates to perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (TDIRA). On initial recognition, the liability component is measured at its market value, corresponding to the value of the contractually determined future cash flows discounted at the interest rate applied at the date of issue to comparable instruments providing substantially the same conditions, but without the option to convert or redeem in shares. This liability component is subsequently recognized at amortized cost. 3 The carrying amount of the equity component is determined at inception by deducting the fair value of the financial liability from the notional value of the instrument. This does not change throughout the life of the instrument. 11.5 Bonds Unmatured bonds at December 31, 2017 were all issued by Orange SA, with the exception of two commitments denominated in Moroccan dirhams and held by Médi Telecom.

Accounting policies Assets available for sale The Group’s assets available for sale mainly consist of investment securities, which are not consolidated and not accounted for using the equity method, and marketable securities that do not fulfill the criteria for classification in any of the other categories of financial assets. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value are recorded as “Gains (losses) on assets available for sale” within other comprehensive income. When there is an objective evidence of impairment on available-for-sale assets or a decrease in fair value by at least one-third or over 2 consecutive semesters, the cumulative impairment loss included in other comprehensive income is definitely reclassified from equity to profit or loss within net financial expenses. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss The Group can designate at fair value at inception financial investments such as negotiable debt securities, deposits and mutual funds (UCITS), that are compliant with the Group’s risk management policy or investment strategy (see Note 12.3). They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. All changes in fair value are recorded in net financial expenses. Other financial assets This category mainly includes loans and receivables. These instruments are recognized at fair value at inception and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. If there is any objective evidence of impairment of these assets, the value of the asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement when impairment tests demonstrate that the financial asset carrying amount is higher than its recoverable amount. 202 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 11.8 Derivatives instruments (excluding Orange Bank) 11.8.1 Market value of derivatives December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions of euros) Net Net Net Cash flow hedge derivatives (447) 553 1,111 Fair value hedge derivatives (0) (26) 91 Net investment hedge derivatives Hedging derivatives (447) 527 1,202 Derivatives held for trading (1) (282) (128) 98 Net derivatives (2) (729) 399 1,300 (1) Mainly due to the foreign exchange effects of the economic hedges against the revaluation of subordinated notes denominated in pounds sterling (equity instruments recognized at their historical value – see Note 13.4) for (203) million euros in 2017, (152) million euros in 2016 and 82 million euros in 2015.

The foreign exchange effects of the cross currency swaps is the difference between the notional converted at the closing rate and its notional converted at the opening rate (or at the trading day spot rate in case of new instrument). 3 These derivatives are negotiated under cash-collateral agreements, which effects are described in Note 12.5. Accounting policies Derivative instruments are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position and presented according to their maturity date, regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 (hedging instruments versus trading instruments). Derivatives are classified as a separate line item in the statement of financial position. Trading derivatives are non-qualified economic hedges. Changes in the value of these instruments are recognized directly in profit and loss. Hedge accounting is applicable when: – at the inception of the hedge, there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship; – the effectiveness of the hedge is demonstrated at inception and it is expected to continue in subsequent periods: i.e. at inception and throughout its duration, the company expects changes in the fair value of the hedged element to be almost fully offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged instrument, and if actual results are within a range of 80-125%. There are three types of hedge accounting: – the fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability (or an identified portion of the asset or liability) that are attributable to a particular interest rate and/or currency risk and which could affect profit or loss. The hedged portion of these items is re-measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. Change in this fair value is booked in the income statement and offset by symmetrical changes in the fair value hedging of financial hedging instruments up to the limit of the hedge effectiveness; – the cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular interest rate and/or currency risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (such as a future purchase or sale) and which could affect profit or loss. As the hedged item is not recognized in the statement of financial position, the effective portion of change in fair value of the hedging instrument is booked in other comprehensive income. It is reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item (financial asset or liability) affects the profit or loss or in the initial cost of the hedged item when it relates to the hedge of a non-financial asset acquisition cost; – the net investment hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in values attributable to exchange risk of a net investment in a foreign operation, and could affect profit or loss on the disposal of the foreign operation. The effective portion of the net investment hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income. It is reclassified in profit or loss upon the disposal of the net investment. For transactions qualified as fair value hedges and economic hedges, the foreign exchange impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives is booked in operating income when the underlying hedged item results from operational transactions and in net finance costs when the underlying hedged item is a financial asset or liability. 2017 Registration Document / Orange 203 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements Hedge accounting can be terminated when the hedged item is no longer recognized, i.e. when the Group voluntarily revokes the designation of the hedging relationship or when the hedging instrument is terminated or exercised. The accounting consequences are as follows: – fair value hedge: at the hedge accounting termination date, the adjustment of the fair value of the liability is amortized using an effective interest rate recalculated at this date; – cash flow hedge: amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item is no longer recognized. In all other cases, amounts are reclassified in profit or loss, on a straight basis, throughout the remaining life of the original hedging relationship. In both cases, subsequent changes in the value of the hedging instrument are recorded in profit or loss. 11.8.2 Cash flow hedges The Group’s cash flow hedges aim mainly at neutralizing foreign exchange risk on future cash flows (notional, coupons) or switch floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt.

The fair value of assets available for sale (AFS) is the quoted price at year-end for listed securities and, for non-listed securities, uses a valuation technique determined according to the most appropriate financial criteria in each case (comparable transactions, multiples for comparable companies, shareholders’ agreement, discounted present value of future cash flows). Concerning loans and receivables (L&R), the Group considers that the carrying amount of cash, trade receivables and various deposits provide a reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the high liquidity of these elements. Among financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVR), with respect to very short-term investments such as deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper or negotiable debt securities, the Group considers that the nominal value of the investment and any related accrued interest represent a reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair value of mutual funds (UCITS) is the latest net asset value. For financial liabilities at amortized cost (LAC), the fair value of financial liabilities is determined using: – the quoted price for listed instruments (a detailed analysis is performed in the case of a material decrease in liquidity to evidence whether 3 the observed price corresponds to the fair value; otherwise the quoted price is adjusted); – the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted using rates observed by the Group at the end of the period for other instruments. The results calculated using the internal valuation model are systematically benchmarked with the values provided by Bloomberg. The Group considers the carrying value of trade payables and deposits received from customers to be a reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the high liquidity of these elements. The fair value of long-term trade payables is the value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rates observed by the Group at the end of the period. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVR) mainly concern firm or contingent commitments to purchase non-controlling interests. Their fair value is measured in accordance with the provisions of the contractual agreements. When the commitment is based on a fixed price, a discounted value is retained. The fair value of derivatives, mostly traded over-the-counter, is determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted using the interest rates observed by the Group at the end of the period. The results calculated using the internal valuation model are consistently benchmarked with the values provided by bank counterparties and Bloomberg. When there are no reliable market data which identify the probability of default, the CVA (Credit Value Adjustment) and the DVA (Debit Value Adjustment) are measured based on historical default charts and CDS (Credit Default Swap) trends. Counterparty credit risk and the Group’s own specific default risk are also continuously monitored based on the monitoring of debt security credit spreads on the secondary market and other market information. Given the implementation of collateralization, and based on counterparty policies and the management of indebtedness and liquidity risk described in Note 12, CVA and DVA estimates are not material compared to the measurement of the related financial instruments. 2017 Registration Document / Orange 213 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements Note 13 Shareholders’ equity At December 31, 2017, Orange SA’s share capital, based on the 13.2 Treasury shares number of issued shares at this date, amounted to 10,640,226,396 euros, divided into 2,660,056,599 ordinary shares with a par value of As authorized by the Shareholders’ Meeting of June 1, 2017, the 4 euros each.

These instruments have no maturity and the coupon’s settlement could be deferred at the option of the issuer. They are booked in equity. As equity instruments are recognized at historical value, the tranche denominated in foreign currency is never re-measured. Where appropriate, a translation adjustment impact will be booked in equity at the exercise date of any purchase option. The holders’ payment is directly booked in equity at the date of the decision to pay the coupons. The tax effect relating to the payment is accounted for as net income and the one relating to the remeasurement of the foreign exchange portion is accounted for as equity. Equity component of perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (TDIRA) (see Note 11.4) The equity component is determined as the difference between the fair value of the instrument taken as a whole and the fair value of the debt component. Thus, the equity component determined and recognized at inception is not subsequently re-measured and remains in equity, even when the instrument is extinguished. 13.5 Translation adjustment (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income during the period (188) (214) 77 Reclassification to net income for the period 8 (13) (0) Total translation adjustment for continuing operations (180) (227) 77 Reclassification to the net income for the period (1) (836) Total translation adjustment for discontinued operations (836) (1) Related to EE.

The financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currency is neither the euro nor the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy are translated into euros (the Group’s presentation currency) as follows: – assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate; – items in the income statement are translated at the average rate for the year; – the translation adjustment resulting from the use of these different rates is included in other comprehensive income. The translation adjustments are reclassified to profit or loss when the entity disposes or partially disposes (loss of control, loss of joint control, loss of significant influence) of its interest in a foreign operation through the sale, liquidation, repayment of capital or abandon of all, or part of, that activity. The reduction in the carrying amount of a foreign operation, either because of its own losses or because of the recognition of an impairment loss, does not lead to a reclassification to profit or loss of the accumulated translation adjustment. Recycling of translation adjustment is presented in the consolidated income statement within: – consolidated net income of discontinued operations, when a line of business or major geographical area is disposed of; – gains (losses) on disposal of investments and activities, when other businesses are disposed of; 3 – reclassification of translation adjustment from liquidated entities, in the event of the liquidation or abandonment of an activity without disposal. 13.6 Non-controlling interests (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Credit part of net income attributable to non-controlling interests (a) 280 335 317 o/w Sonatel group 203 217 212 o/w Orange Belgium group 20 35 35 o/w Côte d’Ivoire subgroup 28 20 20 o/w Jordan Telecom group 15 9 6 o/w Orange Bank 30 o/w Orange Polska group 11 34 Debit part of net income attributable to non-controlling interests (b) (43) (7) (11) o/w Orange Bank (33) o/w Orange Polska group (5) Total part of net income attributable to non-controlling interests (a) + (b) 237 328 306 Credit part of comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests (a) 246 319 354 o/w Sonatel group 180 200 222 o/w Orange Belgium group 19 35 35 o/w Côte d’Ivoire subgroup 24 21 20 o/w Orange Bank 28 o/w Jordan Telecom group 14 30 o/w Orange Polska group 17 29 Debit part of comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests (b) (56) (7) (21) o/w Orange Bank (32) o/w Jordan Telecom group (7) o/w Orange Polska group (3) Total part of comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests (a) + (b) 190 312 333 (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Dividends paid to minority shareholders 234 259 304 o/w Sonatel group 185 186 176 o/w Orange Belgium group 14 o/w Médi Telecom 16 15 o/w Orange Polska group 37 79 o/w Jordan Telecom group 11 10 26 2017 Registration Document / Orange 217 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements December 31, December 31, December 31, (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Credit part of equity attributable to non-controlling interests (a) 2,459 2,491 2,375 o/w Orange Polska group 923 906 941 o/w Sonatel group 731 735 649 o/w Orange Belgium group 252 247 212 o/w Jordan Telecom group 156 175 210 o/w Médi Telecom 143 157 183 Debit part of equity attributable to non-controlling interests (b) (5) (5) (15) Total equity attributable to non-controlling interests (a) + (b) 2,454 2,486 2,360 Accounting policies Commitments to purchase non-controlling interests (put options) When the Group grants firm or contingent commitments to purchase non-controlling interests, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is reclassified to financial debt. When the amount of the commitment exceeds the amount of the non-controlling interests, the difference is recorded as a reduction in equity attributable to the owners of the parent company. Financial debt is re-measured at the end of each reporting period in accordance with the contractual arrangement (at fair value or at present value if fixed price) and, in the absence of any guidance provided by IFRS, against finance income or expense. Non-controlling interests that are debtors Total comprehensive income of a subsidiary is attributed to the owners of the parent company and to the non-controlling interests. In accordance with IFRS 10, this can result in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Transactions with owners Each transaction with non-controlling interests of an entity controlled by the Group, when not resulting in a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction with no effect on the total comprehensive income. 13.7 Earnings per share (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Net income of continuing operations 2,114 1,010 2,510 Effect of subordinated notes (267) (287) (292) Non-controlling interests (237) (328) (306) Net income of continuing operations used for calculating basic earnings per share (a) 1,610 395 1,912 Impact of dilutive instruments: TDIRA 33 33 Net income of continuing operations used for calculating diluted earnings per share (b) 1,643 395 1,945 Net income of continuing operations – basic 0.61 0.15 0.72 – diluted 0.61 0.15 0.72 (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Net income of discontinued operations used for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share (c) 29 2,253 448 Net income of discontinued operations – basic 0.01 0.85 0.17 – diluted 0.01 0.85 0.17 218 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 (in millions of euros) 2017 2016 2015 Net income used for calculating basic earnings per share (a) + (c) 1,639 2,648 2,360 Net income used for calculating diluted earnings per share (b) + (c) 1,672 2,648 2,393 Net income – basic 0.62 1.00 0.89 – diluted 0.62 1.00 0.89 December 31, December 31, December 31, (number of shares) 2017 2016 2015 Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding – basic 2,659,421,767 2,654,045,007 2,648,620,953 Impact of dilutive instruments: TDIRA 52,079,350 52,079,350 Weighted average number of shares outstanding – diluted 2,711,501,117 2,654,045,007 2,700,700,303 The TDIRAs were not included in the calculation of net diluted earnings per share as at December 31, 2016 since they were not dilutive. The stock option plans granted to employees are expired at December 31, 2017 (Note 6.3). At December 31, 2016 and 2015, stock options were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as they were out of the 3 money. Accounting policies Earnings per share The Group discloses both basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for continuing operations and discontinued operations: – basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Group, after deduction of the interests of subordinated notes net of tax, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period; – diluted earnings per share are calculated based on the same net income, adjusted for the finance cost of dilutive debt instruments, net of the related tax effect. The number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share takes into account the conversion into ordinary shares of potentially dilutive instruments outstanding during the period. These instruments are considered to be dilutive when they have the effect of reducing earnings per share of continuing operations. When basic earnings per share are negative, diluted earnings per share are identical to basic earnings per share. In the event of an issuance of shares at a price lower than the market price, and in order to ensure comparability of the reporting period shown, the weighted average numbers of shares outstanding from current and previous periods are adjusted. Treasury shares owned, which deducted from the consolidated equity, do not enter into the calculation of earnings per share. 2017 Registration Document / Orange 219 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements Note 14 Unrecognized contractual commitments (excluding Orange Bank) At December 31, 2017, Orange is not aware of having entered into any commitment involving entities controlled by the Group, that may have a material effect on its current or future financial position, other than the commitments described in this Note. 14.1 Operating activities commitments Less than From one More than (in millions of euros) Total one year to five years five years Operating activities commitments 17,358 4,953 7,763 4,642 Operating leases commitments 6,047 952 2,521 2,574 Handsets purchase commitments 2,889 1,526 1,363 Transmission capacity purchase commitments 911 284 441 186 Other goods and services purchase commitments 3,445 1,161 1,767 517 Investment commitments 794 566 169 59 Public initiative networks commitments 2,101 193 1,026 882 Guarantees granted to third parties in the ordinary course of business 1,171 271 476 424 Operating leases Operating lease commitments mainly include property lease commitments.

Since the concept of current or non-current is non-existent in bank accounting, financial assets and liabilities related to loans and borrowings to customers or credit institutions (the ordinary activities of a bank) were all classified in 2017 as current for all periods presented. With regard to other financial assets and liabilities, classification as current and non-current was made in light of both the original intention of management and the nature of the assets and liabilities in question. For instance, with regard to Orange Bank’s other financial assets, since investments are managed by portfolio, financial assets maturing in less than one year but that will be rolled over are classified as non-current. This classification remains unchanged in 2017. 15.1.1 Loans and receivables of Orange Bank Loans and advances of Orange Bank are composed of loans and advances to customers and credit institutions. In the context of adapting the bank’s accounts into the Group’s financial statements, the following have been considered as loan and advances to customers: clearing accounts and other amounts due, as well as amounts related to securities transactions on behalf of customers.

Accounting policies Loans and receivables of Orange Bank Assets related to Orange bank activities are classified in the IAS 39 category of “loans and receivables”. They are initially recorded at fair value or its equivalent, which is, as a general rule, the net amount originally issued, and which should include the origination costs directly related to the transaction as well as the commissions received or paid, analyzed as an adjustment to the effective return on the loan. The loans and receivables are subsequently valued at amortized cost, and interests, as well as transactions costs and commissions included in the initial value of the credits contributes to the net income for these transactions over the term of the credit, calculated on the basis of effective interest rate. In accordance with IAS 39, loans and receivables are impaired when one or more evidences of depreciation have occurred after the recognition of these receivables. The receivables thus identified are then impaired on an individual basis or on a collective basis. Expected losses are accounted for as impairments, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the loans (amortized cost) and the total of estimated future cash flows, discounted with the initial effective interest rate, or in the form of discounts for restructured loans due to default from customers. Impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value prior to impairment and the discounted value, at the initial rate of the receivable, of the components deemed to be recoverable (principal, interest, guarantees, etc.). The changes in the value of the loans impaired are recorded in the income statement under “Cost of risk” included in other operating expenses. When these changes in value are positive, reflecting a subsequent improvement, they are reversed in the income statement, within the same account. The “Cost of risk” account dedicated to Orange Bank and part of the “other operating expenses”, corresponds to provisions and reversals related to banking risks (in particular, counterparty risks and operational risks). 224 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 15.1.2 Orange Bank financial assets December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 (in millions of euros) Non-current Current Total Total Assets held to maturity 611 4 615 713 Assets available for sale 791 4 795 (1) 745 Financial assets at fair value 171 171 (2) 237 Other financial assets 62 152 214 (3) 74 Total 1,464 331 1,795 1,769 (1) Debt securities only.

They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value are recorded as “Gains (losses) on assets available for sale” within other comprehensive income. The long term impairments associated with the assets available for sale are recorded under “Cost of risk” (within other operating expenses) when the assets are fixed rate securities, but they are recorded in “Net Gains (Loss) on financial assets available for sale” when the assets are floating-rate securities. Assets held to maturity This category includes fixed-rate securities that the bank intends to hold until their maturity. They must not be disposed of prior to maturity and they are accounted for at amortized cost. Impairment is recognized on these securities as soon as there is an objective evidence of the existence of an event subsequent to the acquisition of the security that is likely to generate a measurable loss as a result of counterparty risk. Impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value prior to impairment and the discounted value, with the initial rate, of the components deemed to be recoverable (principal, interest, guarantees, etc.). The changes in value thus impaired are recorded in the Income statement, under the “Cost of risk” account (within other operating expenses). When these changes in value are positive, reflecting a subsequent improvement, they are reversed in the income statement under “Cost of risk” within other operating expenses. 2017 Registration Document / Orange 225 3 Financial report Consolidated financial statements 15.1.3 Debts related to Orange Bank operations Debts related to Orange Bank operations are composed of payables to customers and debts with financial institutions.

We did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Justification of our Assessments – Key Audit Matters In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we draw your attention to the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance for the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year, as well as the response that we have provided for these risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and were used to form the opinion we expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. Key Audit Matters Our audit performed and responses thereon Revenue recognition from telecommunication activities and For telecommunication business, we gained insight into the significant contracts with third party operators accounting processes used to recognize various revenue streams, from contract signature and initial communication to invoicing and (notes 4.1 and 4.4 to the consolidated financial statements) receiving payment.

We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency of the information with the consolidated financial statements. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed statutory auditors of Orange S.A. by the Shareholders’ Meeting held on May 27, 2015 for KPMG and a Ministerial Order dated September 18, 1991 for Ernst & Young Audit. As at December 31, 2017, KPMG was in the third year and Ernst & Young Audit in the twenty-seventh year of their total uninterrupted engagement, which is the twenty-first year since securities of the Company were admitted to trading on a regulated market. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Management is also responsible for such internal control that it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: – identifies and assesses the risk of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for the audit opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; – obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; – evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements; – assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his Audit Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the Audit Report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; – evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; – with regard to the financial information on persons or entities included in the consolidation scope, the statutory auditor obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for the audit opinion. The statutory auditor is responsible for managing, supervising and performing the audit of the consolidated financial statements as well as the opinion on the financial statements. 238 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Consolidated financial statements 3 Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee, which includes a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore key audit matters. We describe these matters in this Audit Report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for by Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France set forth in Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed statutory auditors of Orange S.A. by the Shareholders’ Meeting held on May 27, 2015 for KPMG and by the inter-ministerial decree of September 18, 1991 for Ernst & Young Audit. As at December 31, 2017, KPMG were in the third year of their total uninterrupted engagement and Ernst & Young Audit were in their twenty-seventh year, which is the third year and twenty-first year respectively since the Company’s securities were admitted to trading on a regulated market. 276 Orange / 2017 Registration Document Financial report Annual financial statements Orange SA 3 Responsibilities of Management and Those Charges with Governance for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it expects to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, its internal audit of accounting and financial reporting procedures. The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 3 As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: – identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; – obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; – evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements; – assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his Audit Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the Audit Report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; – evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee, which includes a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore key audit matters. We describe these matters in this Audit Report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set out by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

We determined the nature and scope of our tests and procedures based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information with respect to the characteristics of the Company, the human resources and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainability strategy and industry best practices. Regarding the CSR Information that we considered to be the most important (1): – at consolidated level, we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organisation, policies, actions), performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the consolidation of the data. We also verified that the information was consistent and in agreement with the other information in the Management Report; – at the level of a representative sample of entities selected by us (2) on the basis of their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify that procedures are properly applied and to identify potential undisclosed data], and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. The selected sample represents 69% of headcount considered as material data of social issues and between 83% and 97% of environmental data considered as material data (3) of environmental issues. For the remaining consolidated CSR Information, we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the company. We also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in part. We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used, based on our professional judgement, are sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material 5 misstatement in the CSR information cannot be totally eliminated. Conclusion Based on the work performed, no material misstatement has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines. Emphasis of matter Without qualifying the above conclusion, we draw your attention to the following matters: – for waste indicators, despite the complexity related to the lack of maturity of certain local waste management providers, Orange has pursued its efforts to further identify and collect waste information in the MEA area.
