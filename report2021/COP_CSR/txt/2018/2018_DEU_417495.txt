It was a transition year for us. We made a start on tackling the future and removed obstacles from our path. Particularly, the development of our new Group strategy SHAPING 2030 laid the foundations for the way we will steer our Company towards the future, with sustainability playing a key role. At the core of the strategy is a change in the way we view our activities. Whereas in the past we prioritized extraction of potash and magnesium products as well as salt, now we are sharpening our focus on the market and our customers. Agriculture, Industry, Consumers and Communities are our four strong customer segments. We as a company are aligning ourselves with these segments; we call this ‘One K+S’. In realigning our activities we have drawn up the roadmap for the way in which we intend to lift our operating earnings before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to € 3 billion by 2030 and will also grow profitably and independently beyond this. We implemented the first of these organisational changes this year. To steer the entire company towards this successful future, we also had to make some tough decisions. The decision to end potash production at the Sigmundshall mine was not easy for us. We have come a long way in our quest to achieve ‘environmental peace’. The agreement reached with BUND and the municipality of Gerstungen on the future disposal of mining wastewater gives us certainty in our planning. The permit for early commencement of construction for the expansion of tailings piles in Hattorf and the related positive overall forecast for the project are important further milestones, as is the new wastewater treatment plant on the Werra site. The certainty thus gained creates a good starting point for our business as well as for jobs and our production sites in Germany and around the world. Resolution of environmental issues is essential for the successful future of K+S, which is why we have expressed a public commitment to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. 2 1.1 PREAMBLE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION Another important milestone was the commissioning of our new potash mine in Bethune, Canada. The investment has borne fruits and our customers have already taken receipt of the initial shiploads. Reaching these milestones will enable us to continue growing in 2018 and beyond, increase our earnings again and thus reduce our indebtedness. On behalf of the entire Board of Executive Directors, I would like to express our thanks and appreciation to all our employees. I would also like to thank our customers, partners and you, the shareholders, for your trust and constructive criticism with which you accompanied us again in the past financial year. We look forward to continuing our excellent cooperation with you. All the best! DR BURKHARD LOHR CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS KASSEL, 15 MARCH 2018 1.1 PREAMBLE 3 SHAPING THE FUTURE AS A TEAM In the purpose of ‘One K+S’ we think and act as one company. We are developing a new way of working across areas, locations and countries. LIFT POTENTIAL OF THE EXISTING BUSINESS Our existing business with the two raw materials potash and salt offers a good basis for the future. We will proceed developing it consistently and want to use organic as well as growth options by acquisitions. POTASH FROM TWO CONTINENTS With the commissioning of the new Bethune mine in Canada we are entering a new dimension. Now we supply our customers with potash from two continents: North America and Europe. REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON EXTERNAL FACTORS With the implementation of SHAPING 2030 we become more independent of external influences such as the weather and the price development of potassium chloride. In order to achieve that, we want to expand our specialty business and develop adjacent growth areas. 1.2 HIGHLIGHTS 2017 POTASH FROM TWO CONTINENTS The excitement in the huge warehouse is increasing immeasurably. Several dozen employees are standing together in smaller groups and staring expectantly at the ceiling. Bright spotlights illuminate the area of more than 11,000 square meters, outside it is still dark. Then suddenly the first trickles of ‘white gold’, as the miners call potash, are falling down from a 30 metres high conveyor belt like sudden fog. On the ground it quickly builds-up to a small pyramid. With frenetic cheers and loud clapping the employees are appreciating the things that are happening right now. It’s done: The first product appears at the brand new potash plant Bethune in the south of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. There, in the treasury of the Canadian potash industry, K+S has managed to build the most modern plant of its kind worldwide in less than five years. Therefore 11th of June 2017 marks one of the most important milestones in the recent history of K+S GROUP. ‘This is a great day for our company,’ commented Dr Burkhard Lohr, CEO of K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, the event a little later. ‘With Bethune, we are entering a new dimension. Now we produce potash on two continents.’ With the new location, K+S is expanding the global presence and will reduce the average cost of production, just to name a few of many advantages. And the success story of the German resources company in Canada continues: On 28 August 2017 the company and the partner PACIFIC COAST TERMINALS (PCT) opened the new handling and storage facility for Bethune potash in the Port of Vancouver. Just one month later, the first train with 122 loaded rail cars arrives there. Only four more weeks later, the first cargo ship with 30,000 tons of potash fertilizers leaves the port to be received by customers in the Chinese port of Yantai on November 14th. About 500,000 tons were produced in Bethune last year. ENSURE PRODUCTION, REDUCE WASTEWATER Bethune was not the only step in 2017 to secure potash production in the long term. Thanks to the optimized wastewater management at the Werra plant from mid-February 2017 onwards, it has been possible to stabilize operations of the largest German K+S potash site. The commissioning of the new KAINITE CRYSTALLISATION AND FLOTATION (KCF) facility was another important milestone. This facility reduces the total amount of saline wastewater from the Werra plant by further 20 percent. The receipt of the permit for the early commencement of the tailings pile extension in Hattorf and in accordance to that the positive forecast for this project is rounding-off the successes in this business environment last year. 8 1.2 HIGHLIGHTS 2017 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION GET OUT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MESS At the top of the priority list of the newly formed Board of Executive Directors was the dialogue with critics on environmental issues last year. After a few months, there were first successful steps to be announced: There were two ongoing and lengthy legal disputes with the environmental association BUND and the municipality of Gerstungen in Thuringia resolved by settlement agreements. On the way to environmental peace this kind of dialogue with stakeholders shall continue in the future. ‘It’s about maintaining our license-to-operate,’ Dr Burkhard Lohr aptly described this development. PROMISED IS PROMISED In spring K+S promised its shareholders a ‘tangible increase in earnings’ for the 2017 financial year compared to the previous year. This forecast was achieved with an operating result (EBIT I) of € 271 million eventually. Although the result lies at the lower end of the forecasted range between € 260 and € 360 million. However, this was mainly due to the fact that the planned closure of the Sigmundshall mine near Hanover was announced and thus a high one-time financial effect arose. Without this effect the operating result would have increased by more than 30 percent compared to the previous year. The decision to abandon the location at the end of 2018 was not easy for the Board of Executive Directors. However, it was inevitable as the productivity of the mine has steadily declined in recent years. The target is to give a clear perspective to the more than 700 dedicated employees beyond 2018. PAVING THE WAY TO A SUCCESSFUL FUTURE No one can come up with a new corporate strategy just like that and it cannot be explained completely in a few sentences. It is rather the result of several months of profound analysis and development work. This mammoth task was the core approach of the newly formed Board of Executive Directors directly after the inauguration. And the Board has delivered: The outcome was a clear vision of a successful K+S GROUP in 2030 and the associated new strategy SHAPING 2030. It takes the interests of all stakeholders into account. The newly developed guiding principle keeps it to the point: ‘We will be the most customer-focused, independent minerals company.’ In other words: K+S should become more efficient and have a long-term growth perspective again. That’s why in the future, customers will be more in the focus of action. To achieve this, K+S reorganises the production-driven business units Potash and Magnesium Products as well as Salt to the customer segments Agriculture, Industry, Consumers and Communities. 1.2 HIGHLIGHTS 2017 9 1.3 SHAPING 2030 The new strategy SHAPING 2030 is a clear commitment to the future K+S GROUP. It is based on our strengths and abilities. It expresses that our company will be successful in the long term. We are tapping the full potential of our existing business and explore new adjacent growth areas. Therefore we have set ambitious targets to define our standard and make K+S robust and profitable. Targets 2020: Ambitions 2030: Net debt / EBITDA halved vs. H1 / 2017 € 3bn EBITDA in 2030 > € 150m > 15% Synergies from the end of 2020 ROCE Target 2023: Requirements achieved for > 4% p. a. investment grade-rating Revenue growth beyond 2030 ¹ Detailed information on the new corporate strategy SHAPING 2030 can be found in chapter 2.4 Corporate Strategy from page 75. 10 1.3 SHAPING 2030 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION OUR VISION FOR 2030 We will be the most customer-focused, independent minerals company.

In the Supervisory Board and in the recently created Strategy Committee, we especially discussed the new Group strategy, SHAPING 2030, in great detail during 2017 as well as the forward-looking organisation based thereon. The reorientation is based on an even stronger focus on the relevant markets and customer segments. We believe that K+S is well positioned to achieve the ambitious mediumand long-term objectives of SHAPING 2030. One key element of the Group strategy is the change in the way the Board of Executive Directors approaches environmental issues for safeguarding our production in Germany in the long term. Besides the detailed explanation of the business situation, other focal points of the Supervisory Board’s activities in 2017 were the opening of the new Bethune potash mine, the future of the Sigmundshall potash mine, the implementation of financing measures and the selection of suitable candidates for appointments to the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board. ADVISING OF THE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND MONITORING OF MANAGEMENT During the 2017 financial year, the Supervisory Board diligently performed the supervisory and advisory functions incumbent on it by law and in accordance with the Articles of Association and its bylaws. Numerous matters were discussed in depth and resolutions were adopted on transactions requiring approval. We continuously monitored the Board of Executive Directors’ management of the Company and advised the Board on the governance of the Group. We were always involved in decisions of fundamental importance in a timely and appropriate manner. The Board of 1.5 SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT 15 Executive Directors regularly briefed us promptly and comprehensively on the course of business, the results of operations, financial position and net assets, the employment situation, the progress of important investment projects, planning and the further strategic development of the Company. Deviations from planning were explained to the Supervisory Board in detail. The risk situation and risk management were carefully considered. The Supervisory Board received written reports from the Board of Executive Directors in order to get prepared for meetings. Particularly, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also remained in close personal contact with the Board of Executive Directors outside of meetings and discussed significant events and upcoming decisions with it. The shareholder and employee representatives regularly discussed important agenda items at separate meetings prior to meetings of the Supervisory Board. The average attendance of the 16 Supervisory Board members at the five Supervisory Board meetings was 98 % in the reporting period. Three meetings were attended by all Supervisory Board members; two meetings were unable to be attended by one member in each case. Thus, in 2017, no Supervisory Board member attended fewer than half of the meetings. Of the four Audit Committee meetings, two were attended by all Committee members; one member was excused at each of the other two meetings. The Nomination Committee met on six occasions. Four of these meetings were attended by all Committee members and on two occasions one member was excused. Three of the five meetings of the Personnel Committee were attended by all Committee members; one member was excused at each of the other meetings. The newly created Strategy Committee met on three occasions. Two meetings were attended by all members and at one meeting one member was excused. COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE SUPERVISORY BOARD The composition of the Board of Executive Directors changed as follows: On 1 January 2017, Dr Otto Lose joined the Board of Executive Directors of K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT with responsibility for the Potash and Magnesium Products business unit as well as Waste Management and Recycling business unit. 16 1.5 SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION Norbert Steiner’s term of office ended on 11 May 2017 after 17 years in the Board of Executive Directors, including ten years as its Chairman. Mr Steiner decisively shaped K+S’s growth and success in recent years, for which we would like to formally express our gratitude once again. Dr Burkhard Lohr, the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer, took over as Chief Executive Officer from 12 May 2017. Thorsten Boeckers has held the post of CFO since this date. At its meeting on 28 November 2017, the Supervisory Board resolved to advance the implementation of the new Group strategy in the future with a reduced, restructured Board of Executive Directors, which will be supported by an Executive Committee. The reduced management team will be composed of Dr Burkhard Lohr, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, along with Chief Financial Officer Thorsten Boeckers and Mark Roberts, who holds the new position of Chief Operating Officer. Dr Thomas Nöcker (59) will enter retirement on 1 September 2018 and hand over the areas of responsibility to his colleagues in the Board of Executive Directors before his appointment expires on 31 August 2018. In light of the new corporate structure as part of SHAPING 2030, Dr Otto Lose stepped down from the Board of Executive Directors on the best possible terms with effect from 28 November 2017. The composition of the Supervisory Board changed as follows: Dr Ralf Bethke, who had acted as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT since May 2008, retired from the Supervisory Board when his appointment ended at the close of the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 10 May 2017. The members of the Supervisory Board would like to thank Dr Bethke for his excellent, invariably forward-looking management of the Board, influenced by his extensive knowledge and international experience as long-standing Chairman of the Company’s Board of Executive Directors (1991 to 2007). 1.5 SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT 17 Following the Annual General Meeting of K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, the members of the Supervisory Board elected Dr Andreas Kreimeyer (63), former member of the Board of Executive Directors and Research Executive Director of BASF SE, as the new Chairman of the Supervisory Board. The Annual General Meeting also appointed Thomas Kölbl (55), Chief Financial Officer of SÜDZUCKER AG, to the Company’s Supervisory Board. The composition of the Supervisory Board remained otherwise unchanged. SUPERVISORY BOARD MEETINGS Five ordinary Supervisory Board meetings were held during the 2017 financial year. At the ordinary meeting held on 14 March 2017, the Supervisory Board examined the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the management reports in the presence of the auditor, approved the financial statements on the recommendation of the Audit Committee and, following extensive discussions, agreed to the proposal of the Board of Executive Directors concerning the appropriation of profits for the 2016 financial year. The business situation and the outlook for the current year were discussed in depth and the proposed resolutions for the 2017 Annual General Meeting approved. We also resolved on the target quota for the percentage of women in the Board of Executive Directors. In addition, approval was given for the raising of further outside funds in the capital markets. We were briefed at length on progress at our new Bethune production site in Canada and on the plans to put the plant into operation on 2 May 2017. At the ordinary meeting on 9 May 2017, the Board of Executive Directors briefed the Supervisory Board in detail on the development of business and earnings in the first quarter of 2017, among other things.

We also set up a Strategy Committee and elected its members. Dr Ralf Bethke, who had chaired the Supervisory Board for ten years, was appointed by the Supervisory Board as its Honorary Chairman based on his extraordinary merits and his outstanding personal commitment to the development of the K+S GROUP. One of the topics we discussed in detail at the ordinary meeting on 22 August 2017 was the K+S GROUP’s new strategy, SHAPING 2030 and the reorganisation of the work of the Board of Executive Directors. In addition, we were briefed on the current situation as regards environmental issues, and the business situation of the K+S GROUP was explained to us. We also addressed the future of the Sigmundshall mine. Moreover, we were informed about the ramp-up phase of our new Bethune plant in Canada. At the last ordinary meeting of the year, held on 28 November 2017, the Board of Executive Directors explained the current business situation in the individual business units and provided a forecast of the anticipated revenues and earnings of the K+S GROUP in 2017. The planning of the K+S GROUP for 2018, including the investment and financing framework, was examined in depth (also in terms of consistency with strategic objectives) and subsequently approved. We were then briefed on the implementation status of the new strategy, SHAPING 2030. Furthermore, the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors gave us an explanation of the current environmental issues such as expansion of tailings piles or considerations for the supplementary long-distance pipeline. Following a detailed, intensive discussion, we along with the Board of Executive Directors finally approved the closure of operations at the Sigmundshall mine by 31 December 2018 at the latest. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reported on the last meeting. The Supervisory Board resolved to engage DELOITTE GMBH WIRTSCHAFTSPRÜFUNGSGESELLSCHAFT to audit the non-financial statement. We have also nominated the candidates we will propose to the 2018 Annual General Meeting. 1.5 SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT 19 The joint 2017/2018 declaration of conformity by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board was likewise approved. ‚Declaration on Corporate Governance’, page 64 COMMITTEE MEETINGS In addition to the Mediation Committee required by law, the Supervisory Board has established four more committees to support its tasks and responsibilities: the Audit Committee, the Personnel Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Strategy Committee formed at the Supervisory Board meeting following the 2017 Annual General Meeting.

The deep-well injection permit granted in December 2016 and our efficient wastewater management had a positive effect on product availability at the integrated Werra plant. By commissioning our new Bethune potash plant, we were also able to increase our sales volume compared to the previous year. In contrast, the unfavourable development of exchange rates in both business units and lower prices in the North American de-icing salt business negatively impacted revenues. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) amounted to € 576.7 million and were thus tangibly better than the previous year (2016: € 519.1 million). A non-recurring expense for recognising provisions and adjusting existing provisions for the closure of the Sigmundshall potash mine planned for 2018 was also reflected in earnings. At € − 389.8 million, the adjusted free cash flow remained negative although it improved compared to the previous year (2016: € − 776.8 million).

PROPOSED DIVIDEND FOR THE 2017 FINANCIAL YEAR Our earnings-based dividend policy is essentially reflected in a payout ratio of 40 to 50 % of adjusted Group earnings after taxes. Consequently, the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board intend to propose a dividend of € 0.35 per share (previous year: € 0.30 per share) to the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2018; this corresponds to a payout ratio of 46 % (previous year: 44 %) of the adjusted Group earnings after taxes. GENERAL STATEMENT ON THE EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT OF THE K+S GROUP The Board of Executive Directors of K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT views 2018 optimistically and expects that EBITDA of the K+S GROUP will be significantly higher than that of the previous year. In particular, the new Bethune potash plant in Canada and greater production security at the Werra site in connection with further price increases should contribute to a significant increase in earnings in the Potash and Magnesium Products business unit. This represents the tangible reward of the hard work in recent months and years. The Salt business unit had a promising start to 2018. K+S was once again able to help the local authorities and consumers around the world to guarantee road safety in winter. Demand was strong at the beginning of the year, particularly in the North American de-icing salt regions. The Board of Executive Directors also expects further growth in the non-de-icing salt business in 2018. Overall, the K+S GROUP’s adjusted free cash flow should improve significantly, even though it is expected to remain slightly negative. 116 2.7 REPORT ON EXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION 2.8 K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT (EXPLANATIONS BASED ON THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HGB)) The management report of K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT and view of the course of business can be found on pages 29 – 41 the Group management report have been combined for and 55 – 81. the 2017 financial year.

This excess return is multiplied by the average capital employed (annual average for operating assets and working capital) to give the company’s added value for the year under review. WATER-SOFTENING SALTS Water-softening salts remove hardeners such as calcium and magnesium from the water through an ion exchange process. Soft water is necessary or advantageous for numerous industrial processes, but also in private households.
