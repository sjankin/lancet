Events related to beer transactions are through its own capabilities to oﬀer customers value pricing. representative. Misleading news was reported in July 2012, suggesting that Aeon was demanding that wholesalers supply beer at prices below their cost. The fact was that beer manufacturers had abolished a system of rebates on sales of beer to wholesalers they had introduced in 2005. Then, wholesalers asked retailers to raise their prices. First of all, this price increase request resulted from a change in the way manufacturers and wholesalers did business with each other, so Aeon did not see a valid reason, such as a sharp increase in the cost of raw materials, to pass on higher prices to consumers. Committed to putting customers ﬁrst since day one, Aeon created a system for shipping products from manufacturers directly to its logistics centers. This unique system was a ﬁrst Newspaper advertisement communicating among Japan’s retailers and added to Aeon’s capabilities our refusal to accept a beer price increase to rationally reduce costs.

Tasmanian beef sold under this brand is raised without antibiotics or growth hormones, and the J-Cup Instant Ramen Launched in 1974 The oil crisis of 1973 seriously affected the retail industry as manufacturers took advantage of soaring raw material prices to raise their own product prices. JUSCO, an Aeon predecessor, lodged protests with manufacturers of instant ramen that unilaterally increased prices because it did not see a convincing rationale for the price increase. JUSCO terminated sales of those ramen products and launched its own J-Cup instant ramen product in 1974. Aeon has always believed that the social mission of the retail industry is to act on behalf of customers in purchasing products and services they need and offering them at reasonable prices, and these actions fulfilled that function.

However, understanding Aeon’s community concerns while increasing the contributions diverse business portfolio is not easy for Outside Directors. we make through greater employment of a PDCA cycle. Another priority is therefore constantly providing the Aeon Report 2017 43 Comments from the Chairperson of the Audit Committee We will solicit the valuable opinions of Outside Directors to help Aeon grow with an independent, transparent committee system. I have served as an Outside Director since 2011 and hold Aeon’s governance in high regard because the company’s committee system is purposeful and functions eﬀectively. Committee discussions including Outside Directors are Ken Sato consequential because of the meticulous, straightforward information and Outside Director support provided prior to meetings. Chairperson of Audit Committee The Audit Committee, as a completely independent organization Compensation Committee Member composed of Outside Directors, draws on information and analysis collected by the Group Audit Oﬃce to discuss and ensure that Aeon’s business activities are in accordance with the Aeon Basic Principles. Companies must be committed to their basic principles to grow, and Aeon’s Audit Committee considers them an essential component for monitoring and supervising management. The Aeon Group encompasses some 300 companies, so compliance is particularly important for sustaining growth. Cooperation with the Group Audit Oﬃce, which coordinates compliance issues, and the accounting auditor to rigorously identify and review risks is essential. To accomplish this, we ask the accounting auditor to provide useful opinions from its independent, expert perspective, accompanied by accounting audits of quarterly reports. These reports give us a multifaceted understanding of Aeon’s situation. The Aeon Group had operating revenues of more than ¥8 trillion in ﬁscal 2016 and continues to expand. With the signiﬁcant changes in the current business environment, now is the time for Aeon to embark on a new phase. This means Aeon needs to have a long-term, multifaceted perspective and fundamentally address structural change speciﬁcally. Executive Oﬃcers are responsible for day-to-day business operations and are fully committed to improving performance. The signiﬁcance of Outside Directors is that we have varying backgrounds and can make long-term proposals developed from a diﬀerent perspective. To do so, Outside Directors need more opportunities for dialogue with Executive Oﬃcers to further enhance the eﬀectiveness of Aeon’s governance. It is essential that Outside Directors share their views on Aeon’s present status, awareness of problem areas, including initiatives for the future such as globalization, and personnel development, by actively discussing Aeon from a long-term perspective. As chairperson of the Audit Committee, I will strive to create an environment that allows Outside Directors to candidly express diverse opinions and do all I can to enable meaningful discussions in a timely manner. I intend to take the initiative in contributing to the growth of Aeon. 44 Aeon Report 2017 Corporate Governance Comments from the Chairperson of the Nomination Committee I will help Aeon change and grow by using management mechanisms and addressing our critical objectives. The Nomination Committee has two responsibilities: One is to appoint new Directors; the other, to discuss selection of new Executives. Information technology will be integral to improving the visibility of the standards and mechanisms we employ when selecting new Executives and Senior Oﬃcers and addressing future Yukako Uchinaga challenges. We also need to seriously confront transparency issues so we can Outside Director consider how to enhance the framework to nurture new candidates. Chairperson of Nomination Aeon’s Board of Directors welcomes frank opinions, and functions eﬀectively as Committee a forum for exploring optimal solutions. All members of the Board are committed Audit Committee Member to Aeon and to the dynamic discussions that are required to assure it continues to improve. Encompassing some 300 companies, the Aeon Group faces a diverse array of inherent risks, making Group governance a pivotal focus. Understanding that overpowering governance strips businesses of the freedom to operate, reaching a balance is necessary, but never simple. Consistent management is paramount, so I will make information visible and available throughout the Group to enable sustainable growth and maximize the use of Aeon’s resources. I am dedicated to confronting the issues Aeon faces and applying my knowledge and experience to contribute to its sustainable growth. Comments from the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee I will ensure the best management for Aeon to help increase corporate value, including non-financial aspects. The key to corporate governance is creating the most suitable system to enhance its eﬀectiveness. In Aeon’s corporate culture, Outside Directors freely and eagerly advise Directors, who take that input seriously and reﬂect it in management. Current priorities include strengthening Group governance and creating a shared information infrastructure. Doing so entails intensive discussions that draw on Toru Nagashima Aeon’s Basic Principles and leveraging Aeon’s unique strengths from the close Outside Director Chairperson of Compensation relationships its companies and stores have with their communities. Committee The Compensation Committee decides compensation for the CEO and other Audit Committee Member Senior Executives. However, its essential role is structuring management’s approach by designing evaluation mechanisms and standards unique to Aeon. We need to add non-ﬁnancial criteria to its performance-linked criteria. Aeon’s substantial ESG initiatives represent signiﬁcant non-ﬁnancial value. Objectively evaluating intangibles as a component of corporate value, for example, is in keeping with Aeon’s management ideals. There is still much that Aeon alone can accomplish. As an Outside Director, I will work harder to promote discussion and help increase corporate value.

The Dialogue with Stakeholders for 2017 was an exchange of views on how we can spread environmentallyand socially-aware consumption behavior or “sustainable consumption,” to even more ordinary consumers, which is something we are actively addressing under the slogan “Change the future Yukiko Furuya by shopping at Aeon.” Captain, Consumer Affairs Specialist Consumer Conference for Sustainability recent years. In April 2017, we announced the “Aeon Ten years since handling of Sustainable Procurement Policy” with regard to agricultural, MSC-certified fish began particularly fishery, and livestock products as well as paper, pulp, timber and palm oil, and the Sustainable Procurement Kanamaru: Goals for 2020 as concrete action guidelines. At Aeon, some 300 Group companies operate business in 13 Kanamaru: countries. In carrying out business, we strive to practice Among these products, we led the industry commencing sustainable management with the aim of “realizing a sales in 2006 of MSC-certified products that show natural sustainable society” while solving environment and social seafood was obtained through sustainable fishing. In 2014, challenges under the Aeon Basic Principles of “Pursuing peace, we were the first retailer in Asia to sell ASC-certified respecting humanity, and contributing to local communities, products, which covers aquaculture fish. Moreover, in 2016, always with the customer’s point of view as its core.” As part of we started deploying regular sales counters called “Fish this, Aeon emphasizes above all the pursuit of sustainability in Baton” which sell only these certified fish. Incidentally, we the global community in cooperation and partnership with have two goals in seafood.

About 10 years ago, I was a fellow at SAI, the U.S. NGO that formulated SA8000. SAI, like MSC and FSC, is a constituent member of the ISEAL Alliance in the U.K. In an era when impact evaluations of social responsibility standards and labels were becoming more important, I was in charge of the impact study for SA8000 at SAI. This was an era when most people in Japan were unaware of MSC certification, but I was overcome with a strong feeling that Japan was finally getting in with the times on seeing the news that Aeon, which had already obtained SA8000, was starting to handle MSC products. I’d like to pay tribute to the persistent activities the company has developed in the 10 years since then. 60 Aeon Report 2017 Kaori Kuroda Kaori Miyake Haruko Kanamaru Executive Director, Executive Officer, General CSR Division Manager, CSO Network Japan CSR & Communication, Corporate Citizenship Department, Aeon Co., Ltd.

I think that I can give a high rating to the activities Consumer groups should actively communicate information in promoted by Aeon that enable many customers to raise their order to make consumers’ consumption sustainable in addition awareness about sustainability through their daily shopping, or to consumer protection. initiatives that popularize so-called “ethical consumption” Miyake: among consumers. Although the safety and security of products is a strong Kanamaru: consumer need, it is important to be aware that social Your high rating is appreciated. However, although we have sustainability, including safety and security, will be been working on MSC and ASC as well as developing Fish strengthened through the behavior of consumers themselves. Baton, which communicates the significance of them in a way Furuya: that is easy to understand, over the past 10 years, I really feel In fact, there is no end of misconduct that threatens the safety that the interest of our customers in sustainability and and security of life. Consequently, while issues such as safety “ethical” consumption behavior has not spread as we hoped remain important for consumers, there also is a need to strive compared with Europe and the U.S., which are leading the for the solution of long-term, social issues going forward. On way. I hope to get your opinions on the reasons around these this point, while it may be said that European and U.S. issues and the solutions. consumers are more advanced, there are also many survey results indicating that the awareness of Japanese consumers is not low. In Japan, as I mentioned previously, I think that the fact that adequate information for consumers to act is not provided is an issue. In Europe and the U.S., civic organizations, Solving social issues alongside such as consumer groups, actively communicate information “safety and security” for consumers to select products from the perspective of sustainability. As a result, boycott campaigns as well as the Furuya: “buycott” movement to actively purchase products and There seem to be several reasons why sustainable services from the perspective of sustainability have taken off consumption is not quite taking off. One reason is that the among consumers. issues of safety and security, which are important for Kuroda: consumers, are not regarded as issues of the sustainable Undoubtedly, civic organizations in Europe and the U.S do not society. Secondly, the information for social and global only make demands to government for stricter safety standards sustainable behavior is not adequately communicated to but also actively communicate the environmental and social consumers. In other words, the communication of information issues that arise in the supply chain to corporations and Aeon Report 2017 61 Feature 1 Dialogue with Stakeholders consumers.

I’d like to hear your waste and then sustainable consumption behavior with an opinions. impact throughout the supply chain came about from Kuroda: consumers’ ideas about what they should do. Firstly, speaking of government, as Ms. Kanamaru has said, I Furuya: think it is extremely positive that the Japanese government has In Japan, the Consumer Affairs Agency is at the center of efforts brought achievement of the SDGs to the fore. Going forward, I to develop a “Consumer Citizen Society” based on the Act on am also expecting that “sustainable procurement” will increase Promotion of Consumer Education established in 2012, but it between the companies involved ahead of the 2020 Tokyo cannot be said to have been developed sufficiently yet. The Act Olympic and Paralympic Games. In addition, as I touched on in defines a Consumer Citizen Society as one in which “consumers the example of Europe and the U.S. earlier, I think that it is actively commit themselves to the creation of a just and important that NPOs and NGOs not only ensure product safety sustainable society with an awareness of how their own and security but also take a good look at corporate supply consumption behavior could influence social and economic chains and speak out. Recently, many companies have made trends both at home and abroad, and the global environment some kind of statement about sustainability, but I believe that at present as well as over future generations,” which refers to a it is also vital to fulfill the checking function that has become truly sustainable society. customary in Europe and the U.S., including properly checking Kanamaru: such statements in addition to monitoring and reporting. How Although I don’t have any disagreement with that, to be frank, do we respond to risks? Climate change is a major risk, but the wording “Consumer Citizen Society” gives the impression initiatives aimed at mitigation and adaptation will also be of being rather difficult to understand and of something that is business opportunities. remote from sustainability. Kanamaru: Furuya: What about corporations? As I said at the beginning of our I certainly think that there is a significant issue with the discussion, we are focusing on “Changing the future by wording. However, I do think that it is important that while shopping at Aeon” while constantly increasing our handling of following Japanese law, we practice initiatives to build a MSC and ASC certification as well as full-cycle aquaculture tuna, sustainable society from a global perspective. organic products and Fairtrade products, but I also feel Kanamaru: frustrated that we have only been able to communicate its Definitely, in Japan and overseas, significance to some customers. the Japanese government is Furuya: currently stressing its stance on This is an initiative that takes advantage of “solving issues in working to achieve a sustainable partnership with customers,” which is a unique characteristic of society in a partnership between the retail industry, and I would like you to strengthen it. the public and private sectors, However, the problem is with how much it communicates, and which includes the establishment the “Please buy this product because it is good for the of the SDGs Promotion environment and society” approach often seen at Japanese Headquarters. companies does not pave the way to communicating the issue And though it is not necessarily for to customers and getting them to take action. that reason, we are also trying to Kanamaru: make the connection between the Because people certainly aren’t suddenly motivated to buy activities we have been working on even if certified products are lined up in front of them. to date and the SDGs clearer. Miyake: Furuya: To stop that happening, we explained what kind of I think that there is also questioning of how consumer groups environmental and social issues there are at point-of-purchase will promote SDGs throughout society together with efforts and other places in ways that are easy to understand, but we aimed at a Consumer Citizen Society. might need to check again whether it really is easy to understand. Furuya: To make sure that it does not end up as a discussion of the faraway world, the company communicating the information needs the kind of narratives and strategies that make people really feel that society will change through their own 62 Aeon Report 2017 consumption behavior. Also, if the information provided people who are particular about the place of origin. However, includes how much of a result the behavior produces, it can rather than repudiating such consumers, I think it is important bring about quite a lot of change. expand from there toward the perspective of sustainable Kuroda: consumption. For example, I think that it would be a positive The fact that everyday shopping and global sustainability are thing if there was a campaign that draws on the interest of not connected is a matter of course for ordinary consumers, so consumers who have a strong focus on place of origin to point it is a chance to show off how you can get them to use their out that it is also important to look at what the problems are in imaginations. Incidentally, I saw in Aeon Sustainability Report the present process. What do you think about sending the that more than 200 Ministop stores use 100% FSC® Japan message that it is important to check whether consumption is certified lumber. I think that it would be effective if you sustainable, including human rights, the working environment, informed people about this more actively through easy-toenvironmental impact, and the problem of the food selfunderstand communication in stores and other places, sufficiency rate in the case of Japan, at the same time as quality including why FSC certification is an issue that involves the such as safety and security while looking over the process as a global forest problem and Japan’s forestry industry. whole, or, in other words, the supply chain? Kanamaru: Miyake: As you point out, we are currently promoting instore displays Focusing on the supply chain to emphasize the diverse that try to appeal in a way that is easier-to-understand. perspectives of sustainability seems like a very effective method. That’s really helpful. Promoting awareness of “process (supply chain)” rather than place of origin Importance of collaboration between information providers Kanamaru: This might be changing our discussion a bit, but there was just Furuya: talk of domestically produced lumber so I will bring it up. I feel In terms of focusing on the supply there are Japanese consumers who are particular about chain, I talked about the domestically produced products due to an excessive focus on communication of information by safety and security. Domestically produced lumber is good NPOs and NGOs in Europe and the because it leads to the sustained growth of the domestic U.S. a little earlier, but the same forestry industry, but, for example, as organic food which has applies to scientists, the media, and obtained JAS organic certification is not always domestically educators. produced, there has been some surprise about Aeon’s organic Kuroda: food being produced overseas. There is not only the aspect The media also takes up supply chain that organic is safe food that is good for health in the first place, issues quite a bit and actively reports but it also includes the perspective of sustainability in terms of ratings of corporate CSR activities. In maintaining the ecosystem, particularly in fields. However, we addition, consumer groups have not been able to get that much interest so far. collaborate actively with NPOs and Kuroda: NGOs to develop consumer citizen education, which is quite Only the values of safety and security have been emphasized. different from my impression in Japan. Therefore, the impression that such products are probably Miyake: domestically produced tends to occur. I think that if you are What are the differences in terms of education? Do you know, aware of the reality that the food self-sufficiency rate is about Ms. Furuya? 40% on a calorie base, you can imagine to some extent that Furuya: there are more overseas produced foods, but this “awareness” In consumer education, I have the impression that knowledge has not been well established. and countermeasures on important issues are emphasized in Kanamaru: Japan. However, overseas, there is an effort to cultivate a There are also people who only see the safety and security perspective of solving long-term global problems through a aspect of domestically produced products with the expression sequential narrative that starts with the world food situation, “local production for local consumption,” and I feel that they and, within that, asks where the food you eat comes from, what are losing sight of the environmental and social sustainability kind of problems there are with it, what kind of life you want in aspects in terms of increasing the food self-sufficiency rate the future, and what kind of consumption style is suitable to through the revitalization of the regional economy and local achieve it. In addition, there is active research to promote agriculture, forestry and fisheries industries. sustainable consumption by consumers not only by Furuya: The safety and security orientation of Japanese people universities, but also by civic organizations, including consumer is strongly entrenched, and it is a fact that there are many groups, and corporations among others particularly in Europe Aeon Report 2017 63 Feature 1 Dialogue with Stakeholders and the U.S. What about Aeon conducting research on say about it, the criticism ends up being a generalization, so if sustainable consumption as well? you have any hints for solving this, I’d like to hear your opinion. Kanamaru: Furuya: There are some points in common with our previous discussion Aeon participates actively in the efforts of relevant government about focusing on the supply chain overall to raise the agencies and ministries and business organizations. The awareness of consumers. company also collaborates with local governments and Kuroda: interacts with elementary and junior high schools. I don’t think As with consumer education, I think that a comprehensive that such things can be done by a single department alone. I perspective for the topic of communicating information that think that there is a hint in the question of why you can do it. In we discussed before is important. In Europe and the U.S., the other words, it is because senior management sends a strong various sectors like government, NPOs, NGOs, corporations, message. Therefore, I think that there is an organizational research institutions, and educational institutions each work on atmosphere in which there is repeated dialogue aimed at a the problem of sustainability in a well-balanced way. In that single goal even between departments and organizations with sense, Aeon has provided opportunities for environmental conflicting interests. What I sensed when taking part in a education for elementary and junior high school students with certain corporate event in London this February is that senior the Cheers Club, and I thought it was a very positive initiative management of companies anywhere which focus on to see the company promoting activities in collaboration with sustainability send out strong messages, and each department external organizations. collaborates internally and externally in accordance with its Kanamaru: respective role. I wonder whether Aeon is like that. At the moment, there are approximately 450 clubs around Miyake: Japan, and about 7,800 children have taken part, and in We certainly might be. Our President Motoya Okada is pretty discussing the current topic, I was thinking that since they are at clear about sustainability. “Going global” as he says. The elementary and junior high school for nine years, it is important concept is that it is natural to promote our business based on for them to learn about the overall picture of environmental global standards as Aeon’s customers are global. While many and social issues as a continuum rather than individual points. Japanese companies are hesitant about whether they can be Kuroda: assertive in the face of a lack of evidence or troublesome What I would also like to emphasize is coordination of interests with stakeholders, Aeon has a “collaboration.” Overseas, people with reputation for implementing sustainability-related activities different backgrounds such as due to the clear stance of senior management, and such clarity managers, researchers, labor unions, is much appreciated on the ground. Of course, it is difficult to NPOs, and NGOs, started having send messages about every challenge in management, but our discussions around the same table approach to sustainability is consistent. and coming up with new things in Kuroda: the 1990s. GRI and SAI were these An extremely interesting point is what motivated Aeon to initiate kinds of groups, which at the time these kinds of activities. For example, Marks and Spencer, a British were called multi-stakeholder retail business, is one of the leading companies in sustainability. initiatives. It has been said that Japan But I heard that in the past it faced various problems, and it was is not good at forming horizontal improved in some sense through the process of responding relationships between people from individually to much criticism from NGOs and others, and the different groups, but I think that awareness of senior management also changed. multi-stakeholder frameworks have been increasing over the Miyake: past few years. The occurrence of problems as a trigger for the process of deepening awareness is pretty much the same at Aeon. In fact, around 2000, the consumption of whales in Japan was considered a problem, and Group companies in the U.S. faced boycotts. There was a typical protest movement involving Declaration of intent by senior pickets and so on. At the time, we thought that it would blow management and dialogue stimulate over after a while, but President Okada understood the CSR activities situation and visited himself to start direct talks with NGOs. It was unprecedented in terms of corporate risk management, Miyake: but I heard that he himself had strong intentions. For a full two I think that the lack of collaboration between organizations in years after that, I also happened to be in the action team and Japanese initiatives is very much a problem because Japanese often took the time to visit NGOs and talk with them. To be companies and NPOs are vertically separated from each other honest, my feeling at the time was that it should be left alone and, each of the organizations in and of themselves are because it is Japanese culture. But Mr. Okada’s policy was to vertically organized. Because of this, they cannot draw on talk together anyway, so through this the other side also diverse opinions that include outsiders. However, if that’s all we listened to us, and it became a constructive discussion in which 64 Aeon Report 2017 we made suggestions about what to do. smalland medium-sized enterprises to acquire international Furuya: certification are high. In public procurement, a gradually So a discussion in which repeated dialogue produced results. increasing number of local governments seem to be adopting Miyake: and supporting a so-called comprehensive evaluation system Yes. It was the trigger for the formulation of the Aeon Supplier in which for example they provide incentives and add points to CoC in 2003, and our endorsement of the Global Compact in environmentally-friendly enterprises, so I think it is a positive 2004, leading to the acquisition of SA8000. In addition, the thing for Aeon to try to revitalize local industry from such a NGO groups still visit Japan several times a year to exchange comprehensive perspective. opinions while discussing what we can do together. Also, Furuya: based on the experience of that time, I think that a corporate With regards to sustainable consumption, which is today’s culture has been fostered in which dealing with stakeholders theme, environmental issues have been familiar to the young such as NPOs and NGOs properly promotes growth. Of course, generation born between the 1980s and 2000s, the so-called rather than just accepting anything, we divide up what we can millennials since they were born, so they are quite interested. and cannot do as a company and make decisions on things we Also, these people have an affection for the area where they will address straightaway and things we will consider over the were born and raised, and are a generation with a strong medium-to-long term. entrepreneurial spirit. Therefore, I think you should increase the Kuroda: handling of local produce and so-called social products involving Listening to you speaking, I was thinking that there is a point these young local managers and actively stress its appeal to that ties in with this. This point is what a change there has been implement activities that connect the company’s sustainability in the relationships between corporations and NPOs and NGOs. initiatives with sustainable consumption by consumers. It is well-known that there was a large-scale boycott campaign Miyake: around 1997 about child labor and forced labor at Thank you for your opinions. Today, manufacturing subcontractors for U.S. firm Nike. NPOs and we heard a discussion on the theme NGOs had pointed out issues while going on the offensive of sustainable consumption from a against companies, launching boycott campaigns and variety of perspectives such as what opposition campaigns in the past. At many groups, this incident reasons are hindering its spread and was an opportunity to reaffirm that our ultimate goal was not to what we should do to promote it. As strike at corporations, but to create an environmentally-friendly part of this, the points about how we society without human rights abuses, and we began ongoing should communicate information as dialogues with corporations. This is exactly what our current a retail business with customer discussion is, and we will look for solutions while building up connections, the points to stress as a dialogue over several years. And if there are things wrong in the narrative for customers, and the supply chain, we will solve them together. Such relationships points about emphasizing the effects started happening from 2000 onward, and I was thinking that of sustainable consumption are very this fits in with our current discussion. useful, and I would like to consider them with sales departments straightaway. Going forward, Aeon will continue to promote initiatives with an awareness of sustainability from a global perspective in each region based on all of your opinions. We would like to continue hearing your opinions in Fostering the next generation, including the future. Thank you very much for today. a local perspective Miyake: So let me bring up our final discussion. Some people say of our initiatives that we can do them because we are a big company. Earlier, I mentioned “global standards” as a statement of Mr. Okada, but global standards are by no means always fulfilled. For example, rather than not partnering with local agricultural producers who have not acquired GLOBAL G.A.P. certification, we promoted food artisan activities to emphasize the distinctive local food culture nationwide. We call this movement “global management” at Aeon, and I would like to hear your opinion on this direction. Kuroda: I think that it should be rightly commended as an initiative that is uniquely characteristic of a retail business rooted in the community. On the other hand, it is a fact that the hurdles for Aeon Report 2017 65 Feature 2 Promotion of CSR in the Value Chain Expansion of people and Raw Material environment-friendly TOPVALU Gurinai Procurement into three product lines.

Additionally, I hope that Aeon more strongly showcases the appeal of Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Certification, etc. in stores. Since these are locations where many consumers congregate, I hope that Aeon makes its stores more than simply places for connecting buyers and sellers, but places for thinking together about sustainability. Hidemi Tomita Senior Project Principal, Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited The retail industry is the key to the targets of SDG’s Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. I would like Aeon to show how it is making efforts at each level of its value chain by carrying Fairtrade, organic, and other products. In particular, society notices Aeon’s use of lumber that is domestically produced, Forest Stewardship Council certified, etc., and fish that is Marine Stewardship Council certified. I hope that promoting ethical consumption through these types of activities will be a driving force for achieving the targets of SDG #12.

In addition, each store carries out cleaning and weeding of its “Aeon Hometown Forests Program” planting zone based on the management manual, primarily on Aeon Day on the 11th of each month. In 2016, marking the 25th anniversary of Aeon’s tree planting activities, the cumulative total number of trees planted stood at 11,441,925*.

The aim is to minimize the impact of our stores on the surrounding environment and ecosystem. Examples of these initiatives include the Aeon Hometown Forests Program and installing biotopes at some of our shopping centers. As part of the store biodiversity assessment, “Creature symbiosis office® certification (Urban/SC version)” has been acquired since FY 2013 through the “Association for Business Innovation in harmony with Nature and Community” (ABINC). In FY 2016, one shopping center “Aeon Mall Nagakute” obtained certification, and “Aeon Mall Toin” obtained its threeyearly renewal of certification. In addition, “Aeon Mall Tamadaira Forest” received the ABINC Special Award (Urban SC category) in October 2016. Biotope Biotope introduced on some store premises and rooftops helps in environmental education and raising awareness about environmental protection. Rain GardenTM Rain water is contaminated with substances contained in exhaust gas and risks disrupting the ecosystem if it flows directly into the rivers and sea. The Rain GardenTM reduces the negative impact on the ecosystem by allowing rain water to penetrate into the ground and purifying it.
