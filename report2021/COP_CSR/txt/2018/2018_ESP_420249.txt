Our mission is to help our customers to measure and control both noise & vibration. We do this by designing and manufacturing systems that are extremely easy to use, but which do not compromise on power & functionality. Our activities are centered mainly on the development and manufacture of precision microphones and acoustic instruments and software applications for all of them, which makes them more powerful and competitive in the national and international market. CESVA is certified according to the requirements of ISO 9001:2008 for the design, manufacture, distribution and sale of instruments for the measurement and control of noise The concept of quality is fundamental in our business philosophy, since one of our priorities is its continuous search and what creates added value for our customers. We want the future to sound great. We hope to achieve this by offering quality instruments to sound professionals, to enable them to perform measurement & assessment of noise & vibration in the most efficient way possible. We want to help them achieve this whilst meeting & surpassing the technical levels required by the regulations of wherever they are used. UN Global Compact | Communication on Progress 2018 | page 5 We focus on research and development to create new products, improve quality and maintain competitiveness in the market. Currently CESVA has its own R & D that absorbs 70% of company resources. We like to listen and identify the needs of our customers to create a relationship of mutual trust. We design and manufacture equipment that meet their needs and comply with the requirements of the latest standard in the market. Our ongoing commitment to research and development has enabled us to obtain several patents of acoustic instrumentation and being pioneer in the design of equipment with single measurement range and with simultaneous measurement of all functions, using Bluetooth on sound insulation measures or being the first company in Spain to obtain the pattern approval of a sound level meter. We sit on several committees, both Spanish and International, for the creation and revision of regulations and standards, allowing us to have a global and updated vision of the latest industry requirements. This global reach, together with a foresighted commercial strategy, has led to our range of products becoming a point of reference in the field of precision instrumentation for sound level measurement. UN Global Compact | Communication on Progress 2018 | page 6 GENERAL MANAGER’S STATEMENT OF SUPPORT This year, 2018, CESVA decided ten years ago to join the United Nations Global Compact with the objective of promoting sustainable development in the areas of human rights and business, labor standards, the environment and the fight against corruption in business activities. Being part of the Global Compact has helped us focus our actions on CSR and not leave aside any of the four strategic areas, however obvious they may appear. The communications on progress are for us a date indicated in the annual calendar to take stock of how the principles of the Global Compact have been reflected in our business strategy, culture and daily operations. The COP of CESVA instruments for the period August 2017August 2018 reflects our corporate DNA oriented to the sustainable generation of economic value and social contribution in terms of CSR, as well as respect for human rights, the quality of working conditions within our company and businesses we operate, the rejection of any act of corruption and the protection of the environment, especially in the field most closely linked to our business area: noise pollution. We have also devoted a large part of our efforts to disseminating and transmitting the smart cities philosophy, so that the future of many cities is socially, environmentally and economically more sustainable. Finally and especially in this tenth anniversary, we are also committed to sharing this information with our stakeholders through our main communication channels.

ECOTIC Foundation manages the WEEE (collection and recycling of electrical and electronic devices at the end of their lifespan) of its affiliated enterprises through its Integrated Management System (IMS). The mission of ECOTIC Foundation is not only to conveniently recycle the wastes that are generated by its affiliates after the use of these devices, but also to do it in the most efficient and economically feasible way, so that the system is environmentally and economically sustainable to guarantee its durability. We are equally committed to our support for environmental protection, especially in the field most closely related to our business: noise pollution. We have also devoted much of our efforts to disseminating and transmitting the philosophy of smart cities, so that the future of UN Global Compact | Communication on Progress 2018 | page 12 many cities is socially, environmentally and economically more sustainable. Results The results achieved applying the 3R policies are positive. CESVA is listed in the National Register of Industrial Establishments producing Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE).
