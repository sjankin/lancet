ANNUAL REPORT 2018 (For the year ended March 31, 2018) About OKI OKI Group Values The OKI Group Action Principles we enacted in September 2016 give formal expression to values shared by all OKI Group executives and employees. Amid large changes in the business environment, we seek to embed these principles as extensively as we can into our practices with the commitments expressed in the OKI Group Charter of Corporate Conduct and the OKI Group Code of Conduct as the cornerstones of our corporate activities. We seek to realize our corporate philosophy by striving to embody our vision. Corporate Philosophy The people of OKI, true to the company’s “enterprising spirit,” are committed to creating superior network solutions and providing excellent information and communications services globally to meet the diversified needs of communities worldwide in the information age. Vision The OKI Group helps create a safe and convenient infrastructure for customers and society as a whole through the key Japanese concepts of “Mono-zukuri” and “Koto-zukuri.” *Mono-zukuri: to have the spirit and mind-set to innovate, create and improve products *Koto-zukuri: to work together, proactively seeking opportunities that deliver value to customers Action Principles Act with integrity Challenge and drive change Perform with speed and agility Be passionate, and determined to succeed Proactively encourage excellence as “Team OKI” OKI Group Charter of Corporate Conduct/ OKI Group Code of Conduct OKI Group Charter of Corporate Conduct CSR activities OKI Group must accomplish based on its corporate philosophy OKI Group Code of Conduct Codes of conduct executives and employees must conform to in accordance to OKI Group Charter of Corporate Conduct 1 Annual Report 2018 Profile Founded in 1881, Meikosha, Ltd. was the forerunner of today’s OKI and Japan’s first telecommunications equipment manufacturer. Meikosha’s success came from the company’s “enterprising spirit” to attempt to become the first domestic manufacturer of telephones only five years after Alexander Graham Bell’s invention of the telephone in 1876. Underpinned by this “enterprising spirit,” which has been nurtured and passed down throughout the Company’s long history, OKI has developed and provided a succession of products that have contributed to the development of today’s information society. Always in the vanguard of technology innovation, OKI began selling computers containing Japan’s first domestically developed core memories, developed the world’s first cash recycling automated teller machine (ATM) that recycles deposited bills as funds for withdrawals, developed LED printers, and introduced the first Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) system to the Japanese market. As a company that supports social infrastructural development, OKI will quickly grasp and incorporate the needs of the market into the development of products that satisfy customers, while contributing to the development of an information society. Guided by its brand statement, “Open up your dreams,” OKI will diligently strive to achieve the dreams and hopes of stakeholders, to become the preferred global partner of choice and achieve continuous growth.

OKI Electric Cable’s Production Line Capable of Manufacturing Super-long FPCs Powered by the sun’s rays, a giant solar sail unfolds and begins navigating space. OKI Electric Cable (OEC)’s FPC was selected by the JAXA for use on the solar-powered sail of its Small Solar Power Sail Demonstrator “IKAROS” launched in May 2010. While FPCs are usually around 500mm long, OEC’s industry-leading production line is capable of manufacturing super-long FPCs up to 100m in length. A 14-meter FPC attached to the sail serves as the wiring, connecting the solar cells and various sensors on the thin-film face of the IKAROS, which unfolded to form a giant square sail when it reached outer space. The IKAROS was the world’s first demonstration of interplanetary space travel powered solely by the sun’s radiation, and it continues to navigate space after having completed all of its scheduled and additional missions. This shows that OEC’s FPCs are used not only in everyday electronic devices such as mobile phones and digital cameras, but they can also play a part in aerospace equipment by being able to withstand the harsh environment Small Solar Power Sail Demonstrator “IKAROS” of space.

In employing AI, it developed a proprietary system to simulate on-site operation at the plant and incorporated the “reinforcement learning” method made famous by the AI program AlphaGo, which was developed to play the board game Go. As a result, we were able to dramatically shorten the learning period down to about five minutes with AI, instead of more than two years, which is how long it would take if learning was to be acquired from actual robot operation. We achieved this by having the AI itself learn from narrowing down optimal choices by analyzing large swathes of data. As a result of having the AI-driven robot repeatedly perform tasks on a daily basis with the aim of shortening the time required to complete such tasks, we recorded some significant results, including a roughly 15% reduction in total working time compared to a human worker.

For many years at IHI Corporation I was involved in manufacturing in the aerospace business where I gained experience in planning technological and production strategies, including new products and new businesses, as well as plant location and relocation. Later on, I took charge of companywide strategies for new businesses, procurement, and manufacturing. Considering that OKI was founded in 1881 and IHI in 1853, both companies have a long history of contributing to Japan’s industrialization and modernization. While the industrial segments they operate in may differ, they share many similarities as manufacturers. Moreover, OKI’s vision of being a company that helps create a safe and convenient infrastructure for customers and society as a whole through the key Japanese concepts of “Mono-zukuri” and “Koto-zukuri” is something I can identify with given its similarity to IHI’s vision. Based on these many common points and similarities, I hope for OKI to utilize my accumulated experience and knowledge of corporate governance and I myself hope to do my utmost to contribute even in the slightest. OKI boasts many competitive products and systems in the growth field of Director information and telecommunications. The “connected society,” “connected Tamotsu Saito lifestyles,” and “connected manufacturing” visions promoted by OKI go hand-in-hand with the building of sustainable society and I hope to contribute somewhat as a member of the Board to these Company activities. In June of this year the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s Corporate Governance Code was revised for the first time. The amended version strongly reflects the idea of shifting corporate governance away from formality to something of substance. I have spent many years researching corporate law with a focus on the Companies Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. One of my main research topics is legislation related to corporate governance based on comparative law studies of the UK and the US. The decision to employ a Board of Directors’ structure in which the majority of members are highly independent outside directors says to me that OKI has a strong commitment to strengthening governance. As a member of OKI’s Board of Directors, my first objective is to focus on accumulating information about the Company’s businesses and hopefully contribute to the increased enhancement of corporate governance by leveraging the knowledge and experience I have honed as an expert in the field of corporate law. And given Director a flurry of corporate scandals coming to light at leading Japanese manufacIzumi Kawashima turers, I will do everything possible to ensure that the supervision functions of the Board are working adequately with the aim of bolstering and enhancing OKI’s compliance structure and internal control systems.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 1) Matters concerning the status of financial instruments (1) Policy on financial products Regarding the fund management of the Group, it is based on short-term deposits and highly secure securities. Regarding fund procurement, it is the policy to procure funds through borrowing from financial institutions and corporate bonds. Derivatives are used to avoid the risks described below, and it is the policy not to conduct speculative transactions. (2) Details of financial products and their risks and risk management system Credit risk of customers related to trade notes and accounts receivable is managed by conducting credit investigation of business partners in accordance with rules and regulations on accounts receivable management etc. of each company, and we strive to reliably collect trade receivables. Regarding borrowings, short-term borrowings are primarily fund procurement related to working capital, and long-term debt are financing related to working capital and capital investment. Some of these borrowings have variable interest rates and they are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuation, but they are hedged by derivative transactions (interest rate swap transactions). Derivative transactions are forward exchange contracts and currency swap transactions intended to hedge the foreign exchange risk associated with receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and interest rate swap transactions intended to hedge the risk of fluctuation in interest payment on borrowings. Since the method for evaluating the effectiveness of hedging in interest rate swaps meets the requirements for special treatment, the assessment of effectiveness is omitted with that judgment. The execution and management of derivative transactions are carried out in accordance with internal regulations. (3) Supplementary explanation on matters concerning fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, if available. When there is no quoted market price available, the fair value is determined based on reasonable estimates. Since various assumptions and factors are reflected in estimating the fair value, different assumptions and factors could result in different fair value. In addition, the notional amounts of derivatives in 2. Disclosure concerning fair value of financial instruments are not indicative of the actual market risk involved in derivative transactions. 2) Disclosure concerning fair value of financial instruments As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, the amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, fair value, and the amount of differences are as shown in the table below. Any item whose fair value is deemed extremely difficult to assess is excluded from the table.

Annual Report 2018 50 DATA SECTION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes: 1. Disclosure concerning methods of calculation of fair value of financial instruments, securities and derivative transactions. Assets (1) Cash and deposits and (2) Notes and accounts receivable These items are settled over a short period of time and their fair value is virtually equal to their book value. Hence, their fair value is determined to be equal to their book value. (3) Investments in securities The fair value of investments in securities is based on their prices determined at the financial instruments exchanges, and the fair value of bonds is based on the quotations offered by the correspondent financial institution as of the balance sheet date. (4) Long-term trade receivables Fair value of long-term trade receivables is determined by deducting the present estimated doubtful receivables from the book value as estimated doubtful receivables are calculated based on the present value of loans / receivables. Liabilities (1) Notes and accounts payable, (2) Short-term borrowings, (3) Account payable, other and (4) Other accrued expenses These items are settled over a short period of time and their fair value is virtually equal to their book value. Hence, their fair value is determined to be equal to their book value. (5) Long-term debt The fair value is based primarily on the method of calculation whereby the sum of principal and interest is discounted by an assumed interest rate based on rates currently available to the Company for similar transactions. Some long-term debt with floating interest rates are prescribed to be subject to special accounting treatment applicable to interest rate swaps (see below). Hence, the fair value of a long-term debt is based on the method of calculation whereby the sum of principal and interest, treated in combination with the said interest rate swap, is discounted by an assumed interest rate based on rates currently available to the Company for similar transactions. Derivative transactions Described in Note12 2. Financial instruments whose fair value is considered extremely difficult to assess Unlisted equity securities at of March 31, 2018 and 2017, are not included in (3) Investments in securities because they have no market price and it is deemed extremely difficult to assess their fair values.

The figure is calculated from the actual stock prices for the period 12.5 years (from February, 2005 to August, 2017). 2. Because accumulation of data is insufficient and reasonable estimation is difficult, this is estimated on the assumption that it will be exercised at the midpoint of the subscription rights exercise period. 3. This figure is a simple average of actual dividend for the most recent two periods. This is after the consolidation of shares executed on October 1, 2016. 4. The yield of government bond is accordance with estimated residual period. 5) The method of estimating the number of stock options vested Fundamentally, only the actual number of cancelled stock options is shown as it is difficult to estimate the possible number of cancelled stock options.
