The organic waste can be used to make products such as compost. The shredded substrate slabs, blocks and plugs are recycled into raw material in a low-energy process for various manufacturing processes like brick, cement, potting compost or soil improver production. Some of this raw material is turned into stone wool briquettes and used in the ROCKWOOL factory to create new stone wool products. The plastic wrapping used for Grodan products is turned into plastic granulate and used in the plastics industry to manufacture refuse bags. This re-use of resources from end–of-life products not only diverts waste from landfill, but also reduces the consumption of new raw materials, thereby reducing our impact on the environment.
