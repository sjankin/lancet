CASTELLUM ANNUAL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT 19 Market, customers and regions Welcome to Castellum. We are one of Sweden’s largest real estate companies, with local presence in cities from Copenhagen in the south to Sundsvall up north. Every day, we strive to be a landlord that exceeds the wishes and expectations of our customers. We know that business operations are carried out between people. In dialogue with customers, we create customized solutions that increase well-being, efficiency, profitability and job satisfaction. This requires perceptiveness and short decision-making processes, which Castellum’s flat organization makes possible. This way – and by always putting people first – we promote growth in cities, in d­ evelopment areas and for our tenants. 20 CASTELLUM ANNUAL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS' REPORT MARKET, CUSTOMERS AND REGIONS Market comments Swedish and Danish economies Danish GDP growth is also developing well.

In this context, it is a competitive advantage to own building rights in attractive locations with local zoning plans already in place – as this implies the shortest possible lead-time until customers can occupy the premises. At year-end, Castellum had approximately 864 thousand sq.m. of unutilized building rights (leasable area). A number of these include finalized project plans which can be launched relatively promptly. During the year, Castellum made several major potential projects public, and these are summarized on the following pages. The projects are characterized by being situated in attractive development areas, in combination with Castellum’s clear sustainability focus. Torsgatan 26 in Stockholm In spring 2017, Castellum acquired Stockholm Vatten’s former headquarters, situated on Torsgatan 26 in central Stockholm. The property was designed by ­Ferdinand Boberg in the early 20th century and has a leasable area of 13,000 sq.m., with estimated opportunities for new building rights. In 2018, Castellum will renovate stage 1, comprising approximately 9,000 sq.m., into modern premises and access is planned during 2019. The idea is to preserve the building’s historical and unique impression, while adding the modern technology associated with versatile and sustainable premises. Castellum already owns some of the neighbouring properties to Torsgatan 26 and sees great development potential in the area. Castellum’s Torsgatan plan is to join Stockholm City and other property owners in creating a lively mixed-use neighbourhood in an attractive and central location. CASTELLUM ANNUAL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT 47 Cont. Building rights and potential projects Söderstaden in the Globen area, Stockholm At year end, it was announced that Castellum had won the City of Stockholm’s land allocation competition for Söderstaden, a major development area south of Stockholm’s city centre. The city development project is one of Castellum’s largest and has been taken Unutilized building rights on by a consortium including Wallenstam AB and Åke Sundvall AB. The project includes are valued at SEKm 1,508 (1,530) a total of approx. 100,000 sq.m., and Castellum’s 30,000 sq.m. share will comprise commercial properties, such as office space, hotels and restaurants.

The opportunity to contribute to developing an entire new city district in one of Stockholm’s most exciting areas – featuring major arenas, a subway line and proximity to Södermalm – of course constitutes a very thrilling project for Castellum. 48 CASTELLUM ANNUAL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT INVESTMENTS Kungspassagen in Uppsala Castellum is planning to construct Kungspassagen, comprising 7,500 sq.m. of leasable space, in one of the best locations in Uppsala, close to both the Travel Centre and an entire city’s range of restaurants, services and shopping facilities. At the moment the building is pre-leased to 35%. The office building will be built according to the Miljöbyggnad environmental classification system (Gold level), which includes solar cells, green electricity and carbon-neutral district heating. In addition to tailor-made office solutions, Kungspassagen will also provide a roof garden with outdoor offices, access to changing rooms with showers, a bicycle storage room and charging posts for electric cars. Mölndalsvägen in Mölndal, south of Gothenburg In 2017, Castellum acquired an office building-right with completed zoneplanning in the city district of Krok­slätt in Gothenburg – an exciting district consisting of several beautiful early 20th-century brick factory buildings. Castellum conducted an architectural competition for the design of a new office building of approx. 7,500 sq.m, and Wingårdh Arkitektkontor was appointed winner with the following motivation: “Wingårdh’s presents an exciting and dynamic brick facade design that ties in with the area. The design of the house creates warmth and openness in a city environment, and the entrance level becomes a natural meeting place for both the public and for our tenants in the building.” Projecting is currently underway for the new building whose facade design and floor plans must meet the certification criteria for Miljöbyggnad level Gold.

At Castellum we are actively working with ecosystem services together with our tenants. We evaluate ecosystem services in connection with new construction and larger projects. Pollination, natural water regulation and nature experiences are some examples. Hence, we are extra proud of our beekeeping in the Kopparlund area of Västerås. Beekeeping efforts are carried out in collaboration with Bee Urban and a local beekeeper, and this year, plantations with flowers that are particularly good for our bees have also been established in the area. The plants are in bloom for most of the season. So, in addition to beautifying the area, our plantations contribute to the bees being able to pollinate for a much longer period. And the honey? Well, naturally, we distribute it to our tenants in Kopparlunden.

For finance operation purposes, it is ensure risk management through close control. therefore important to reflect and support the goals Castellum’s finance strategy can be summarized and requirements of the business operations. With in five cornerstones: diversification, liquidity, the support of the finance policy, the Group can strength, transparency and flexibility. CASTELLUM’S FIVE CORNERSTONES ABOUT FUNDING DIVERSIFICATON Castellum will oversee a diversified loan portfolio and avoid dependence on both individual counterparty and source of financing. In addition, the maturity of various kinds of funding sources and individual loans will be distributed over time. Castellum will monitor and follow developments on financial markets, enabling us to act quickly and to match business requirements. At year end, Castellum’s interest-bearing financing amounted to SEK 38.0 billion, of which SEK 22.2 billion came from capital market financing (an MTN-program totalling SEK 14.2 billion and a commercial paper program totalling SEK 8.0 billion) corresponding to 58%. Remaining financing came from bank financing from major Nordic banks and credit institutes. At year end, the average maturity of credit agreements amounted to 2.7 years and ranged from 1 month to 24.0 years. LIQUIDITY Castellum will keep unutilized credit facilities available, in order to respond rapidly to business needs and opportunities that arise. Moreover, there will be revolving credit facilities for the purpose of reducing the need to invest the surplus. At year end, Castellum had SEK 57.2 billion in credit agreements, of which SEK 19.2 billion was unutilized. STRENGTH The Group’s financial key ratios will be strong, with a loan-to-value ratio not exceeding 55% and an interest coverage ratio of at least 200%. The strength of our real estate portfolio is enhanced by the quality of our cash flow as well as by the composition of our debt and interest rate portfolio. Castellum is to reduce the risk of sudden negative impact on net financial items – resulting from interest rate changes and/or the assessment of Castellum as borrower – that cannot be adjusted by opposing effects on income related to business operations. The loan-to-value ratio was 47% at year end, while the interest coverage ratio for 2017 was 386%. TRANSPARENCY Castellum will encourage long-term relationships with both banks and other lenders/investors and aim to be transparent in order to increase stakeholder understanding of the Group’s operations and, consequently, credit exposure. FLEXIBILITY Castellum is to have flexible financing for the purpose of supporting business developments regarding acquisitions, sales and project development. Our credit facilities will provide us with high flexibility to withdraw and repay with short notice and at no extra cost. Furthermore, Castellum is to have access to flexibility, both in terms of pricing (fixed and floating) and maturities. At year end, Castellum had SEK 35.1 billion in bank agreements, of which SEK 24.9 billion consisted of revolving credit facilities.

CASTELLUM ANNUAL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT 81 Property valuation Castellum determines property value using internal valuations based on a 10-year cash-ﬂow model with individual assessments for each property. This approach reflects both future earnings capacity and required market yield. In order to provide further assurance and validation of the valuation, 177 proper­ties – representing 53% of the value of the portfolio – have been assessed e­ xternally in 2017. In all, Castellum’s property portfolio was valued to SEKm 81,078, corresponding to SEK 18,268/ sq.m. The average valuation yield for Castel­lum’s real estate portfolio – excluding development projects, undeveloped land and building rights – can be calculated to 5.5%. 82 CASTELLUM ANNUAL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT PROPERTY VALUATION Property valuation Internal valuation Assumptions in Castellum’s internal valuations Castellum records the investment properties at Office/retail Warehouse/logistics fair value and has made an internal valuation of all Cash flow year 1 properties as of December 31, 2017.

In times of urbanization, technology-driven changes in customer behavior, and new business models, we – as Castellum’s Board of Directors – have the responsibility to inspire management and other employees to a high pace of business where we see change as a possibility. The real estate industry is by definition local. Compared with most other products and services in the business world, it has historically been protected by barriers to entry, a traditional view on s­ upply and product, and international competition.

number of the financial measures presented by Castellum are not defined in accordance with the IFRS accounting standards. However, the company believes that these measures provide useful supplementary information to both investors and Castellum management, as they facilitate evaluation of company performance. It is to be noted that, since not all companies calculate financial measurements in the same manner, these are not always comparable to measurements used by other companies. Hence, these financial measures should not be seen as a substitute for measures defined according to the IFRS. Unless otherwise stated, the table below presents measures, along with their reconciliation, which are not defined according to the IFRS. Definitions for these measures appear on the page 175. Jan – Dec 2017 Jan – Dec 2016 Average number of shares, thousand (related to financial key ratios) * 273,201 234,540 Outstanding number of shares, thousand (related to balance sheet ratios) * 273,201 273,201 *) The number of historical shares that have been recalculated with reference to the bonus-issue element (i.e. the value of the subscription right) in the completed new share issue, and utilized in all ratio calculations for SEK-per-share. The conversion factor is 1.15. INCOME FROM PROPERTY MANAGEMENT Castellum’s operations are focused on cash-flow growth from ongoing management operations – i.e. income growth from property management – the prime yearly objective being a 10% increase in property management income. Income from property management also forms the basis of the annual shareholder dividend: at least 50% of property-management income. Income from property management is calculated before paid tax, as well as after the theoretical tax that Castellum would have paid on income from property management, had there been no loss carryforwards.

Based on this equity, Castellum wants to create return and growth at a low level of risk. Net asset value can be calculated both long and short term. Long-term net asset value is based on the balance sheet, with adjustments for items that will not lead to any short-term payment. In Castellum’s case, these would include such things as goodwill, derivatives and deferred tax liability. Actual net asset value is equity according to the balance sheet, adjusted for the market value of the deferred tax liability.

Further, assessments have been made that tax loss carry forwards are realized in 2 years with a nominal tax of 22%, giving a present value of deferred tax liability of 21%, and that the properties are realized in 50 years where 33% are sold directly with a nominal tax of 22% and that 67% are sold indirect through company disposals where the buyers tax discount is 11%, which gives a present value of deferred tax liability of 8%. 114 CASTELLUM ANNUAL ÅRSREDOVISNING REPORT 2017 2015DIRECTORS’ REPORT QUARTERLY AND MULTI-YEAR SUMMARY FINANCIAL RISK Castellum’s strategy is to own, develop and manage properties at low financial risk.
