Alongside protecting the ecological basis for life on our planet, increasing attention is being paid to social issues. Following the Policy Statement on Human Rights adopted by the Executive Board in 2016, we took further steps in 2017 to underpin our obligation as a responsible company. They include integrating aspects of human rights into our supplier validation process and drawing up a global human rights risk map. We are also delighted by the confidence shown in Evonik by our recent election to the Steering Committee of the German Global Compact network. CHRISTIAN KULLMANN THOMAS WESSEL Chairman of the Executive Board Chief Human Resources Officer The numerous awards we received in 2017 for the progress made in our sustainability work and the associated reporting, our excellent performance in the relevant ratings and rankings, and, above all, the trust we experience in our daily collaboration within and beyond the company all strengthen our resolve to continue systematically along the path we have chosen. We also want to be best-in-class in sustainability. That is our promise. And we will continue to work towards that goal in 2018 with full commitment and the necessary courage to innovate. 4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 EVONIK INDUSTRIES The creative Living better with Evonik power of We do quite a lot to make things better. specialty chemicals What exactly?

That was a dramatic watershed in the fight against international corruption. However, fighting corruption is still a challenge, especially in a global context. That has recently been demonstrated painfully by the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers. We still need systematic change. And globalized markets mean that change can only be achieved through effective and constructive collaboration between politics, businesses, and civil society. But companies have done lot to fight corruption in ­recent years. Why is that not enough? It’s true that many companies have made a big contribution, for example, by introducing codes of conduct, training, and whistleblower systems. And they are often victims when they are sidelined by competitors that use corrupt practices.

Energy efficiency and efficient use of resources have increased almost everywhere in the world in the past 30 years, but that has been more than offset by economic and population growth. Today, we drive more efficient automobiles and live in insulated rooms—but we drive more autos, heavier autos, and live in larger apartments. So what can be done? In my view, the increase in energy and resource ­efficiency should be combined with putting a price on CO2. Pricing CO2 would channel investment and energy efficiency in the right direction.

Complying with REACH and CLP gives a company a better insight to the risks of their substances. This not only enables them to manage the risks and communicate correspondingly to customers—both a longer-term market advantage—it also gives the company better planning security as the uncertainties related to regularity action are reduced. These advantages are valid for EU-acting companies but the more so for globally acting companies. Can EU-REACH legislation serve as a blueprint for chemicals regulation around the world? Yes, of course! All chemicals legislation designed to date has strong similarities with parts of REACH or CLP.

As a result, there are people who have not left the house for years ­because of their disability. We want to put an end to such isolation. How can greater social integration be encouraged? It is important to enable such people to work. Poultry farming is an example. We have built a number of facilities in rural areas where people with disabilities care for the poultry and manage egg production. Through their work, they provide eggs and poultry for the village and are better accepted by the community. Why should companies play a role in society?

Following the devastation caused by hurricanes on the coast of Texas and Florida in fall 2017, Evonik partnered with the American Red Cross and promised to double every dollar donated by Evonik employees to the relief work. This resulted in a total donation of more than US$90,000. The fire service at our production site in Shanghai Chemical Industry Park in China offers training for voluntary fire brigades in neighboring communities. In Japan, many employees from Nippon Aerosil, a joint venture of Evonik and Mitsubishi Materials, cleared trash from the river banks as part of the Suzuka River Clean-Up Event. The arts Evonik fosters diversity in society through a wide range of cultural projects. In 2017, we continued our traditional support for the Ruhr Festival in Recklinghausen, the Küppersmühle museum in Duisburg, Villa Schöningen in Potsdam, the Nibelungen Festival in Worms, and the intonations chamber music festival in Berlin. In addition, we continued the partnership established in the previous year with Thomas Hengelbrock and the Balthasar-Neumann choir and ensemble. We also supported the lit.RUHR literature festival in Essen for the first time. Sport In the spirit of good neighborly relations, Evonik promotes sport at many of its sites around the world. As part of the celebrations to mark the tenth anniversary of the “Evonik” corporate brand, more than 1,000 children of employees around the world were able to attend training sessions run by the BVB club’s Evonik soccer school.
