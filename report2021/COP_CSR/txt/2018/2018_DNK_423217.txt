To maintain and develop this position, we are convinced it is a prerequisite to conduct our business in a responsible manner – “Doing Business the Right Way – the sustainable way”. However, we must admit our principles are under pressure from competitors NOT doing business the right way, which will not let us change our focus on what we believe is the right long-term strategy. It is important to stress that our CSR strategy and business values are not a project that starts and ends, but an ongoing willingness to improve our sustainable business model. Stig Maasbøl Group CEO “Doing Business the Right Way” and focus on sustainability can ScanCom International A/S go hand in hand with improved operational performances and profitability, as our 2017/18 results are showing. ScanCom’s approach to doing business the right way was recognized in late 2014 when securing the “CSR Abroad Prize”, an award established by Denmark’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and this provided great encouragement to continue our CSR strategy. Sustainability for materials, products, and operations To create and offer sustainable products, ScanCom controls all materials and products in order to meet all relevant regulations in our markets. For the wood used in our products, ScanCom was a pioneer in using FSC certified hardwood, and today we use 100% FSC hardwood. At the same time, we continuously optimize our operating activities to reduce consumption of energy and resources, increase recycling, and reduce emissions. Our main operation site in Vietnam is operated under ISO 14001 certificate. Social accountability It is important for ScanCom to assure respect for human and labour rights. Key features of this are: BSCI monitoring of all operations in Vietnam since 2008, SA 8000 certificates for the operations in Brazil (2012) and Indonesia (2001), and having our own Code of Conduct. OHSAS 18001 certification for health and safety management was obtained for the Vietnamese operation in 2014. Being signatory to the UN Global Compact, in addition to BSCI, SMETA monitoring and certifications, sends a clear signal to all stakeholders that we are committed to doing business the right way and supports our activities in terms of meeting the CSR requirements of our global customers. Requirements for contract manufacturers and key suppliers Built into the BSCI CoC, SA 8000, and UN Global Compact are requirements for the improvement of CSR level in the supply chain. ScanCom actively practises this by performing CSR audits at key suppliers and contract manufacturers and requesting them to sign our Code of Conduct, and targets are set for continuous improvement in terms of that policy. UN Global Compact commitment I am very pleased that ScanCom, even under the difficult market conditions, has been able to remain true to its basic CSR values and to make progress, or at least maintained the same high level, in all 10 of the UN Global Compact principles. For the future, ScanCom will continue to further develop commitment to the UN Global Compact – “Doing Business the Right Way” will remain part of our DNA. It is important for me to highlight that in ScanCom CSR is not a project that starts and ends, but a strategy integrated in daily business and in our business plan. 5 ScanCom International A/S Legal Structure Finance figures The finance figures for ScanCom International A/S are presented below: Key figures (DDK million): 2017/18 2016/17 2015/16 2014/15 2013/14 Income Statement: Revenue 911.3 886.1 898.1 880.8 672.2 EBITDA 51.7 45.3 47.3 32.6 21.2 Profit/loss on ordinary operating activities 31.5 19.6 22.8 10.3 6.7 Financial income and expenses, net -12.8 -12.0 -9.0 5.1 -12.6 Profit/loss on ordinary activities before tax 18.7 7.6 13.8 15.4 -5.9 Tax on profit/loss -6.2 -4.4 -7.3 -5.2 0.1 Net Profit/loss for the year 12.5 3.3 6.5 10.1 -5.8 Balance: Balance sheet total 599.3 538.3 564.9 593.8 506.1 Purchases of property, plant, 35.9 22.8 31.2 35.0 20.2 and equipment, gross Current Assets 435.6 392.6 393.5 427.3 357.9 Equity 160.0 154.0 156.1 152.7 150.3 Short-term debt 398.1 377.6 401.3 432.8 301.3 Employees: Average number of emloyees 3,598 3,144 3,459 3,932 4,415 6 ScanCom International A/S Performance indicators and objectives For season 17/18 ScanCom selected the performance indicators given below and set related objectives.

Human rights ScanCom International A/S is committed to influencing our employees and business partners to respect the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For several years ScanCom has had its own, annually updated Code of Conduct for employees and business partners. It can be seen in full on our website: http://www.scancom.net ScanCom used the BSCI, SMETA, ICS monitoring system to ensure that its contract manufacturers, as a minimum, comply with basic human rights and local regulations pertaining to labour conditions. Besides, for season 2017/18 ScanCom verified social compliance for 27 contract manufacturers and used 25 contract manufacturers, all of which were registered on the BSCI platform and audited completely. 9 ScanCom International A/S BSCI monitoring of Contract Manufacturers Contract manufacturers SS 16/17 SS 17/18 Production site registered on BSCI audit platform 27 25 Total number of BSCI audits, initial and re-audit 25 25 Total number of ScanCom Code of Conduct audits 27 25 BSCI compliance rating SS 16/17 SS 17/18 A (Outstanding) 3/27 0/25 B (Good) 1/27 0/25 C (Acceptable) 22/27 25/25 D (Improvement needed) 1/27 0/25 E (Non-Compliant) 0/27 0/25 ScanCom continued to increase collaboration with more contract manufacturers and their production sites were registered on BSCI, in order to meet the new code of BSCI requirements and to ensure implementation.

All suppliers signed ScanCom’s Code of Conduct. 100% of new suppliers, where relevant, were subject to an onsite CSR audit conducted by ScanCom. In general, the top level management of suppliers is integral to developments in this area, as the awareness and commitment of suppliers is improved due to the allocation of resources and time in order to make improvements. Child labor and forced labor During the past season, as with those previous, ScanCom maintained regular audits of contract manufacturers together with customer audits, BSCI and SMETA audits. Again for this season we can report that no cases of child labour or forced labour were recorded.

ScanCom was affected by this for several years and actively addressed the problem by creating incentives for employees to stay. These have taken the form of an improvement in working conditions and the provision of a range of benefits: supporting the children of employees, providing a transportation allowance, and assistance with house rental. Specifically, to meet legal requirements, in the previous year we installed an air cooling system to reduce temperatures at most production areas which had a high temperature. The focus on making it attractive to stay with ScanCom was continued throughout season 17/18 and seems to have had a positive impact. The employee turnover rate for SCVN was increased a little bit from 49% in season 16/17 to 50% in season 17/18, and although this figure may still be considered high, it meets absolutely the objective for this parameter. Related to this area, it is worth noting that the headcount was significantly increased in 17/18 due to increase orders, containers export. SCIN In terms of labor turnover for season 17/18, the employee turnover rate for SCIN was increased from 5.7% in season 16/17 to 7.8% in season 17/18. SCBR The labour turnover of SCBR saw significant variation from the previous year due to high movement at the Rio Grande do Sul “Minas do Leão” site, which was adjusting its staffing.

Besides; ScanCom Brazil with average overtime 2017-2018 little bit increased since there is additional holiday from government related to general election. Wages and benefits SCVN the legal minimum wage is frequently adjusted 6% in Jan 2018, and ScanCom has always compensated employees at a significantly higher level, applying principles for actual living costs rather than the minimum wage. In season 17/18 the lowest wage level for ScanCom workers was around 28% higher than the legal minimum. Furthermore, ScanCom continued the policy of an extra 2.5 % health and social and unemployment insurance for workers compared to the legal requirement. SCIN pays contract workers at a rate of minimum wages level as decided by government and all permanent employees are paid at (minimum 12.8%) higher level than regulation (minimum wages), depending on position and responsibility. SCBR pays wages based on an agreement with the Union and the wage pattern of the local area. SCBR salaries were at least 28% above the national regulation, which is a positive factor in terms of the retention of staff. Discrimination ScanCom continuously enforces its policy of not accepting any kind of employment discrimination of the workforce due to gender, age, or origin. 15 ScanCom International A/S Age distribution of employees. (Numbers are per end of season) The low median age of ScanCom’s employees reflects the age distribution in the population of the countries where manufacturing takes place. Furthermore the official retirement ages are relatively low with 55/60, 55/55, 60/65 years for women/ men in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Brazil respectively.

Differences in the above figures are related to different kinds of jobs. The variation also occurred due to the adjustment of the staff in general terms. Older company employees have been disconnected from higher salaries, directly impacting on the average. Reduce the average wages of all levels, motivated by the reduction of the currency exchange rate of the Minas do Leão/RS, and also by the variation of the dollar. 17 ScanCom International A/S Health and safety OHSAS 18001 To build a strong culture to prevent accidents, incidents and work related illness is important at all level of The ScanCom. Everyone should go home healthy from work and doing the right thing by protecting your workers’ health. During season 17/18 SCVN received annual audit OHSAS 18001:2007 for the occupational health and safety management system – the result was a very positive pass. In relation to the OHSAS 18001 regulations, SCVN has now fully implemented standards associated with firefighting and safety regulations and customer requirement related to health and safety.

Root cause the some of the increases due to a higher percentage of new workers in a growth environment. Therefore, our management will focus and improve in season 18/19 to reduce, we target those sectors and activities with the most serious risks and where the risks are least well-controlled and significant improvements will need to be made, probably related to the implementation of a safety training programme to enhance awareness within the workplace and an associated action plan. SCIN SCIN trains all new employees in health and safety, including evacuation and fire drill and this is repeated twice a year for employees. SCIN also give general training to give information related to health and safety such as first aid training, safety riding motorbike, HIV-AIDS, insurance, etc. For new worker supervisor gives training about machinery and quality of product. 18 ScanCom International A/S SCBR During this period, there was a reduction in personnel, reflecting the closure of the Minas do Leão /RS unit and adjustments at the Telemaco Borba/PR Unit. There was also a reduction in sick leave, motivated by prevention campaigns proportioned by Scancom (note: vaccination against Influenza A1n1); About accidents, there has been an increase, all slight accidents, which by the activity we are exposed. Consequently increasing the number of days of work lost. In addition to all absences including maternity leave, we also had an increase over the previous year. Under our analysis, it is controlled. Because of the greater number of accidents in the period, the attendance rate per employee also increased. We continue with policies to prevent and control accidents. As for training in matters related to work safety, we maintained an average for the Telemaco Borba unit, which is lower than in the previous year due to a reduction in the number of employees Environment SCVN’s environmental management system, upgraded completely with new version the requirements of ISO 14001:2015 and audited with a good result. Besides, applied sustainability program indluce GreenSteps with reducing hazardous material, waste, saving energy, good REACH solutions prevent pollution. Materials used, recycling, and waste Data Over the preceding years ScanCom has worked towards an improvement in the collection of reliable data and this has now reached a satisfactory level.

SCVN As an improvement in sustainability recycling, resource use, we continue to look for alternative solutions that will result in a more positive impact on the environment, continually attempting to increase the recycling of materials – mainly in SCVN. New methods for recycling wood and plastic composite furniture have resulted in increased recycling figures. Total electrical energy was reduced because we: applied an energy management system and made use of the energy monitoring data from sub-meters; installed LED lighting at all production sites and offices. We aim to continue this control when new machines are installed in future. SCIN Electrical energy consumption 2017-2018 is 3.8% lower than 2016-2017 but the amount is not so significant. Water: water consumption is for employee toilet purpose only and this is lower than 2016-2017 since lower in total employee. Sawn timber and industrial waste are lower. SCBR In the latter period, a SCBR deactivated its unit in the city of Minas do Leão/RS. In this way, we have had a reduction of the numerous in relation to a last session.
