In order to respond to the challenges presented by the digitalisation of marketing, Alma ­Media has systematically enhanced the digital competencies of its media sales and marketing organisation in recent years and developed its advertising systems. The aim of these investments is to ensure that Alma ­Media will maintain its position as a competent and high-quality digital marketing partner and a competitive media advertising network, as well as provide advertisers and consumer customers with a safe and productive advertising environment. Alma ­Media’s most significant marketing development investments in 2017 were allocated to advertising and data management technology. The Group’s Finnish units deployed a new joint advertising distribution system that, among other things, provides more effective tools for identifying malicious advertising. At the same time, a new project was started to replace the customer data management platform.

The risk management process identifies and controls the risks, 87 YEAR 2017 OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND STRATEGY BUSINESS SEGMENTS CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE develops appropriate risk management methods and regularly reports on risk issues to the risk management organisation and the Board of Directors. Risk management is part of Alma Media’s internal control function and thereby part of good corporate governance. The most critical strategic risks for Alma Media are a significant drop in its print newspaper readership and a decrease in the online audience of digital media, a permanent decline in advertising sales and a significant increase in distribution and delivery costs. The group subscriptions of the major financial and technology-related magazines are significant in scale. Changes to the subscription agreements could have a substantial impact on the magazines’ total subscription volumes. The media industry is undergoing changes following the transformation in media consumption and technological development. Alma Media’s strategic objective is to meet this challenge by developing digital products and services for consumers and businesses. Fluctuating economic cycles are reflected in the development of advertising sales. Advertising sales account for approximately half of the Group’s revenue. Business operations outside Finland, such as in Eastern and Central European countries, include country-specific risks relating to market development and economic growth. The expansion of business outside Finland has reduced the risks inherent in operating in one market area. The most important operational risks are disturbances in information technology and data transfer, as well as an interruption of the printing operations.

The Group’s management has considered these components of the financial statements to be the most relevant in this regard, as they involve the most complicated accounting policies from the Group’s perspective and their application requires the most extensive application of significant estimates and assumptions—for example, in the valuation of assets. In addition, the effects of potential changes to the assumptions and estimates used in these components of the financial statements are estimated to be the largest. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets in conjunction with business combinations is based on the management’s estimate of the cash flows related to the assets in question. The determination of the fair value of liabilities related to contingent considerations arising from business combinations are based on the management’s estimate. The key variables in the change in fair value of contingent considerations are estimates of future operating profit. Impairment tests: The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life for impairment annually and reviews any indications of impairment in the manner described above. The amounts recoverable from cash-generating units are recognised based on calculations of their fair value. The preparation of these calculations requires the use of estimates. The estimates and assumptions used to test major goodwill items for impairment, and the sensitivity of changes in these factors with respect to goodwill testing is described in more detail in the note which specifies goodwill. Useful lives: Estimating useful lives used to calculate depreciation and amortisation also requires management to estimate the useful lives of these assets. The useful lives used for each type of asset are listed above under Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets. Other estimates: Other management estimates relate mainly to other assets, such as the current nature of receivables and capitalised R&D costs, to tax risks, to determining pension obligations and to the utilisation of tax assets against future taxable income. 101 YEAR 2017 OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND STRATEGY BUSINESS SEGMENTS CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Segment and operating profit 1.1 Information by segment Alma Media’s reportable segments are Alma Markets, Alma Talent, Alma News & Life the E-kontakti business was transferred from Group advertising revenue to Group and Alma Regions.
