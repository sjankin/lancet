E Establish a new sustainable product for each month of the year, favouring local suppliers where possible. F Create relationship with local charity. Due to the change in CSR management structure in 20152016, the 2015 objectives a, b and e were not monitored. Also, objectives set for 2017 and 2018 (b and e) are flawed as they do not have specific absolute or intensity based target, timescale and key performance indicators.

To address labour policies, reduce labour risks and respond to labour violations HR Corporate has: • conducted employment legal risks assessments in Seychelles, UK, France, Brazil and Antigua • received support from professional experts, labour law lawyers, to understand local practices, anticipate and assess risk, assess current ligation and deploy labour law strategy as aligned with business strategy • trained and coached local HR Leaders • organised internal meeting with General Manager and/or Executive Committee Members • distributed an opinion survey (annually distributed with action plan follow up) • held Health & Safety Committee meetings in operations based in France, Germany and Brazil • held internal meetings with the participant of all team members: Direct Line Meeting or General Assembly or Town Hall meetings and Department Meetings. If a property incurs an incident of violation of Labour principles it will inform Work Council and/or Union to conduct an internal inquiry. If needed an employee representative will attend the inquiry interviews. Work Council and/or Union will be presented with a written report of incident findings. A disciplinary process will apply following the evaluation of the incident, with possible termination of employee contract. HR Corporate will analyse and assess the incident with support and consultation of experts, labour law lawyers, resulting with the implementation of immediate actions.

However, in 2018 more specific objectives and monitoring systems will be put in place to track 2017 objective. HR Corporate has set the following 2018 objectives to continue striving towards Commitment 1 of Oetker Collection CSR Strategy: • Implement a common HR software called Talent Soft to monitor employee data • Continued compliance with local laws and regulations • Decrease in employment risks • No litigation unless we have a very strong court case • Reinforce team member welfare understanding and assessing the local living conditions • Lead by our company values.

Control our consumption and protect our environment 13.2 Environmental Monitoring In 2015 Oetker Collection commenced monitoring and evaluating its environmental resource consumption through Con-Serve™ data management system. 2.1. Through innovation reduce our resource consumption. 2.2. Understand, protect and restore the biodiversity that surrounds us. 2.3. Apply waste regulations and strive to limit any type of pollution. 13.1 Organization Overview Environmental goals are integrated in the overall Oetker Collection CSR Strategy; therefore the group has not developed a separate environmental policy. Environmental commitments are addressed through Oetker Collection CSR Standards, as all standards directly or indirectly relate to the environment. Group CSR Team is responsible for the development and implementation of environmental actions at group level with the CEO overseeing its implementation. At property level CSR Patrons, Property CSR Teams, General Managers and Facility Managers are responsible to incentivize and implement environmental initiatives. Also the latter are the first point of contact when employees, guests and suppliers at property level have concerns with regards to hotel or company environmental performance. Group suppliers and partners can contact Group Purchasing Team, Management Team and CSR Team for company environmental enquiries. OHMC Executive Committee and executive staff is adjourned on all CSR and environmental related activities during the annual Oetker Collection summit. During the summit the group exchanges Oetker Collection overall goals and incentives, which are ultimately aligned to the CSR Strategy.
