RISK MANAGEMENT Identifying and managing risks and opportunities are an integral part of the Group’s business processes. Borregaard has established a risk assessment and management system. Each member of the Group Executive Management is responsible for internal control and risk assessment within their respective areas. The risk assessment is presented to the Board for annual review.

This is explained Borregaard has engaged an independent third party, Østfold SUSTAINABILITY AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 9 Research, to conduct a life cycle analysis (LCA) in accordance In 2017, Borregaard recognised NOK 85 million (66 million) with the ISO 14044/48 standard. This involves analysing all in the form of public funding for ongoing research projects, environmental and resource-related impacts of Borregaard’s mainly from the EU Horizon 20209 programme, the Research products from cradle to factory gate. The study was first carried Council of Norway and Innovation Norway. In addition, out in 2008 and has since been updated several times, most Borregaard has received other grants from both the Norwegian recently in 2015. This analysis confirms that the environmental Government and the European Union. and climate footprint of Borregaard’s products has decreased over time. KEY INITIATIVES AND RESULTS IN 2017 Borregaard’s sustainability profile has been strengthened In 2016, the environmental performance of Borregaard’s during 2017 by reductions in most types of emissions and by products relative to competing products was studied by further development of new biorefinery products. In 2016, Østfold Research. All comparisons encompass a number of Borregaard finalised an investment in a facility for the environmental impact categories.

During 2017, Borregaard initiated an upgrade of the bioethanol plant and a facility to capture and store biogas. Borregaard’s research and innovation efforts in 2017 amounted This was completed in early 2018. As a result, there will be to NOK 200 million (250 million)8, or 4.3% of the company’s sufficient capacity to deliver the whole bioethanol production revenues.
