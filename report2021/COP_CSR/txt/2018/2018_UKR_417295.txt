It has been a global negative trend for many years. Therefore, maintenance of the environment is an important aspect of our responsibility to the society, which is clearly expressed in the principles and approaches reflected in the Policy of the Organization. We are not dealing with harmful production of finished products and do not cause significant harm to the environment, for the implementation of our environmental policy, we identify threats and risks that may cause environmental damage in the supply chain. Environmental risk management is part of the functioning of the Organization's operational life safety management system is built on the principle of balance between minimizing environmental impact and ensuring production processes, taking into account the requirements of current national and international environmental legislation, recommendations and requirements of international initiatives and standards, including the Constitution of Ukraine, the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, SDGs, ISO 14001.

Efficient conditions for operating on the territory of Ukraine are the basis for the prevention of corruption. Trade facilitation can streamline economic activity. Trade facilitation process is mostly related to customs procedures, and one of the major barriers impeding the international trade is goods clearance at the border of Ukraine. PLASKE JSC realizes today the fight against corruption is a top-priority challenge for our nation. Along with government authorities fighting against corruption, promoting transparent and ethical business practices, the business community plays an important role in building a transparent global economy. Following the UNECE Recommendations No 33, 34 and 35 PLASKE JSC jointly with Odessa Commercial Sea Port initiated a project for the introduction of the Single Window Local Solution technology in the Southern Customs and the ports of the Odessa Region in 2012. The project was aimed at preventing corruption and promoting deregulation, limiting bureaucratic procedures, ensuring the security of the supply chain, standardizing and digitalizing international trade procedures in the context of Ukraine's integration into European and world markets. The project envisaged the creation of a unified information system of the port community in the ports of the Odessa region (Pic. 31). This Port Community System (ISPS) accumulates, verifies, processes, stores, exchanges and transmits electronically information and documents for border, customs and other control authorities. It allows registration of persons, vehicles, goods, including cargo and luggage. This system complies with the legislation on electronic documents and takes into account the Single Window concept in international practice and the recommendations of international organizations in the use of electronic records and digital signatures. Pic. 31. Visualization of interaction between Port Community System users 49 / 62 An Interagency Working Group was established to coordinate and monitor the progress and to determine the direction of its implementation. It consists of the representatives of government authorities, law enforcement agencies, business associations and 02 03 organizations, traders and transporters. To make it transparent the singlewindow.org website was created. Transparency Access-friendly It reports on the ISPS and the Interagency Working Group activities covering the relevant seminars. This website is available to all the stakeholders and transporters interested in the project concept, project regulations, meeting minutes, newsletters and statistics on the use of ISPS by freight forwarders in the ports of Ukraine.

For us, the introduction of the CIM/SMGS consignment note as a single transport document for combined transport involving rail mode was a milestone. PLASKE JSC took an active part in this process. In March 2017 ISPS was launched at the ferry terminal of the port of Chornomorsk (test run mode).

The Stakeholders receive all the necessary knowledge to operate in ISPS. In 2017, within the framework of the annual International Transport Week in Odessa, the Seventh International Trade Facilitation Seminar National Single Window and Data Harmonization in Ukraine was held. The speakers are leading experts in this field. The major topics of the seminar were: progress achieved in the implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement in Ukraine and the data harmonization; creation of a nation-wide Single Window; prospects for using the Port Community Information System (Single Window) implemented in the Odessa Port as a hub for international trade and transport corridors in the country. PLASKE JSC actively participates in the work of UN/CEFACT. The successful result of this activity was the development of a new UNECE Recommendation No. 36 on the integration of national data centers for the implementation of the Single Window systems adopted in 2017. Photo Gallery: 7th UNECE International Trade Facilitation Seminar, June 2017, Odessa. 52 / 62 UNECE continues to provide Ukraine with advisory services and technical assistance for the Port Community System, which should become the prototype of the nation-wide Single Window. According to the Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine, the introduction of the Single Window concept made it possible to increase goods traffic through the ports of Ukraine in 2017 by 15%. The project Single Window Local Solution was included in the UN reports, under the heading Regional Advisory Services. Single Window mechanism in countries with economies in transition for the two times, as a positive example. The UNECE also continues to support other trade facilitation and Single Window projects in Uzbekistan, Albania, Armenia and Azerbaijan. At the same time, Ukraine is one of the locomotives in this process. Currently, the UNECE, together with the working group and the Government of Ukraine, is working on the national strategy for trade facilitation in our country. The project's main achievement is the realization of the main objective, namely, the exchange of legally significant information between business entities that operate in seaports and state regulatory bodies, the data exchange between government agencies during control operations and law enforcement functions, analyzing the existing information for statistical purposes, taxation, anti-corruption and illegal movement of goods across borders of Ukraine. 53 / 62 Bilateral, general working meetings and Pic. 33.
