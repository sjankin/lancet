Environmental statement update 2018 Update of the consolidated 2017– 2019 environmental statement Sustainability has been a core theme in our company and for the development of Wilkhahn office furniture for three decades. The supervisory board’s resolution in 1989 that if in doubt ecology and social responsibility were to be valued more highly than a fast profit is just as relevant today as it was then. Wilkhahn’s overarching goal of sustainability management was and is to make customers all over the world enthusiastic about superbly designed office furniture and useful innovations and services. Therefore, Wilkhahn office furniture is produced for maxiWilkhahn is an owner-managed mid-sized enterprise and mum fitness for purpose and with resources consumed in encouraging social welfare aspects in its dealings with the process kept to a minimum.

Reduce – “less is more” is more than just a design principle to us, it means: • we reduce the materials used to make handling easier and to protect resources; • we use energy in manufacturing efficiently, for example by drawing on a combined heat and power plant and heat recovery in manufacturing; • we reduce emissions, by utilising solar power, climate-neutral energy sources (cutting (CO2) and varnishing techniques that are low in solvents. 3. Recover– “Reuse + Recycle” In this case, the goal is to continue to use the whole product or parts of it and recycle it at the end: • Because the products are modular, expendable parts can be exchanged and features added or retrofitted (e.g. armrest types, covers, cushions, surfaces). • Connecting points in the product can be dismantled for easy repair. • Where possible, we use pure materials that are marked as such, making them ideal for recycling. 3 Sustainability goals and sustainability performance.

This is a decline of 3% compared with the previous year. Table top manufacturing was responsible for approx. 3.5 tonnes of VOC and chair upholstery for 3.3 tonnes of VOC. Therefore, the statutory emissions threshold of 15 tonnes of VOC per year was complied with as regards ­varnishing and gluing in 2017 too. Due to the low quantities no negative environmental impact is to be expected. Wilkhahn has stringent health and safety measures in place to protect its workforce. The purpose of regular workspace assessments is to prevent or cut risks due to organisational, technical and personal protective measures. Powerful extraction systems in the workspaces ensure that no harmful ­solvent concentrations can occur.

At 26%, cardboard packaging accounts for the second biggest share of residues. In terms of quantity, at 17% mixed municipal waste takes third place. At 43 tonnes, a lot more hazardous waste was produced in 2017 than in the previous year. Its relative proportion in terms of total waste doubled to 8% (2016: 4%). The cause was the breakdown of an evaporator in the powder coater that’s normally used to condense aqueous waste from the precleaning process. Which is why large quantities of waste water with a lower concentration of pollutants occurred in Since 2017, Wilkhahn has been increasingly choosing reusable packaging and December 2017. By replacing faulty components and shorttherefore cutting resource consumption. ening the evaporator’s maintenance intervals, the quantity of hazardous waste will probably stabilise at under 4% of the total quantity of waste from 2018 onwards. The proportion of residues that can be recycled was at a pleasingly high level last year. In total, it was possible to recycle 93.5% of waste in terms of the materials or heat occurring from production and offices.
