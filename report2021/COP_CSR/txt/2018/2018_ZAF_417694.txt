In addition, as a Group, we remain a signatory to the Equator Principles and the CEO Water Mandate and we continue to support the UNEP FI Positive Impact Working Group. These commitments, along with deliberate focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), form an important part of our overall strategy as we align our core business to deliver on our purpose – to use our financial expertise for the good of individuals, families, businesses and society. The SDGs represent a powerful lens to identify opportunities for business innovation and growth, and they define the ‘good’ in our purpose. As such, in 2017 we began to reorient our approach to focus on the most material SDG targets through our three main points of leverage – Products and Services: Sustainable Development Finance, Operations and Partnerships (including CSI). We are proud to support the work undertaken by the UNGC, cognisant of the important role that the private sector plays in this.

This will result in OML, immediately after the implementation of unbundling, having a 19,9% strategic minority shareholding in Nedbank Group. The unbundling will occur at an appropriate time and in an orderly manner, after the listing of OML and allowing suitable time for the transition of the OML shareholder register to an investor base with an SA and emerging-market focus and mandate.

We aspire to be the most admired financial services provider in Africa by our staff, clients, shareholders, regulators and society. The banking system is critical to driving investment and economic growth, channelling capital from savers to those who can use it productively. Vassi Naidoo Chairman 2017 was difficult for SA, principally because business international roadshow and dismissed, a great deal of found itself at odds with some of our political leaders. that social capital was obliterated.

Last the ANC in December 2017 and subsequently as President year, though, I lost that faith. of SA, the good news is that we have seen a remarkable There were several issues that contributed to this. After turnaround in confidence and the willingness of key the dismissal of Nhlanhla Nene as Finance Minister in late groups in our society to pull together. In his State of the 2015 (subsequently reappointed in February 2018) there Nation Address (SONA) to Parliament on 16 February were significant concerns among business leaders about 2018, President Ramaphosa emphasised partnerships the impact on international and domestic confidence. and called on business to work with government, I remember attending the World Economic Forum in organised labour and civil society. He spoke of the CEO Davos in February 2016, where the usual international Initiative programmes and government’s renewed interest shown by the world’s leaders in SA had commitment to them. This has galvanised us at Nedbank, evaporated. We then decided to form the CEO Initiative and other business leaders I have engaged with, to in SA – with other business leaders and alongside redouble our efforts to find solutions to our employment organised labour – to support government with several and growth challenges. Prospects for SA have brightened interventions to address the most urgent problems in our as a result. economy, including unemployment and the dire fiscal In 2017, however, we planned on the basis that position of several state-owned enterprises.

We also braced interventions. Those efforts were paying dividends, as for a difficult economic environment, recognising that evidenced by international rating agencies holding off on policy uncertainty as well as global economic factors was downgrading SA’s debt to subinvestment grade. constraining economic growth in SA.

Every measure of confidence But when Minister Gordhan was recalled from an Nedbank Group – United Nations Global Compact Communication of Progress 2017 4 Creating value in a sustainable manner BEING POSITIONED FOR VALUE CREATION trended downwards through most of the year. The weak growth led to a deterioration in government’s revenue collection, exacerbating government’s budget deficit. Facing this stark reality, continued talk of an extremely expensive nuclear build programme, while several stateowned enterprises faced financial calamity requiring government bailouts, was reckless. The parlous state of the government balance sheet had been made clear by then Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement in October 2017, but this did not seem to drive the needed response from our political leadership. The dire state of Eskom, particularly, has the potential to cause serious damage to the overall financial health of government, while weak economic growth will result in a revenue shortfall. Eskom The role of the bank in society is a critical institution in our economy, not only as a This challenging and uncertain macroeconomic supplier of electricity to us all, but also as a major issuer environment has made me think harder about the role of bonds and other debt held by financial institutions.

Nedbank Group – United Nations Global Compact Communication of Progress 2017 Creating value in a sustainable manner 7 REFLECTIONS FROM OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE We anticipated many of the challenges that presented themselves in 2017 and we were well prepared. We have to accept that the environment in which we operate is constantly evolving.

Nedbank Group – United Nations Global Compact Communication of Progress 2017 10 Creating value in a sustainable manner I am confident that Nedbank is well positioned to take advantage of the greater levels of consumer and business confidence that have emerged in early 2018. With the ETI Q4 2016 loss behind us and having exciting strategies and plans in place, we believe that earnings growth should be stronger in 2018 than in 2017, and DHEPS growth is expected to be in line with our medium-to-long-term target of greater than or equal to GDP plus the CPI plus 5%.

Banks play a crucial role in facilitating economic activity and enabling sustainable growth and development by moving capital from where it is to where it is required. A deep understanding of one’s purpose helps to guide strategy and decisionmaking in this regard and should result in an optimal balance between long-term value creation and short-term results. Delivering on our purpose will require the considered development and delivery of products and services that satisfy unmet societal needs, enabling a thriving society, creating long-term value, maintaining trust and ensuring the success of our brand.

OUR MATERIAL MATTERS Material matter Volatile and uncertain socioeconomic environment characterised by slower growth and rising inequality As a financial services provider, we are deeply connected to and interdependent on the macroeconomic environment. Our ability to create value is dependent on key economic drivers, our response to them and their impact on our stakeholders. Our current forecast is for SA, where we currently generate more than 90% of our earnings, to remain in a mild-stress environment although the outlook is more positive than for the previous year as a result of improved levels of consumer and business confidence. POLITICAL AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS GDP GROWTH The African National Congress (ANC) has elected Mr Cyril Ramaphosa Our economic forecasts suggest that SA’s as its new leader and he has subsequently been elected as President of recovery will be modest and gradual over the the Republic of SA.

New digital technologies are reshaping the value proposition of existing financial products and services and how these are delivered to and consumed by clients. It is estimated that over 90% of retail transactions in sub-Saharan Africa are cash-based, creating a significant opportunity for growth in digital banking in years to come.

While we understand the need for this regulation to protect our stakeholders and support its intent, it has resulted in increased cost of banking, and slower loan growth, ultimately affecting fixed-capital investments and economic expansion. Globally, systemically important banks have reduced their capital commitments as well as exposure to emerging markets in response.

Following a year in which drought, heatwaves, wildfires and floods were commonplace, it is not surprising that environmental risks, such as extreme weather, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, major natural disasters, man-made environmental disasters, and failure of climatechange mitigation and adaptation, were ranked highly in terms of likelihood and impact in the latest World Economic Forum (WEF) Risk Report. It is, of course, the deep interconnectedness of these risks with human wellbeing that sees them posing systemic challenges to citizens across the world.

Nedbank Group – United Nations Global Compact Communication of Progress 2017 26 26 Creating value in a sustainable manner Our strategy is primarily aimed at creating value for all our stakeholders and is defined by our five key strategic focus areas of: Strategic focus area Delivering innovative marketleading client experiences Financial services providers that respond best to the digital challenge in a clientcentred manner will continue to gain a disproportionate share of client revenues. In addition, technological developments provide opportunities for improving efficiency, bringing new digital offerings quicker to market, and lowering the cost to serve as well as the overall cost base by reducing branch sizes and ancillary costs. Our strategy is to become a more digital, more In this approach we select the applications best suited for competitive and more agile bank. In 2010 we embarked on a given purpose and connect them using service-oriented what we termed a Managed Evolution approach to architecture, as we do not believe that any one vendor can transform and digitise our core IT systems over time.

Reflecting on 2017 and looking ahead ■■ As part of our Managed Evolution journey, we continue to rationalise, standardise and simplify our large IT systems and have reduced our core systems from 251 in 2010 to 129 with the aim of having fewer than 60 by 2020. The emphasis in 2017 was on integrating the foundational capabilities built in 2015 and 2016 into our onboarding and servicing programmes, while continuing to meet the prevailing regulatory challenges through the enhancement of our payment, anti-money-laundering and data capabilities. ■■ The DFL is infusing innovation capability into our existing DNA by providing us with increased speed to market, highvelocity client feedback and improved commercialisation capability. Some of the innovations launched through this capability are discussed on the following page as well as on page 65 of the 2017 Nedbank Integrated Report. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on disruptive new-to-market innovations, embracing new technologies and new ways of working with new partners, and novel go-to-market strategies. ■■ We have proactively enabled 5,8 million clients to do their banking on our digital channels and are now focusing on increasing active use (currently 890 539 clients) as we enhance functionality and ease of use. Benefits of increasing selfservice devices are illustrated in the increasing volumes of cash being handled by Intelligent Depositor devices, now at 48% from 23% in 2015. ■■ We remain focused on transforming our clients‘ digital experience and processes, and aim to have digitised the top 10 retail products by 2020. Our outlets are also becoming more digital, with 55% converted to the new format and an aim to have converted 73% by 2020.

Nedbank Group – United Nations Global Compact Communication of Progress 2017 28 Creating value in a sustainable manner Strategic focus area Growing our transactional banking Nedbank retail main-banked franchise faster than the market market share (%) 8,8 9,6 10,1 AMPS discontinued 12,7 15,0 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2020 target Growing our transactional banking franchise faster than the market improves our ROE, as deposits and transactional revenue consume less capital and add to our funding pool. At the same time earnings volatility is reduced as more stable sources of income are increased and our brand value increases. Our strategy starts by growing and retaining our clients, and deepening our share of wallet by converting new and existing clients into main-banked and transactional banking clients. This is why creating market-leading client experiences is so important. Nedbank has built a track record of delivering on this strategic focus area, growing NIR at or above the SA industry average over an extended period. The exception was in 2014, when we deliberately kept our bank fees at 2013 levels and reduced fees for small and medium enterprises as well as business banking clients. Reflecting on 2017 and looking ahead ■■ In our retail business growing our transactional banking franchise is a major focus. Over the past five years we have succeeded in consistently growing our client base despite increasing competition and new entrants. Looking forward, market research suggests that the number of banked consumers in SA will grow to 28 million by 2020, and we expect to increase our share of this. ■■ Of our 7,5 million retail clients in SA, 6,0 million have some form of transactional product with Nedbank. Of these only 27% have another product, which means there is still significant opportunity for cross-sell. In terms of our strict definition of main-banked clients we have 2,8 million clients who regularly bank with us. This is flat on 2016 as some clients fell out of our main-banked definition given lower transactional activity as a result of economic pressures. We believe that our market-leading client innovations will continue to support client growth. The new Consulta survey measuring main-banked clients, estimates our share of main-banked clients to be 12,7%, up from the previous 9% recorded in the 2013 AMPS survey. We are targeting an increase in our main-banked market share to more than 15% by 2020. ■■ While we remain a bank for all, we will continue to focus on the youth and entry-level banking (ELB) segments, which we aim to target leveraging digital while ensuring effective migration to a rising middle market, where we focus on retention and on deepening the relationship through cross-sell. The rising middle market has the highest economic potential, greater propensity to switch and the fastest growth rate among the retail segments. ■■ In CIB we have won major transactional accounts over the past few years, including major private sector and municipal transactional banking accounts. CIB has gained 26 new primary clients in 2017 – these provide a valuable underpin to ongoing NIR growth. We intend to grow our transactional banking share by improving client coverage and deeper client penetration, enabled by improved client data and business analytics, an integrated corporate and investment bank and our strategic partnerships with Ecobank, Deutsche Bank and the Bank of China. In 2017 we concluded a cooperation agreement with Deutsche Bank as our preferred partner in equity and debt capital markets. The cooperation is intended to combine Deutsche Bank’s leading SA equities and global capital markets distribution platform with Nedbank CIB’s leading local primary markets expertise and strong client franchise in both the corporate and public sectors in SA and, in time, select markets in sub-Saharan Africa. In CIB our NIR-to-advances ratio, a key indicator of cross-sell and ability to leverage our strong balance sheet to grow NIR, decreased from a high base in 2016 to 2,0%, due to macroeconomic headwinds which negatively impacted NIR, with a target of > 2,0%, which provides scope for further growth.

Reflecting on 2017 and looking ahead ■■ In an increasingly tough economic environment we focus on optimising cost savings and have identified key business areas for reducing our efficiency ratios, namely RBB and RoA (targets shown on pages 46 and 47 of the 2017 Nedbank Integrated Report), to assist the group in meeting its ≤ 53% target by 2020. ■■ Good progress has also been made with our Target Operating Model (TOM) initiatives, which aim to generate R1,0bn pretax benefits for Nedbank by 2019 (and R1,2bn by 2020) and are linked to our long-term incentive scheme. Most costscaling initiatives in 2017 were identified in RBB and we delivered savings of R621m, of which TOM-related run-rate savings were R238m. These initiatives are linked to the investment we are making on the RBB digital journey and include credit process optimisation and simplification, sales and service optimisation in our outlets, the use of more digital channels, optimisation of our middle office and self-service and video banking. Some highlights include: We reduced headcount by 859 (mostly through natural attrition), optimised our staffed points of presence by closing 52 Pick n Pay kiosks and 32 personal-loan outlets (while maintaining our coverage of the bankable population at 84%) and achieved efficiencies by recycling cash through our increased footprint of Intelligent Depositor devices during the year. Four client-servicing functions, previously accessible only through branches, were launched together with the new Nedbank Money app during Q4 2017 and a total of 33 are planned for deployment across our digital channels in the first half of 2018. We implemented 50 software robots (robotic process automation) to enhance efficiencies and reduce processing errors in administrative-intense processes, with more than 200 planned to be rolled out in 2018. We continued to roll out our new-format outlets and reduced floor space, with a targeted reduction of more than 30 000 m2 by 2020, in addition to optimising processes that require less human intervention. To date we have reduced floor space by just over 24 000 m2. ■■ We worked with our sister companies in the Old Mutual Group to deliver synergies just in excess of R1bn, of which R393m accrued to Nedbank.

Reflecting on 2017 and looking ahead ■■ In the SADC we continue to build scale and optimise costs. Our core banking system, Flexcube, was successfully rolled out in Namibia in 2016 and was also rolled out in Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland in 2017, and we plan to implement in Zimbabwe during 2018. In addition, we have launched a number of new digital products whilst limiting growth in our physical footprint as we invest in our digital offering. As a result, clients increased 14% and online digital activations were up 22%. The acquisition of a majority stake in Banco Único in 2016 continued to deliver value and positioned Nedbank well to leverage off higher economic growth in Mozambique. In 2018 we will rebrand MBCA in Zimbabwe to Nedbank at the same time as we complete the last of our core banking system implementations in our subsidiaries. ■■ Ecobank has been through a challenging period over the past two years following depressed oil prices, the naira devaluation and the recession in Nigeria. Pleasingly, while risks remain, it does appear as if the worst is now behind the bank, and we note that its 2017 interim results have been audited, which should give investors comfort that the risk of another fourth-quarter loss has decreased. We are working very closely with ETI’s management and board to improve returns. The share price of ETI was up 65% in 2017, albeit in thinly traded markets. ■■ Collaboration is increasing and we have recently integrated our payment solutions into Ecobank’s market-leading remittance product that has been launched in over 30 countries. This enables Nedbank to provide a low-cost, fast and convenient solution to 2,7 million African migrants and capture a share of the R14bn–R19bn remittance market. ■■ We have also increased our representation on the ETI board with Mfundo Nkuhlu our Chief Operating Officer newly appointed as Chair of the Risk Committee, now complemented by Brian Kennedy, Managing Executive for CIB, who has joined the Audit and Remuneration Committees. ■■ After a disappointing start, we believe our investment in ETI will be a meaningful contributor to Nedbank’s growth over the next few years.

Our stakeholder engagement framework While the Nedbank Group Executive Committee (Group Exco) has ultimate responsibility for our group’s stakeholder engagement efforts, the process of engaging with stakeholders is decentralised to form part of the operations of our various clusters and business areas. Cluster-based stakeholder engagement is governed by a comprehensive group stakeholder engagement framework and policy, which include our corporate identity and communication guidelines. Each business area is required to report regularly on its stakeholder engagements through the Group Exco.

We will continue to collaborate with Old Mutual on the managed separation. Some investors are separation and synergies from our arm's-length collaboration initiatives. concerned about a potential share overhang after unbundling. On 1 November 2017 Old Mutual plc announced that the strategic minority shareholding to be retained in Nedbank Group by Old Mutual Limited (OML) to underpin the ongoing commercial relationship between the companies has been agreed at 19,9% of the total Nedbank Group ordinary shares in issue, as held by shareholder funds. The 19,9% shareholding will be held by OML, which will have a primary listing on the JSE and a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange. OML will be listed at the earliest opportunity in 2018, following the publication of Old Mutual plc’s 2017 fullyear results. The decrease in OML’s shareholding in Nedbank Group will be achieved through the unbundling of Nedbank Group ordinary shares to OML shareholders. This will result in OML, immediately after the implementation of unbundling, holding a 19,9% strategic minority shareholding in Nedbank Group. The unbundling will occur at an appropriate time and in an orderly manner after the listing of OML, allowing suitable time for the transition of the OML shareholder register to an investor base with an SA and emerging-market focus and mandate.

Nedbank Group – United Nations Global Compact Communication of Progress 2017 42 Creating value in a sustainable manner GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE STANDARDS INDEX For the 2017 financial year we have used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards for sustainability reporting, published in 2016, for the first time. We believe our report is in accordance with the core option requirements of such and meets some of the requirements of the comprehensive option where we believe that this matter is material to Nedbank. In addition we have chosen to report on certain environmental disclosures including, energy (302-1, 302-3 and 302-4) and emissions (305-1 to 305-6). While these do not form part of our material disclosures they are key to Nedbank's carbonneutral status. We will continue to improve our reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards over time.
