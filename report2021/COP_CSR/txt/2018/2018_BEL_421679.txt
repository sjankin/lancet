The decrease mainly reflects: •• The payment of benefits for an amount of EUR 44.3 million. bpost ANNUAL REPORT 2017 13 Non-current trade and other liabilities Non-current trade and other liabilities increased by EUR 4.9 million (2016: EUR 40.3 million), mainly due to the commitments relating to contingent FINANCIAL REVIEW considerations for Bubble Post and DynaGroup, partially offset by a decrease of the contingent consideration of de Buren following the finalization of the purchase price allocation. Non-current provisions Non-current provisions amounted to EUR 24.2 million (2016: EUR 31.6 million) and decreased by EUR 7.4 million compared to last year. Deferred tax liabilities Deferred tax liabilities increased by EUR 11.2 million from EUR 1.1 million in 2016 to EUR 12.3 million in 2017. This increase was mainly due to the deferred tax liabilities linked to the intangible assets recognized throughout the purchase price allocation process for de Buren, DynaGroup and Ubiway in 2017. Furthemore as the Belgian and US corporate tax reform had been substantially enacted before December 31, 2017 bpost reassessed their deferred tax liabilities under IFRS taking into consideration these new measures. Current interest-bearing loans and borrowings Current interest-bearing loans and borrowings increased by EUR 689.5 million to EUR 699.9 million due to the bridge loan entered into 2017 to buy Radial. bpost borrowed a part in USD to mitigate the risk on foreign exchange rate differences on the foreign operation, hence bpost performed a net investment hedge. Current provisions Current provisions decreased by EUR 6.0 million to EUR 21.2 million (2016: EUR 27.1 million). Current trade and other liabilities Current trade and other liabilities increased by EUR 253.5 million EUR, or 26.3%, to EUR 1,218.2 million in 2017. This variance was mainly due to the increase of trade payables by EUR 155.0 million, the payroll and social security payables increased by EUR 34.3 million and other payables increased by EUR 62.1 million. The increase of the trade payables as well as the increase of the payroll and social security payables was mainly due to the integration of the new subsidiaries. The increase of the other payables was caused by the contingent considerations relating to the acquisition of DynaGroup, an outstanding payable for the purchase of Radial at year-end 2017, partially compensated by the payment of the remaining 24.5% of the shares of Landmark during 2017 and the payment of a contingent consideration to FDM and Apple Express. bpost ANNUAL REPORT 2017 14 1.3 Statement of cash flows FINANCIAL REVIEW In 2017, bpost consumed EUR 68.9 million of net cash. This is a decrease of EUR 7.3 million compared to the net cash outflow of EUR 76.2 million in 2016. Cash flow from operating activities resulted in a cash inflow of EUR 266.1 million, EUR 86.5 million less than in 2016. Cash generation from operating activities had been impacted by the net impact of last year’s pay-outs for the social plan related to the Alpha project (EUR +18.7 million), the payment of terminal dues in 2016 (EUR +16.8 million), which was mainly phasing, and the deterioration of working capital by EUR 121.1 million mainly driven by the peak sales season at Radial combined with lower outstanding trade payables. Investing activities generated a cash outflow of EUR 751.9 million in 2017 compared to an outflow of EUR 158.7 million last year, resulting from lower proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment (EUR -3.2 million) and higher capital expenditures (EUR -36.3 million), which was partially offset by investment securities (EUR +24.0 million). Cash outflows related to the acquisition of new subsidiaries and activities increased by EUR 577.7 million: Radial (EUR -581.5 million), DynaGroup (EUR -50.2 million), LGI (EUR -11.0 million), Ubiway (EUR +43.0 million), Apple Express (EUR +12.3 million), FDM (EUR +8.6 million), other acquisitions (EUR +1.0 million). The net cash flow relating to financing activities amounted to EUR 416.8 million, an increase by EUR 687.0 million compared to last year given the bridge loan entered into for the purchase of Radial and the dividend to minority interests paid in 2016 which were partially counterbalanced by the higher final dividend in 2017. bpost ANNUAL REPORT 2017 15 1.4 Reconciliation of A non-recurring item is deemed to be significant if it amounts to EUR 20.0 million or more.

We expect revenues to grow driven by: •• double digit volume growth in Domestic Parcels, with a price/mix effect between -3% and -6%; •• continued growth in international parcels supported by newly acquired businesses; •• stable Radial revenues, partly offset by: •• an underlying Domestic Mail volume decline of up to 7%, partially compensated by price/mix effect of +4% on average; •• continued decline in Banking & Financial revenue. On the cost side, we expect higher costs driven by: •• increase in transport cost reflecting growth in International Parcels & Mail; •• consolidation of acquired businesses; •• salary indexation expected as of November 2018; •• Radial costs impacted by phase out webstore business and higher than expected opex (medical benefits & inflation) not fully compensated by productivity improvements.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when bpost revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Hedges of net investments in foreign operations Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of foreign currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the foreign operation. bpost ANNUAL REPORT 2017 40 Mitigation Monitoring FINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED Regulatory/Legal Risks •• Maintaining a constructive •• Annual status reporting (Legal/ STATEMENTS relationship with the regulatory) Authorities and Regulators •• Immediate reporting of important evolutions potentially impacting the strategy External Business Risks •• Tracking of the events which •• Annual status reporting as input influence the risk assessment for the Annual Report (EOY) •• Networking and influencing (if •• Immediate reporting of deemed useful) important evolutions potentially •• Definition of Plan B (if deemed impacting the strategy useful) Operational Risks •• Action plans/Projects to •• Brief status & Emerging risk mitigate the risks (part of the evolutions are reported during BU objectives and budget the Quarterly Review (QR) process) •• Annual update on the risk evolution (Corporate Risk) Any of the following risks could have a material force in February 2018. bpost welcomes this legislative adverse effect on bpost’s business, financial position initiative as the new Postal Law provides a futureand operating results.
