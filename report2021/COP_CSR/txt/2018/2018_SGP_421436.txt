SAJEN ASWANI I am pleased to confirm that Tolaram Group reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and AntiCorruption. In this annual Communication on Progress, we reaffirm our commitments to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. With 70 years of entrepreneurship experience, Tolaram Group has evolved from trading, to manufacturing, to brand-building. While we are established in several industries, we are now focusing on growing our fast-moving consumer goods and digital services businesses. With that, a fundamental part of the Group’s philosophy has always been to give back to the communities that have helped us grow to who we are today. Philanthropy has remained a core aspect of the Group’s values, and this tenet goes back to the roots of the founding family, long before the business’ inception. As part of honouring this tradition, in 2015, Tolaram Group was reorganised as a trust with Ishk Tolaram Foundation becoming the majority trustee and 25% beneficiary. The Foundation represents the philanthropic pursuits of the family, focusing on issues related to education, employment, and healthcare in Indonesia and Nigeria. Through both the business and foundation we hope to continue to embody the Ten Principles outlined by the Global Compact in all our endeavors. Our Group has always believed in philanthropy & volunteerism from our very humble beginnings. In Nigeria, Indonesia and Estonia, where we have manufacturing operations, we have been participating in community initiatives for a long time. The idea is to contribute meaningfully to the society/community in these locations. The areas covered include Education & Sports, Physically & Mentally Challenged and Health Care. One example is Nigeria, where we operate a non-for-profit Limb Centre, which fits beneficiaries with prosthetic limbs and connects them with employment opportunities. As of 2018, the Group employs over 10,000 and our employee profile consists of individuals from a range of backgrounds. Some of the nationalities include Egyptian, Estonian, Ethiopian, German, Ghanaian, Indian, Indonesian, Nigerian, Pakistani, Russian, Singaporean, South African, etc. We believe that the diversity of our people plays a key role in the success of our businesses across the globe. We are convinced that with our successes comes an increased responsibility to contribute meaningfully to the communities in which we operate. Our culture is shaped by our guiding values: Trust, Respect, Commitment, Courage, and Humility. These values stand at the core of everything we do and allow us to honour where we came from, what we have learnt along the way, and how we can continue to contribute to a better world.
