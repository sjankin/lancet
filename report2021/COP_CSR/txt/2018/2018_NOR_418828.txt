The framework gives us the potential to pursue our opportunity to inherent in building a greener, more equitable and inclusive society. During last year, Ekornes upgraded the heating system at the Ikornnes and Fetsund plants. These investments were conducted to diminish the usage of fossil fuel, reduce the local pollution and enhanced the utilization of more sustainable heat sources. In 2017 we continued our wide-ranging logistics project, exploiting our opportunities to use the fjords and sea as a transportation solution. Our goal is to reach 70 per cent of our output by sea, while 30 per cent will go by road. By this transition to more sea-freight our CO2 emission, like-for-like, will be reduced by approximately 40 %. We are already underway with this change, and has great expectations of reaching target within 2018. Ekornes aim to meet our final customers’ needs in an even better way than today, thereby creating a foundation for growth and greater profitability. For that reason, we have implemented a number of structural changes in recent years. These changes, allied with our market position and continued investments in growth-enhancing measures going forward, mean that we are ready to embark on the next leg of the journey we started several years ago. A journey we will take together: the company’s board, management and, not least, all our highly competent employees around the world. We continue this journey in the spirit of our founder, Jens E. Ekornes, by being curious and open and swift to spot new opportunities, so that we can continue to create value for our shareholders, employees and society at large in 2018 as well. Olav Holst-Dyrnes CEO Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 4 This is Ekornes Ekornes is the largest furniture producer in Norway and owns the brand names Ekornes®, Stressless®, Svane® and IMG. Stressless® is one of the world’s most well-known furniture brands, while Ekornes®, Stressless® and Svane® are the best known in the Norwegian furniture sector. Production takes place at the Group’s nine factories, five of which are in Norway, one in the USA, one in Thailand and two in Vietnam. Ekornes sells its products over large parts of the world either through its own sales companies or via importers. Ekornes’s business idea is to develop and manufacture products which offer outstanding comfort and functionality, and whose design and price appeal to a wide audience. Ekornes is headquartered at the company’s factory at Ikornnes in Sykkylven, on the west coast of Norway. Ekornes ASA is the Group’s parent company. Ekornes was founded in 1934 when Jens E. Ekornes started producing furniture springs at the J.E. Ekornes Fjærfabrikk in Sykkylven. The first Stressless® chairs were launched onto the Norwegian market in 1971. Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 5 Our Values The Ekornes Group has set three core values for all employees in Ekornes. These shall be emphasized and are given as: Honesty and sincerity towards everyone we relate to Transparency and reliability, both internally and with respect to our surroundings Innovation to enable us to stay a step ahead of our competitors The Ekornes values is set in the handbook “Objectives and Values for the Ekornes Group”. This handbook is the instrumental in ensuring that everyone working in Ekornes, in Norway and abroad, have the ability to understand and further develop the joint set of values. These values are forged by our history and the strategies that are to create future growth and progress. Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 6 Our Sustainability Policy The environment. The objective of Ekornes is to accept environmental responsibility related to manufacturing, distribution and use of the company’s products. We will continue to implement initiatives in our factories that improve the internal and external environment, at the same time as we continue to select environmentallyfriendly raw materials. A sustainable manufacture of durable products will also in future be an objective in the development of our company. The following core items shall be complied with in all parts of our activity: • Ekornes shall appear as an environmentally-friendly enterprise. Our products shall cause the least possible impact on the environment. • Ekornes has as its objective to keep the health risk at the workplaces at a minimum. • Ekornes invests to avoid damage to the environment and injuries to health. • Environmental information shall be generally available, for example through Environmental Product Declarations (EPD). • Ekornes shall give objective and open information about how the company handles its environmental responsibility.

Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 8 The people The Group’s policy states that Ekornes shall act as a responsible enterprise and operate within all relevant laws, regulations and to strict ethical standards. Ekornes clearly states, both internally and externally, that the company endeavor to comply with the UN’s Global Compact’s ten principles. This policy is presented in the “Objectives and Values for the Ekornes Group”, which is available for all stakeholders. Equality. Ekornes places great emphasis on meeting the objective of the AntiDiscrimination Act and the Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act. Through physical access and the formation of work tasks, working hours and workplaces, the company has conducted arrangements to enable people with disabilities to enjoy equal treatment and provide individual adaptation. Providing individual adaptation is also contributing to lower absence rates. One way of providing individual adaptation is through the Green working stations. These working stations are designed for eased work for employees with smaller disabilities. Ekornes has Inclusive Working Life agreements for the period 2014–2018. The Inclusive Working Life scheme stems from a tripartite agreement between employers’ organisations, trade unions and the government, to make it possible for everyone who is able and willing to work. Ekornes’s Inclusive Working Life agreements cover its facilities at Sykkylven, Grodås and Hornindal. The equality between men and women in Ekornes is illustrated in the table below.

Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 9 Health. The Group’s overall sickness absence rate came to 3.5 per cent in 2017. This is a decrease of 0.3 percentage points from 2016. Long-term sickness absence (over 16 days) accounted for the bulk of the sickness absence. In the Norwegian part of the Group, efforts related to the 3,5 per cent ‘Inclusive Working Life’ scheme, the workplace rehabilitation committee and individual follow-up have The Group overall been implemented with a view to reducing sickness sickness absence rate absence. Safety. Ekornes aims to have zero work-related personal injuries through the year. The Group is working systematically to reduce the number of injuries. The reporting of undesirable incidents and careful follow-up of incidents and near-misses form an important part of this effort. In 2017, there were a total of 16 lost-time injuries in the Group. This is one less than in 2016. The H1 value (number of lost-time injuries per million hours worked) for the Group came to 3.9 in 2017. In 2016, the H1 value came to 4.1. Labour unions. The majority of the employees in the Ekornes Group are organized in various labour uni1ons. There is a constructive cooperation between the management and all the unions through continuous dialogue and regular meetings. Negotiation committees are established to represent the employees in the yearly local wage negotiations. There is a long tradition in Ekornes to maintain good dialogue between the management and the labour unions. Ekornes believe that respecting labor rights is an important factor in the work to reduce sickness absence, and increase effectiveness and profitability. Employees are represented in the board of the Ekornes Group. These representatives hold the same rights as members chosen by the shareholders. Education. The competence of its workforce is Ekornes’s most important resource. It is therefore crucial that Ekornes is capable of both retaining and attracting competent staff, and of developing its existing competence base. Emphasis is placed on making Ekornes an attractive workplace, which offers opportunities 12 for advancement within the Group. Craft apprenticeships are a key area for Ekornes in Norway. In 2017, Ekornes was an approved training company within 7 craft disciplines and employees employed 24 apprentices. During the year, 12 people passed their final exams to become qualified craftsmen or women. passed their final exam Close cooperation with lower and upper secondary schools, to become craftsmen as well as the various training offices, are important for maintaining the high quality of the vocational training or women provided. Ekornes facilitates Norwegian language education for Norwegian employees who do not have Norwegian as their native language. In 2017, 7 employees attended basic language courses in Norwegian language initiated and funded by Ekornes. In addition to this, 12 employees participated in courses for advanced Norwegian on their own initiative. Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 10 A number of training measures were implemented in 2017, both as a result of statutory requirements and to boost the Group’s level of competence. A leadership development programme for managers in Norway was also staged. In addition, the HR function has been expanded, in part to help reinforce the long-term development of the Group’s sales forces in all segments. For the first time ever, Ekornes offered a summer internship programme in 2017. The internship lasted for seven weeks from June to August. During that time, the participating students were allocated a project to complete, and were given guidance by mentors in a variety of disciplines. A summer internship programme offers the company an opportunity to showcase its operations, but also a chance for employees to learn and be challenged by young students. During the year, efforts have also been made to strengthen the competence of the sales organisation in several parts of both IMG and Stressless®. The company is open for students of higher education to use Ekornes as casework in their assignments. Robot partnership. The vocational high-school of Sykkylven has since 2006 been supplied with an industry robot by Ekornes for educational use. Training takes place both in the company and at the school: vocational teachers are trained and undertake internships at Ekornes to increase their breadth of knowledge and sharpen their skills. On the other hand, Ekornes employees also take courses at the school. School students have excursions to the factories where Ekornes provide guided tours of the plants and training in a variety of topics. Shared value creation. Ekornes has a long tradition of contributing to the local communities in which its operations are located. The Ekornes Group depends on having qualified staff at all its factories, and the company’s engagement in the local community helps to foster an enjoyable and positive working environment for employees. For several years, employees engaged in Stressless® production have donated Christmas gifts to worthy causes in the local community through a special fund. Decisions regarding the allocation of these Christmas donations are taken by a committee made up of employees. In 2017, Christmas donations were given to various local initiatives intended to promote active engagement in outdoor pursuits in Sykkylven and Hornindal. Donations were also made to support local care homes for the elderly. In addition, Ekornes sponsors and participates in activities for children and teens in those districts in which it has production facilities. Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 11 Anti-Corruption Ekornes has zero-tolerance for corruption, bribery and extortion. The top management team has continuous focus on risk of corruption and continuously work to promote transparency in daily operations. The anti-corruption policy is clearly stated in the Ekornes Code of Conduct and made known to all employees and business partners. Supplementary to this, Ekornes has a policy for transparency in economic transactions: Ekornes requires transparency in all operations. All Ekornes entities shall therefore ensure that transactions are correctly registered and supported by proper documentation in accordance with local and international accounting principles. Anticorruption law requires that Ekornes has in place effective internal accounting controls and maintains books and records that accurately reflect the companies’ transactions. All entities within the group must correctly account for income and expenditures, and must ensure that payments are not recorded falsely in company books. All expenses shall be approved under standard company procedures, documented and recorded in accordance with appropriate accounting standards. Compliance. Ekornes has its own internal audit team which focuses on the work environment, local laws and regulations in order to secure the Groups own processes. Ekornes conduct audits on our suppliers performed by a third party. The audit is a social audit which reflects upon the Ekornes Supplier principles and the Ekornes code of conduct. Whistleblow. Ekornes has its own Whistleblow program, operated by an external third party. The whistleblow program allows all employees to raise their concerns and report through other channels than management if needed. The employees are encouraged to alert about critical issues on all levels. Ekornes endeavors to continuously maintain and further develop an open corporate culture. Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 12 The products Environmental practice is a part of the Ekornes culture and encourages “More with less” through the whole value chain. Based on life-cycle considerations Ekornes acknowledge that extraction, refining and transportation of raw materials for production of components going in to our products represent the largest impact on the environment. Since Ekornes only has indirect influence on these processes, we take responsibility by continuously improving the efficiency on in-house processes. Ekornes seeks to maximize utilization of raw materials and other resources. Quality. Ekornes follow the requirements for strength, stability and security set by the Norwegian Møbelfakta (www.mobelfakta.no). Through the membership of Møbelfakta Ekornes commits to environment and quality certified production and certification of the products according to current requirements and criteria in mobelfakta.no. Quality Certification of furniture requires extensive quality testing by an accredited furniture testing laboratory according to current specifications in accordance with international standards (EN standards). The furniture is tested by the following criteria: • Strength and durability, function • Stability and security, risk • Material quality (wood, textiles, leather) • Surface treatment • Fire resistance All new products are tested at accredited laboratories. In addition, Ekornes perform testing internally prior to official testing. This is done both during the product development stage and in the production phase by testing reception of critical goods like e.g. leather. Quality requirements in the various commodity and component categories is a work that is done in interdisciplinary collaboration with manufacturing and purchasing. Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 13 The production The Ekornes Group has been making quality furniture for over 80 years. This focus on quality helps to reduce the overall environmental impact of the products, and thereby the environmental impact of the Group as a whole. A sustainable Ekornes is an Ekornes which shares the value it creates between its shareholders, employees and the communities affected by its operational activities. Ekornes has implemented numerous measures at its factories which have lessened the company’s environmental impact. New technologies, environment-friendly materials and new product solutions have resulted in one of the most efficient manufacturing environments in the furniture industry today. Ekornes focus on the areas where the impacts of improvements are greatest. In the furniture industry this is connected to the production of polyurethane foam, surface coatings and adhesives as well as leather and fabrics. Ekornes strives continuously to reduce its use of chemicals and promote environment-friendly solutions. Among other things, Ekornes has contributed to the development of a new environment-friendly adhesive to produce laminated wood and all J.E. Ekornes’ surface coatings facilities now use water-based products. Where necessary, Ekornes has made use of independent expertise to monitor requirements and set the standards needed to ensure compliance. Foam. Ekornes produce its own polyurethane foam. This benefit provides Ekornes with first-hand knowledge of the challenges of foam-making as well as full control on what is added in the foam. The foam is free from halogenated flameretardants, organotin components or organic solvent based release agents and glue. The plants are designed to re-use the residual foam generated from trimming, in order to make rebonded foam. To grasp the developments in the profession of foam-making Ekornes participate at many arenas to gain knowledge on how to go forward. Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 14 Leather and fabric. The Ekornes Group is a large consumer of leather in Europe. Leather is purchased from selected tanneries all over the world. The leather is manufactured according to current laws, guidelines and recommendations relating to their utilisation properties, and for the use and content of chemicals and other substances. Ekornes are cooperating with recognised international institutions in this line of business to ensure that the leather and leather processing is compliant at all times with events relating to health, safety and the environment. Ekornes also provide to our customers a broad assortment of environmentally certified fabrics. Leather and fabric are some of the key drivers of the products’ life cycle environmental impact. Ekornes are always looking for ways to optimize its use of raw material. An improvement of only 1% of leather yeild can translate into considerable costand environmental impact reductions. Ekornes have invested considerably in recent years in autmated leather and fabric cutting in order to generate savings at every stage in the cutting process. In 2017, IMG invested in new leather-cutting equipment, which has increased the raw material’s utilization rate at the factories. The residue trims are not wasted, but collected and sold to manufacturers of small leather goods. In 2017, Ekornes became a member of the Leather working group (LWG). This organisation focus on sustainable valuechains in the leather industry. In addition, Ekornes has an ongoing internal leather sustainability project which was launched in 2016. The aim of the project is to increase the internal knowledge in Ekornes on the environmental impacts associated with leather. Throughout the process the project will gain insight from reputed institutions and the industry to set new standards for chemical management, animal welfare, deforestation and other leather supply chain sustainability matters. Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 15 Wood and coating. J.E. Ekornes utilizes millions of sheets of beech veneer every year. An original Stressless® base contains 36 sheets of European quality veneer. There is only used FSC/PEFC certified wood in the Stressless® production. The wood used in the IMG products are veneer from rubber wood trees that have past their service life for making natural rubber. In this way, as the way is cleared for new trees at the plantations, the old ones do not go to waste. Ekornes require its suppliers of wood to prove documentation of the origin and legality of wood. Another important environmental and compliance aspect is the emission characteristics from composite wood products, coating and adhesives. JE. Ekornes only use water based stains and varnish in their own production. This is applied automatically in closed cells by robots. An automatic process, provides a healthy working environment for the employees. In 2016 a new type of stain was introduced which reduced the level of heavy metal based color pigments down to levels far below the thresholds that are required by standards and regulation. In 2017 a project of introducing a new glue for beech laminate was introduced in J.E. Ekornes. Further testing was performed throughout the year. The results from the project are perceived to be positive with even more reduced levels of formaldehyde in the wood. Steel and sourced components. The steel processing department at JE. Ekornes AS has a wide range of highly automated operations. Steel pipes, coil and wire are converted to frames, components and springs. This processing involves cutting, stamping, bending and welding of hundreds of different types of components. The majority of welding/soldering operations at J.E. Ekornes AS are automated and take place in closed, ventilated welding cells. Steel components to which epoxy resin is to be applied are degreased biologically in a closed loop system. When the processing water needs to be changed once or twice per year, it is delivered to special waste handlers. These partners ensure that the water is treated according to the local governmental regulations. Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 16 Ekornes use polished cast aluminum for the Signatureand Star Base. The main outer frame of the Star Base chairs is subjected to galvanic surface treatment in order to withstand the strains from the Glide system. The partner for galvanic surface treatment is locally based and utilize a modern closed loop process, ensuring zero emissions to water. Setting standards for emissions and a respectful, safe and healthy working environment is part of the dialogue Ekornes have with its suppliers of sourced components. The supply chain. The Ekornes Group supply chain and sourcing team set the standard for suppliers and follow up regularly by contact, visits, risk-assessment and audits. Ekornes perform audits at the suppliers’ facilities in order to generate a good cooperation, and secure that all partners in the supply chain are in compliance with the UN Global Compact principles. Ekornes’ operations rely on suppliers of raw material and distributors from all over the world. This means that the company must face different cultures and legislations for business operations in different regions, which can be challenging. Towards our business partners, Ekornes states the company expectations through the Ekornes Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of Conduct is reflected upon the UN Global Compact principles as an overreaching framework and are supported with internationally acclaimed conventions and norms embodied in national laws and regulations. Regarding human rights and labour, the Ekornes Supplier Code of Conduct sets expectations regarding: Freedom of Association & Regular Employment Collective Bargaining Forced labour Health & Safety Discrimination Living wage / minimum wage Discipline / Inhumane treatment Working hours Child labour and young workers The suppliers of direct material to the production of Stressless® products are every year evaluated through a risk assessment of the Ekornes supply chain. This is assessment is conducted in order for Ekornes to understand its supply chain and to generate an even further cooperation with its suppliers. Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 17 The environment By engaging in sustainable production, the Ekornes Group will reduce the environmental impact of its products, measured over their entire lifespan. For Ekornes, a sustainable piece of furniture is one that is robust, and that does not need to be replaced often. A high-quality piece of furniture will also have a high second-hand value. In recent years, considerable resources have been devoted to increasing the focus on continuous improvement, and a number of improvement measures were implemented on the production side in 2017. This contributes to the sustainable development not only of the products, but of the Group as a whole. Any move that helps to increase quality or reduce raw materials wastage, time and energy is a step in the right direction. Emissions. Ekornes monitor the emissions from the production. There are conducted gas measurements on an annual basis, to be compliant with local regulations. Ekornes additionally map the environmental emission impact of operations, such as business travels, the production and material usage. The group total impact is reported to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) every year. Direct emissions to the air from the manufacturing process are primarily generated by oil and solid fuel boilers. Wood chips are generated as a biproduct from the production and the production surplus is the main energy source for heating the Tynes, Grodås, Aure and Ikornnes plants. The emissions from burning wood chips are mainly CO2, CO, NOx and particles. Ekornes has own emission permits for its woodchip boilers for the factories in Sykkylven. In 2017, Ekornes’s total carbon footprint was calculated at 4,848.8 tonnes of carbon equivalents. For the Group as a whole, this corresponds to 2.4 tonnes of carbon equivalents per full-time equivalent. Ekornes reports its greenhouse gas emissions in three so-called “scopes”. For Ekornes, emissions in Scope 1 (direct emissions) derive from internal transport, heating with natural gas and oil, as well as carbon dioxide released during polyurethane foam production. Scope 2 encompasses indirect emissions deriving from the generation of electricity by a third party. Scope 3 is associated with the treatment of waste, air travel and authorized business use of motor vehicles. Through its updated travel policy, Ekornes has paved the way for a reduction in business travel, which may lead to a reduction in the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions. The table below shows a breakdown between the various “scopes” per year and an overall reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions from 2015–2017. Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 18 The Group’s greenhouse gas emissions (tonnes CO2 eq.) Scope 1 Scope 2 2439,1 Scope 3 TONN C02E 1828,7 1064,7 2715 2442,4 2539,6 1105,2 812,1 1341,7 2015 2016 2017 Previously reported greenhouse gas figures for the Group have been based on the assumption that the Norwegian facilities deliver residual waste to landfills. This is not the case. As a result, the factor for greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 3 has been too high. With effect from the 2017 reporting cycle, this error has been identified and amended. Historical figures are therefore incorrect, and any future comparison will only be valid from the 2017 sustainability report onward. In 2017, Ekornes continued our wide-ranging logistics project, exploiting our opportunities to use the fjords and sea as a transportation solution. Ekornes’ has the latter years had an ongoing project in mapping the logistics of the entire value chain with the aim of finding opportunities for improvement and increased efficiency. A major restructuring is currently under implementation, with a main aim to implement more transport by sea. The objective of this reconstruction is that, in the future, 70 per cent of the products will go by sea, while 30 per cent will go by road. In addition to increasing the use of transport by sea, there will be fewer external warehouses and subcontractors. In the longer term, this will cut time spent on administration and increase the focus on development, quality, cost-effectiveness and the environment. By this transition to more sea-freight Ekornes CO2 emission, will be reduced by approximately 40 %. The change is still underway, and Ekornes has great expectations of reaching target within 2018. Energy usage. J.E. Ekornes uses mainly bioenergy to heat its manufacturing facilities in Norway. Wood chips is the main energy source for heating Ekornes’ Tynes, Grodås, Aure and Ikornnes plants. Two of these plants has fossil oil as the alternative energy source, which is only used in exceptional cases on the coldest days. In 2017 J.E. Ekornes invested in new technology for wood chip incineration at the Ikornnes plant. The replacement was conducted due to high emission levels from the old boiler. Additionally, a new accumulator tank was installed related to this upgrade, in order to accumulate for high system load. A new boiler was additionally installed at the JE. Ekornes Beds plant in Fetsund. This new combination boiler is rigged to meet the demands of being fossil oil free for heating Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 19 purposes in Norway by 2020. The new boiler at Ekornes Beds can utilize liquefied petroleum gas and will provide considerable reductions in green-house gas emissions. Converting from oil to LPG was in 2016 estimated to save nearly 1 million NOK and 96 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year compared to 2015 numbers. Ekornes has a defined objective to phase out oil use by 2020. Ekornes performed in 2017 mapping activities related to the energy usage in J.E. Ekornes AS. A project with the main aim to increase the utilization of the wood chips was conducted throughout the year. The logistics connected to this process 68,2 KWh was additionally made more efficient. This project was related to the investment of new woodchip incineration During 2017, J.E. technology. Ekornes used 68KWh per seating produced. The objectives for energy states a reduction of energy consumption by 10% before 2020. In order to complete this goal, J.E. Ekornes AS has set a specific objective to reduce its own electricity consumption to 50 kWh per seat unit produced by 2020. This target has been set to help meet the Group’s overarching environmental goals. In 2017, the production of a Stressless® seat unit required, on average, 68.2 kWh. This is a marginal improvement from 2016. The graph below shows the Group’s consumption of electricity, woodchips, heating oil and natural gas in kWh. 2016 has been put as a new baseline for comparison, since older measurements have shown an incorrectly high level of consumption. Comparable figures from further back are therefore not available. 30 000 000 25 000 000 20 000 000 kWh 15 000 000 10 000 000 5 000 000 0 Fuel oil and natural Electricity Woodchips gas 2017 24 875 823 3 505 178 8 866 734 2016 27 082 677 2 306 996 8 455 666 The factories in the USA, Thailand and Vietnam are less affected by ambient temperatures, and their energy consumption relates largely to their machine park. The use of daylight at the factories in Vietnam and Thailand has improved in the past year, Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 20 which has reduced the need for artificial lighting. In recent years, the factory at Fetsund has switched to LED lighting in its premises, which has also reduced energy consumption. The majority of the production in Ekornes is based in Norway, where hydro power accounts for 95% of electricity generation. Although this is clean, renewable power, reducing electricity use is one of Ekornes main environmental objectives. Ekornes is participating in the Tafjord Energi Arena network. Through the network, Ekornes learn from the experiences of other manufacturers in the Sykkylven area. A part of this network is training on energy management theory based on the principles of the ISO 50001 standard. Waste management. Furniture production generates waste. Efforts to reduce the volume of waste and to increase recycling are therefore important. Ekornes sorts all its waste at source in such a way that the bulk of the waste is reused, recycled or used for energy recovery at its own plants. For Ekornes’s factories in Norway and the USA, sorting and recycling accounted for over 80 per cent of all recorded waste. Ekornes wishes to transform as much of its waste as possible into useful byproducts that are reused in its own production cycle. 1,8 kg waste Ekornes sorts all its waste at source in accordance with applicable regulations and in such a way that the bulk of In 2017, J.E. Ekornes the waste is recycled or used for energy recovery. Ekornes generated 1,8 kg waste seeks to utilize as much as possible of its waste, either for per seating produced. heat production or as raw materials for its own production. In 2017, J.E. Ekornes increased the focus on waste management in the organization. Measures like the acquisition of specialised containers for hazardous waste storage have helped improve hazardous waste control. For Ekornes Beds, the acquisition of hazardous waste lockers has helped improve the systematisation and control of the plant’s hazardous waste. To achieve its waste-reduction target, Ekornes monitors the volume of waste from its production facilities. Efforts are also made to increase the individual employee’s awareness in this area, so that everyone can contribute to target realisation. J.E. Ekornes AS aims to reduce the proportion of waste that cannot be recycled or reused at the plants. The objective is to reduce the waste generated from own production from approximately 2 kg per seat unit in 2015 to 1.5 kg by 2020. In order to achieve this goal the total amount of waste needs to be reduced as well as the percentage of waste being recycled needs to be increased. Many of the improvement projects initiated through LEAN work have resulted in less amounts of waste. Recycle and use of byproducts. Ekornes has a focus to utilize byproducts from the furniture production. Utilizing byproducts from the production is conducted in order to reduce the waste generated and focusing on a lifecycle perspective. One of the resources that are recycled on site, directly in to the production cycle, are offcuts of foamed plastic or fiber. The offcuts are collected, shredded and remolded. In addition to reusing some by-products from production at Ekornes’s own factories, other by-products can represent valuable raw materials for other enterprises. Hides are a valuable raw Ekornes ASA COP Sustainability Report 2017 21 material, which Ekornes is continuously seeking to make maximum use of. Investments in modern technology have helped to reduce the volume of offcuts. Remaining leather offcuts are collected and sold to producers of small articles. The table below shows the volume of waste in tonnes produced by the Group’s facilities in Norway and the USA, and is characterised according to the waste’s value in use. The categories are: landfill, mixed waste for energy recovery, wood for combustion at our own or external facilities, and reuse or recycling. Waste sent for reuse or recycling is waste that can be utilised by other parties.

IMG The Local Environment. Ekornes produces its own polyurethane foam. Foamed plastic is produced at J.E. Ekornes AS’s Ikornnes plant and at Ekornes Beds AS. Isocyanates, which are hazardous to health, are used in connection with the production of foamed plastic. Both facilities have the capacity to store over 100 tonnes of toluene diisocyanate, and are therefore subject to the major accident regulations (Storulykkeforskriften). Safety reports have been prepared at both sites and these are regularly updated and submitted to the authorities in accordance with the major accident regulations. Information is additionally available through the website Ekornes.com. Every factory has an established industrial safety organization. Emergency response plans are drawn up by the factories, and all carry out the necessary training and exercises. All the Norwegian factories have their own industrial safety/emergency response organizations. The regulatory authorities perform annual inspections of both plants, and both meet existing environmental regulations. All the Norwegian factories have an organised industrial safety capability. Emergency response plans are drawn up at each factory. The necessary drills and training have been carried out at all facilities.
