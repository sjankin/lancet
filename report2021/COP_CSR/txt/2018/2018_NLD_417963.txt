Lending amounted to €6.2 billion and the bank’s net profit increased by 14% to €122.5 million (2016: €107.4 million). The increase in profit is mainly due to the fact that the bank made optimum, but appropriate use of the particularly favourable funding rates in the money market, stemming from the ECB’s extensive asset purchase programme and the low-interest environment. The bank has used those attractive short-term funds for short term lending to its clients, to strengthen its liquidity buffer and to meet the collateral obligations under the derivatives contracts, which it is concluding to cover its own risks. The balance sheet total amounted to €87 billion. With the number of employees standing at about 65, NWB Bank remains a very cost-efficient bank. 20 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Water authorities and housing associations, together The bank’s capital ratios have strengthened further with municipalities, remain NWB Bank’s biggest client over the past year.

The topics emerged from discussions with stakeholders and from their policies with regard to general social and sector-specific issues. This resulted in the ‘Material Topics Plot’ (MTP) shown here, which was drawn up by the bank’s CSR committee. It turned out that the topics ‘putting the client’s interests first’ and sustainability impact (environmental and social) are highly relevant for both the stakeholders and NWB Bank itself. Their relevance is apparent from such aspects as supervisory policies, discussions with shareholders, the focus on credit ratings in the financial markets and the bank’s own policies. In 2017, the MTP was brought into line with the GRI provisions: this means that the impact of NWB Bank rather than the importance to NWB Bank is plotted on the x axis.

The Directive has now been transposed into Dutch law in two parts, effective 1 January 2017. Public shareholdings are not explicitly named as a category falling within the scope of the Directive in Dutch law. As shareholder, the Ministry of Finance asked for the non-financial information and diversity information to be included in the annual report. See the EU Directive reference table NWB Bank subscribes to the UN Global Compact principles. By signing these principles, the bank has committed to considering key themes such as human rights, the environment and anti-corruption in its business processes. It also means that NWB Bank will hold its stakeholders to account, where possible and relevant, for compliance with these principles. Further information on the implementation of these principles can be found in the GRI table on NWB Bank’s website. Together with 12 other banks, trade unions, nongovernmental organisations and the government, NWB Bank has signed the ICSR agreement to help banks ensure that human rights are respected when making investments and issuing loans. The agreement covers aspects such as working conditions, freedom to belong to a trade union, child labour and land rights, and applies to financing arrangements ‘anywhere in the world’. NWB Bank has formulated a specific Customer Due Diligence policy that is applicable both to the credit portfolio and the liquidity portfolio. It also describes the analysis of human rights.

To ensure maximum impact, in addition to missions, the NWB Fonds is also stepping up investment in skills development to promote efficient, sustainable and innovative water management. Encouraging exchanges between projects and water authorities at the start of a project is also playing an ever greater role. In recent years, partnerships have been lasting longer and results and learning benefits have improved as well. This means the €800,000 made available by the NWB Fonds is being put to good use. The impact on the global agenda for climate adaptation and Sustainable Development Goals is rising and is set to grow further in the years ahead, particularly since, with the Blue Deal, the central government and the Dutch Water Authorities have agreed to increase the level of international cooperation. 96 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS 97 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | 7 REMUNERATION REPORT 2017 HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS 7. REMUNERATION REPORT 2017 NWB Bank seeks to express the role it fulfils in society, as a bank of and for the public sector, in its remuneration policy. In opting for a moderate and sustainable remuneration policy that is in keeping with its strategy, low risk profile and risk appetite, the remuneration policy contributes to achieving the bank’s long-term objectives, which are aimed at long-term value creation.

He receives an attendance fee of €750 for each coordination meeting. REGULATIONS AND PROPORTIONALITY The bank’s remuneration policy is in line with the applicable national and international regulations, including DNB’s Restrained Remuneration Policy (Financial Supervision Act) Regulation of 2014 (Rbb) implementing the relevant provisions of CRD IV with effect from August 2014; the Wbfo; the EBA Criteria; and the CEBS Guidelines. The bank will promptly implement any amendments made to CRD V concerning remuneration. The CRD V proposals are not expected to take effect before 1 January 2019. On 4 September 2017, DNB published a draft Rbb for 2017. The final 2017 Rbb entered into force on 8 December 2017. The bank is in compliance with the 2017 Rbb, which is based on the CRD IV remuneration rules. With respect to the application of a number of elements of the Rbb, the bank invokes the proportionality principle for 2017. This means that the bank does not apply certain elements in view of its low risk profile and the modest level of variable remuneration. This relates first and foremost to the payment of at least 50% of the variable remuneration in shares or other instruments. The reasons are that the bank has a limited number of ‘identified staff’ members, no listed shares and that developing a programme or plan for payment in comparable instruments would involve disproportionately high costs and administrative expenses. In addition, the bank does not fully apply the rule that stipulates that the deferred component of the variable remuneration should amount to at least 40%. The variable remuneration of the Managing Board comprises a smaller deferred component (one third) and the variable remuneration of employees has no deferred component at all. Again, application of the rule would involve disproportionately high costs and administrative expenses.

Investing activities include the purchase and sale and settlement of interest-bearing securities held to maturity, as well as the purchase and sale of property and equipment. New long-term loans taken out and repaid (terms > 1 year) are classified as a financing activity. Segment information As the bank’s organisation is not geared towards operations in different sectors, NWB Bank’s Managing Board does not distinguish between operating segments in its assessment and decision-making about returns and the allocation of resources. Accordingly, no segment information is disclosed. Significant assumptions and estimation uncertainties The preparation of the financial statements requires that the Managing Board forms opinions and makes estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the application of accounting policies and the reported value of assets and liabilities and of income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on past experience, market information and various other factors considered to be reasonable given the circumstances. The outcomes form the basis for the opinion on most of the carrying amounts of NWB Bank’s assets and liabilities, which cannot be easily established from other sources. The actual outcomes may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly. Revisions of estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate was revised if the revision only has consequences for that period, or in both the reporting period and future periods if the revision also has consequences for future periods. 121 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS 1 NET INTEREST INCOME Interest income consists of income on loans and receivables, interest-bearing securities, cash, cash equivalents and deposits at the Central Bank, as well as commission having the nature of interest, fees received for the early redemption of financial instruments to which no hedge accounting is applied, premiums and discounts. Premiums and discounts on loans and receivables not stated at fair value are recognised using the effective interest method, together with the relevant interest income. Interest expense consists of interest expense on liabilities, whether or not embodied in debt securities, and derivatives, as well as interest-like commission, fees paid for early redemption, premiums and discounts. Premiums and discounts on debts, whether or not embodied in debt securities, not stated at fair value are recognised using the effective interest method, together with the relevant interest expense. 2017 2016 Interest income on cash, cash equivalents and deposits at the Central Bank and loans and receivables at amortised cost 1,581,441 1,655,038 Interest income on interest-bearing securities 27,251 21,873 Commission 477 1,404 Negative interest expense 5,556 1,998 Interest income 1,614,725 1,680,313 Interest expense on banks, funds entrusted, hybrid capital and debt securities at amortised cost -407,542 -551,098 Derivatives (net interest income/expense) -815,045 -832,447 Negative interest expense -116,604 -78,437 Interest expense -1,339,191 -1,461,982 Net interest income 275,534 218,331 Negative interest income concerns the negative interest on the financial assets, cash and cash equivalents and deposits at the Central Bank, banks, and loans and receivables.

Micro hedging relates to individual transactions that are included in an economic hedge relationship covering interest rate and foreign exchange risks. It involves a one-on-one relationship between the hedged instrument and the hedged item. Macro hedging relates to a group of transactions that is hedged, for interest rate risk purposes, by using a group of derivative financial instruments. While there is not always a one-on-one relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument at an individual level, it is demonstrated at a portfolio level that the derivative financial instruments in question set off the fair value changes caused by interest rate fluctuations. 122 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS The results from financial transactions can be broken down as follows: 2017 2016 Changes in the fair value of derivatives included in macro hedge accounting 2,704,465 -2,107,746 Revaluation of financial assets and liabilities included in hedge accounting -2,707,139 2,106,024 Macro hedge accounting ineffectiveness -2,674 -1,722 Micro hedge accounting ineffectiveness -129 32 Total hedge accounting ineffectiveness -2,803 -1,690 Other changes in the fair value of restructured derivatives included in hedge accounting -63,114 -54,477 Changes in the fair value of derivatives not included in hedge accounting 3,671 554 Change in counterparty credit risk (CVA/DVA) -939 -487 Results from maturity extensions and early redemptions 735 24,902 Other fair value changes 4,260 6,646 Total -58,190 -24,522 The other changes in the fair value of restructured derivatives included in hedge accounting were caused by the restructuring of the derivatives portfolio on several occasions in the past with a view to managing the interest rate risk position. The restructuring of the derivatives portfolio has a favourable effect on net interest income (lower interest expenses). The other fair value changes include changes in the fair value of financial instruments after the moment of purchase or sale, and entering into or terminating the hedge relationship, premiums and fees received and paid upon the settlement of derivative contracts, realised revaluation gains on the sale of interest-bearing securities and commission. The fair value when applying hedge accounting to the financial instruments is €16,744 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: €19,302 million) on the assets side of the balance sheet, and €12,836 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: €18,555 million) on the liabilities side. NWB Bank borrows significant amounts in foreign currency. The associated risks are immediately and fully hedged by means of currency swaps. The currency risks run by NWB Bank are minimal. 123 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS 3 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE The average number of employees expressed in FTEs, including the Managing Board, totalled 57.2 at the end of the financial year (2016: 53.2).

The amounts for 2017 and 2016 are based on the balance sheet at year-end 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are charged to the profit for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Bank tax is based on the ratio of current liabilities at the end of the previous financial year amounting to €22,898 million (2016: €25,835 million) and long-term liabilities for the previous financial year amounting to €70,009 million (2016: €64,080 million). The total amount of bank tax paid in 2017 was €19.9 million (2016: €19.8 million). Under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the bank is required to pay a resolution levy.

The initial tranche of €200 million was issued in September 2015. The loans are intended to boost NWB Bank’s Tier 1 capital in order to meet the leverage ratio requirement. The second tranche of €120.5 million was issued in 2016. No new hybrid capital was raised in 2017. The loans were issued by Dutch public sector parties and subordinated to receivables from creditors with a higher order of priority than ordinary shares. In addition, the loans are perpetual and do not have a fixed repayment date. Early redemption is subject to the consent of the regulatory authority on dates agreed in advance or in specific situations. The interest rate is between 2.34% and 4.025% for the first period until the first early redemption date and will be subsequently reviewed provided no early redemptions have been made. Interest payments by the bank are entirely discretionary. If the Tier 1 core capital ratio declines below 5.125%, the notional principal amount of this and all similar type loans will be reduced by the amount required to take the Tier 1 core capital ratio above the 5.125% level.

When determining the fair value of financial instruments, reference is made to market prices to the extent the financial instruments are traded in an active market. Such market prices are unavailable for most financial instruments, however. In such cases the fair value is determined using measurement models. The models use various assumptions relating to the discount rate and the timing and the size of the projected future cash flows. When calculating the fair value of options, generally accepted option pricing models are used. The bank establishes on a regular basis that the application of the measurement models leads to reliable fair values that fit the risk profile of the assets and liabilities. Ongoing changes in market conditions require the bank to adjust, on a regular basis, the measurement parameters that serve as inputs for the measurement models. 145 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Loans and receivables, and debt securities A measurement model is used to determine the fair value of loans and receivables, and debt securities. The model is also used as a basis for internal risk reports. The principle underlying the model is a going concern approach pursuant to which the bank: 1) generally grants the loans that it holds until they mature, and 2) funds the relatively long-term loans with shorter-term loans on average. The measurement curve is based on the average cost of funding, which is the swap interest rate plus a spread. The spread is effectively a measure of the additional funding charges the bank pays on account of liquidity and credit risks. Those additional charges are determined based on the funding outstanding as at the reporting date. The spread resulting from this calculation method is used across all relevant maturities (continuous curve). The assumption is that the spreads applying to the bank are equally representative of the non-market-observable spreads applying to the bank’s borrowers. Interest-bearing securities Other listed interest-bearing securities are carried at market prices. The fair values of the other interest-bearing securities are determined using the model that is also used for loans and receivables. Derivatives Derivatives are measured by applying generally accepted valuation models, based on the most appropriate valuation curves, which include the OIS curve. A credit valuation adjustment and a debt valuation adjustment are also included the measurement. The curves used reflect the price level at which the bank closes swaps. Credit risks associated with the derivatives transactions entered into are largely mitigated by exchanging collateral. 146 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Overview of fair values of financial instruments The following table sets out the estimated fair value of the financial assets and liabilities and other financial instruments not disclosed on the face of the balance sheet.

These derivatives are included under the interest rate derivatives in the above table. 33 RISK MANAGEMENT The bank’s strategy places strict requirements on risk management and on the organisation and enforcement of adequate internal controls. NWB Bank has adopted an organisation-wide approach to risk management and its control. The bank has a risk appetite framework in place which is updated annually and sets out the degree and areas of risk NWB Bank is prepared to accept in achieving its strategic objectives. The risk appetite is approved by the Supervisory Board. The internal risk management system for each relevant type of risk is described in the remainder of this section. 149 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS INTEREST RATE RISK: ‘The possible impact on profit and capital of interest rate fluctuations’ The bank’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates arises from differences in the interest rate and terms between lending and borrowing. The bank pursues a prudent policy towards these risks. The policy is to manage the interest rate risk bank-wide by taking out interest rate derivatives for both the asset and the liability side of the balance sheet, in which the bank agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest rates calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. However, the bank is prepared to adopt a strategic interest rate risk position and thereby achieve a result aimed at realising the level of return on equity agreed with the shareholders. The benchmark for the return on equity is based on the income from a ten-year continuous investment in a ten-year Dutch government bond, plus a surcharge appropriate to the bank’s profile. The surcharge is included in the bank’s Fund Transfer Pricing model, which is applied to new lending. The strategic position is independent of any vision on interest rate developments and is determined on a quarterly basis. Prudent policy, supplemented by a management system tailored to that policy, constitutes the basis for the calculation, monitoring and management of the interest rate risks. The Asset & Liability committee (alco) decides on the size of the risks within the parameters set. To manage risks, a gap analysis according to the interest rate period, risk measures such as (spread) DV01 (see below) and earnings at risk, and scenario analyses are used. Outcomes from positions adopted are analysed using profit forecasts, interest margin analysis and performance analysis. This management information is also important for the decision-making process within the alco. Interest rate sensitivity analysis (DV01) NWB Bank uses DV01 (the dollar value of a basis point) as the key measure of interest rate risk. An absolute measure derived from duration, it indicates the change in price or fair value, expressed in monetary units, caused by a one basis point (0.01%) change in the yield curve. A system of DV01 limits applies to the overall interest rate risk position which follows from the bank’s risk appetite. These limits are related to the strategic interest rate position. The interest rate sensitivity of the portfolio to which macro hedging is applied is monitored on the basis of DV01s for various time intervals. To manage spread risk related to the refinancing of the bank, a spread DV01 measure and concomitant limit apply. They indicate a maturity mismatch between funding and lending. The spread DV01 is quantified on the basis of the interest rate sensitivity of all long-term lending and funding. At year-end 2017, it was within the limit set. Earnings at Risk In addition to the DV01 analysis, which provides an insight into the interest rate risk for the total term of the portfolio, NWB Bank applies the Earnings at Risk measure for the short term, with the aim of setting limits to the volatility of interest income during the next 365 days. This is a simulation measure, comparing the expected net interest income or expense for the next twelve months under various interest rate scenarios with the outcome of a baseline scenario. At year-end 2017, the outcomes for those scenarios were within the limits set. 150 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Gap analysis A gap analysis according to the interest rate period is shown below based on the contractual interest review date or redemption date if the latter is earlier.

The derivatives plus centrally cleared derivatives include notional amounts to give a clearer picture of interest rate positions. Accordingly, no direct link can be made to the balance sheet. Scenario analysis NWB Bank performs scenario analyses to gain an additional insight into the interest rate risk. A common scenario is to calculate the changes in the fair value of equity in the event of a parallel shift in the yield curve of -100 basis points (bp) and +100 bp. The effect of this sudden change in the interest rate as at 31 December 2017 is shown in the table below. It shows the consequential changes in fair value which have been subsequently broken down into the effect on the result of the current financial year and the effect on future annual results. The long-term effect merely indicates an opportunity loss. In other words, if NWB Bank had fully hedged its interest rate position, its future financial results would have been €96 million higher (2016: €101 million higher) in the event of a 100 bp rise in interest rates. 151 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS (in millions of euros) Total fair value Immediate effect on Long-term effect on change profit or loss future profit or loss Interest rate shock of +100 bp -91 5 -96 Interest rate shock of -100 bp 40 -6 46 LIQUIDITY RISK: ‘The possible impact on profit and capital of not being able to meet current obligations without incurring unacceptable losses’ NWB Bank has an AAA/Aaa credit rating identical to that of the Dutch State. With this credit rating, under normal circumstances, NWB Bank should always easily be able to cover its current and future liquidity requirements in the market. In the event of market stagnation, NWB Bank has sufficient means, among other things in the form of liquid assets and collateral pledged with DNB, to repay loans and finance new loans at all times. NWB Bank currently has an ample collateral position at DNB. Virtually the entire loans portfolio of NWB Bank is accepted as collateral at DNB. The collateral value of the portion of portfolio contributed as collateral to DNB was €11.8 billion as at 31 December 2017 (€12.4 billion as at 31 December 2016). However, NWB Bank did not call on this position. In terms of short-term funding, NWB Bank mainly relies on the commercial paper market. The bank uses an ECP programme capped at €25 billion and a USCP programme capped at $15 billion. The bank has the highest short-term ratings (A-1+/P-1) with respect to those programmes. The outstanding commercial paper as at 31 December 2017 totalled €9.6 billion (as at 31 December 2016: €10.4 billion). The liquidity position is monitored daily. The aim of liquidity management is to ensure that there are sufficient funds available for the bank to meet not only foreseen, but also unforeseen financial commitments. The bank’s management is informed daily by means of a liquidity gap analysis, containing differences between the cash flows receivable and payable. The liquidity position is subject to a system of limits. One limit relates to the LCR, a liquidity ratio set out in CRD IV/CRR (Capital Requirements Directive IV/Capital Requirements Regulation) to which a minimum requirement applies with effect from 1 October 2015. DNB requires Dutch banks to maintain a minimum LCR of 100% as at the effective date. The internal LCR limit is higher than the minimum requirement. Along with LCR, another liquidity risk will also be included in the regulations: the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). A minimum requirement of 100% is expected to apply with effect from 1 January 2019. NWB Bank meets both minimum requirements as at 31 December 2017. The LCR was 178% at the balance sheet date (2016: 146%) and the NSFR 126% (2016: 123%). 152 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS The balance sheet categories according to the remaining contractual term, including all future undiscounted interest cash flows, as well as centrally cleared derivatives and before proposed profit appropriation, are presented below.

NWB Bank principally lends to governments and government-backed institutions. It also provides loans to water supply companies and finances PPP projects with the government as the contracting authority. Other new client groups in the public sector will be added to the loans portfolio, such as university medical centres and regional network managers. Furthermore, to a limited extent the bank purchases bonds issued by governments in Western European countries and international organisations, and covered bonds securitised by Dutch mortgage loans, applying the same quality standards as for domestic lending. Lastly, the bank enters into agreements with banks for money market transactions and currency and interest rate swaps, which result in counterparty risk. In financing the Dutch public authorities and institutions under guarantee from the Dutch government no limits are applied by the bank; these positions are also exempted from the Large Positions rules set out in the CRR. The other loans are included in the bank’s credit assessment system pursuant to its credit risk management policy. If a credit limit is set for a borrower, it is adjusted annually, at a minimum, in line with the latest developments. Decision-making on lending subject to solvency requirements takes place in the Credit Committee based on a credit proposal from the public finance department and an independent risk assessment from the risk management department. The Corporate Social Responsibility aspects of credit risk management policy are set out in the Corporate Social Responsibility section. Given the public sector nature of the majority of its clients who, moreover, are exempt from solvency requirements, the credit risk of the loans portfolio is limited, which is also reflected in the robust capital ratios. The gross balance sheet value (including irrevocable commitments and contingent liabilities), without taking risk mitigation measures into account, totalled €91.2 billion at the end of 2017 (€98.3 billion at the end of 2016). The total credit risk (including irrevocable commitments) expressed in risk-weighted assets based on the standard approach as set out in the CRR is as follows at the reporting date: 154 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS 2017 Europe North Total RWA America NL EU Non-EU Central governments 0-50% 9,815 100 9,915 Regional government 0% 17,241 26 17,267 Institutions with delegated 20-100% 48,473 50 48,523 663 government duties Development banks 0% 60 60 International organisations 0% 258 258 Banking counterparties* 2-50% 5,006 4,483 309 998 10,796 456 RMBS (NHG) notes* 20-100% 1,711 1,711 420 Covered bonds 10% 458 458 46 Other 0-100% 8 8 8 Total 82,712 4,977 309 998 88,996 1,593 2016 Europe North Total RWA America NL EU Non-EU Central governments 0-50% 7,483 46 7,528 23 Regional government 0% 17,245 26 17,271 Institutions with delegated 20-100% 51,430 51,430 674 government duties Development banks 0% 63 63 International organisations 0% 315 315 Banking counterparties* 2%-50% 6,298 6,492 325 1,106 14,221 560 RMBS (NHG) notes* 20-100% 2,145 2,145 522 Covered bonds 10% 328 328 33 Other 0%-100% 9 9 9 Total 84,938 6,942 325 1,106 93,311 1,821 * Based on external rating (External Credit Assessment Institution) Most of NWB Bank’s lending comes under the category of a 0% weighting, which means that the credit risk is considered to be very limited. The counterparty risks and potential money market lending by banking counterparties come under the 20% and 50% weighting categories. The RMBS with a government-backed National Mortgage Guarantee (NHG) notes come under the 20% weighting and 50% weighting categories if they are senior A notes. A smaller portion (lower S notes) comes under the 100% weighting category. Lastly, loans provided to Dutch water supply companies (government-controlled public limited liability companies) and PPP financing are included in the 100% weighting category. 155 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS The table below provides an insight into the breakdown of loans granted (paid out) by the bank: (in millions of euros) 2017 Balance sheet 2016 Balance sheet Nominal value value Nominal value value Water authorities 6,187 7,106 5,953 7,171 Municipal authorities 5,932 6,793 6,268 7,389 Other public authorities 269 355 291 393 Social housing 29,973 40,363 31,005 43,367 Healthcare institutions 3,092 3,763 3,277 4,107 Other borrowers under 431 476 634 711 government guarantee Joint schemes 706 730 219 245 Government-controlled public 408 428 350 375 limited liability companies Public-private partnerships 140 139 109 107 Credit institutions 100 100 100 100 Other 42 45 54 57 Total 47,280 60,298 48,260 64,022 NWB Bank’s borrowers as listed above are mainly public authorities and entities in the social housing and healthcare sectors to which funds are lent guaranteed by the public authorities. The bank has never suffered a loan loss. Owing to the adequate guarantees obtained and the very limited credit risk, no losses on the loans granted are expected. Therefore, no provision for uncollectible receivables was formed, nor were any loans written down on account of credit risk. Both during the year and at the balance sheet date, arrears were low in monetary terms (non-material), were of a technical nature and of a very short duration. In 2017, NWB Bank held notes of RMBS programmes from five Dutch originators in its portfolio, securitised by Dutch mortgage loans backed by the government under the National Mortgage Guarantee scheme (NHG). By purchasing these bonds, NWB Bank contributes to the financing of government-guaranteed private home loans. NWB Bank only actively uses securitisation in its role as an investor, monitors the associated credit, market and liquidity risks during the period to maturity and firmly intends to hold the RMBS (NHG) notes until the expected expiry date. Credit risk is expressed in risk-weighted assets based on the Standard Approach to Securitisations as set out in Article 251 of the CRR, in which the ratings issued by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch are used to indicate credit risk. The table below shows the data as at 31 December 2017.

To limit the credit risks associated with these derivatives as far as possible, in principle, NWB Bank only enters into transactions (unless they have been cleared centrally) with counterparties with a single-A rating at a minimum, and limits are set to minimise the total exposure from derivatives. The fair values of these derivatives are hedged by collateral agreements (CSAs) using mostly zero thresholds and by exchanging collateral on a daily basis, in cash. The bank’s policy is to conclude agreements with counterparties within the ISDA framework consisting of at least agreements in ISDA schedules and CSAs which ensure that netting agreements apply. In 2017, CSAs concluded with the majority of counterparties were amended to bring them into line with the new market standard (Variation Margin CSA, or VM CSA), to ensure compliance with the statutory obligation to exchange collateral daily for non-cleared derivatives. Portfolio management, monitoring and collateral management have been stepped up over the past years with respect to the individual derivatives portfolios for each counterparty, as well as for the total derivatives portfolio. This involves monitoring sensitivities in counterparty-specific portfolios and the option of novating a portfolio, or part thereof, to a central counterparty under central clearing in due course. Since 2016, the bank’s interest rate derivatives have been cleared by a central counterparty, which has further reduced counterparty risk. In addition, concentrations in the derivatives portfolio are assessed and adjusted in terms of interest rate sensitivities, credit ratings and other early warning signals for each counterparty. The total fair value exposure from derivatives to financial counterparties at year-end 2017 was €642 million, of which €506 million was covered by collateral pledged to the bank (2016: €1,937 million and €1,791 million). The total fair value exposure from derivatives from financial counterparties at year-end 2017 was €8,240 million, of which €8,188 million was covered by collateral provided by the bank (2016: €10,515 million and €10,309 million). The tables below show the net fair values of the derivatives, i.e. including collateral received and provided.

The derivatives entered into with non-banking counterparties are embedded derivatives in the form of agreements which are included in the loan contracts. No ISDA or CSA agreements have been made, which means that no netting takes places for these parties. Settlement risk refers to the risk that, in settling a transaction, a counterparty fails to meet its obligations while the bank meets its own. Instances in which this may happen include when the notional amount of a currency swap is ultimately exchanged, which is used to repay the associated funding in foreign currency. The currency risk arising from funding in foreign currency is hedged on a one-on-one basis using currency swaps. The bank monitors settlement risks arising chiefly upon payment and receipt of foreign currency during currency swaps. CURRENCY RISK: ‘The possible impact on profit and capital of changes in exchange rates’ The bank’s policy is to eliminate all currency risks on both loans granted and borrowings. Currency risks arise primarily in respect of funds borrowed by the bank. NWB Bank borrows significant amounts in foreign currency. The resulting currency risks are fully hedged immediately by entering into currency swaps. 158 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS The table below shows the nominal values in millions in local currencies. 2017 2016 CCY Asset Liability Derivatives Total Asset Liability Derivatives Total AUD -3,779 3,779 -3,504 3,504 CAD -592 592 -1,387 1,387 CHF -3,260 3,260 -3,400 3,400 GBP -1,927 1,927 -1,723 1,723 HKD -100 100 -100 100 JPY -175,403 175,403 -186,800 -186,800 NOK -500 500 -3,500 3,500 NZD 0 0 -100 100 SEK -4,630 4,630 -1,100 1,100 USD 52 -32,158 32,106 104 -29,427 29,323 ZAR -116 116 -116 116 NON-FINANCIAL RISKS: ‘The possible impact on profit and capital of interest rate fluctuations’ The non-financial risks at NWB Bank are subdivided into two categories, i.e. strategic and operational risks. STRATEGIC RISKS: ‘The possible impact on profit and capital of the risk that the bank’s strategy no longer contributes to the profitability and continuity of the bank’ An important principle in managing strategic risk is the retention of the bank’s high-quality risk profile as reflected in its credit ratings. In order to be able to optimally serve its clients, it is essential that the bank’s credit ratings remain in line with those of the Dutch government. The bank’s ratings largely depend on the public sector profile of its shareholders and clients, combined with its strong solvency position. External factors that could potentially affect this are closely monitored. Where necessary, the Managing Board adjusts the bank’s strategy in a timely manner. As a promotional bank for and established by the Dutch public sector, the bank is sensitive to changes in government policy concerning public sector funding. NWB Bank maintains a continuous and constructive dialogue with its stakeholders on this topic. Another important focus area for the Managing Board in terms of strategic risk is the impact of the constantly changing laws and regulations with which NWB Bank as a financial institution must comply. Reputational risk, the risk that the bank’s reputation will be tarnished, is another key aspect of strategic risk. Reputational risk could impair the conditions enabling the bank to meet its objectives, due to the bank no 159 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS longer meeting the expectations of its clients, the supervisory authorities, rating agencies, investors and other stakeholders. The bank’s Managing Board is responsible for managing the above strategic risks. OPERATIONAL RISK: ‘The possible impact on profit and capital of inadequate or ineffective internal processes and systems, inadequate or ineffective human actions or external events’ General management of operational risks To help it put into effect its mission to be a robust and sustainable bank for the public sector, the bank has set its risk appetite at a low level. Its internal organisation, processes and systems are designed in such a manner that operational incidents and the associated losses are kept to a minimum. In 2017, in consultation with the ECB, the bank made the transition to a standardised approach for the management of operational risks to ensure prudential supervision. This transition has no impact on the level of capital to be maintained, but does require the bank’s operational risk management to be conducted on a more formal basis. That is why all aspects of the operational risk management framework were assessed and, where necessary, tightened up in 2017. For instance, in the past year the bank set up an ORM unit and extended the Operational Risk Committee with various disciplines, making it a Non-Financial Risk Committee (NFRC), on which the full Managing Board is represented. The bank’s operational risk management is based on the three lines of defence principle where the first line (heads of the treasury, public finance, back office, ICT, legal, and finance & control departments) is responsible for controlling operational risks in the bank’s primary processes. The second line supports the first line with its activities and ensures the effectiveness of risk management by adopting an advisory and a monitoring role and providing a framework. The second line is made up of the ORM team, comprising the operational risk officer, the HR manager, the security manager and the compliance officer, and reports to the Managing Board and the NFRC. The ORM team manages, among other things, the following tools from the operational risk management framework: • Risk control self-assessments: an annual self-assessment in respect of the risks and the effectiveness of the first line’s process and control measures. The systematic integrity risk analysis was integrated into it as from 2017. • Key risk indicators: indicators have been created for various sub-categories of operational risk so that the bank’s risk controls can be assessed. • Register of incidents and reporting: incidents are recorded and reported to the NFRC, where measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring are put in place, where applicable. • AO/IC: the processes, risks and associated key controls are set out in a risk & control framework and assessed and adjusted on an annual basis. • The non-financial risk report is a new, comprehensive non-financial risk report to the NFRC and the management team. 160 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS The internal audit department (iad) forms the third line of defence and has an independent role within the bank. The iad tests the management of risks associated with the bank’s activities. In addition, the iad advises on the structure and risk management of the bank. New products or services The Product Approval and Review Process (PARP) refers to the procedures the bank follows in deciding whether it will offer or distribute a certain product, either at its own risk and expense or for the benefit of its clients, or whether it will enter a new market. This process involves a widely scoped review in terms of transparency and risk management. No new product is marketed without careful consideration of the risks by the relevant departments at the bank and meticulous checks against other relevant aspects. The Managing Board is responsible for the effectiveness of the product approval process. Based on its annual risk assessment, the iad audits the design, existence and effectiveness of the process and reports its findings to the Managing Board and the Audit and Risk Committees. ICT, continuity management and information security To prevent disruptions to the information systems, NWB Bank makes ongoing investments to improve its systems. Key words include security, integrity, manageability and continuity. A transparent infrastructure and ICT organisation and optimum security of ICT components are in place to minimise the impact of any operational disruptions at NWB Bank. For this purpose, adequate service and maintenance contracts have been concluded for all relevant hardware and software, ICT employees receive ongoing training through classes and seminars and contracts have been entered into with external parties for backup, recovery and contingency facilities. In the event of a disaster, NWB Bank has access to an external location where it can continue all its core activities. The bank’s information security policy is based on ISO 27002 (NEN), the internationally recognised information security standard. Information management NWB Bank has a reliable, fully integrated management information system (MIS). The data quality of the MIS is monitored, validated and reconciled with the financial accounting records on a daily basis. In order to minimise the operational risks, all the internal and external reports are fully automated. Adjustments in the system landscape and information systems are approved by the Change Advisory Board and implemented through a controlled change process. Outsourcing The bank has outsourced its client funds transfers and the related ICT support operations. This means that certain services are performed outside the company. Agreements have therefore been made with the service provider on control measures for funds transfers. 161 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Integrity and compliance NWB Bank attaches great value to its reputation as a solid and respectable bank for the public sector. For this reason, compliance and integrity play an important role in the bank’s control mechanism. The bank wishes to ensure that its clients and investors can be completely confident in using its services and secure in the knowledge that their funds are safe. The Supervisory and Managing Board members as well as staff have taken the banker’s oath (which includes the relevant code of conduct and disciplinary rules) pursuant to the Dutch Oath or Promise (Financial Sector) Regulation or the Dutch Banking Code, which took effect on 1January 2015. NWB Bank also has a Code of Conduct, which forms part of the employment contracts and has been posted on both the Intranet and the bank’s website. NWB Bank has assigned some of the compliance-based duties to the legal & compliance department and the supervision of compliance with the Insider Regulation to an external party. The external supervisor reports to the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board, while the internal compliance officer reports directly to the Managing Board. These reporting lines confirm the value that the bank attaches to internal supervision and to the work of both compliance officers. The supervision-based rules and rules of conduct are an important element of the compliance role. The rapid succession of new and complex laws and regulations puts increasing pressure on the management of compliance risks. The bank has set up a regulatory team in the light of the need to closely monitor developments in laws and regulations. Legal risk Like any other bank, NWB Bank is exposed to legal risk. NWB Bank operates on the principle of providing proper and sound financial services. By using standard contracts as far as possible, NWB Bank endeavours to reduce the legal risks for both itself and its clients. If needed, external advisers are consulted on legal issues and to review documents relating to these transactions. MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS The standardised method for determining the capital requirement stipulates how much capital a bank must reserve for credit risk purposes. This method uses external ratings linked to certain risk weightings. NWB Bank uses the credit ratings of Moody’s, S&P and/or Fitch for this purpose. The capital requirement pursuant to the CVA is additional to the capital requirement for counterparty default risk. This capital requirement is calculated using a standard formula based on exposure, rating and average terms of derivatives positions entered into with counterparties, among other things. The market risk concerns risks in the trading portfolio and currency and commodity risks. NWB Bank does not keep a trading portfolio and has no commodity positions. Due to its stringent policy on currency risk, on balance there are no outstanding currency positions, and therefore the capital that is to be reserved to cover market risk is nil. When calculating qualifying capital for operational risk, NWB Bank has been using the standard approach with effect from 2017. Under this approach, 15% of the relevant indicator is taken as a benchmark for the operational risk. The relevant indicator is the three-year average of the total of the annual net interest income and the annual net non-interest income at the end of the financial year. The Large Positions rules stipulate how much capital a bank must reserve for concentration risk. NWB Bank’s large positions are mainly connected to the derivatives portfolio. The risks arising from these positions are limited as far as possible by concluding CSAs and applying netting to derivatives contracts. 162 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Calculation of the Tier I capital ratio as at the reporting date: 2017 2016 Equity excluding profit for the current financial year 1,505 1,400 Intangible assets -2 -2 Prudential filters -3 -2 CET1 capital 1,500 1,396 Additional Tier 1 capital 320 320 Tier 1 capital (A) 1,820 1,716 Weighted credit risk (SA) 1,593 1,821 Capital requirement pursuant to CVA (SA) 796 938 Weighted operational risk (SA, BIA) 291 220 Risk-weighted assets (B) 2,680 2,979 Tier 1 ratio (A/B) 68% 58% At the end of 2017, visible equity totalled €1,505 million (excluding profit for the current financial year) against €1,400 million at year-end 2016 (excluding profit for the current financial year). CET1 capital including Additional Tier 1 capital amounted to €1,820 million at year-end 2017 (excluding profit for the current financial year) against €1,716 million at year-end 2016 (excluding profit for the current financial year). The bank’s total risk-weighted assets fell from €2,979 million at the end of 2016 to €2,680 million at the end of 2017. That fall is largely due to the use of central clearing for derivatives and a decline in the NHG RMBS portfolio. 34 INFORMATION ON RELATED PARTIES The shareholders and the members of the Managing and Supervisory Boards qualify as related parties. With respect to the obligation to report information on related parties, there are no particular circumstances at NWB Bank that warrant disclosure. For more information on the remuneration of, and loans to, members of the Supervisory Board and the Managing Board, please refer to Note 4. As at 31 December 2017, an amount of €6,331 million in loans had been granted to shareholders on market terms (2016: €6,244 million). 163 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS 35 EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE No material events occurred between the reporting date and the date of the preparation of the financial statements that had such an impact on the overall presentation of the financial statements that disclosure in this section was considered necessary. 36 MEMBERS OF THE MANAGING BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD Managing Board Lidwin van Velden Frenk van der Vliet Supervisory Board Age Bakker Maurice Oostendorp Peter Glas Petra van Hoeken Toon van der Klugt Frida van den Maagdenberg Manfred Schepers The Hague, 15 March 2018 164 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS 165 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT To: the shareholders and supervisory board of Nederlandse Waterschapsbank N.V. Report on the audit of the financial statements 2017 included in the annual report Our opinion We have audited the financial statements 2017 of Nederlandse Waterschapsbank N.V. (hereinafter referred to as ‘NWB Bank’), based in The Hague. In our opinion the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of NWB Bank as at 31 December 2017, and of its result for 2017 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The financial statements comprise:  The balance sheet as at 31 December 2017  The statement of income for 2017  The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information Basis for our opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ section of our report. We are independent of NWB Bank in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the Verordening gedragsen beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 166 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Materiality Materiality € 15 million Benchmark applied 1% of equity Rational  ased on our professional judgement we consider B an equity-based measure as the most appropriate basis to determine materiality as it provides a stable basis for determining materiality and is one of the key performance measures for the users of the financial statements. We have also taken misstatements into account and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons. We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of € 750.000 which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds. Our key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 167 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Our key audit matters are consistent with last year. Key audit matters Hedge accounting Risk NWB Bank hedges interest rate risks and currency risks related to financial assets and liabilities through the use of financial instruments. The application of hedge accounting enables the synchronization of the reported results for the hedging instrument and the hedged position, insofar the hedge is effective. NWB Bank uses derivatives as hedging instruments and measures these on the balance sheet at fair value. Both the fair value adjustments of the hedged position related to the hedged risk and the fair value adjustments of the derivatives are recorded in the statement of income as result from financial transactions. NWB Bank applies two types of fair value hedge accounting, micro and macro hedging. NWB Bank has developed specific models to calculate hedge effectiveness. The hedge accounting models used by NWB Bank to determine the effectiveness of the hedges is significant for our audit, since the process is complex, highly subjective and based on assumptions. Our audit approach We assessed and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the controls over hedge accounting. Furthermore, we have evaluated the adequacy of the hedge documentation, supported by our hedge accounting specialists and audited the significant parameters used for the fair valuation of derivatives and hedged items. In addition, we have audited the hedge effectiveness calculations and assessed the completeness and correctness of the disclosures relating to hedge accounting, evaluated Dutch GAAP thereof and our valuation specialists re-performed the fair value calculations for selected derivative curves and hedged items. 168 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Key observations Based on our procedures performed no material findings were noted with respect to the adequacy of the hedge documentation and the hedge effectiveness tests. We found the disclosure on hedge accounting in accordance with Dutch GAAP requirements. Fair value measurement of financial instruments Risk Fair value measurement of financial instruments and associated valuation adjustments can be a subjective area insofar model based valuations are applied due to lower liquidity and limited price availability. Most investments of NWB Bank qualify as so called ‘level 1’ financial instruments and have quoted prices in an active (listed) market. The main focus is on the level 2 financial instruments (derivatives) as for the fair value determination models are used with market observable data. The valuation was significant for our audit because the estimation process is complex, subjective and based on assumptions. Our audit approach As part of our audit we have requested our valuation specialists to re-perform the fair value calculation for a representative sample of derivative contracts. Also, we have evaluated the fair value hierarchy and migrations within the hierarchy during the year, we have audited compliance and consistency with Dutch GAAP on disclosure of financial instruments and evaluated developments in credit spreads for the fair value determination of the portfolio. Key observations We have not identified any material misstatements regarding the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments as at 31 December 2017 and the related notes in the financial statements impacting our audit opinion. 169 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Credit quality loan portfolio and loan loss provision Risk Credit risk and the related impairments are limited for NWB Bank as the majority of the portfolio consists of government guaranteed exposures. For the remainder of the portfolio, NWB Bank evaluated whether there were any objective indicators of impairment. As NWB Bank is expanding their activity in non-guaranteed exposure identified this as a key audit matter. Our audit approach We have assessed the internal control measures for determination of impairment as well as the credit risk evaluations performed by NWB Bank and independently re-assessed indicators of impairment for a number of risk-based selected files. Furthermore, we reconciled the guarantees as confirmed by WSW and WFZ with NWB Bank’s loan portfolio. In addition we sent out positive as well as negative confirmations to the clients of NWB Bank to verify the existence of the portfolio. Key observations NWB Bank has no non-performing loans nor any defaults in its portfolio as per year-end 2017. Following our procedures we concur with management’s conclusion that a provision for credit losses is not required. Report on other information included in the annual report In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of:  The report of the managing board  The report of the supervisory board to the shareholders  Corporate governance  Corporate Social Responsibility; and  Other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:  Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements  Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch 170 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements. Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the report of the managing board in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Engagement We were engaged by the general meeting of shareholders as auditor of NWB Bank on 23 April 2015, as of the audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor since that date. No prohibited non-audit services We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. Other non-prohibited services provided In addition to the statutory audit of the financial statements we provided the assurance on prudential returns, corporate social responsibility and credit claims. Description of responsibilities for the financial statements Responsibilities of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process. Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all material errors and fraud. 171 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included e.g.,:  Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control  Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control  Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management  Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern  Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures  Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect we also submit an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report. We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 172 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2017 | HEADLINE ORGANISATION REPORT OF THE REPORT OF THE CORPORATE CORPORATE SOCIAL REMUNERATION FINANCIAL FIGURES MANAGING BOARD SUPERVISORY BOARD GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT STATEMENTS From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.
