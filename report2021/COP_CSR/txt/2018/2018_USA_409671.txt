Ban Ki-moon Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 Dear Mr. Secretary General, We are pleased to confirm that Middle East Investment Initiative (MEII) reaffirms its support of the ten principles of the Unites Nation’s Global Compact (UNGC) with respect to human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. In this annual Communication of Progress (COP), we report on the efforts we have taken in 2016 to incorporate the ten principles in our organization’s strategy, culture, and day-to-day operations. We believe these actions have contributed to a stronger foundation for our organization and for our future growth. We are committed to engaging in collaborative projects, which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. MEII is proud to share this commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a COP that describes our company’s efforts to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to report on progress annually according to the Global Compact COP policy. It is an honor to work with the UNGC in our collective mission, and we look forward to the progress we can make together over the course of 2017 and beyond.
