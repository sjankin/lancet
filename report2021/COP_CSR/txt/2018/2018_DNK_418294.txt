Sustainable and ethical business practices are embedded in our organizational culture and daily activities. In 2014, we adopted a CSR Policy to gain a more comprehensive overview of our activities, followed by a CSR Strategy with goals for 20152017. Furthermore, Clipper became a member of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) in 2016. We continue to support UN Global Compact and are committed to the initiative and its principles. Good cooperation with other stakeholders is an important part of our CSR efforts. We value the collaboration with Danish Shipping’s CSR committee where we are active members, and work closely with other shipping companies. As the latest example, I can mention The Blueprint Project, a cooperation between Danish shipping companies and the Danish Embassy in Turkey against corruption. You can read more about it in the anti-corruption section on page 12. Clipper’s 2018-2020 CSR strategy is under development. It will reflect on our ongoing efforts to make a positive impact as a globally operating shipping company. Peter Norborg Group CEO Clipper Group 3 CLIPPER GROUP CSR REPORT 2017 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS Shipping is an international industry with a large impact on the environment and societies around the world. As a leading dry bulk carrier, we have considered how to contribute to UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015. In this report, we do not relate specifically to the individual goals, as we wish to keep the scope on our current CSR strategy, but we believe that the following four goals are especially relevant to us: Goal no. 2 – End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. Agro products such as grain are among our most important cargo types, and we actively participate in facilitating world trade and global development. In 2017, agricultural products and fertilizers accounted for about 50% of the cargo we transported. Goal no. 9 – Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable economic industrialization and foster innovation. As a shipping company dealing with raw materials and global trade, this goal is extremely relevant to us. On one hand, we are part of building the world’s infrastructure at sea. On the other hand, we transport products like steel and cement used in the building and production industries. Steel products accounted for 13% of the cargo we transported in 2017. Goal no. 13 – Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Although shipping is the most environment friendly mean of mass transportation when it comes to CO2 emissions per transported ton, our industry stands for about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. Clipper supports the climate policy developed by Danish Shipping, which takes an ambitious CO2 approach for the global shipping sector. Goal no. 14 – Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. This is highly relevant goal to a shipping company and closely related to our general climate approach. In this report, we report on four different environmentally related goals. 4 CLIPPER GROUP CSR REPORT 2017 CSR ACTIVITIES AND REPORTING AT CLIPPER CLIPPER CSR POLICY As a significant player in the maritime industry with a global presence at sea and on shore, we recognize our social and environmental responsibility: • We never compromise the safety of our employees at sea or ashore • We recognize our responsibility towards the environment, and endeavor to constantly reduce our environmental footprint We build our CSR activities upon our CSR Policy, adThe present report covers the four main areas of the 10 opted in 2014.

We also focus on personal development areas for these two groups. and all Clipper employees have annual appraisals with their managers to secure continuous professional development. Towards the end of 2017, Clipper employed 289 people in our offices in 10 countries. Of these, 128 worked at our Copenhagen headquarters. 5 CLIPPER GROUP CSR REPORT 2017 Diversity / Women in management To us, diversity is good business.

In 2017, we introduced a new safety campaign with the so-called Safety Delta concept. It entails a survey of the safety culture on board the individual vessel, followed by a score and relevant tools and games to improve any weak spots. The reporting of events is a good indicator of a healthy safety culture, and we had set high goals for event reporting with minimum 6 events reported per vessel per month. An increase in reported events is not indicative of a decrease in safety, but illustrates potential safety hazards and concerns, and allows us to address these proactively. Compared to 2016, we saw a great increase in event reporting with 90% of our vessels reporting minimum 6 events monthly in 2017, compared to 63% in 2016. This increase can be explained by a strong focus and systematic follow-up on our reporting culture. While we have aimed for a high number of event reports, we have naturally aimed for as few serious incidents as possible. Our incident frequency decreased significantly during 2015 and 2016 (1.33 down from 1.9), while we experienced an increase in 2017 (up to 1.8). We measure the so-called lost time incidents, where seafarers have been unable to perform their work for more than 24 hours, and this number signifies the number of events per million man hours. The last indicator we chose for safety standards was port state control deficiencies per inspection. Port state controls are internationally agreed inspections of foreign vessels. The investigations involve checking compliance with the requirements of international conventions, checking that the vessel is manned and operated in compliance with applicable international law, and verifying the competency of the vessel’s master and officers, and the vessel’s condition and equipment. Port state controls cover both environmental, work environmental and safety matters and are sound overall indicators of how responsibly we have been performing. We saw a small decrease in deficiencies again in 2017, going down from 0.82 to 0.79 deficiencies per inspection. 9 CLIPPER GROUP CSR REPORT 2017 Responsible ship recycling We wish to ensure that any recycling of Clipper’s vessels is done in a responsible way safeguarding the environment and the workers working on the recycling. Following our experience with the recycling of the multipurpose vessel M/V Clipper Concord in 2015, we formulated a Recycling Policy in December 2015 for future reference. The policy is available on clipper-group.com. We do not expect to recycle any more vessels in the near future. 10 CLIPPER GROUP CSR REPORT 2017 ENVIRONMENT Although shipping is the eco-friendliest form of mass plans ready pending the development on the market. long-distance transportation, we do acknowledge our BWT systems have already been installed on most of our environmental impact.

The first vessel to receive OBS on board was the 5,300 dwt Seatruck Progress. These five vessels are part of Seatruck’s fleet of 10 ships. They serve Heysham and Liverpool on the UK mainland, Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland and Dublin in Ireland. It is the Dublin service – an international destination – that made the BWT installations necessary on the specific ships that operate the Dublin route. The installation was very straightforward and the work was shared between the ships’ on board crew and shore-based contractors. Seatruck chose a UV treatment system because of the limited space available and because it does not use any chemicals. Although the ships do not load much ballast compared with large oceangoing ships – about 100-150 m3 – they do this twice each day; which is much more often than other ship types. The OBS is fully approved by both IMO and USCG, with certification through DNV GL, Lloyd’s, Bureau Veritas, MLIT Japan and American Bureau of Shipping. Review of speed percentage not needed.

Our anti-corruption policy adopted in 2012 confirms that we have a zero tolerance towards traditional bribery such as kickbacks. Facility payments (small payments for services that the company is already entitled to) are a separate challenge, and given some of the areas we operate in, we are not yet able to implement a zero-tolerance policy in this regard. In some areas of the world, facility payments are an integrated part of the social structure and a zerotolerance policy would create several irresolvable deadlock situations. Anti-corruption training program We have chosen to actively fight facility payments in whatever form or shape those appear. In 2015, we commenced a global anti-corruption training program for all our employees on shore as well as Senior Officers. This program continued in 2016 and 2017, where we trained 174 Senior Officers and 57 office staff, including the Clipper Fleet Management, Chartering and Operations teams. The training material and an online test were developed by the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN), of which Clipper continues to be an active member. The Blueprint Project: public-private cooperation against corruption The Blueprint Project is an initiative launched by Mærsk Line to promote collaboration between the public and private sectors in the fight against corruption by bringing together companies and embassies. A group of five Danish shipping companies have joined forces in this project, and Clipper is proud to be among them. In 2016, the Danish Embassy in Turkey acted as pilot to the Blueprint model. The Danish Embassy in Turkey made their resources and knowledge available to a group of the Danish shipping companies in case unjustified demands for payments were made by local port authorities. The results in Turkey are more than promising. Zero tolerance was successfully enforced as of January 2017 and significantly fewer demands for facility payments have been made in the Turkish ports since. Encouraged by the positive results, further discussions are taking place to bring more Danish embassies on board such as the Danish Embassy in Ghana. In Ghana, companies that do not yet have a zero-tolerance policy towards facility payments, have started implementing it. The Blueprint Project provides the perfect opportunity for companies and governments to collaborate on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 16 & 17) and have a positive impact on the maritime industry. SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. 13 CLIPPER GROUP CSR REPORT 2017 CLIPPER GROUP CSR GOALS 2015-17 UN GLOBAL COMPACT Sign up for UN Global Compact during 2015 2015: Membership prepared 2016: Joined Jan 2016 2017: UNGC Participant Prepare format for and file annual communication on progress in 2015, 2016 and 2017. 2015: Format prepared 2016: Filed May 2017 2017: Filed May 2018 WE SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS AND LABOR STANDARDS: ON SHORE DIVERSITY/WOMEN IN MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION 33% of all employees shall be female (end 2017).
