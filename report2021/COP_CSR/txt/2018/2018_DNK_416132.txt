Since 2015, Marianne Hoffmann Dyrbøl became sole owner of the company. Our vision is to be the preferred children’s brand by selling everyday luxury for children inspired by the latest trends. Besides our high-quality demands, it has always been our goal to deliver a unique design embracing the child’s personality. Therefore, we design and produce everything ourselves from the buttons to fabrics and prints. We have a vision to always deliver nice design, high quality, low prices and high customer satisfaction. All products are designed in Denmark and produced by our agent’s suppliers in Turkey, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Ukraine. The concept is based on Business to Consumer.

PROMISES We strive to reduce the impact, which we have worldwide from running our business.

We are committed to offer our customers as many products as possible with Oeko-Tex standard 100 label or the organic label, GOTS. We are committed to up-hold chemicals legislation and we observe the EU-Reach as a minimum.

Our suppliers are obligated to inform if any production deviate and in which area the deviation is found. We promise to do random chemical tests made by Bureau Veritas. ACTIVITIES We uncover our resources on essential and relevant areas and strive to reduce our consumption pr. employee. An area of focus is our recycling of cardboard, which we increase year by year. In 2012 we developed relevant KPI’s for our environmental effort. Our position on transportation is clear and demands us to prevent from flying clothes to Denmark unless absolutely necessary. Good preparation is the key to the solution in that respect and we endeavor to influence our suppliers to have the same attitude. We have experienced a minor decline in that respect. During the year we start to use railway from Asia as a new way of transportation and we will try to increase this transportation way in 2018. POMPdeLUX | UN GLOBAL COMPACTCOMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT | PAGE 7 We strive to have as much of our clothes labeled with the health label, Oeko-Tex 100 to create confidence for our consumers.
