The code of conduct of Bank of Palestine and its subsidiary companies emphasizes a policy on respecting human rights and preventing potential abuses. A special mechanism to investigate and prosecute human rights violations at the work place has also been established. In fact, all the bank branches and offices have a suggestion box, which could be utilized to highlight ideas pertaining to human rights at the work place. Bank of Palestine has established an open-line policy between its employees and the Human Resources Department, thus allowing employees to report any human rights violations or abuses. Through its Employee Internal By Law, Bank of Palestine has made it clear to all employees and stakeholders that it adopts and supports the United Nations Global Compact policies on human rights. This is evident as Bank of Palestine’s senior management receives regular reports from the Human Resources Department on issues relating to human rights. When cases of human rights abuses are discovered, investigations are held promptly and correction measures are then adopted. It is vital to mention that hiring employees with disabilities lies within the bank strategy and the aim is for them to constitute 6% of the employees. Moreover, the majority of the bank branch buildings are constructed in a way that complies with the needs of people with disabilities. In fact, since seven years, it has been prohibited to construct buildings that don’t comply with their needs. Moreover, as part of the bank’s strategy to provide access to finance to all segments of society, BOP continued working on enhancing its extensive programs for women in 2016 in order to meet their needs through banking and non-financial advisory services. Bank of Palestine under its flagship “Felestineya” program focusing on economic and social empowerment for women both at the bank and in the market place. The program provided access to more women jobs at the bank including senior positions; raising the number of women employees to 36%. In addition, as part of the bank’s social responsibility, through which 6% of its annual profit is contributed to many sectors in the community, the bank launched the “I Want to Hear” campaign – in partnership with the Palestine Red Crescent Society – which aims to buy 1,000 hearing aids for people with hearing impairments and other related contributions. In reference to the financial aspect, the bank signed an agreement with the Ministry of Labor to finance small and micro sized enterprises for people with special needs. The bank pledged to allocate an amount of USD 500K to finance these enterprises with no interest rate. This initiative comes out of the bank’s belief to empower people with special needs in the society. The Compliance Department continues to ensure that the bank doesn’t deal with any entity that has any human right abuses or are part or complicit to such abuses. Labor Principles: Bank of Palestine and its subsidiaries uphold the Labor Principles of the United Nations Global Compact. These principles are referenced in Bank of Palestine’s Employee Internal By law. In addition to these principles, Bank of Palestine emphasizes other labor principles including ones that focus on gender inclusion at the work place. The Labor Principles of the United Nations Global Compact are adopted at Bank of Palestine in several ways. First, an employee-employer communication mechanism has been established through an employee suggestion email, and through the adoption of an open-line policy connecting the employees with the general management. Through the suggestion email and the open-line policy, the employees are freely able to communicate all their suggestions and concerns to their seniors. Second, Bank of Palestine has invested great efforts in training all employees to improve their skills. For example, a new employee orientation has been set in place to support this initiative. Bank of Palestine has enhanced its healthcare insurance to all employees and their families since four years. In addition, the Bank has extended paternity leaves for its male employees. The Bank has also extended a child allowance for female employees, where this privilege was only granted to male employees in the past. In addition, the senior management receives regular reports from the Human Resources department pertaining to the labor principles of the United Nations Global Compact. The reports focus on gender inclusion, including figures on employees’ benefits and salaries in order to ensure equality at the work place. With a total of 1,652 staff in 2016, Bank of Palestine continued to attract talented staff into its operations. The bank continued to support job creating initiatives in the market place and continued to invest in training. Gender parity was an important milestone achieved this year. In 2016, UN Women and the International Labor Organization (ILO) were invited to conduct a gender audit of the Bank. The Bank achieved good marks, on its gender inclusion policies and parity between female employees with their male counterparts. Today, women employees at senior and all levels make up %32 of the bank’s total staff with an aim to reach %50 males%50 females as part of our Gender Equity inclusion. In addition, the Bank was also awarded Best Global Bank in Financial Inclusion by the Banker Magazine of the Financial Times in December 2016 in recognition for its pioneering work in women inclusion under the women flagship Felestineya Program. Other recognitions were Best Program for Women Empowerment by the Global Alliance for Banking for Women GBAW and Best Bank in the Middle East for Financial Inclusion by Emea finance in 2016. The bank is a leader in engaging with people with Disabilities. While the law requires institutions to allocate 5% of their staff from people with disabilities, the bank has allocated the percentage to be 6% and hence showing the upmost respect and care for this segment of society. Moreover, the bank has introduced specialized training programs, mostly in sign language, so as to facilitate communication with customers who have impairments. The best example of our bank’s culture and concern for labor rights was the bank’s absorption of employees of former Palestine Commercial Bank which was merged into Bank of Palestine in 2016.The bank absorbed all of the former staff and retrained them and many of them remained in equivalent positions and are advancing in their careers. The bank also enhanced its communications platforms with staff through “ Yammer “ Portal ( Microsoft Office 365) and initiated community building initiatives to promote healthy lifestyle staff via biggest weight loss programs to promote reducing weight. Environmental Principles Social and environmental responsibility has been an integral part of the way Bank of Palestine ( BOP ) operates since the establishment of the bank in 1960. BOP has been implementing a comprehensive sustainability strategy, as we believe that out of strong, stable communities will grow sustainable businesses that will help strengthen the wider economy of Palestine. As part of our sustainability strategy, we have dedicated staff to track the progress of the different parts of the strategy. BOP has a Social and Environmental Aspects Screening Checklist, which includes compliance with all applicable requirements such as the national regulatory requirements and the International Finance Corporation’s exclusion list. Bank of Palestine is committed to environmental protection on different levels. First, Bank of Palestine advances its policy on bringing about social and environmental improvements through its green loans program. As its name suggests, these are loans to individuals, families, and MSMEs for projects that lead to greater water or energy efficiency, waste water treatment, and the production of renewable energy. In addition, Bank of Palestine considers the environment as it administers other loan programs as the Bank has a policy of declining loans to any projects that are seen hazardous to the environment, or judged harmful in any means to the environment. Moreover, Bank of Palestine tries to ensure that its own operations are as sustainable as possible through the way buildings are constructed and through the types of products and services offered. For instance, the gas within the air conditioning system is considered environment friendly ( responsible for cooling / heating). Moreover, there are isolation layers inside the walls and this contributes to maintaining temperature. Also, the construction material used in construction are locally produced and this is an environment friendly approach as using locally produced material would mean avoiding means of transportation ( shipping,..) and that would mean reducing air pollution. In addition, Bank of Palestine installed solar – power ATMs in the Gaza Strip, hence benefitting the environment by reducing the use of oil – generated electricity, and to make sure our ATMs are in operation during wars and electricity cuts. In addition, a led lights smart system is used in newly constructed buildings with both a motion feature and a lux meter and this is surely an environment friendly approach as it makes use of the sun to the maximum and only lights dim places when it gets dark. Moreover, the trend is also minimizing the number of printers in the departments; this will surely save up both energy and paper, thus making it an environment friendly approach. As part of our corporate social responsibilities ( CSR ) initiatives, the bank has initiated the Al Bayyara Project ( Al – Bayyara “ is the Arabic word of an orange Orchard ). The bank has implemented the Al Bayyara Parks project in a number of cities within the Palestinian governorates, to provide a safe place for children that responds to their entertainment needs and physical health. Another major example is the solar system project implemented in the Gaza Strip. The project lightened 40 houses through generating electricity with solar energy. Moreover, BOP supports a traditional seeds project, activate the agricultural sector, and develop agricultural and productive crops in the West Bank, among many other examples. Bank of Palestine is keen to support its organic growth strategy with enhanced digital banking channels in addition to physical branch channels in line with modern banking trends and customer demands for digital banking platforms. In 2016, the bank launched the first Mobile application allowing customers to have a more enhanced experience with many banking transactions. This has helped the bank service more customers electronically increasing subscriptions in the bank e service and reducing paper use. Moreover, Bank of Palestine ensures the advancement of its policies on environmental protection through the implementation of different measures. To start, Bank of Palestine’s Employee Internal By Law and Annual Report have a special section on the environment, intended to raise awareness amongst the employees and stakeholders. The bank continues to promote its Green Loans portfolio. Anti-Corruption Principles Bank of Palestine and its subsidiaries adopt the Anti-Corruption Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the Palestinian Anti – Corruption Law. In its Employee Internal By Law, Bank of Palestine makes it clear that it adheres to a zero-tolerance policy for bribery, corruption and extortion. Bank of Palestine has a mechanism to deal with violators who are found guilty of corruption-related activities. Bank of Palestine’s senior management receives regular reports from the Risk Management Department on issues relating to corruption. When cases of human rights abuses are discovered, investigations are held promptly and correction measures are then adopted. The bank is committed to conducting business in an ethical and honest manner, and is committed to implementing and enforcing systems that ensure corruption is presented, and we familiarize all employees with whistle – blowing procedures, so employees can vocalize their concerns swiftly and confidentially. The bank adopts a Code of Corporate Governance and hence confirms its commitment to lead and promote good corporate governance throughout the bank’s departments and activities. BOP understands corporate governance as a set of policies, systems and processes for the direction and control of companies, involving a set of relationships between the company’s shareholders, board and executive bodies for the purpose of creating long-term shareholder value. In order to foster the confidence of its shareholders, employees, investors, and the general public, this Code goes beyond the established legal and regulatory framework by the Palestine Capital Markets Authority (PCMA), Palestinian Monetary Authority (PMA), and embraces internationally recognized corporate governance principles and practices. BOP’s corporate governance framework is broadly based on the following principles: Accountability: This Code ensures BOP’s accountability to all shareholders and guides the company’s board in the important strategy setting function, while guiding and monitoring the company’s management Fairness: BOP obligates itself to protect shareholder rights and ensure the equitable treatment of all shareholders, including minority shareholders. All shareholders are to be granted effective redress for violation of their rights through the board. Transparency: BOP is to ensure that timely and accurate disclosure is made on all material matters regarding the corporation, including the financial situation, performance, ownership and governance of the company, in a manner easily accessible to interested parties. Responsibility: BOP recognizes the rights of other stakeholders as established by laws and regulations, and encourages cooperation between the company and stakeholders in creating sustainable and financially sound enterprises. In addition to disclosures as per regulations, the bank continues to disclose its financial news and results to a wider list of stakeholders and constantly updates such information on its website. The bank has also continued implementing its risk management strategy by enhancing the governance structure through having an active Risk committee and a Risk management function, Compliance department and Money Laundry Reporting Officer ( MLRO) strengthening its internal controls, spreading risk culture, developing and applying advanced internal rating models for its credit portfolio, and upgrading systems for Basel II implementation, working in tandem with International Banking compliance requirements and local national regulatory requirements.. The Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) has continued implementing Basel II & III instructions to banks operating in Palestine in 2016. The PMA continued to receive positive appraisal from international monetary agencies about its strict implementation of the Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorism Financing (CTF ) rules in Palestine. The Inspection and Audit department also plays a major role in providing all internal and contracted audit activities, inspections, and reviews for programs and operations. The AML Department reports directly to the board with oversight over the executive management. It is vital to mention the bank’s 6% allocation towards corporate social responsibility(CSR) projects and activities in various fields. In fact, in addition to the bank’s internal CSR report, a booklet is issued yearly by the Association of Bank in Palestine that displays the banks’ contribution to CSR projects and the bank has been a leader for years contributing to various initiatives. This , without doubt, shows the bank’s accountability and transparency and its keenness towards supporting developmental projects in the Palestinian community. It is essential to mention that the bank cooperates with credible institutions to implement its projects / activities and hence guarantying no forms of violations to occur whatsoever.
