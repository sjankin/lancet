Lenovo Group Limited | 2016/17 Sustainability Report Stock Code 992 Making a Difference Lenovo is passionate about its commitment to serve as a global corporate citizen and leader in sustainable business practices. These are both values and promises that we hold across our company – and as we transform and grow, so too does our focus on making a positive impact. The way we approach sustainability at Lenovo is similar to how we approach innovation – with the mantra that Different is Better. We always strive to find new ways of doing things differently so that we can consistently become better – for our customers, for our employees, for the communities where we do business and for the environment. This year, we developed a breakthrough LTS manufacturing process that will reduce Lenovo’s annual CO2 emissions by almost 6,000 metric tons through 2018 – and we’ll soon make the process available to all electronics manufacturers so they can do things differently for the sake of being better, too. In the year ahead, we’ll continue to pave new roads with our global CSR and sustainability initiatives and maintain our unwavering pledge to build a more sustainable future. BECAUSE DIFFERENT IS BETTER.

We are guided by the same level of commitment, accountability and customer-centric action that has made Lenovo a company with both business goals and social and environmental purpose. Sustainability and corporate social responsibility have always been priorities for Lenovo because they are priorities for our stakeholders, whom we view as partners: our customers, our employees, our investors and the communities in which we live and operate. As Lenovo becomes the leading device + cloud company, we measure success not only by the innovative products and services we create, but also by the strides we make with our purpose-driven sustainability and corporate social initiatives. We will never waiver on our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship. 6 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS This past fiscal year, we worked to clear a path for our Mobile and Data Center businesses to grow, while continuing to nurture our leadership in the PC market. We also appointed new leaders across key areas of our business to join what is already a very diverse global leadership team. Of note, this included three new women leaders joining our ranks in senior roles: Kim Stevenson, senior vice president and general manager of Data Center Group (formerly with Intel); Radhika Krishnan, executive director and general manager, Software-Defined Data Center (formerly with Nimble Storage and Network Appliance); and Laura Quatela, senior vice president and chief legal officer (formerly with Alcatel-Lucent and Eastman Kodak). We believe passionately that by leveraging the breadth of skills and various backgrounds of our diverse workforce, we are uniquely able to meet the varied cultural needs of all our customers. As we are in the eleventh year of Lenovo’s annual Sustainability Report, you’ll see this culture of ownership, accountability and customer centricity manifested in our sustainability and corporate social initiatives. • Lenovo achieved a breakthrough innovation in manufacturing with the development of an industryfirst low-temperature solder (LTS) process that supports our climate change mitigation goals while increasing product reliability. LTS reduces the heat required for connecting components to circuit boards by 70 degrees Celsius. Through 2018, LTS will reduce Lenovo’s annual CO2 emissions by almost 6,000 metric tons, which is equivalent to the consumption of 670,000 gallons of gasoline per year. Despite the competitive advantage this innovation provides in reducing costs, in 2018 Lenovo intends to offer its new procedure on an industrywide basis free of charge for the benefit of all electronics manufacturers. • Lenovo’s photovoltaic solar panel installation at the Lenovo-Compal facility in Hefei, China, was completed and began producing electricity. The plant will generate 3,900,000 KWh of power annually, saving approximately 3,900 tons of carbon emissions. This achievement is another step toward Lenovo’s goal of reducing our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 40 percent by 2020, relative to our FY2009/10 baseline. • Lenovo scored A-, “Leadership level,” on CDP’s questionnaire assessing progress toward environmental stewardship of climate change mitigation and adaption. • Lenovo received a perfect score of 100 percent by the Corporate Equality Index 2017 on corporate policies and practices related to LGBT workplace equality, earning distinction in “Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality.” • Lenovo appeared on the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index for the seventh year in a row and scored an AA, the best overall score in our industry. • Since 2009, Lenovo continues its role as a member and signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, aligning its operations and strategies in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Environmental stewardship, ethical conduct and community involvement underpin Lenovo’s business growth and fulfills our purpose as a company. Our credo will continue to guide us as a company as we strive to improve the daily lives of our customers, employees and local communities and positively impact society overall. Thank you, Yang Yuanqing Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 7 Lenovo EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS A MESSAGE FROM GUAN WEI OUR CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY EXECUTIVE “ Lenovo is a truly global technology leader capable of positively improving life, work, and even society. Our promise to our stakeholders is that we will continue to embrace our long-held values of environmental and social responsibility as key ingredients in shaping our future.” As I look back on my first year as Lenovo’s Chief Sustainability Executive, I am proud of our marked progress in sustainable and ethical practices and motivated by the challenges and work we still face. One of Lenovo’s enduring strengths is its ability to maintain focus while navigating uncharted territories. We exerted that strength this year as we established three distinct business groups – PC, Mobile and Data Center – to better meet customer needs, business priorities and industry shifts. We remained diligent in offering products and services that our customers are proud to use, not only because they comprise innovative technologies but also embody sustainable and ethical practices. My role as head of Lenovo’s Global Supply Chain allows me to constantly leverage my extensive manufacturing and supply chain operations experience in implementing sustainability best practices at Lenovo. Lenovo has created one of the most secure and best-performing global supply chains – a distinction recognized by Lenovo’s consistent inclusion in Gartner’s “Supply Chain Top 25” rankings. In addition, Lenovo manufactures a higher volume of products in its own factories than almost any other technology hardware supplier. This gives us greater control and transparency from product conception through end-of-life. We lead the industry with the highest product quality standards and fully comply with all laws and regulations in the countries where we operate, and require that our suppliers do the same through contracts and our Supplier Code of Conduct. 8 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Lenovo also places additional requirements on our suppliers that go beyond legal compliance, such as the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct. Lenovo recognizes the importance of concerns regarding the sourcing of materials containing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3T/G), commonly referred to as “conflict minerals,” from regions experiencing political and social conflict. The company fully supports the efforts of the EICC, Conflict Free Smelter Initiative (CFSI), NGOs and governmental bodies to solve this complex issue. Lenovo also formally joined the EICC Responsible Raw Materials Initiative (RRMI), launched in 2016. The company is a member of the RRMI Advocacy Workgroup, whose initial efforts aim to drive responsible sourcing of cobalt and tin with a principal focus on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Indonesia, respectively. Cobalt is a key ingredient in the lithium-ion batteries that power smartphones, laptops and electric cars, and about 60 percent originates from artisanal mines located in the DRC. Lenovo also supports the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and commits to extending these rights to our employees and others directly or indirectly employed in our supply chain. In FY 2016/17, we codified this commitment by implementing a Human Rights Policy, which is available on our website. As Lenovo evolves and diversifies, we remain nimble in dedicating resources and attention across every business in the areas of quality and safety for products, employee welfare, ethical corporate behavior, social investments and environmental affairs. In FY 2016/2017 we continued to demonstrate leadership in these areas, and recognition of our successes included: • In the Hong Kong Oxfam ESG 2016 Survey, Lenovo ranked 5th overall among Hang Seng 50 companies and rated highest in human rights, supply chain and environmental management. • Lenovo scored 71/100 in the EcoVadis 2016 CSR “Gold” Ranking, a European assessment platform, placing in the top 2 percent of suppliers in all categories. • Lenovo was selected for inclusion for the third consecutive year in the Corporate Knights 2017 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World Index. • For the fourth consecutive year, Lenovo was a recipient of the Platinum Award in the 2016 Best Corporate Governance Awards. Organized by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), a respected authority on corporate governance in Hong Kong, the Platinum Award recognizes Lenovo’s commitment to upholding rigorous standards of corporate governance through corporate disclosures and practices, including an emphasis on corporate social responsibility. Lenovo was also granted a Special Mention, ranking first in our category, in the Sustainability and Social Responsibility Award. • Lenovo was recognized in 2016 for its environmental leadership by the China Quality Management Association for the Electronics Industry, which awarded Lenovo the “Outstanding Company for Pushing Green Development in the ICT Industry.” Lenovo is a truly global technology leader capable of positively improving life, work and even society. Our promise to our stakeholders is that we will continue to embrace our long-held values of environmental and social responsibility as key ingredients in shaping our future.

Please email Mark Thomsen at environment@lenovo.com. 2.2 MATERIALITY AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT MATERIALITY Lenovo’s integration of sustainability impact concerns into its strategy, planning, implementation and reporting activities begins with an assessment of materiality. We believe proper identification of sustainability related material concerns is integral to achieving our business goals of minimizing risk and maximizing growth and returns on capital, along with fulfilling our commitment to outstanding corporate citizenship. Internally, Lenovo regularly conducts assessments to identify and categorize all material concerns through its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, including sustainability related issues. Material concerns are further clarified and addressed through company management systems. Lenovo’s environmental management system, for example, provides a framework for assessment of significant environmental aspects (SEA), regularly scheduled audits, measurement of key performance indicators and continuous improvement. This SEA evaluation process and the ERM process provide valuable input into Lenovo’s overall sustainability materiality assessment process. Other benefits of the EMS include monitoring our progress on previously identified material concerns and more quickly spotting emerging issues. The scope of this Sustainability Report was determined by our Sustainability Materiality Assessment, a process where we evaluate and determine Lenovo’s significant, or material, environmental and social responsibility aspects. We carried out this assessment in the fall of 2016. Lenovo acknowledges that a variety of external perspectives are relevant to identifying material issues. We regularly engage with a variety of stakeholders and consider their feedback as we affirm what is material to our business, develop our sustainability strategy, set our goals and report on our progress. 14 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS SUSTAINABILITY MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT: MATERIAL TOPICS • Business Ethics • Climate Change (emissions) • Community Outreach • Corporate Governance • Digital Inclusion • Diversity and Equal Opportunity • Economic Performance • Energy Use • Environmental Management System • Human Rights • Labor Standards and Practices • Packaging • Philanthropy/Disaster Relief • Privacy • Procurement Practices • Product End-of-Life Management • Product Energy Use • Product Materials • Product Responsibility • Supply Chain Environmental Performance • Supply Chain Labor Practices • Talent Management • Transportation • Waste • Water Use STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT Lenovo continued to actively manage its relationships in FY 2016/17 with employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and investors, regulators, members of the communities in which we operate, industry groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and other stakeholders whose actions can affect the company’s performance and value. Examples of mechanisms for engaging with stakeholders on sustainability issues include: • Direct customer interaction via in person briefings, calls, social media engagement and other means; responses to customer surveys, etc. • A Report Review Panel where customers, partners and other stakeholders provided feedback on Lenovo’s previous Sustainability Report to inform the creation of this FY 2016/17 Sustainability Report (see page 13) • Opportunities for comment and feedback from employees, customers, investors and other stakeholders based on sustainability communications issued by Lenovo, such as this report • Employee/management meetings and communications for employee performance management • Employee surveys such as the “Lenovo Listens” survey, commuting surveys and others 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 15 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS • Supplier conferences and quarterly business reviews • Ongoing interactions and initiatives with local communities • Responding to investor analyst and NGO surveys and inquiries • Meetings and communications with industry peers, regulators and standards organizations to address issues of industry importance Each section of this report contains numerous other examples of Lenovo’s engagement with stakeholders. The results of the Sustainability Materiality Assessment also guide us in evaluating and prioritizing stakeholder inputs. Our environmental, quality and other management systems have defined processes for obtaining and analyzing stakeholder input to help improve our performance as well as manage risk. Lenovo’s network of geographic, environmental and sustainability focal points engage with local sales teams and customers on a regular basis. This is done through detailed responses to customer questions and meetings at customer locations or at Lenovo’s briefing centers. These meetings allow Lenovo to get direct feedback on our environmental programs. Examples of feedback include information on ecolabel preferences, requests for packaging optimization and requests for further information for internal customer education. We are also heavily engaged with our suppliers to drive enhanced transparency and compliance and reporting tools such as Lenovo’s full materials disclosure declarations and EICC reporting requirements. This is done via regular interactions with our suppliers, including communications, regular reviews and report cards. Local stakeholder engagement at the site level is primarily done through Lenovo’s community relations (see the Social Investments section) and communications teams, who work closely with Lenovo’s global organization on sustainability issues. Key sustainability issues addressed through Lenovo’s engagement with stakeholders in the past fiscal year include concerns about protecting human rights in the supply chain, climate change mitigation and impact, recycling, product certifications and others. Lenovo has responded to these concerns by: • Implementing a Human Rights Policy and updating our Supplier Code of Conduct • Adding additional renewable energy generation at our Hefei site (see the Renewable Energy section) • Reporting carbon emissions data and strategies to CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) (see the Environmental Impact of Lenovo Operations section). In 2016, Lenovo scored an Aand Leadership Level on its CDP carbon emissions-related reporting • Providing free consumer recycling options in many geographies (see the Recovery and Recycling Trends section) • Continuing the use of post-consumer recycled content (see the Product Materials section) 16 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS 2.3 LENOVO AND THE U.N. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS Lenovo supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were officially adopted by the U.N. in September 2015 and came into force in January 2016. The SDGs include 169 targets and are to be carried out between 2016 and 2030. Lenovo has well-established programs to ensure we operate sustainably and responsibly, following our long-standing commitment to ethical corporate citizenship and promoting sustainability in all our activities. We became a Global Compact signatory in 2009. There are aspects of our business, projects, programs and activities that we can readily identify as contributing toward achieving SDGs. Examples include: • Goal 4 – Education and digital inclusion are key components to Lenovo’s social investment strategy. See the Social Investments section to read about our global activities in these areas in FY 2016/17. • Goal 5 – Lenovo is actively implementing programs to increase the hiring of women and develop female senior executive talent. See the Diversity section for more information. • Goal 8 – Lenovo has been recognized for its commitment to providing safe and healthy workspaces, and our supply chain program flows down our safe and healthy workspace requirements contractually. See the Manufacturing and Supply Chain Operations chapter for more information. • Goal 9 – Lenovo relentlessly pursues innovation that reaps sustainability benefits. Read about the benefits of some of our innovations on pages 52-53. • Goal 12 – Lenovo’s Environmentally Conscious Products program has long been pushing forward the boundaries of reducing the resources required to manufacture and use our products. An example on pages 109-110 explains the generational improvements in energy efficiency we have achieved in one of our desktop models. • Goal 13 – Lenovo has pledged to achieve a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse emissions by FY 2020/21, relative to FY 2009/10.

A change in organization structure in FY 2016/17 led to a restatement of revenue analysis data for previous years according to the new structure. 2. Number of Employees Total includes Lenovo employees (regulars and supplementals) only. Contractors are not included as they are not Lenovo employees. 3. Lenovo changed its management of geographies in FY 2012/13. 4. FY 2010/11 to FY 2013/14 EMEA and Asia Pacific cash donations are included with “Corporate and Rest of World.” 5. FY 2010/11 to FY 2013/14 EMEA and Asia Pacific in-kind donations are included with “Corporate and Rest of World.” 6. Lenovo’s GHG Emissions and Energy Inventory Specifics: Lenovo started to verify energy and GHG emissions data in FY 2009/2010. At the end of FY 2012/13 Lenovo adjusted its historical Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions data to account for acquiring Medion in Germany and creating a joint venture with NEC in Japan. At the end of FY 2015/16, Lenovo adjusted historical Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions data to account for acquiring System x and Motorola Mobility. Lenovo started to report locationand market-based Scope 2 from FY 2015/16. Base year and consecutive year Scope 2 totals are the same for both the location-based and market-based methods, as productand supplier-specific market-based data were not available in the base year and consecutive years. The location-based results thus have been used as a proxy for the market-based method. Beginning in FY 2015/16, System x and Motorola Mobility data are included in energy and Scope 3 emissions data. Approximately 1% of purchased energy (electricity) is estimated based upon energy use at similar Lenovo facilities with metered usage. Product transportation emissions include key upstream suppliers representing the majority of global logistics spend. Note: Upon confirmation with the GHG Protocol standard, we decided to recategorize this to upstream from downstream transportation (from FY 2016/17, previous years were adjusted accordingly). Emissions from waste include nonhazardous waste, hazardous waste and wastewater from all manufacturing, R&D locations and some large offices. No product waste is included. Purchased goods and services include suppliers covering 95% of direct global suppliers spend. The EICC Carbon and Water Reporting Tool was used for collecting most supplier data. Data was allocated based on revenue. Fuel-and-energy related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) include transmission and distribution (T&D) losses from Lenovo’s worldwide purchased electricity and natural gas. A World Bank database and Energy Star Performance Rating document were used for determining T&D loss rates. Lenovo used the current Product Attribute Impact Algorithm (PAIA) notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one and thin client tool for calculating emissions of Lenovo’s typical notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one and thin client. The calculated results show emissions distribution by different parts and also for use, packaging, transportation and end-of-life treatment categories. The emissions associated with use and end-of-life treatment of sold products were estimated on a narrow baseline for the typical notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one and thin client multiplied by sold/shipped product volumes. Emissions from capital goods are based on purchased capital goods in a given year. The 2012 Guidelines to Defra GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, Annex 13, was used for emission factors for different type of capital goods adjusted for inflation and exchange rates. Solar energy is measured in MWh. Renewable Energy Credit, International Renewable Energy Credit and Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin represent 1 MWh and carbon offset represents 1 MT CO2e. These are reported and calculated separately and taken into consideration internally when evaluating progress toward emissions targets. Renewable energy generation capacity includes electric solar panels in Shanghai and Hefei, China, and hot water solar panels in Beijing, China. 7. Water data includes manufacturing, research and development sites and some large offices. Lenovo started to verify waste and water data in FY 2011/12. Beginning of FY 2015/16, System x and Motorola Mobility data are included in water data. 8. Waste data includes site waste from manufacturing, research & development sites and some large offices. Waste data includes processes and operations waste; product waste is reported separately. Lenovo started to verify waste and water data in FY 2011/12. Beginning of FY 2015/16, System x and Motorola Mobility data are included in waste data. 9. Lenovo’s Product End-of-Life Management (PELM) includes product take back (PTB) from customers and Lenovo-owned country returns, manufacturing and R&D scrap, and employee equipment from real estate sites. 26 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS 3.2 FY 2016/17 PERFORMANCE Key Performance Target Type Objective Indicator(s) Target(s) Status % packaging Use 100% FSC or equivalent Target met.

The core governance structure of Lenovo is an effective board of directors (the ““Board”), led by the Chairman with the support of senior management with the goal to attain and uphold a high standard of corporate governance and to maintain sound and well-established corporate governance practices in the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders. The Company also regularly reviews its corporate governance structure to ensure it is in line with international and local best practices. Throughout the year ending March 31, 2017, the Company has complied with the code provisions of the Corporate Governance Code and the Corporate Governance Report (the “CG Code”) set out in Appendix 14 to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited and, where appropriate, met the recommended best practices in the CG Code except for the deviation as explained on page 45 of the Annual Report. More details on Lenovo’s corporate governance structure and practices, as well as risk management and internal control, can be found on pages 44-94 of the Annual Report. For quick reference, in particular on our sustainability governance structure and management approach, the following overview is provided. BOARD STRUCTURE The Board is the highest governing body in the organization and is responsible for overseeing the overall strategy of the Company and directing and supervising its affairs in a responsible and effective manner. As of March 31, 2017, there were eleven Board members consisting of one executive director, namely Mr. Yang Yuanqing; two nonexecutive directors, namely Mr. Zhu Linan and Mr. Zhao John Huan; and eight independent nonexecutive directors, namely Dr. Tian Suning, Mr. Nicholas C. Allen, Mr. Nobuyuki Idei, Mr. William O. Grabe, Mr. William Tudor Brown, Ms. Ma Xuezheng, Mr. Yang Chih-Yuan Jerry and Mr. Gordon Robert Halyburton Orr. The Board diversity mix is set out on page 48 of the Annual Report, while the detailed biographies and a snapshot of the Board’s experience are set out on pages 133-136 of the Annual Report. The Company has adopted a Board Diversity Policy that ensures that Board members have an appropriate balance of skill, experience, knowledge and independence. Currently, the Board, comprising a vast majority of independent nonexecutive directors, brings diverse experience and expertise to the Company and also enhances the independence, diversity and perspective of the Board. In line with international corporate governance practices, a Lead Independent Director has been appointed. Details of the nomination and appointment process of directors and the Board Diversity Policy can be found in the Corporate Governance Report section of the Annual Report. 36 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS The Company has preserved three Board Committees—the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nomination and Governance Committee—to enhance the effectiveness of Board functioning and operation. Each Board Committee has defined terms of reference, which are available on both the websites of the Company (www.lenovo.com/hk/publication) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (www.hkex.com.hk). Further details on the composition, responsibilities and main activities in FY 2016/17 of these Board Committees are included in the Annual Report on pages 67-71.

While friendlier to the environment, the DIFFERENCE tin-based solder had some drawbacks: It required more heat during manufacturing, so it consumed more energy and consequently created more carbon emissions. The high temperature also increased the risk of heat damage to the components, which could potentially affect reliability. The problem gnawed at Lenovo’s Tadashi Kosuga, senior engineering staff member and director of ECAT (Electronic Card Assembly and Test). Convinced he could find a solution, Kosuga-san assembled a cross-functional team of more than 20 engineers and tirelessly searched for two years to find the recipe, or “secret sauce,” for a low temperature solder process that could apply to all devices using printed circuit boards. The recipe consists of only four ingredients – solder type, “flux” (an additive to help flow of the solder), time in the oven and temperature. While this sounds simple, getting the proportion and combination of each of these factors right stumped some of the industry’s brightest minds for years. In the world of solder and metallurgy, classical experimentation and empirical observation is required to catalog and accept or reject each result. As a result, the team tried thousands of recipes, running experiments on more than 3,000 boards; each run of 30 boards took two to three weeks. The weeks added up to months. Using surface mount technology (SMT), the solder and flux mixture is printed on the Around the six-month mark, Kosuga-san thought face of the circuit board. Then components they might be on to something. He determined are added and heat applied to melt the that the solder joint using the LTS process met solder mixture, securing and connecting the the same strength as the current process. The components to the board used in the ThinkPad new process applies soldering heat at a max X1 Carbon 5th generation. temp of 180 degrees Celsius, compared to the 52 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS previous 250 degrees. And by using existing 1 Lenovo estimate of potential savings using calculations based on emissions per week per oven on Anhui province materials for the solder paste and the same emission factors manufacturing equipment, the new process does not add cost. 2 Lenovo calculation based on a total of 33 Surface Mount Technology manufacturing lines with 2 ovens per line Despite this discovery, the team would have including those within original design manufacturers (ODM) many months of quality and durability testing using Anhui province emission factors and fine tuning to do. Just because they found 3 Calculation using Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a recipe that worked did not mean that it would Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator – meet Lenovo’s rigorous testing standards. The https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gaslow temperature solder process had to create equivalencies-calculator products that were flexible but that resisted changes in heat exposure. After validation of the procedure, Lenovo discovered a significant reduction in carbon emissions as a result of using the new process. And with its lower temperature generating less heat, this process is already lowering carbon emissions; we are using it on the ThinkPad E Series, our largest volume commercial laptop, and on ThinkPad X1 Carbon, our premium commercial laptop. Throughout 2017, Lenovo intends to implement the new LTS process on eight SMT lines and estimates savings of up to 35 percent on carbon emissions1. By the end of 2018, Lenovo aims to have 33 SMT lines with two ovens per line using this new process, giving an estimated annual saving of 5,956 metric tons of CO22. To put this into perspective, the equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions is equal to the consumption of 670,170 gallons of gasoline3 per year. Kosuga-san and his team did not want to keep the new manufacturing process a secret. They wanted to do something uncommon in the industry – something different. They wanted to make the industry and world better by sharing their knowledge and solution. So after the patents are granted this year, they will proudly share this process technology via technical papers and consortiums with other electronics manufacturers – partners and competitors alike.

EICC COMPLIANCE As noted previously, we contractually implement a full EICC compliance program with our suppliers and directly validate compliance with independent third-party EICC approved auditors. Contract Requirements to Comply with the EICC Code of Conduct • Self-assess annually and report formally using EICC questionnaire and reporting tools • Receive in-depth audits biennially with independent, third-party EICC-approved auditors • Provide audit reports and corrective action plans • Require their own suppliers to comply with the EICC Code of Conduct (which reinforces EICC Code requirements for flow-down of EICC Code adherence through the whole supply chain) 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 59 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Program Statistics • 95 percent of Tier 1 suppliers by spending were in the program and all EICC contracts executed and in force • About 60 percent of Tier 2 and 30 percent of Tier 3 suppliers by spending also were included in the program efforts • 95 percent of self-assessments and audits were conducted in a timely manner • Corrective action plans were received on all audits and tracked to closure Like many companies doing significant business in China, we recognize that excessive working hours and insufficient time off are difficult but important supplier workplace issues. We recognize that overall we have some challenges addressing supplier health and safety issues, but have minimal problems regarding environmental impacts, management systems and ethics. This year we took corrective steps on working hours and time off that not only ensure closure of supplier action plans, but also track the suppliers for two subsequent quarters to verify sustained improvement and compliance. Our performance is noted below (audit scores are based on a specially weighted 200-point system where priority and major findings have significant weighting). Sections CY2014 CY2015 CY2016 Labor 141 144 154 Ethics 178 182 191 Health & Safety 143 153 166 Environment 168 176 182 Mgmt. System 168 175 184 Overall performance 112 130 150 Avg. Priority Items/Audit 1.4 1.0 0.7 Avg. Major Items/Audit 9.8 8.6 5.3 It is important to note that Lenovo’s implementation of the EICC Code of Conduct greatly exceeds EICC membership requirements. The EICC code requires annual self-assessments of 80 percent of suppliers by spending and annual audits covering only 25 percent of any identified high-risk facilities. Thus, only suppliers identified as high-risk receive audits to meet EICC requirements. We drive for 95 percent coverage of suppliers for both annual self-assessments and biennial audits regardless of risk. Lenovo’s supply chain performance is directly and independently validated. 60 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND BUSINESS REVIEWS Lenovo’s goals with regard to supplier evaluation are to measure performance to specific criteria, provide regular scorecard feedback and engage suppliers in business reviews and conferences. These activities serve as the foundation for mutual discussions on improving business relationships, standards compliance and future business volume increases or decreases. • Supplier performance is measured and reported in key areas, including quality, delivery/flexibility, technology, cost reduction and service. Supplier transparency and performance in sustainability programs are included as an overall penalty/credit multiplier in the calculations. We report our program status to senior management monthly and generally conduct about 200 report cards quarterly that cover 95 percent of our suppliers by spending. The key goals are to increase our business with suppliers who perform the best and to improve areas of weakness with underperforming suppliers. In the event a supplier does not adequately meet our expectations, business activity is discontinued. • We also engage suppliers at several events and meetings. First is a significant annual supplier conference where top executives from suppliers and Lenovo meet to build relationships and to discuss overall performance and key initiatives for the new year. Second is a semiannual Lenovo Supplier Advisory Council meeting where Lenovo brings together executives from the top 20 suppliers. Lenovo executive participation in both of these events includes our CEO, Business Unit Executives and Senior Vice Presidents from Supply Chain, Research & Technology, and Development organizations. Third, top strategic and key suppliers have quarterly in-person meetings. Lenovo recognizes that stable supplier relationships support stable communities in which our supply chain operates and provides the foundation for compliance to social, ethical and environmental requirements. Significant portions of our procurement spending and our supplier relationships can be measured in decades. HUMAN RIGHTS IN LENOVO’S SUPPLY CHAIN Lenovo respects human rights in all its activities, including those involving its supply chain. We manage all operations consistent with the spirit and intent of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We also have been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2009. As a signatory, we support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and ensure that our business practices are not complicit in human rights abuses. We strive to uphold these standards and to demonstrate our commitment to them with our supply chain social responsibility programs. As noted earlier, we conduct a full EICC Code of Conduct implementation within our supply chain to ensure proper supplier employee working conditions. Furthermore, we have our comprehensive Lenovo Supplier Code of Conduct that upholds our values and includes provisions prohibiting corruption, bribery, human trafficking, discrimination and retaliation to worker complaints. Lenovo requires its suppliers to have formal grievance mechanisms. We actively support procurement diversity (see the Supplier Diversity section). We are also focused on minerals in our supply chain from conflict-afflicted areas where human rights abuses have been known to occur. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 61 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS CONFLICT MINERALS Lenovo recognizes the importance of concerns regarding the sourcing of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3T/G) and other minerals. When sourced from regions experiencing political and social conflict, which may include the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or surrounding countries, these materials are generally referred to as “conflict minerals.” We fully support the efforts of the EICC Conflict-Free Smelter Initiative (CFSI), NGOs and governmental bodies to solve this complex issue, and have supported these efforts with our EICC membership since 2006 and direct participation in EICC CFSI programs. Lenovo has also formally joined the EICC Responsible Raw Materials Initiative (RRMI) to focus on the next stage of addressing conflict materials. Lenovo is on the advocacy team supporting the efforts of the Cobalt, Tin and Sensing workgroups. In FY 2017/18 we will commence new efforts in policy, actions and transparency. Lenovo fully believes in responsible sourcing and not participating in boycotts in the DRC or other new areas as the RRMI drives new efforts. Some companies have engaged in boycotts, but boycotts do not improve the situation on the ground and are counter to the OECD Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. Those guidelines are the de facto industry standard in this regard. In FY 2016/17, we continued our comprehensive due diligence program to understand the chain of custody of conflict minerals in our supply chain. This program included compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Dodd-Frank ruling and with the OECD. Lenovo’s specific activities included: • Implementing an industry-leading conflict minerals policy validated by independent third-party review • Engaging suppliers through formal contracts and directly validating their due diligence efforts via independent third-party EICC audits • Holding regular education sessions for internal employees, publishing monthly newsletters and providing supplier training as needed • Utilizing the EICC Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) for Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (RCOI) efforts across 95 percent of our procurement spend and our supply chain • Utilizing the EICC Conflict-Free Smelter Program (CFSP) and the Smelter Information Exchange (SET) to identify the status of smelters reported as being in our supply chain • Reporting the program status to Lenovo’s Chief Sustainability Officer • Publicly reporting the smelters and refiners in our supply chain 62 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS In FY 2016/17 we significantly improved our overall conflict-free status as noted below: • Overall conflict-free status improved from 75 percent to 82 percent of suppliers by spending • Tantalum achieved 100 percent conflict-free status • Tin and tungsten each achieved about 90 percent conflict-free status • Gold achieved about 75 percent conflict–free status • Overall about 90 percent of Lenovo’s supply chain is conflict-free compliant or formally active to become conflict-free • While Lenovo is a non-U.S. company with many non-U.S. suppliers (53 percent) and is not legally required to file reports to the U.S. Security and Exchange or covered by the Dodd-Frank law, we achieved the following: Supplier CMRT response rates were 100 percent The vast majority of our suppliers have public policies, require their suppliers to be conflict-free, use the CMRT reporting and use the EICC Conflict-Free Smelter Program (CFSP) for audit • We also integrated the Motorola supply chain into our conflict minerals program Full details and statistics on our reasonable country of origin inquiry, due diligences and smelters can be found in our most recent public report: http://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/social_responsibility/LenovoConflict-Minerals-Update. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, WATER USAGE AND WASTE GENERATION Lenovo continues to drive for accurate reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, water usage and waste generation across our supply chain. We ask our suppliers every year to formally provide their environmental impact data via either the EICC or the CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) reporting methodologies and platforms. CDP is a global organization with a much more comprehensive framework and reporting regimen for GHG emissions. It is important to note that suppliers representing greater than 70 percent of our procurement spend also report via CDP and have formal CDP performance ratings. In FY 2016/17, suppliers representing 95 percent of our procurement spend reported total Scope 1 and 2 emissions, water and waste. While our total emissions have increased about 50 percent over the past four years, our business volume has grown about 110 percent. This is due to increased sales and two major corporate acquisitions and their respective supply chains. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 63 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Other key statistics: • 92 percent of our suppliers by spending have public GHG reduction goals • 82 percent of our suppliers by spending have formal third-party verification of their emissions reductions • Suppliers must have greater than three percent annual GHG reduction goals in order to be rated “green” in our supplier report cards • 90 percent of our suppliers by spending have public water and waste reduction goals • We received “Limited Assurance” certification of supplier GHG emissions, which is the highest level of available third-party verification from Bureau Veritas, for 95 percent of our suppliers by spending With respect to water usage and waste generation, while this marks our third year of reporting, suppliers are still improving their ability to precisely measure usage and amounts. We know from past experience dealing with the early reporting years of GHG emissions that capturing 100 percent of supplier operational activity across multiple facilities and measuring it properly is a challenge. However, we are confident that we now have a much better baseline upon which to track overall environmental impact of water usage and waste generation and to drive reductions of the footprint. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK MANAGEMENT As required by the Lenovo Corporate Environmental Standards policy governing supplier relationships, the procurement team identifies areas of overall environmental risk based on specific criteria and then conducts prescribed actions to ensure risk is mitigated. Specifically, suppliers are classified by a risk category that drives the needed actions below. • Category 1 suppliers are those from whom Lenovo purchases off-the-shelf goods, or uses processes or services produced or offered commercially and that are consistent with the supplier’s normal business activities. In other words, Lenovo does not increase environmental impact due to special requirements. • Category 2 suppliers are those that may or may not present additional environmental risks. In these situations, Lenovo specifies raw materials, process materials and/or process methods outside the typical business activities of the supplier. In these cases, a pre-assessment is conducted to determine if formal environmental audits must occur similar to those as required for Category 3 suppliers, noted below. • Category 3 is designated for suppliers who handle hazardous waste, special waste and product endof-life management services. In these cases, approval of the Global Environment Affairs organization and environmental on-site audits are required. These suppliers are also subject to additional contractual terms and conditions and semiannual activity reporting. In FY 2016/17 all required environmental audits were conducted on time and as required and no events of noncompliance were noted. 64 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS SUPPLIER DIVERSITY Lenovo sees mutual value in promoting diversity in our business relationships. It is a natural part of our business strategy to create a diverse and competitive supplier base and to strengthen economic development in historically underutilized communities. Through its Supplier Diversity Program, Lenovo is committed to maximizing the inclusion of diverse suppliers by identifying opportunities, developing and incubating relationships, creating processes that encourage diverse supplier integration, and building on our already strong culture of inclusion – The Lenovo Way. Lenovo identifies diverse suppliers as those that are at least 51-percent owned and controlled by women, minorities, veterans, service-disabled veterans and persons with a disability. Lenovo also includes suppliers that are defined by the U.S. Federal Government as a Small Disadvantaged Business, HUB Zone business or small business. Lenovo partners with a variety of national and regional organizations such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) to facilitate supplier identification and program development. Lenovo is also active in local and regional events aimed at promoting, creating opportunities for and celebrating diverse suppliers. Lenovo currently conducts more than US$150 million in business annually with small and/or certified diverse suppliers. This represents all Lenovo operations in the United States (including System x and Motorola).

Our leadership team is diverse and balanced: the top 12 company leaders include three women and come from six different countries; 17 nationalities are represented in the top 100. Lenovo’s 52,000-plus employees and contractors speak more than 40 languages and live in more than 60 countries around the world. At Lenovo, we view our diversity as a key competitive advantage. This diversity in leadership and talent allows the company to take advantage of far-reaching industry trends, while at the same time leveraging the unique strengths of local leadership to drive success in key markets. While incredibly diverse, our team is united by our commitment, ownership and pioneer initiative. Our cohesive global culture and shared values are critical to driving the speed, efficiency, innovation and execution that separate us from the competition. OUR CULTURE AND PEOPLE Our Culture Over the past year, we’ve considered the critical role our culture plays as we move our bold vision of ‘Device + Cloud’ from wishful dream to reality. The statement “We do what we say, we own what we do. We wow our customers” best represents Lenovo’s culture of not only delivering on commitments and taking ownership of everything we do, but also encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship and being team players. We are in the midst of an intensive effort to make all employees laser-focused on serving customers, whether they be external or internal customers. Lenovo’s culture is backed by labor practices, pay for performance, wellness programs and other benefits that support every Lenovo employee, from factory workers to our most senior executives. The uniting of our culture and our systems engenders a “We are Lenovo” team spirit that enables us to continue delivering breakthrough innovations and award-winning designs to our growing customer base. Our People At Lenovo, our people share a common aspiration to be the very best. Whether serving our customers, working together as a team or contributing to the community, we are working to build a unique company delivering unparalleled products created and supported by people who represent a wealth of cultures and experiences. Our strength lies in this diversity. And every day, on every project, we are creating a better place for inclusion and respect for others. We are dedicated Classroom training is an important component of to fostering an environment that encourages employee learning and development. entrepreneurism and ownership – a workplace where people’s talents can be challenged and their results recognized and rewarded. 68 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS LABOR PRACTICES AND HUMAN RIGHTS Lenovo’s Human Rights policy states our commitment to respecting human rights in everything we do, and we extend those rights to our employees and others directly or indirectly employed in our supply chain. Lenovo operates in accordance with the universal human rights identified in the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights and the U.N. Global Compact. Lenovo does not permit the use of child labor, forced labor or coercion, including physical punishment, in any Lenovo operation. Since 2009, Lenovo has been a signatory and active participant in the United Nations Global Compact, a public-private strategic policy initiative for businesses committed to aligning operations and strategies with 10 universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anticorruption. As a signatory, we support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, including the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and ensure that our business practices are not complicit in human rights abuses. Lenovo manages all operations consistent with the spirit and intent of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Lenovo performs due diligence across its value chain to identify risks and avoid complicity in human rights violations. We provide access to grievance mechanisms, investigate allegations and escalate known cases of human rights abuse to senior leadership. Training and accountability for respecting human rights are integrated across the business and the supply chain. Lenovo has also set up a process where we engage internal and external stakeholders to address common challenges and advance human rights practices through continuous improvement. For more information on how Lenovo protects human rights in its supply chain, please see the section Human Rights in Lenovo’s Supply Chain. COMPENSATION, PERFORMANCE AND RECOGNITION We believe that our employees are the most valuable strategic resource at Lenovo. We recognize the importance of each unique individual and their need to be recognized frequently and rewarded fairly. A fully engaged workforce is the key to our differentiation and exceptional business performance. Lenovo believes and invests heavily in the concept of Total Rewards, which consists of five key elements: compensation, benefits, work-life balance, performance and recognition, and development and career opportunities. We believe that, collectively, these five elements are critical to attract, motivate and retain our most valuable strategic resource—our people. Lenovo’s culture guides us in tying pay to performance. We believe that exceptional individual performance will support and drive exceptional business performance, which will result in exceptional pay for individuals. All “Key Performance Indicators” throughout the organization are linked to a business strategy. In terms of our pay practices, we carefully monitor and evaluate market trends and industry practices in each of our geographic locations to ensure that we remain competitive. Our culture allows us to react quickly when we see trends changing. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 69 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS In addition to maintaining competitive wages, in 2016 we implemented a comprehensive approach to performance management and bonus awards that we call “the 3x3 program.” This program is operated on a globally consistent platform that is aligned with Lenovo’s matrixed, multibusiness operating model. The model comprises three defined business stages and three core business synergy levels, resulting in a more flexible incentive framework that supports our business at difference stages of the life cycle. It accounts for competitive pressures, empowers business units to adapt their plans to meet business objectives and is closely aligned with The Lenovo Way, the touchstone of our company culture that focuses us on delivering our commitments and taking ownership in everything we do. Lenovo’s performance management system is critical, as our success depends on how well each of us achieves our individual goals and contributes to the company’s strategic objectives. The 3x3 performance management program is the means by which all Lenovo employees worldwide set their goals for the year, receive feedback on their performance and development needs, are evaluated on their performance and, if eligible, receive a performance bonus. Sales employees and executives are assessed annually and nonsales employees are assessed semiannually. In addition to the annual assessment, sales employees also receive quarterly reviews. While formal assessments occur once or twice a year for all employees, managers are expected to provide ongoing feedback to their employees throughout the year. Completion of employee performance reviews is tracked at the end of the performance review cycle to ensure each employee has received performance feedback as required. Reward and recognition are very important at Lenovo, so much so that we also encourage every business unit leader to develop supplemental programs, based on broad global guidelines, to reinforce frequent and continuous recognition of successful collaborative efforts and exceptional performance within their organizations. Lenovo’s compensation programs are designed to provide marketcompetitive compensation that will attract, motivate and retain talent: • Base pay makes up an important part of an employee’s total cash opportunity at Lenovo; it reflects the value of the job in the marketplace, performance and the value of individual contribution to the Company. • Short-term incentive plans (including sales compensation) reward employees on overall corporate, business group or team performance, while recognizing individual performance as well. • Long-term incentive plans are targeted to executives, critical nonexecutives, top performers and high-potential employees. 70 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS GLOBAL BENEFITS Lenovo recognizes the importance that employees and their families place on a comprehensive benefits package. To ensure that Lenovo can attract and retain high-quality talent in the competitive technology marketplace, a variety of benefits are offered that are intended to aid in managing and protecting the physical and financial well-being of employees and their families. Benefits packages are designed to follow these strategic guidelines: • Position Lenovo competitively within the local marketplace • Align with and support Lenovo business and cultural strategy • Emphasize Lenovo’s commitment to wellness To achieve these goals, Lenovo must be flexible and consider varying customs, practices, legal requirements and employee expectations around the world to design impactful benefits programs. Health and Wellness Benefits Private health benefits such as medical, dental and vision care are offered in many countries to supplement government-provided healthcare. These arrangements often permit employees to provide coverage for dependents, including spouses, domestic partners, children or other family members. Employees may share in the cost of these benefits, especially when coverage for dependents is available. However, Lenovo shoulders the majority of these costs as an investment in the well-being of employees. Wellness is a critical component of a comprehensive benefits package. Lenovo believes that a successful wellness program can result in benefits that go way beyond the financial measure of reduced medical costs, with more productive employees and less absenteeism most notable among them. “Live Well with Lenovo,” the Lenovo wellness brand, was relaunched in 2012. The wellness program in the U.S. includes a health risk assessment and biometric screenings, health coaching, expanded nutrition and fitness tools, wellness seminars and other educational content, and membership in Lenovo’s PowerUp fitness facilities located at our main North Carolina campuses. Lenovo currently offers a variety of wellness programs around the world, including fitness facility discounts, employee assistance programs, health coaching, stress and lifestyle management programs, medical consulting and screening services, and access to health educational material. Informational resources are made available globally to assist employees with wellness matters and disease prevention. To ensure successful business continuity planning, Lenovo has developed and activated comprehensive pandemic plans and procedures to limit the potential impact of health-related concerns, such as the H1N1 virus. As dictated by these procedures, health and safety information/requirements are available and shared with employees and nonemployees as needed. Lenovo’s long-term wellness goals include the evolution of its wellness brand and related programs globally under one comprehensive umbrella. Income Protection In the event that an employee is unable to work due to illness or injury, Lenovo provides for protection of income in many countries. These benefits may take the form of salary continuation for a period of time and generally supplement government-provided benefits. For longer periods of illness or injury, Lenovo commonly provides additional disability benefits. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 71 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Retirement or Post-Employment Savings To supplement the income of employees and survivors after retirement or separation from Lenovo, a variety of savings programs are offered. These programs may be mandatory or voluntary, depending on legal and marketplace considerations. It is quite common for programs to have both an employee and employer contribution component, with the latter signifying Lenovo’s willingness to make a current investment to provide future security for employees and their families. Lenovo continually reviews and improves its benefits to ensure that they are competitive and meet the needs of our diverse employee population. EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING Lenovo is committed to its investment in talent development and has a robust and systematic approach to employee, manager and executive development. Lenovo’s development agenda is targeted at building the capabilities of our people and our organization through three primary ways: 1) Experiences on the job – learning while doing. This is how 70 percent of all learning occurs. 2) Colleague relationships at Lenovo – mentors, guides, coaches, managers. Employees learn through their successes, failures, guidance and advice. This is how 20 percent of learning occurs. 3) Education – formal training in the classroom or online that teaches key principles and skills. This is how 10 percent of learning occurs. Our systematic approach combines all three methods to maximize learning. It includes formal employee and leadership education programs, targeted people planning and international rotations, Women in Lenovo Leadership Forums, mentoring circles, executive coaching, structured feedback, and a variety of additional assessment and development tools. Lenovo’s training includes regular mandatory online training courses for all global employees on “Code of Conduct” and compliance subjects. All Lenovo employees receive ongoing training in areas such as culture, compliance, information security and performance management. All employees have career discussions at least annually. Employees received on average 4.5 hours of training in FY 2016/17. Lenovo refreshed its learning platform this past year, marking the start of an exciting new journey to enable learning and professional development anytime, anywhere. The platform, entitled Grow@Lenovo, is designed to integrate learning resources, collaborative learning environments and tools, access to experts and user-generated content sharing. Lenovo is building an environment to support learning, development and best practice sharing across functions, geographies and cultures. While Lenovo continues to provide access to the very latest in product training and skills development, Grow@Lenovo will take learning and development to a new level. There are Communities of Practice, created to grow and drive innovative thinking and best practice sharing. Curriculums, both virtual and in-person, have been created to address the knowledge and skills required to win in the always-connected Internet plus marketplace. All of this is just a single click away, with no need for employees to log in. This new tool had over 33,000 users in FY 2016/17. 72 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Grow@Lenovo capabilities include: • Instant access to learning resources from anywhere within Lenovo’s network • Sharing of content and resources from experts and peers alike • Integration to employee performance records to capture and celebrate development efforts Grow@Lenovo represents a significant investment in the professional development of our employees. By consolidating Lenovo’s learning materials and courseware in one place, we will be able to leverage our knowledge assets across the organization and improve the learning experience for all employees. Mentoring Lenovo encourages mentoring relationships. They are an excellent vehicle for growing an employee’s skills and knowledge in order to develop his or her full potential. Mentees and mentors both gain from participation in a mentoring relationship. Mentees can increase their understanding in the targeted subject area, and mentors can sharpen their leadership and coaching skills. To aid employees in the mentoring process, Lenovo provides two online courses: “Mentoring: Identifying Your Goals” and “Mentoring: Developing Relationships.” Panel Hosted by Women in Lenovo Leadership Both courses include a simulation. Orientation & Training For over three decades, one of our key differentiators in the marketplace has been our people. We believe that our employees are our greatest asset. Our organization’s practice has been to attract, develop and retain the best people around the world. With this philosophy in mind, we place a high emphasis on staff development and ensuring that our talented employees can take on new and different challenges. This begins on each employee’s first days of employment, in New Employee Orientation. This program introduces new employees to a wide variety of topics, including Lenovo’s history and culture, diversity, business policies and practices as well as the tools and resources available to employees. Lenovo encourages cross-cultural development by means of diverse experiences. Development is strengthened by the frequency and quality of the career-focused discussions that employees have with their managers. The management development program “For Those Who Manage” has a particular focus on improving career development discussions. The primary source of career development support comes from an employee’s immediate manager. Employees are encouraged to take ownership of their careers and utilize a mix of work experiences, education and relationship building to aid in their growth, development and upward movement. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 73 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Succession Planning Lenovo has an established organization and human resources planning process that ensures we: • Have the right structure in place to deliver on our strategy • Identify the talent needed now and in the future • Invest in attracting, retaining and developing top talent • Continue raising the bar on internal and external talent EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATIONS Lenovo actively fosters open communication among employees – as well as communication between employees and the company – in several ways: Meetings To help make our employees effective and informed “brand ambassadors,” Lenovo holds regular employee (All Hands) meetings in each of its business units and functions, typically on a quarterly basis. Employees attend in person when possible, with remote participation enabled through a combination of web stream and conference calls. These meetings feature ample opportunities for employees to ask questions, interact with each other and their senior leaders, and hear the latest on Lenovo’s strategy and mission. Guest speakers help employees deepen their knowledge about other areas of the company. Meetings are recorded for later playback to ensure employees can review anything they may have missed. Lenovo’s goal is to ensure that our employees are fully informed on the strategic direction of the company and that they have firsthand access to our senior leaders. “Lenovo Listens” Employee Engagement Survey Lenovo seeks the insights of its employees worldwide through its Lenovo Listens employee engagement survey. This survey is designed to gain insight on how Lenovo employees view their jobs, their management, their teams, their rewards and the company as a whole. Lenovo Listens is an important measure of employees’ pride, motivation and commitment to staying at Lenovo. Research shows that measures of employee engagement can be used to predict the amount of effort that employees are willing to invest in their jobs as well as employee retention. In addition, employee engagement can be tied to important measures of organizational performance, including financial results, customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Lenovo analyzes the data from the survey and encourages meaningful action planning to address any areas of concern. Post-survey focus groups are also conducted to better understand employee input and drive action planning at the management and corporate level for continuous improvement. As in past years, results from the 2015 Lenovo Listens survey will help managers and employees identify specific actions to further increase team engagement and productivity. The next Lenovo Listens survey will be conducted during the summer of 2017. 74 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Operational Changes Lenovo provides advance notice of significant operational changes in accordance with local requirements and collective bargaining agreements in the locations in which we operate. We meet regularly with employees and provide information on business changes. In cases where operational changes are required, we take steps to mitigate negative impacts. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION Women Breaking Rules Referral Drive and Mixer At Lenovo, people are our most valuable asset and key to success. We know from our own experience that it is not just a diverse workforce but an inclusive culture that creates a space where our employees create, innovate and drive change. Lenovo believes that “Connected People Change the World” and it is this belief that drives what we deliver in the market and how we deliver it. When our employees bring their whole selves to the workplace, it allows their emotional and intellectual abilities to thrive and to meet the needs of our customers. Lenovo focuses beyond our diverse employees and customers. We take a holistic approach to being an employer. We want to positively impact our diverse suppliers and community as well. Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive community where all employees are engaged and feel fulfilled in terms of the impact of their work. Lenovo’s diversity and inclusion strategy is incorporated in a five-year roadmap that focuses on five areas: 1) fostering diverse and inclusive employee systems (policies, practices, and programs); 2) building inclusive leadership behaviors; 3) designing geocentric diversity strategies (diversity is different everywhere, leading inclusively is what is constant); 4) creating accountability; and 5) telling our story both internally and externally. We have made significant progress in all five areas during year one, FY 2016/17. The diversity team, in partnership with various Human Resource centers of excellence, worked to embed diversity and inclusion concepts in the employee experience. The North America Talent Acquisition team saw a 61 percent increase in diverse applicants through efforts to increase the influx of diverse candidates. Globally, the Women’s Leadership Development program continued to build our pipeline of women executives with 19.1 percent of executive promotions being women, just short of our goal of 20 percent. Our CEO demonstrated his commitment to gender diversity with three new female executives added to his team, for a senior executive team total of 33 percent women. Our China Talent Acquisition team hired over 25 individuals with disabilities, and our “Nothing Without a Woman” campaign in EMEA, which had the stated goal of encouraging gender diversity in the workplace, helped attract over 2,500 women applicants. Other key successes include a perfect score of 100/100 on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index – an independent survey that measures an organization’s inclusive practices for LGBT employees. Lenovo unsuccessfully applied for the 2016 Working Mother 100 Best Companies. This survey reflected policies and benefits from 2015 prior to harmonizing benefits with employees joining from our acquisition of Motorola and IBM x86. Lenovo also addressed several additional gaps identified. We expect significant progress in our ranking in 2017. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 75 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Lenovo will never lose sight of its commitment as an equal opportunity employer. Lenovo offers equal employment opportunities without regard to race, color, gender, religion, age, nationality, social or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, pregnancy, disability, veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law. These opportunities include all terms, conditions and privileges of employment, including but not limited to recruiting, hiring, job placement, training, compensation, benefits, discipline, advancement and termination. All employees are expected to adhere to both the spirit and the letter of our long-standing policies: Lenovo’s Commitment to Diversity and Nondiscrimination and Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Policy Statement. Supplier Diversity Lenovo also actively promotes diversity in our business relationships. To read more about our Supplier Diversity program, please see the Supplier Diversity section. EMPLOYEE RETENTION To ensure retention of key talent, Lenovo uses the following strategies and programs: • Conducts global employee engagement survey (Lenovo Listens) to help identify opportunities to reduce the loss of key talent. • Leverages compensation programs such as long-term incentive stock-based awards and recognition to help retain key talent. • Ensures pay (base and incentive) is differentiated so top performers are paid on par with peers in the marketplace. • In cases where key, critical talent has opportunities outside Lenovo, the company takes specific “critical save” actions to retain these employees. The Lenovo population is composed of regular (permanent) employees, supplemental (temporary) employees and contract workers. From time to time, the senior leadership makes a business decision to move work from one country or region to another in support of the business strategy and objectives. When these decisions are made, great care is taken to ensure affected employees and nonemployees alike are provided with notice as required by local and/or country laws. Employees are provided with severance packages and career and training assistance where possible and as required by local/country laws. 7.2 SOCIAL INVESTMENTS COMMITMENT Lenovo’s social investments are focused on education and digital inclusion, themes that are integral to the success of our business. Lenovo annually commits up to one percent of its pretax income to global social investment programs and initiatives.

Proposed actions supported by Lenovo include: • Reducing global emissions from 40 to 70 percent between 2010 and 2050 • Aligning with the global scientific community’s generally accepted recommendations for maintaining global warming below two degrees Celsius over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels. We are working both internally and externally to minimize and mitigate climate risks. Lenovo is committed to continually reducing the global carbon footprint of all of its business activities. Lenovo has demonstrated its commitment by: • Developing a corporate Climate and Energy Policy • Implementing a long-term comprehensive Climate Change Strategy • Setting aggressive corporatewide objectives and targets which support the Policy and Strategy • Showing continual year-to-year progress in achieving those objectives and targets. In an effort to drive climate actions external to Lenovo’s operations, we monitor, support and in some cases participate in the development of voluntary carbon reduction programs, climate change regulations, renewable energy portfolio standards and product carbon footprint and labeling requirements both globally and regionally. Reducing energy consumption and associated carbon emissions is the primary focus of our climate change programs and strategy. Management of energy and carbon emissions reduction activities and programs is carried out within the scope of Lenovo’s global EMS. Lenovo is achieving its energy and carbon management goals through improvements in operational and logistical energy efficiency, reductions in energy consumption, switching to renewable energy sources where practicable, supporting an increase in renewable energy available via the grid, and purchasing renewable energy credits and carbon offsets. 90 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Over the past several years, Lenovo has experienced organic growth in conjunction with operational consolidation. In addition, significant structural changes and external market factors have presented unique challenges to staying on the course of achieving our climate change goals. We overcame these challenges by engaging internal teams and external partners to identify opportunities to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. The identified opportunities were then subjected to a project approval hierarchy that favors energy efficiency first, use of renewable energy second and finally, the purchase of renewable energy credits or carbon offsets. This process continues to lead to the identification and implementation of projects that support Lenovo’s goal of maintaining a sustainable balance among social, economic and environmental impacts. Visit www.lenovo.com/climate for more information on Lenovo’s Climate and Energy Policy, strategy, objectives and targets. OPERATIONAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY Given that one of Lenovo’s most significant environmental aspects is emissions associated with energy consumption, Lenovo’s goal is to continually improve the energy efficiency of its operations. Lenovo initiatives for energy reduction include activities such as installation of low-energy lighting and related electrical equipment, energy-efficiency improvements to HVAC systems, eliminating or improving usage of transformers and air compressors, manufacturing area optimization, manufacturing-line optimization, improving computer server room energy efficiency, consolidation of operations, and employee education. For more information on our performance relative to energy efficiency, please see the Energy Reductions in Operations section. RENEWABLE ENERGY Lenovo is committed to installing local renewable energy generation sources where feasible. In support of this commitment we continue to expand our use of on-site solar energy. In FY 2016/17 Lenovo’s photovoltaic solar panel installation at the Lenovo-Compal facility in Hefei, China, was completed and began producing electricity. The 3.9 MW plant will save approximately 3,900 metric tons of carbon Solar carports in Hefei, China emissions annually. Lenovo’s other renewable energy installations include solar hot water generation facilities in Beijing and Huiyang and solar electric generation plants in Beijing and Shanghai. The current solar capacity of all these projects is over 5 MW with emission reduction potential of over 5,000 metric tons of carbon emissions annually. Our next project will be a solar electricity installation at the Development Drive R&D center in Morrisville, N.C., U.S. A similar project is proposed for Lenovo’s site in Wuhan, China. These two proposed projects represent almost 6 MW of solar electric generation capacity. Lenovo has a target of achieving 30 MW of owned or leased renewable energy generation capacity globally by 2020. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 91 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS In 2016, Lenovo was again recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a Top 30 Tech & Telecom Green Power Partner for its purchase of renewable energy. Please click here for more information: https://www.epa.gov/greenpower/green-power-partnership-top-30-tech-telecom. RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS AND CARBON OFFSETS Where actual direct energy reductions or use of renewable energy sources are not technically or economically feasible, Lenovo chooses to purchase Renewable Energy Credits (REC), International Renewable Energy Credits (I-REC), Guarantees of Origin (GO) and carbon offsets.

CLIMATE CHANGE RISK/OPPORTUNITIES MANAGEMENT Climate change risks and opportunities are identified and evaluated as part of two processes within Lenovo’s business management systems. These include our global annual risk registration process and our annual environmental significant aspect evaluation. These two processes are connected, meaning that if climate change risks are identified in the global risk registration, they are considered in the environmental aspects analysis — and vice versa. 1. Lenovo’s formal risk management process includes, among other sustainability factors: environmental risk categories such as environmental incidents, catastrophic weather conditions, supply chain disruptions and other elements. Each business unit is required to annually identify risks and assess their impacts on Lenovo’s strategy execution, then develop mitigation plans for select identified risks. This process is managed by Lenovo’s Enterprise Risk Management team. 2. Climate change risks are also evaluated, and the results of this evaluation are considered in the annual risk registration process described above. Energy consumption, the associated greenhouse gas emissions and climate change are identified as significant environmental aspects and impacts for CH4 Lenovo GHG PFCs NO 2 Emissions SF6 CO 2 HFCs Scope 1 + Scope 2 Scope 3 Upstream Emissions from on-site fuel Scope 3 Downstream • Purchased goods and services combustion in owned/controlled • Transportation and distribution • Capital goods vehicles, use of purchased • Processing of sold products • Fuel and energy related activities not electricity & steam and fugitive • Use of sold products included in Scope 1 and 2 emissions • End-of-life treatment of sold • Transportation and distribution products • Waste generated in operations • Leased assets • Business travel FY 2009/10 Reduction by 40% FY 2019/20 • Franchises • Employee commuting • Leased assets Via energy efficiency, • Investments renewable energy, RECs and carbon offsets Notes: Scope 3 categories in orange are tracked and evaluated and in some cases actions are being taken to drive emissions reductions Scope 3 categories in blue have not been tracked and evaluated yet Scope 3 categories in grey are not relevant to Lenovo 92 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Lenovo. As such, associated risks and opportunities are evaluated and prioritized annually based on Lenovo’s significant aspect methodology in accordance with the requirements of our environmental management system. Per these requirements, climate change is evaluated relative to its actual and potential influence on the environment and the business. This process is managed by Lenovo’s Global Environmental Affairs team. As a demonstration of Lenovo’s long-term approach to risk management in this area, in May 2014, Lenovo’s Board of Directors (BOD) and Executive Committee (LEC) acted to increase Lenovo’s GHG emissions reduction commitment from 20 percent to 40 percent by FY 2019/20, relative to FY 2009/10 (see graphic above). We will meet this commitment through investment in on-site renewable generation, energy efficiency and renewable energy credits or offsets. Lenovo’s commitment to addressing climate change extends to supporting global initiatives such as the We Mean Business initiative, a coalition of businesses and investors supporting a transition to a low carbon economy. MINIMIZING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF LENOVO’S LOGISTICS Lenovo continues to optimize our logistics programs and work closely with our partners to ship products in the most environmentally responsible manner. We established a product transportation carbon emissions baseline for FY 2011/12 which aids in gauging our progress. Our accomplishments in FY 2016/17 include: • Streamlining the collection of logistics data by leveraging our online platform rather than collecting information manually from carriers via spreadsheets • Extending our carbon dashboard to China domestic transportation, monitoring performance and identifying opportunities for improvement • Engaging with key carriers to ensure they have effective sustainability programs in place Lenovo’s Global Logistics team has worked closely with the R&D team to develop a new, lighter weight pallet for air shipments. The lighter pallet, which weighs approximately 9.8 kilograms, was implemented at our Shenzhen plant in March 2016 and was extended to Lenovo original design manufacturers (ODMs) by September 2016. This initiative achieves a carbon emissions reduction of approximately 6,595 MT CO2e per year. In May 2016, Lenovo completed a switch from wooden pallets to light plywood pallets for its China mobile manufacturers. This switch yields a carbon emissions reduction of 4,160 MT CO2e yearly. The Global Logistics team proactively promotes rail transportation for shipments from China to Europe, and has shipped over 600 containers to Europe by rail. Global Logistics also drives ocean-transport consolidation opportunities to reduce the number of containers shipped out of China manufacturing sites with the goal of reducing carbon emissions. Lenovo participates in regional initiatives that seek to disseminate best practices in transportation. In Asia Pacific, Lenovo is a founding member of Green Freight Asia (GFA). GFA’s goal is to promote and improve fuel-efficient freight transport and decrease air pollution in Asia. Lenovo also is an approved U.S. EPA SmartWay partner. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 93 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS GLOBAL REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS Lenovo’s China Real Estate Lenovo’s China Property (CP) function is responsible for managing all office real estate activities and meeting Lenovo’s real estate needs in China. As of March 2017, CP managed nine Lenovo-owned sites in China with a total of 840,000 square meters. Additionally, the total leasing real estate portfolio represented 390,000 square meters across 54 locations in China. Energy efficiency was a key target of Lenovo’s CP team throughout FY 2016/17. We continually improve energy efficiency by optimizing facility management processes. We saved 278,440 kWh of electricity in our Beijing Headquarters West Campus lighting system by optimizing induction lamp sensor control in the office area and light control in the underground parking area. We also saved 94,350 kWh by optimizing air cooling system operation control in the Lenovo Beijing Building. Lenovo’s Real Estate Outside of China In FY 2016/17, the Real Estate and Workplace Solutions (REWS) team continued to drive innovation in creating workplaces that are productive for our employees and have fewer impacts on our planet. Our sustainability approach is focused on choosing the right sites, enhancing the environmental performance of our operations and improving workplace design. This approach helps us limit our exposure to environmental risks, lower our environmental footprint and create value for our clients, employees, communities and shareholders. Our real estate teams continuously look for opportunities to increase the efficient use of resources. Our EMEA Real Estate team identified an inefficient lab in Greenock, Scotland, and consolidated it with a facility in Glasgow. Combining the facilities reduced our footprint by 15,000 square feet and reduced the number of rack servers in the lab alone by 30 percent. This achieved an energy consumption reduction of almost 46 percent when comparing FY 2015/16 and FY 2016/17 energy use. Lenovo incorporates local community stakeholder perspectives on real estate sustainability initiatives when there are opportunities. For example, Lenovo’s Yamoto Lab is located in Yokohama, Japan, in the Minatomirai Center Building. The city of Yokohama has made a strong commitment to becoming a model city in Japan for low environmental impact, and the Minatomirai district has been chosen as one of the city’s showcases. Lenovo’s Yokohama site operations team considers the city’s sustainability goals in the planning of its own initiatives. Motorola Mobility Headquarters – The Chicago Merchandise Mart The Chicago Merchandise Mart is the largest LEEDEB certified building in the world and has received a LEED Platinum rating. Motorola is one of the Mart’s largest tenants with over 404,000 square feet of space. Motorola Mobility moved to its new downtown headquarters in 2014 with a long-term view on reducing its environmental impacts. The sustainability benefits reaped in FY 2016/17 include: 94 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Transportation • Sixty-five percent of Motorola employees took public transportation to get to and from work • Bio-diesel powered shuttle buses provided transport to employees from two commuter rail stations, reducing fossil fuel use Human Environment • A combination of LEDs and efficient fluorescents helped reduce the lighting load while providing adequate light levels for employees • Low-flow toilets, urinals and faucets conserved water Pollution Prevention • An enhanced recycling program was put in place for electronic waste, batteries, packaging materials, and lights in addition to the typical cardboard, paper, metals, glass and plastic recycling reduced waste going to landfills. Composting was added in 2016. • Green cleaning and pest control policies implemented by building management helped maintain better air quality FY 2016/17 ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE ENERGY REDUCTIONS IN OPERATIONS Improving operational energy efficiency is a fundamental element of Lenovo’s strategy to meet its GHG reduction targets. Since establishing climate change objectives and targets, Lenovo has implemented more than 150 operational energy-efficiency projects worldwide. All sites continue to strive to identify and implement energy-efficiency projects and evaluate the opportunity to employ the use of renewable energy. Throughout the organization, these activities are driven by site energy champions who lead energy teams that help implement energy reduction projects. During FY 2016/17 Lenovo approved approximately 20 new energy-efficiency projects. Some of the projects implemented during the year included: • Solar photovoltaic power generation installation in Hefei, China • Improvement of the server system in Beijing, China • Intelligent light controllers in Shenzhen and Chengdu, China • Improvements in HVAC efficiency at Chengdu, Shanghai and Shenzhen, China • Implementation of a low temperature solder process in our PC manufacturing All totaled, the approved projects will generate approximately US$570,000 in savings per year and reduce energy consumption by 5,200 MWh annually. It is estimated that the total annual CO2e savings will be over 3,400 MT CO2e. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 95 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS ENERGY CONSUMPTION Lenovo’s direct and indirect energy consumption by primary energy source for FY 2016/17 is detailed below.

The Scope 1 and Scope 2 reductions were accomplished by implementing energy efficiency projects (approximately 20 new projects such as installing low energy lighting, improving the efficiency of air conditioning systems and optimizing production processes); consolidating operations between existing and newly acquired sites; using solar sources at sites (solar panels in Shanghai and Hefei, China); and purchasing renewable energy certificates from renewable projects in the United States, international renewable energy certificates from renewable projects in China and Guarantees of Origin in Europe. Energy and GHG emissions data for all eight years included in our reporting (beginning with the baseline year FY 2009/10) was third-party verified. Click here to view the FY 2016/17 GHG Verification Statement, or visit www.lenovo.com/climate and follow the link from there. Lenovo began disclosing GHG emissions, climate change strategies and climate change risks and opportunities assessments through the voluntary public reporting system CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) in 2009. On the 2016 CDP Climate Change questionnaire, Lenovo was rated as Leadership Level with a score of A-, and we were honored with the Sustainable Enterprise Influence Award at CDP China’s report launch event in October 2016. Additionally we were included in the CDP pilot supplier engagement ranking and received a score of Aon the 2016 CDP Supply Chain survey along with the Combating Climate Change Award. Lenovo’s annual GHG disclosures are publicly available at www.cdp.net/reports. D. Emission Trading System Lenovo was selected for a pilot emission trading system in China. It was determined by the Beijing Municipal authority in 2013 that Lenovo Beijing, as a significant energy consumption enterprise (consuming more than 5,000 MT coal-equivalent electricity – CO2 emissions of over 10,000 MT/ year), must meet an emissions trading requirement and emissions reduction of two percent year-toyear for Lenovo Beijing sites. Our Shenzhen server plant is also listed as a significant carbon emission enterprise, but its released emissions do not exceed allocated allowances so reductions are not required. The trial period for the pilot emissions trading scheme has ended, and China is now in the process of implementing a nationwide mandatory carbon trading regimen. Lenovo is closely monitoring other provinces where the pilot program was imposed since our sites in Shanghai, Huiyang, Xiamen, Chengdu and Wuhan could be impacted in the future. Lenovo has a climate and energy policy and strategy in place and works on meeting the regulatory requirements of reducing emissions two percent year-by-year for our Beijing sites. The main activities include: establishing a comprehensive energy/carbon system for Beijing sites, including energy efficiency and renewable project identification and implementation (e.g., optimizing equipment controls on our production lines, installing energy-efficient lighting systems, installing solar hot water systems); implementing energy verification and energy management audits; and purchasing carbon offsets. This is the third year for Lenovo to be a part of this scheme and, since our business is developing constantly, we are anticipating the need to purchase offset allowances. The above-mentioned energy efficiency projects will help us meet the emissions reduction requirements. Additionally, Lenovo partnered with China Reach Academy of Environmental Sciences on the “Cleaning Production Program” that took place in all locations in Beijing during 2016 and focused on identifying energy savings opportunities and eliminating waste generated in our manufacturing/assembling operations. 100 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS E. Additional GHG Emissions Performance and Related Initiatives End-of-Life: We estimated4 that Lenovo avoided more than 72,000 MT CO2e thanks to recycling end-of-life electronic products in FY 2016/17. Suppliers: Lenovo continues to fully implement the EICC Environmental Reporting Initiative or the CDP reporting tool for top Tier 1 suppliers. Based on our suppliers’ Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reported for 2015, it was estimated that the emissions allocated to Lenovo from 95 percent of our direct spend (85 key suppliers) was approximately 2,055,000 MT CO2e. During the current reporting period, 92 percent of our procurement spend had specific GHG reduction targets/goals, which were achieved via implementing energy efficiency projects and/or renewable projects. However, due to adding new suppliers from our acquired businesses, moving volume to higher emission suppliers and getting more allocation of suppliers’ emissions, Lenovo’s overall supplier emissions increased. Transportation: During FY 2016/17, Lenovo continued collecting and calculating product transportation emissions data via DHL’s carbon data dashboard. Emissions from air, ocean, road and rail from international transport and multiple local carriers in China were estimated based on the shipment data received from key Lenovo carriers, which represent the majority of worldwide global logistics spend. Plans for future work in this area include: expanding emissions data collection to additional key suppliers, assessing the correlation of costs and emissions, and closely examining upstream transportation and distribution emissions. Fuel-and-Energy Related Activities: Lenovo included transmission and distribution (T&D) losses from electricity and natural gas used worldwide in the category “Fuel-and-energy related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2).” T&D loss rates for electricity by country listed in the World Bank database and natural gas loss mentioned in the ENERGY STAR® Performance Rating document were used for final emissions calculations. 4 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Waste Reduction Model (WARM, March 2016) emission factor of 2.50 MT CO2e per short ton was used for the estimate — https://www.epa.gov/warm/versions-waste-reduction-model-warm#WARM Tool V14 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 101 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS OPERATIONAL WASTE MANAGEMENT MANAGING NONHAZARDOUS SOLID WASTE One of Lenovo’s primary environmental objectives for operational facilities involves minimizing solid waste and maximizing recycling and reuse.

OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS WATER RESOURCES Lenovo’s manufacturing and product development operations do not have any wet processes. Since Lenovo withdraws water only from municipal sources and only for human support, we have minimal impact on local water resources. As such, there are minimal opportunities to reuse and recycle water, but this metric is tracked. We do, however, identify and implement opportunities to reduce and recycle the amount of water we consume. Detailed in the chart below is water use at Lenovo’s manufacturing and R&D facilities and some large office locations over the past eight years. Lenovo does not engage in any intentional discharge of wastewater other than into municipal wastewater disposal systems. There were no significant accidental releases of wastewater, fuel, chemicals or other potentially harmful substances at Lenovo facilities during the fiscal year.

Ozone-depleting substances used in HVAC and fire-suppression equipment are managed in accordance with local regulations, and intentional releases are prohibited. Lenovo requires the reporting of unintentional releases of chemical substances as an environmental incident. During FY 2016/17, there were no incidents of refrigerant release. We only added refrigerants to our equipment during maintenance services. Lenovo does not have significant direct air emissions such as NOx and SOx. In addition, Lenovo has no wet chemical or industrial processes that use volatile organic compounds (VOC) and thus has no point sources of VOC. Household and cleaning products that contain small quantities of VOC are used at some of our facilities but associated fugitive emissions are minimal and are not quantified. SPILLS In FY 2016/17 there was one accidental release at the Lenovo facility in Whitsett, N.C., U.S. The incident involved the spill of approximately 0.5 pounds of fork truck battery electrolytes onto the floor. The spill was contained and captured without offsite impact. Corrective actions were implemented to mitigate the chance of recurrence. Due to the nature and size of the spill, there was no requirement to notify a regulatory authority. BIODIVERSITY Lenovo is not aware of any significant impacts of its activities, products and services on biodiversity, including impacts from water discharge and runoff from our operations. Lenovo requires an environmental site assessment for acquisition or divestiture of facilities or real estate. Our internal new project environmental assessment requires an evaluation relative to the potential for impacts on protected habitats or protected or endangered species. 8.3 ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS PRODUCTS Lenovo’s commitment to protecting the environment dates back to our early days as a company. By the time the acquisition of the IBM PC division was completed in 2005, Lenovo had already developed technical specifications for PCs that included environmental attributes such as energy efficiency, while at the same time its commercial products were designed to meet China’s rapidly evolving energy-saving targets. With the expansion of Lenovo’s global reach in 2005, the company took environmental sustainability a step further by adopting a comprehensive Environmentally Conscious Products Program. Supported by Lenovo’s Global Environmental Affairs team, this companywide initiative was implemented by a network of Environmentally Conscious Product engineers and green product teams within each business unit. 104 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS PRODUCT MATERIALS Lenovo’s product development process is focused on integrating environmentally preferred materials into our products. Incorporating post-consumer recycled content (PCC) and post-industrial recycled content (PIC) plastics continues to be instrumental to our development strategy. Use of Recycled Plastics Starting in 2007, as new grades of recycled plastics with PCC became available, Lenovo’s product development teams began to use these environmentally preferred materials to satisfy corporate environmental objectives and targets and meet new customer requirements. Using these engineered plastics not only saves the natural resources and energy that would have gone into manufacturing new plastics, but also diverts both PCC and PIC from landfills. These environmental benefits are achieved while still creating a product that meets Lenovo’s high-performance standards. Usage of PCC in Products Released in FY 2016/17 1~10% PCC >10% PCC > 25% PCC 50% Select notebooks, desktops, accessories ThinkPad L460 ThinkCentre M910z ThinkVision T23i-10 ThinkPad S5 ThinkVision TIO22 ThinkVision TIO24 Lenovo continues to expand its emphasis on green design with the ThinkPad L Series. The LCD cover, palm rests and top and bottom cases of these notebooks use up to 30 percent PCC from sources such as used office water jugs and IT equipment. ThinkPad has also succeeded in using PCC in the very thin walls of battery packs. The ThinkPad Ultra Dock, ThinkPad Pro Dock and ThinkPad Basic Dock use PCC as well. To overcome the continuing challenges of using recycled content in the design and manufacture of smart connected devices, especially notebooks, tablets and smartphones, Lenovo’s team of engineers works closely with our PCC suppliers to develop and qualify new grades of plastic resins previously unavailable to the IT industry. Using PCC in IT products presents significant challenges due to the unique structural, performance and cosmetic requirements associated with these applications. Depending on the final application requirements, the plastic resins contain between 10 and 85 percent PCC. Some plastic resins also contain up to 20 percent PIC. All of these materials receive environmental and performance qualifications prior to their approval and use in Lenovo product applications. Recycled Content Usage to Date Since early 2005, Lenovo has used over 193 million pounds (gross) of plastic materials containing PCC and/or PIC in its products, with net PCC of over 90 million pounds and net PIC of more than 1.9 million pounds. In 2016, Lenovo used nearly 15.8 million pounds (gross) of recycled plastics with net PCC of over 10.2 million pounds. Please see Objectives and Targets on page 31 for Lenovo’s recycled content usage targets for FY 2017/18. The following graph shows Lenovo’s annualized use of PCC and PIC plastics over the past five years. The decline reflects a decreasing use of plastics overall, which is resulting from successful efforts to make products thinner and lighter. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 105 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Use of Plastics Containing Recycled Content Use of Recycled Plastics in Products 30,000,000 16,000,000 14,000,000 25,000,000 12,000,000 20,000,000 10,000,000 Pounds Pounds 15,000,000 8,000,000 6,000,000 10,000,000 4,000,000 5,000,000 2,000,000 0 0 CY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Plastics Containing Recycled Content (PCRC) Net Post-Industrial Recycled Content (PIC) Net Post-Consumer Recycled Content (PCC) Other Materials of Interest Lenovo’s corporatewide environmental standards and specifications require the designers of all Lenovo IT products to consider certain environmentally conscious design practices to facilitate and encourage recycling and minimize resource consumption. Some examples include: • All product lines adhere to the marking of plastic parts greater than 25 grams for identification of resins for recycling. • Products are designed to minimize the types of plastics they contain and avoid contamination of plastics by paints, glues or welded connections. Tools needed for disassembly to subsystem levels are also universally available. • Product-specific upgradeability features are described in product literature and declarations for all Lenovo product lines. • Recycled resins, ranging in recycled content from 10 percent to more than 85 percent, are used in a number of Lenovo hardware applications and are specified as preferred materials where practical. Lenovo is working toward the goal of including some amount of recycled plastic in all new products. • New products are evaluated for chemical emissions. To minimize potential volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, nonsolvent-based powder coatings are used for decorative painted parts wherever practical. Lenovo supports a precautionary approach, ensuring that appropriate actions are taken even if causeand-effect relationships are not fully established scientifically. Lenovo’s priority is to use environmentally preferable materials whenever applicable. In adhering to this precautionary approach, Lenovo supports restricting the intentional addition of materials that are potentially concerning when economically and technically viable alternatives exist. These restrictions may also include implementing concentration limits for incidental occurrences. For materials where economically and technically viable alternatives do not exist, Lenovo collects data on the usage of these materials above the defined concentration limit. This data can then be reported to customers or other stakeholders. Lenovo continues to actively search for environmentally preferable materials that can be used as substitutes. One example of this transition is eliminating the use of mercury from backlighting in Lenovo displays. Lenovo completed the phase out of mercury in all our display parts and products in 2014. 106 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS We also expect our partners and suppliers to demonstrate the same commitment to environmentally sound practices. Our supplier specifications are available at: http://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/global_ procurement/Guidelines/Restrictions_and_Packaging.html. Lenovo restricts the use of environmentally sensitive materials in our products. The specification encompasses both regulatory and Lenovo-imposed material bans and restrictions. This includes the prohibition of ozone-depleting substances in all applications; the restriction on the use of persistent organic pollutants (PoPs) under the Stockholm Convention; and the elimination of materials covered under European Union (EU) Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), even beyond those jurisdictions where regulatory requirements exist. Lenovo’s implementation strategy and requirements are consistent with the requirements specified in the EU’s RoHS Directive and REACH Regulation. Lenovo supports phasing out1 brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PVC and is committed to driving its supply chain toward this goal. Lenovo has made significant progress toward the elimination of BFR and PVC from our systems. We continue to focus on eliminating halogen from our top-selling products and across as many commodities as possible. Each product group completes a low halogen scorecard for each new product developed. The product groups have committed to improve the generation-togeneration low halogen score for at least one mainstream high volume product released during FY 2017/18.2 Highlights from 2016 include the following: • Elimination of most BFR and PVC from ThinkPad notebooks. BFRs are used in power cords, cables, AC adapters, planar ASMs, subcards, connectors and some modular parts. PVC is only used in power cords and cables. In addition, all ThinkPad notebooks have low halogen printed circuit boards. • Many Lenovo commercial monitors meet the iNEMI definition of low halogen with the exception of their PCBA and external cables. • Lenovo ThinkCentre desktops have low halogen chassis and CPUs. Lenovo has completely phased out the use of BFR/PVC in all mechanical plastic parts (such as external covers, housings, etc.) across all Lenovo product lines. Lenovo currently prohibits the following from intentional addition to any Lenovo parts: • Polybrominated Biphenyls (PBBs) • Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) • Deca-Brominated Diphenyl Ethers 1 Lenovo supports the definition of “BFR/PVC free” as defined in the “iNEMI Position Statement on the ‘Definition of Low-Halogen’ Electronics (BFR/CFR/PVC-Free).” 2 To support this activity, all BUs shall include a requirement for the evaluation of low halogen components (including raw card PCBs) in the development marketing requirements document and RFI/RFQs. Qualified low halogen parts available at cost parity shall be used. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 107 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Lenovo has also made significant progress in phasing out halogen in many commodities across several product lines. For example, all plastic enclosures; most components and connectors (with the exception of printed board laminates); all mechanical plastic parts such as product covers, housings, bezels, etc.; and many hard disk drives, optical disk drives, solid state drives, LCD screens, memory, CPUs, chipsets, communication cards and other commodities have offerings that meet the iNEMI definition of low halogen. Lenovo plans to release additional BFRand PVC-free models across the Think and Idea family of products as acceptable alternative materials become available, working toward the goal to phase out the use of these materials across all newly introduced products. We continue to work with our suppliers to pilot new BFRand PVC-free applications. Lenovo recognizes that the phase-out of these materials is dependent upon the availability of suitable alternatives that meet Lenovo’s technological, quality, environmental, health and safety requirements. Lenovo has identified a list of materials and substances of environmental interest. These substances may be candidates for further restrictions in the future. Lenovo holds suppliers accountable for reporting the use of these materials through Supplier Material Declarations. An industry standard IPC 1752A XML Full Material Disclosure (FMD) form, submitted via the Green Data Exchange (GDX), is the preferred format for confirmation of compliance to the restrictions and for reporting when substances in question are above the specified concentration levels. Lenovo has achieved FMD for all product types in FY 2016/17, realizing quick response to regulatory compliance updates, specifically for REACH SVHC updates. FMD provides material usage data which Lenovo uses to analyze material environmental health and safety attributes to aid in the process of selecting the most appropriate eco-friendly substances. Lenovo also tries to reduce the categories of substances, aiming to simplify e-waste disposal. We have made it a point to inform customers about the environmental attributes of our products and compliance with applicable laws and regulations through the presentation of a completed industry standard IT Eco Declaration (based on Annex B2 of ECMA-370 5th edition, June 2015). Declarations for newly released products are posted on Lenovo’s environmental website at: www.lenovo.com/ ecodeclaration. Consistent with our precautionary approach, we continuously analyze the regulatory environment and consider input from our customers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other stakeholders in evaluating the potential health and environmental impacts of our products. We weigh these inputs to determine the restricted substances, as well as the substances of interest to be tracked for the purpose of reporting and for consideration of future restrictions. PRODUCT ENERGY EFFICIENCY Product energy efficiency remains a core focus for Lenovo. Through collaboration with other OEMs, as well as industry stakeholder work groups, existing and proposed global IT product energy efficiency policies, regulations and requirements are vetted against current and future technology. The results of this effort are leveraged to develop leading edge products with much improved overall and operating efficiencies. Ongoing activities include updates to the ENERGY STAR® program specifications, U.S. DOE Appliance and Equipment standards, California Appliance Efficiency Program requirements, China CEC standards, EU Ecodesign (ErP) requirements and many other emerging protocols and regulations. To further improve product energy efficiency for desktops, workstations and servers, Lenovo certifies internal power supplies to Ecova Plug Load Solutions’ 80 Plus program for power supply efficiency. 80 Plus certified power supplies are independently tested and verified to the program’s rated efficiency 108 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS criteria; i.e., Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Lenovo desktop, workstation and server products equipped with 80 Plus power supplies are significantly more energy efficient than systems equipped with typical power supplies. The energy consumption and performance of Lenovo products meet the efficiency requirements of China, Japan, the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions. Many Lenovo notebook, desktop, server and monitor products satisfy and even exceed the current ENERGY STAR® requirements. The ENERGY STAR® qualified models are listed at www.energystar.gov. For more information about Lenovo’s energyefficient products, go to: www.lenovo.com/energy. GENERATIONAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT ENERGY EFFICIENCY Lenovo continues to drive energy efficiency improvements in our products both from a generation-togeneration perspective and by driving innovative new approaches to personal computer design. These improvements result in significant carbon emission reductions over the lifetime of the products’ use by our customers. Using a ThinkCentre desktop computer as an example, with assumptions regarding the number of computers in use and the same usage habits over a three-year use period, the numbers tell the story.

Lenovo designs its products to maximize their product lifecycle and offers three-year standard warranties and five years of replacement parts availability on many of our top selling commercial products to support this extended lifecycle. Threeyear warranties are offered as the base warranty on many top-selling Think-branded products, including all commercial monitors, notebooks, desktops and others. In addition, customers can purchase warranty upgrades to extend the base warranty by one or two years for many products. Base warranties for Lenovo consumer (Idea) products vary by product type and geography, but typically start at one to two years for the base warranty with the option for many products to purchase an extended warranty. Click here for more details on Lenovo’s warranties. Lenovo is continuously designing innovative features for our products to help extend their useful life. For example, Lenovo Longevity Battery Technology extends notebook battery cycle life through key technologies, including: • Increased use of lithium polymer cells: Used in notebooks and tablets with embedded batteries, these cells typically provide longer life cycles than lithium-ion cylindrical cells. • Longer lifespan batteries: Many Lenovo embedded batteries are designed to last two to three times longer than standard batteries. Lenovo Services offers three-year warranty upgrades on many embedded batteries. The longer lifespan is made possible due to carefully selected cells and charge algorithms. • Dual mode charging algorithms: These technologies are used on most notebook batteries and adjust charge voltage and current over time to prolong the battery’s lifespan. The feature is implemented in the hardware and as part of the battery firmware so it is not operating system or application dependent and works with any software load. • Field updateable battery firmware: Customers can download a firmware update utility which allows them to apply firmware fixes to batteries in service, eliminating the need to replace batteries due to firmware problems. This program allows customers to apply fixes quickly and at no cost, even on batteries outside of warranty. PRODUCT PACKAGING Lenovo is committed to offering environmentally preferable packaging for its products. Over the past several years, Lenovo has had a strong focus on increasing the use of recycled and recyclable materials in packaging, reducing the size of packaging, and expanding the use of bulk and reusable packaging solutions. Beginning in 2008 with the ThinkCentre M58/58p ECO USFF desktop PC, Lenovo has implemented the use of 100 percent recycled and recyclable packaging material on many products. The new packaging material, made from 100 percent recycled thermoformed cushions, enables PCs to be stacked together and requires less packaging material. This new material also helps minimize shipping costs. In FY 2016/17, Lenovo expanded the use of 100 percent post-consumer content foam packaging to more products, including the new Yoga, Miix, Tiny desktop and small form factor (SFF) desktop. In addition, on many Lenovo notebook product lines, Lenovo has implemented the use of 100 percent post-consumer molded fiber (paper pulp) packaging, which can typically be readily recycled in municipal waste streams. Lenovo discourages the use of polystyrene packaging wherever possible and encourages the use of molded pulp, fiber and LDPE. For more information about the process for making and recycling LDPE thermoformed cushions, go to www.lenovo.com/packaging and follow the link from there. 112 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Lenovo continues to drive increases in the use of recycled content materials in product packaging. For example, all Think product primary carton boxes are certified to contain a minimum of 50 percent post-consumer fiber content and are required to use the maximum available postconsumer material where adequate supplies exist without compromising required packaging performance characteristics. The use of recycled content in Lenovo corrugated box packaging averages more than 70 percent. Lenovo has also transitioned 95 percent of ThinkPad products to recycled cushioning materials with the ThinkPad Edge using 100 percent recycled cushioning materials. Printing on boxes is done via In 2016 Lenovo began replacing EPS packaging flexography with water-based, nontoxic, RoHSfor ThinkVision monitors with recycled molded compliant inks. fiber (paper pulp). Lenovo has a strong focus on reducing the size of our packaging to minimize the amount of materials used while maintaining adequate protection for our products. Smaller packages also contribute to increased pallet density, enabling Lenovo to increase pallet density by over 33 percent in many cases. Lenovo uses reusable bulk packaging in our own internal operations for the transportation of chassis to manufacturing locations. In addition, bulk packaging and reusable bulk packaging may be available for many of Lenovo’s products for customers in many regions. Since 2008, Lenovo has eliminated 2,500 tons of packaging consumption by weight. In FY 2016/17 alone, the Packaging Team reduced packaging consumption by 500 tons. Reuse Lenovo provides the end customer an optional returnable packaging service, where the packaging materials can be sent back to Lenovo after receiving the products and reused for new shipments by Lenovo. Lenovo is also devoted to the reuse of incoming component packaging, especially in the return of chassis packaging. Reducing Paper Lenovo has eliminated the use of multipage user manuals shipped with many of our products. For example, with our line of PC options and accessories, Lenovo was able to condense 50-page user manuals into one-page posters. This single action allowed Lenovo to save approximately 350 million printed pages per year. To see how Lenovo performed against its FY 2016/17 packaging targets, please go to page 27. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 113 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Packaging Specifications Lenovo communicates environmental requirements for packaging to suppliers via a series of packaging specifications. These specifications include requirements for minimum amounts of recycled content, marking for proper recycling, banned materials and other elements. All corrugated container (box) packaging should use a minimum of 50 percent post-consumer recycled fiber, and all paperboard packaging should contain a minimum of 45 percent post-consumer recycled fiber and 100 percent recovered fiber. In addition to meeting these specifications, many Lenovo packaging suppliers provide FSC-certified products for Lenovo packaging. Lenovo is currently in the process of assessing the global availability of FSC-certified packaging to support manufacturing facilities in all geographies. 8.4 PRODUCT END-OF-LIFE MANAGEMENT (PELM) At Lenovo, PELM includes the reuse, refurbishing, de-manufacturing, dismantling, reclamation, shredding, recycling, treatment and disposal of products, parts and peripherals when they are taken out of service, reach end-of-life and/or are scrapped. This includes the recovery and reuse of products, parts subassemblies and components, including scrap electronic and electrical components such as disk drives, printed wiring boards, power supplies, and cables and cords. Lenovo-branded and nonbranded products owned or accepted by Lenovo (including customer returns or take back) are included in this definition. As a part of our efforts to improve Lenovo’s supplier base around the globe, we have made available our “Lenovo Electronics End-of-Life Standard.” This document details what is required to become a Lenovo end-of-life partner. We continue to require and encourage our global supplier base to become R2 or eStewards certified. KEY ELEMENTS OF PELM Lenovo supports efforts to reduce the volume of end-of-life electronic products being disposed of in landfills, as well as efforts to reduce the need for new raw materials by increasing the beneficial reuse of products and parts or recycling of materials. • We support legislation assigning financial responsibility for end-of-life management to the individual producers. • We advocate legislative initiatives that allow at least the option for manufacturers to recover their own brand products, using the information gained from recycling their own brands to be fed back into the product design process. This practice optimizes the cost not only for the manufacturer but the consumer as well. • We encourage our customers to reuse or recycle products at the end of their life cycle by offering consumers and/or commercial clients a range of recycling options for disposing of products, batteries and product packaging worldwide through voluntary programs and/or country, province or state mandated programs. If you are interested in learning more about these programs, please visit: www.lenovo.com/recycling. 114 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS PRODUCT TAKE-BACK PROGRAMS As a global company, Lenovo offers end-of-life recycling and management programs for both consumer and business customers in many countries around the world.

MANAGEMENT OF LENOVO’S PELM SUPPLIERS Lenovo maintains an extensive program for ensuring that remarketed products and parts and the refurbishing, remanufacturing, recycling and disposal of end-of-life products owned by Lenovo or returned by customers are accomplished in an environmentally conscious and legally compliant manner. This program includes Lenovo on-site environmental evaluations and approvals in accordance with Lenovo’s stringent auditing protocol. Some of the critical evaluation requirements include: • Supplier completion of Lenovo’s initial supplier evaluation form declaring their processing capabilities and controls, environmental, health and safety management systems, and legal compliance. • Supplier full downstream disclosure of facilities involved with receiving equipment or waste; reusing equipment as a product, part or material; and disposing of waste and ensuring all facilities maintain compliance. • Successful Lenovo on-site environmental and services audit of all facilities and processes prior to their use, and documentation of audit findings and recommendations in a final report. • Review of all audit documentation and recommendations by Lenovo’s Product End-of-Life Management Program Manager, and final approval by Lenovo’s Director of Global Environmental Affairs. • Maintain Lenovo Corporate Approved Supplier Facility listing by geography and approved services for use by all Lenovo organizations, sites and programs worldwide in Lenovo’s internal database. • Establishment of a Lenovo contract with each approved supplier with specific environmental terms and conditions related to expected environmental performance and reporting. 2016/17 Lenovo Sustainability Report 115 EXECUTIVE INTEGRATING CONSOLIDATED PRACTICING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX LETTERS SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPLY TARGETS AND BUSINESS CHAIN OBJECTIVES OPERATIONS Suppliers include surplus buyers, end-of-lease, asset recovery services, legal and voluntary product take-back providers, field services, dismantlers, recyclers and disposal vendors. All recovered products and parts are required to be data wiped, refurbished, tested for function, labeled as refurbished and resold where they will be used as originally intended without further refurbishing before use. Suppliers are required to use Lenovo-approved recyclers for the disposition of nonworking products and parts and waste generated from their refurbishing processes. Lenovo prohibits the shipment of hazardous waste to non-OECD countries. Additionally, Lenovo incorporates specific environmental terms and conditions into contracts and agreements with all PELM suppliers. Approved and contracted facilities are required to submit regular environmental reports documenting the total quantities of equipment and e-waste collected and processed on behalf of Lenovo and Lenovo customers, including the identification of methods of disposition and their percentages. Periodic follow-up audits are also completed to ensure continued compliance to legal and Lenovo environmental requirements. RECOVERY AND RECYCLING TRENDS During the 2016 calendar year, Lenovo financed or managed the processing of 29,075 metric tons, equivalent to more than 64 million pounds, of Lenovo-owned and customer-returned computer equipment. Of this total, 2.4 percent was reused as products or parts, 91.4 percent was recycled as materials, 3.1 percent was incinerated with waste-to-energy recovery, 0.8 percent was incinerated as disposal treatment, and 2.3 percent was disposed of by landfill. As part of Lenovo’s continual improvement activities, we look for opportunities to reduce the use of incineration and landfills and maximize reuse and recycling. Since its launch as a global company in May 2005, Lenovo has processed more than 182,900 metric tons, or more than 400 million pounds, of computer equipment through our contracted service providers.
