Development of Yttrium-based High-temperature Superconductive (HTS) Wire for Medical MRIs and Other Applications Fujikura has worked to develop mass production technology for long lengths of high-temperature superconducting wire for many years, and the company’s efforts have been highly appreciated in Japan and overseas. Yttrium-based high-temperature superconducting wire is promising for medical MRIs and other applications due the fact that it shows high performance in high magnetic fields without liquid helium. In fiscal year 2016, Fujikura was commissioned Advanced Communication Energy & Industry Life-Assistance Vehicle and subsidized the “Technology development to promote commercialization of HTS program” by the NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization). We are working to develop technology that improves performance 2030 Vision and increases productivity of Yttrium-based HTS wire. Active Optical Cable (AOC) Contributes to Manufacturing Industry Innovation Fujikura sells the active optical cable (AOC) that connects industrial cameras used in machine vision. We are making progress on achieving higher definition and increasing the data capacity of industrial cameras used for inspecting products, image monitoring, etc. on manufacturing lines. We are also making progress on increasing the speed of transmission along with these advances. The Fujikura optical camera link cables Creation enable high-speed connection over long cable lengths Penetration & due to optical communications technology.
