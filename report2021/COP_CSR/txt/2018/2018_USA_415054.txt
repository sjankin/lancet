Due to continued training and employee awareness in 2017 we have not had any reportable OSHA incidents in the workplace. Criterion has also successfully maintained ISO 9001:2008 certification. As of February 6th, we completed the ISO 9001:2015 transition and certification audit, we are proud of our ability to maintain and grow as an organization. *Environmental Principles Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Assessment, Policy and Goals Criterion Technology is committed to the health and safety of our environment and community. Proper disposal and storage of chemicals is taught and enforced. Criterion continues to enforce its recycling program and has identified new materials to recycle. Implementation Our policies, work instructions, product specifications, insurance booklets and job descriptions are maintained electronically through the company intranet and we encourage employees to print on both sides of paper sheets. We have a closed loop water system for our injection molding process allowing us to reuse water. We recycle paper, plastic, aluminum and other metals, corrugated cardboard and scrap materials. Recycling bins are placed throughout our facility and employees are encouraged to use them for all recyclable materials. Our heating and air system is programed so that it does not run excessively when the building is unoccupied. Chemicals are disposed of and stored according to state and federal regulations. Our skylights reduce the need to use lights throughout the production areas. Measurement of Outcomes All recycled materials are tracked throughout the year. This has allowed us to monitor progress and set goals for improving our programs. The graphs below compare our past 3 years of recycled materials. At the beginning of 2015 we have partnered with another manufacturing company that is using our scrap acrylic as purge, they are currently picking up several gaylords of Acrylic per year. Our increased ABS quantity was due to an increase of products produced with ABS. During 2015 we have been using Nylon as purge material and find that using the scrap material has lowered our need for the virgin material and reduced waste. In 2016 we have found that we are able to regrind the nylon scrap and use it as purge material. During the third quarter of 2017 we have been testing a color additive to use with our Acrylic and Nylon material, this colorant will enable us to reduce our inventory of resin. This makes switching between tinted product and clear more efficient and reduce scrap. In 2014/2015 we were successful at decreasing our paper consumption even though we are still printing instruction manuals in house. We were also able to increase the amounts of paper, co-mingle and corrugated cardboard recycled through an increased effort of employee awareness. In 2015 we implemented Electronic travelers and Daily shift reports to again reduce our paper consumption. The daily shift reporting project was completed in January 2015. Our project on electronic travelers was completed in July 2015. In 2016 we have been using the Electronic Shift Reports and Travelers for the past year, we have cut our usage in half. In 2017 we have had more Special Order Job Travelers that are used to prove out new products, this has increased our paper consumption, our goal for 2018 is to attempt to move these SOJTâ€™s to a paperless format. Criterion Technology has not had any reportable environmental incidents within the last year and has not been subject to any statutory notices or prosecutions. *Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Assessment, Policy and Goals Criterion Technology does not participate in any corruption, bribery or extortion and does not do business with organizations that are known to be corrupt. Criterion has a policy against accepting gifts of any kind from vendors or customers. Implementation Criterion Technology enforces our no gift policy. If gifts are received from vendors or customers, they are placed in a secure location and are distributed evenly to all employees during our annual Christmas celebration. Any food items received are shared amongst all employees. Measurement of Outcomes Criterion Technology has not been involved in any legal cases, rulings or other events related to corruption or bribery.
