Group CEO perspective PROGRESS IN A YEAR OF UNPRECEDENTED GLOBAL CHANGE 2016 was an exceptional year. The ascent of populism, waning of the forces of globalisation, continued sub-par global growth, monetary policy exhaustion and the digital revolution presented many challenges for businesses to navigate. These challenges underscored the need for businesses to stay the course with a clear and focused strategy, while at the same time acting on their capacity to rapidly adapt and remain relevant in times of such unprecedented and unexpected change. I believe Olam achieved this difficult and delicate balance in 2016. We responded to these challenges by sharpening our focus and strengthening our efforts to accelerate the delivery of value to our shareholders. We made speciﬁc investment choices and capital allocation decisions in 2016 that will shape our future and ensure our continuing success. To this end, we continued expansion of our operational footprint – further growing our upstream plantation investments in almonds, coffee, palm and rubber and making new plantation investments in adjacent businesses such as pistachios, walnuts and black pepper. p16 ECONOMIC CONTENTS: 18 Group COO’s review 24 Edible Nuts, Spices and Vegetable Ingredients 26 Confectionery and Beverage Ingredients 28 Food Staples and Packaged Foods 30 Industrial Raw Materials, Ag Logistics and Infrastructure 31 Commodity Financial Services 32 Value chain review and analysis 36 Principal risks and uncertainties p38 SOCIAL We rely on our people to grow our business responsibly.

At a global scale, our operations and those of our suppliers are at risk of climate change, poor soil quality, and water scarcity, which in turn impact on global food security.

This pre-competitive, voluntary, CEO-led private sector initiative demonstrates a growing commitment to establish collaboration and partnerships to help solve the seemingly intractable problems facing our sector including food and nutrition insecurity, water scarcity, impact of climate change and growing inclusively within planetary boundaries. While the enormity of these challenges cannot be underestimated, this industry-wide effort to solve them will hopefully result in making a signiﬁcant impact in tackling these major developmental challenges. It will also offer considerable new opportunities to companies, not just in terms of enhancing customer stickiness as they look to us to help solve their supply chain issues and protect their reputations, but also unlock new streams of income.

The exceptional losses in 2015 had come largely from fair value losses on our equity investment in PureCircle, which was due to a conservative interpretation of an accounting treatment, with no change to total equity (including reserves) or cash ﬂow. The remaining portion of the exceptional losses was a result of deliberate actions to optimise operations for future growth, including the buy-back of higher cost debt and restructuring cost for the Dairy operations in Uruguay. The buy-back of higher cost debt, which was part of our debt optimisation efforts that continued into 2016, resulted in a net exceptional loss of S$12.5 million for this year. Stripping out these exceptional items, operational PATMI showed a strong 23.1% year-on-year growth to S$363.8 million, compared with S$295.6 million in 2015. A.

These were funded by S$5.8 billion of equity, S$6.0 billion of short-term debt and S$7.7 billion of long-term debt. Compared with 2015, our overall balance sheet grew by S$1.7 billion due to the acquisition of the wheat milling and peanut shelling assets and working capital increase, as well as other capital expenditure (Capex) investments. Working capital rose by S$222.1 million compared with 2015 with the increase in volumes after the acquisition of these businesses, as well as with higher prices of commodities, including dairy, sugar, cotton, cocoa and coffee.

We increased the overall tonnage covered under the Olam Supplier Code (OSC). The Code covers social, as well as environmental requirements, and we’re updating it in 2017 to reﬂect the evolution of our global policies. More information can be found on sustainability progress in our Managing the impact of our third-party supply chains is a GRI Report and Olam Livelihood Charter on olamgroup.com. 3-step process: ﬁrstly, we need to complete the roll-out of our Supplier Code; then we need to verify that suppliers are upholding the Code; and ﬁnally, we must work with suppliers to address any issues that we identify in this process. This can be straightforward when we have direct engagement with the supplier but it is much more challenging when we are procuring through a third-party, as we don’t have the direct link to producers. With a supplier base of more than 4 million smallholder farmers, verifying that each one is upholding the Code is impossible. Our big challenge this year is how to combine risk assessment, partnerships and pre-competitive veriﬁcation platforms to ensure compliance with the Code, building on the extraordinary development of remote sensing technology and traceability systems. olamgroup.com 67 Environment Our material areas LAND The land required to supply the 14.4 million metric tonnes of product in 2016 is estimated at just under 10 million hectares.
