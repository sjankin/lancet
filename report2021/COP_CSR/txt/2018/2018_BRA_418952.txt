In the context of economic or financial crises, the Brazilian government may also decide to implement changes to the legal framework applicable to the operation of Brazilian financial institutions. For example, in response to the global financial crisis which began in late 2007, Brazilian national and intergovernmental regulatory entities, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, proposed regulatory reforms aiming to prevent the recurrence of similar crises, which included a new requirement to increase the minimum regulatory capital (Basel III).

The Basel III framework requires banks to maintain minimum capital levels corresponding to the following percentages of risk-weighted assets: (i) a minimum common equity capital ratio of 4.5% composed of common shares; (ii) a minimum Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.0%; and (iii) a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0%. In addition to the minimum capital requirements, Basel III requires a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% and each national regulator is given discretion to institute a “countercyclical buffer” if it perceives a greater system-wide risk to the banking system as the result of a build-up of excess credit growth in its jurisdiction. Basel III also introduces a new leverage ratio, defined as Tier 1 Capital divided by the bank’s total exposure.

A-126 Annual Report 2017 Treatment of past due debts Brazilian financial institutions are required to classify their credit transactions (including leasing transactions and other transactions characterized as credit advances) at different levels and recognize provisions according to the level attributed to each such transaction. The classification is based on the financial condition of the clients the terms and conditions of the transaction, and the period of time during which the transaction is past due, if any. For purposes of Central Bank requirements, transactions are classified as level AA, A, B, C, D, E, F, G or H, with AA being the highest classification. Credit classifications must be reviewed on a monthly basis and, apart from additional provisions required by the Central Bank which are deemed necessary by the management of financial institutions, each level has a specific allowance percentage that is applied to it and which we use to calculate our allowance for loan losses, as specified in more detail in the table below: Classification(1) AA A B C D E F G H Allowance (%) 0 0.5 1 3 10 30 50 70 100 Past due (in days) 15 to 30 31 to 60 61 to 90 91 to 120 121 to 150 151 to 180 Over 180 (1) Our credit classification also takes into account the client´s credit profile, which may negatively impact the past due classification.

Its main effect is that the obligations to third parties are settled. whole management loses its offices and is replaced by a steering committee appointed by the Central Bank with broad management powers. Its duration is limited and its main objective is the adoption of measures aimed at the resumption of the financial institution’s regular activities. If resumption is not possible, this regime may be turned into an extrajudicial liquidation.

The company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposals of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to allow for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those controls determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or a decline in the level of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its evaluation and those criteria, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017. In connection with the evaluation required by the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d), our management, concluded that the changes that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 have not materially affected, or are not reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Executive Board on February 05, 2018. Performance F-197 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Note 2 – Significant accounting policies 2.1. Basis of preparation The Consolidated Financial Statements of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING were prepared taking into account the requirements and guidelines set out by the National Monetary Council (CMN), which established that as from December 31, 2010 annual Consolidated Financial Statements are to be prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING adopted the criteria for recognition, measurement and disclosure established in the IFRS and in the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC). The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents during the period, arising from operating, investing, and financing activities, and include highly-liquid investments (Note 2.4c). The Cash flows of operating activities are calculated by the indirect method. Consolidated net income is adjusted for non-monetary items, such as measurement gains and losses, changes in provisions and in receivables and liabilities balances. All income and expense arising from non-monetary transactions, attributable to investing and financing activities, are eliminated. Interest received or paid are classified as operating cash flows. Management believes that the information included in these Consolidated Financial Statements is relevant and a faithful representation of the information used in the management of the ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING. 2.2. New accounting standards and new accounting standards changes and interpretations a) Accounting standards applicable for period ended December 31, 2017 There were no new accounting pronouncements for the period ended December 31, 2017. b) Accounting standards recently issued and applicable in future periods The following pronouncements will become applicable for periods after the date of these consolidated financial statements and were not early adopted: • IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – The pronouncement replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 is applicable to all financial assets and liabilities and will be retrospectively adopted on the date the standard becomes effective, on January 1 st, 2018. The new rule is structured to contemplate the pillars: (I) Classification and measurement of financial assets: the classification of financial assets should depend on two criteria: the entity´s business model for managing its financial assets and the characteristics of the contractual cash flow of financial assets; • Business model: it is determined at a level that reflects how the groups of financial assets are jointly managed to achieve a specific commercial purpose and generate cash flows, not depending of the management’s intention regarding an individual instrument. Accordingly, it represents whether cash flows will result from contractual cash flows, sale of financial assets or both; and • Characteristics of contractual cash flow of financial assets: identification of asset cash flows what constitute only payment of principal and interest, by applying the SPPI (Solely Payment Principal and Interest) test. (ll) Impairment: The new standard brings the concept of expected loss (including the use of prospective information) and classification in three phases. An asset will migrate from the phase of expected credit loss as the credit risk deteriorates. If, in a subsequent period, the quality of a financial asset improves or the significant increase in the previously identified credit risk is reverse, the financial asset may return to phase 1, unless it is a financial asset originated with credit recovery issues. Performance F-198 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 • Phase 1 – Credit losses expected for 12 months: represented possible default events within 12 months. Applicable to financial assets without significant increase in credit risk and no credit recovery issues in origination; • Phase 2 – Permanent credit losses expected over the life of the financial instrument: resulting from all possible default events. Applicable to financial assets with a significant increase in credit risk, but which were not originated with recovery issues. • Phase 3 – Permanent credit losses expected for assets with credit recovery problems: resulting from all possible default events. Applicable to financial assets considered with credit recovery issues due to the occurrence of one or more events that negatively affect the estimated future cash flows for this asset. Financial assets what are not originated with recovery issues, but that subsequently had recovery issues, differ from phase 2 due to the recognition of interest income by applying the effective interest rate at amortized cost (net of provision) rather than the gross carrying amount. (lll) Hedge accounting: The hedge accounting requirements are closed aligned with risk management and should be applied on a prospective basis. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING will continue applying all requirements for hedge accounting set forth in IAS 39, as permitted by IFRS 9. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING conducted simulations during the second half of 2017 for better understanding of the potential effect of the new accounting standard. The transition to IFRS 9 will cause, according to the best estimates, a reduction not higher than 3.00% in stockholder’s equity, net of tax effects. The transition impacts are based on the best estimates on the reporting date and adjustments identified will be recognized in retained earnings on the transition date, directly affecting the stockholders’ equity. The adoption of the new standard shall not bring regulatory or prudential impacts – including capital – on ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, since these limits are calculated based on Prudential Consolidated, which is prepared according to the standards and generally accepted accounting principles in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by BACEN. • IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The pronouncement replaces IAS 18 – Revenue and IAS 11– Construction Contracts, as well as respective interpretations (IFRICs 13, 15 and 18). It requires that the recognition of revenue reflect the transfer of goods or services to the client. This standard is effective for the years beginning January 1st, 2018 and there are no impacts for the Consolidated Financial Statements of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING. • IFRS 16 – Leases – The pronouncement replaces IAS 17 Leases, and related interpretations (IFRIC 4, SIC 15 and SIC 27). It eliminates the accounting for operating lease agreements for the lessee, presenting only one lease model, that consists of: (a) recognizing leases which terms exceeds 12 months and with substantial amounts; (b) initially recognizing lease in assets and liabilities at present value; and (c) recognizing depreciation and interest from lease separately in the result. For the lessor, accounting will continue to be segregated between operating and financial lease. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on January 1 st, 2019. Possible impacts arising from the adoption of this standard are being assessed and will be completed by the date this standard is effective. • IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts: The pronouncement replaces IFRS 4 – Insurance Contracts and presents three approaches for assessment of insurance contracts: • General Model: applicable to all contracts, particularly the long-term contracts; • Premium Allocation Approach (PAA): applicable to contracts which term is up to 12 months and with modestly complex cash flows. It is simpler than the standard model; however, it can be used only when it produces results similar to those that would be obtained it the standard model was used; • Variable Fee Approach: approach specific for contracts with participation in the result of investments. Insurance contracts should be recognized based on the analysis of four components: Performance F-199 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 • Expected Future Cash Flows: estimate of all components of cash flow of the contract, considering inflows and outflows; • Risk Adjustment: estimate of offset required by deviations that may occur between cash flows; • Contractual Margin: difference between any amounts received before the beginning of the contract coverage and present value of cash flows estimated in the beginning of the contract; • Discount: projected cash flows should be discounted at present value, to reflect the time value of money, at rates that reflect the characteristics of respective flows. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on January 1st, 2021. Possible impacts arising from the adoption of this standard are being assessed and will be completed by the date this standard is effective. • Amendment to IFRS 4 – Insurance Contracts – Joint application of IFRS 9: The amendment enables entities that are issuers of insurance contracts to mitigate possible impacts of the adoption of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments before the effectiveness of IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts, through two options: • Temporary exemption: adoption of IFRS 9 together with IFRS 17, i.e., as from January 2021. This option is applicable only to entities with significant insurance activities (over 80% of total liabilities) and that have not applied IFRS 9 in advance; • Overlay approach: adoption of IFRS 9, however, for assets reclassified to the category Fair Value through Profit or Loss, transferring the effects of the adoption of IFRS 9 from Income for the Period to Other Comprehensive Income until the effectiveness of IFRS 17. Liabilities related to insurance contracts are not representative as compared to total liabilities of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING. In 2018, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING will adopt IFRS 9 for all financial assets of insurance entities, and, therefore, will not use the aforementioned options. • Amendment to IFRS 10 – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures – The amendments refer to an inconsistency between IFRS 10 and IAS 28 requirements, when addressing the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The effective date has not been defined by IASB yet. No material impacts arising from this change on the consolidated financial statements of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING were identified. 2.3. Critical accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, gains, and losses over the reporting and subsequent periods, because actual results may differ from those determined in accordance with such estimates and assumptions. 2.3.1 Critical accounting estimates All estimates and assumptions made by Management are in accordance with IFRS and represent the current best estimates made in compliance with the applicable standards. Estimates are evaluated continuously, considering past experience and other factors. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect a variety of estimates and assumptions. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions that have the most significant impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are described below: Performance F-200 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 a) Allowance for loan and lease losses ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING periodically reviews its portfolio of loans and receivables to evaluate the existence of impairment. In order to determine the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income with respect to receivables or group of receivables, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING exercises its judgment to determine whether objective evidence indicates that an event of loss has occurred. This evidence may include observable data that indicates that an adverse change has occurred in the cash flows received in relation to those expected from the counterparty or the existence of a change in local or international economic conditions that correlates with impairment. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are regularly reviewed by Management, considering the adequacy of models and sufficiency of provision volumes in view of the experience of incurred loss. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses statistical models to calculate the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses in the homogeneous loan portfolio. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING periodically carries out procedures to improve these estimates by aligning the required provisions to the levels of losses observed by the historical behavior (as described in Note 2.4d X). This alignment aims at ensuring that the volume of allowances reflects the current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolios, the quality of guarantees obtained and the profile of our clients. Methodology and assumptions used by Management are detailed in Note 2.4d X. Allowance for loan losses is detailed in Note 12b. b) Deferred income tax and social contribution As explained in Note 2.4k, deferred tax assets are recognized only in relation to temporary differences and tax assets and loss for offset to the extent it is probable that ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING will generate future taxable profit for its use. The expected realization of deferred tax assets is based on the projection of future taxable profits and technical studies, as disclosed in Note 27. c) Fair value of financial instruments, including derivatives The fair value of Financial Instruments is measured recurrently, in conformity with the requirements of IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The fair value of financial instruments, including derivatives that are not traded in active markets, is determined by using valuation techniques. This calculation is based on assumptions that take into consideration Management’s judgment based on market information and conditions in place at the balance sheet date. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING ranks fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in the measurement process. The fair value of Financial Instruments, including Derivatives, as well as the fair value hierarchy, are presented in Note 31. The team in charge of the pricing of assets, in accordance with the governance defined by the committee and regulatory circulars, carries out critical analyses of the information extracted from the market and from time to time reassesses the long term of indexes. At the end of the monthly closings, the departments meet for a new round of analyses for the maintenance of the classification in connection with the fair value hierarchy. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING believes that all methodologies adopted are appropriate and consistent with market participants, however, the adoption of other methodologies or use of different assumptions to estimate fair values may result in different fair value estimates. The methodologies used to estimate the fair value of certain financial instruments are described in Note 31. Performance F-201 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 d) Defined benefit pension plan The current amount of pension plan obligations is obtained from actuarial calculations that use a set of assumptions. Among the assumptions used for estimating the net cost (income) of these plans is the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will affect the carrying amount of pension plan liabilities. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year, which is used for determining the present value of estimated future cash outflows necessary for settling the pension plan liabilities. In order to determine the appropriate discount rate, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING considers the interest rates of the Brazilian federal government bonds that are denominated in Brazilian Reais, the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have maturity terms approximating the terms of the related liabilities. The main assumptions on Pension plan obligations are based on, in part, current market conditions. Additional information is disclosed in Note 29. e) Provisions, contingencies and other commitments ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING periodically reviews its contingencies. These contingencies are evaluated based on Management´s best estimates, taking into account the opinion of legal counsel when there is a likelihood that financial resources will be required to settle the obligations and the amounts may be reasonably estimated. Contingencies classified as probable losses are recognized in the Balance Sheet under Provisions. Contingent amounts are measured using appropriate models and criteria, despite the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate timing and amounts. Provisions, contingencies and other commitments are detailed in Note 32. f) Technical provisions for insurance and pension plan Technical provisions are liabilities arising from obligations of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING to its policyholders and participants. These obligations may be short term liabilities (property and casualty insurance) or medium and long term liabilities (life insurance and pension plans). The determination of the actuarial liability is subject to several uncertainties inherent in the coverage of insurance and pension contracts, such as assumptions of persistence, mortality, disability, life expectancy, morbidity, expenses, frequency and severity of claims, conversion of benefits into annuities, redemptions and return on assets. The estimates for these assumptions are based on the historical experience of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, benchmarks and experience of the actuary, in order to comply with best market practices and the continuous review of the actuarial liability. The adjustments resulting from these continuous improvements, when necessary, are recognized in the statement of income for the corresponding period. Additional information is described in Note 30. 2.3.2 Critical judgments in accounting policies a) Goodwill The impairment test for goodwill involves estimates and significant judgments, including the identification of cash generation units and the allocation of goodwill to such units based on the expectations of which ones will benefit from the acquisition. Determining the expected cash flows and a risk-adjusted interest rate for each unit requires that management exercises judgment and estimates. Semi-annually goodwill is submitted to the impairment test and, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING did not identify goodwill impairment losses. Performance F-202 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 2.4. Summary of main accounting practices a) Consolidation I. Subsidiaries In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, subsidiaries are all entities in which ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING holds control. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING controls an entity when it is exposed to, or is entitled to, its variable returns derived from its involvement with such entity, and has the capacity to impact such returns. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated as from the date in which ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING obtains control and are no longer consolidated as from the date such control is lost.

Performance F-204 Context Our profile Our governance Our risk management Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 II. Business combinations Accounting for business combinations under IFRS 3 is only applicable when a business is acquired. Under IFRS 3 – Business Combinations, a business is defined as an integrated set of activities and assets that is conducted and managed so to provide a return to investors, cost reduction or other economic benefits, and it should be recorded when a business is acquired. In general, a business consists of an integrated set of activities and assets that may be conducted and managed so as to provide a direct return, as dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits, to investors or other stockholders, members or participants. There is goodwill in a set of activities and transferred assets, it is presumed to be a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of business, accounting under the purchase method is required. The acquisition cost is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the exchange date, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Acquired assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities identifiable in a business combination are initially measured at fair value at the date of acquisition, regardless of the existence of non-controlling interests. The excess of the acquisition cost, plus non-controlling interests, if any, over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, is accounted for as goodwill. The treatment of goodwill is described in Note 2.4h. If the cost of acquisition, plus non-controlling interests, if any, is lower than the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, the difference is directly recognized in income. For each business combination, the purchaser should measure any non-controlling interest in the acquired company at the fair value or amount proportional to its interest in net assets of the acquired company. III. Transactions with non-controlling stockholders IFRS 10 – Consolidated Financial Statements establishes that, changes in an ownership interest in a subsidiary, which do not result in a loss of control, are accounted for as capital transactions and any difference between the amount paid and the carrying amount of non-controlling stockholders is recognized directly in consolidated stockholders' equity. b) Foreign currency translation I. Functional and presentation currency The Consolidated Financial Statements of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING are presented in Brazilian Reais, which is its functional and presentation currency. For each subsidiary and investment in associates and joint ventures, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING defined the functional currency, as set forth in IAS 21 – The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the Brazilian Real are translated as follows: • Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date; • Income and expenses are translated at monthly average exchange rates; • Exchange differences arising from currency translation are recorded in other comprehensive income. II. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as part of foreign exchange results and exchange variations on transactions. Performance F-205 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 c) Cash and cash equivalents ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING defines cash and cash equivalents as cash and current accounts in banks (included in the heading cash and deposits on demand on the Consolidated Balance Sheet), interbank deposits and securities purchased under agreements to resell that have original maturities of up to 90 days or less, as shown in Note 4. d) Financial Assets and Liabilities In accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement, Financial Assets and Liabilities, including derivative financial instruments, should be recognized in the Balance Sheet, and measured in accordance with the category in which the instrument was classified. Financial assets and liabilities may be classified as follows: Categories Recognition and Measurement • Financial assets and liabilities • Initial and subsequently recognized at fair value; at fair value through profit or • Transaction costs are directly recognized in the Consolidated loss – held for trading Statement of Income; • Financial assets and liabilities • Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are at fair value through profit or directly included in Net gain (loss) from investments in loss – designated at fair value securities and derivatives. • Initial and subsequently recognized at fair value plus transaction costs; • Available-for-sale financial • Unrealized gains and losses (except losses for impairment, assets (*) foreign exchange differences, dividends and interest income) are recognized, net of applicable taxes, in Other comprehensive income. • Held-to-maturity financial assets (*) • Initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs; • Loans and receivables • Subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective • Financial liabilities at interest rate method. amortized cost (*) Interest, including the amortization of premiums and discounts, is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of income under Interest and similar income. The classification of financial assets and liabilities depends on the purpose for which financial assets were acquired or financial liabilities were assumed. Management determines the classification of financial instruments at initial recognition. Effective interest rate – when calculating the effective interest rate, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING estimates cash flows including all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but does not include future credit losses. The calculation includes all commissions paid or received between parties to the contract, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. Interest and similar income and expense are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, in Interest and similar income and Interest and similar expense, respectively. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING classifies as loans and receivables and financial liabilities at amortized cost the following Balance Sheet headings: Loans and receivables Financial liabilities at amortized cost • Central Banks compulsory deposits (Note • Deposits (Note 17); 2.4dl and Note 5); • Securities sold under repurchase agreements • Interbank deposits (Note 6); (Note 2.4dll and Note 19a); • Securities purchased under agreements to • Funds from interbank markets (Note 19a); resell (Note 2.4dll and Note 6); • Funds from institutional markets (Note 19b); • Loan operations (Note 2.4dVIII and Note 12); • Liabilities for capitalization plans; and and • Other financial liabilities (Note 20b). • Other financial assets (Note 20a). Performance F-206 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized, respectively, on the trade date. Financial assets are derecognized when rights to receive cash flows expire or when ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership, and such transfer qualifies for write-off in accordance with IAS 39 requirements. Otherwise, control should be assessed to determine whether the continuous involvement related to any retained control does not prevent write-off. Financial liabilities are derecognized when settled or extinguished. Financial assets and liabilities are offset against each other and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet solely when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and intention to settle them on a net basis, or simultaneously realize the asset and settle the liability. I – Central Bank Compulsory deposits The Central Banks of the countries in which ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING operates currently impose a number of compulsory deposit requirements on financial institutions. Such requirements are applied to a wide range of banking activities and operations, such as demand, savings, and time deposits. II – Securities purchased under agreements to resell ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has purchased securities with resale agreement (resale agreements), and sold securities with repurchase agreement (repurchase agreement) of financial assets. Resale and repurchase agreements are accounted for under Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities sold under repurchase agreements, respectively. The difference between the sale and repurchase prices is treated as interest and recognized over the life of the agreements using the effective interest rate method. The financial assets accepted as collateral in our resale agreements can be used by us, if provided for in the agreements, as collateral for our repurchase agreements or can be sold. In Brazil, control over custody of financial assets is centralized and the ownership of investments under resale and repurchase agreements is temporarily transferred to the buyer. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING strictly monitors the fair value of financial assets received as collateral under our resale agreements and adjusts the collateral amount when appropriate. Financial assets pledged as collateral to counterparties are also recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. When the counterparty has the right to sell or re-pledge such instruments, they are presented in the balance sheet under the appropriate class of financial assets. lll -Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss held for trading These are financial assets and liabilities acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling them in the short term or when they are part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent history of trading transactions. lV -Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss – designated at fair value These are assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition (fair value option). In accordance with IAS 39, the fair value option can only be applied if it reduces or eliminates accounting mismatches in income or when the financial instruments are part of a portfolio for which risk is managed and reported to Management based on its fair value or when these instruments consist of debt instruments and embedded derivatives that should otherwise be separated. Performance F-207 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 VDerivatives All derivatives are recorded as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments are treated as separate derivatives, when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not recognized at fair value through profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are accounted for separately at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income in Net gain (loss) on investment securities and derivatives. Derivatives can be designated as hedging instruments under hedge accounting and in the event they qualify, depending upon the nature of the hedged item, the method for recognizing gains or losses from changes in fair value will be different. These derivatives, which are used to hedge exposures to risk or modify the characteristics of financial assets and liabilities, and that meet IAS 39 criteria, are recognized as hedge accounting. In accordance with IAS 39, to qualify for hedge accounting, all of the following conditions are met: • At the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entity’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge; • The hedge is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the originally documented risk management strategy for that particular hedging relationship; • For a cash flow hedge, a forecast transaction that is the subject of the hedge must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss; • The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured, i.e. the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk and the fair value of the hedging instrument can be reliably measured; • The hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and it is determined that the hedge has in fact been highly effective throughout the periods for which the hedge was designated. IAS 39 presents three hedge accounting categories: fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, and hedge of net investments in a foreign operation. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses derivatives as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge strategies, fair value hedge and hedge of net investments, as detailed in Note 9. Fair value hedge For derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the following practices are adopted: a) The gain or loss arising from the new measurement of the hedge instrument at fair value should be recognized in income; and b) The gain or loss arising from the hedged item, attributable to the effective portion of the hedged risk, should adjust the book value of the hedged item and also be recognized in income. When the derivative expires or is sold or the hedge no longer meets the accounting hedge criteria or the entity revokes the designation, the entity should prospectively discontinue the accounting hedge. In addition, any adjustment in the book value of the hedged item should be amortized in income. Performance F-208 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Cash flow hedge For derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of derivative gains or losses are recognized in Other comprehensive income – Cash flow hedge, and reclassified to Income in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects income. The portion of gain or loss on derivatives that represents the ineffective portion or the hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized immediately in income. Amounts originally recorded in Other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to Income are recorded in the corresponding income or expense lines in which the related hedged item is reported. When the derivative expires or is sold or the hedge no longer meets the accounting hedge criteria or the entity revokes the designation, any cumulative gain or loss existing in Other comprehensive income is frozen and is recognized in income when the hedged item is ultimately recognized in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognized in Other Comprehensive Income is immediately transferred to the statement of income. Hedge of net investments in foreign operations The hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, including hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the net investment, is accounted for in a manner similar to a cash flow hedge: a) The portion of gain or loss on the hedge instrument determined as effective is recognized in other comprehensive income; b) The ineffective portion is recognized in income. Gains or losses on the hedging instrument related to the effective portion of the hedge which is recognized in comprehensive income are reclassified to the disposal of the investment in the foreign operation. VI Available-for-sale financial assets In accordance with IAS 39, financial assets are classified as available-for-sale when in the Management’s judgment they can be sold in response to or in anticipation of changes in market conditions, and that were not classified into the categories of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables or held to maturity. The average cost is used to determine the realized Gains and losses on Disposal of available-forsale financial assets, which are recorded in the consolidated statement of income under Net gain (loss) on Investments in Securities and Derivatives – Available-for-sale financial assets. Dividends on available-for-sale assets are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income as Dividend Income when it is probable that ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING is entitled to receive such dividends and inflow of economic benefits. VIIHeld-to-maturity financial assets In accordance with IAS 39, the financial assets classified into the held-to-maturity category are non-derivative financial assets for which ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Both impairment of held-to-maturity financial assets and reversal of this loss are recorded, when applicable, in the Consolidated statement of income. VIIILoan operations ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING classifies a loan operation as on non-accrual status if the payment of the principal or interest has been in default for 60 days or more. In this case, accrual of interest is no longer recognized. When a financial asset or group of similar financial assets is impaired and its carrying amount is reduced through an allowance for loan losses, the subsequent interest income is recognized on the reduced carrying amount using the interest rate used to discount the future cash flows for purposes of measuring the allowance for loan losses. Performance F-209 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Both the credit risk and the finance areas are responsible for defining the methodologies used to measure the allowance for loan losses and for assessing changes in the provision amounts on a recurring basis. These areas monitor the trends observed in allowance for loan losses by segment level, in addition to establishing an initial understanding of the variables that may trigger changes in the allowance for loan losses, the probability of default or the loss given default. Once the trends have been identified and an initial assessment of the variables has been made at the corporate level, the business areas are responsible for further analyzing these observed trends at a detailed level and for each portfolio, in order to understand the underlying reasons for the trends observed and for deciding whether changes are required in our credit policies. IX Lease operations (as lessor) When assets are subject to a finance lease, the present value of lease payments is recognized as a receivable in the consolidated balance sheet under Loan operations and Lease Operations. Initial direct costs when incurred by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING are included in the initial measurement of the lease receivable, reducing the amount of income to be recognized over the lease period. Such initial costs usually include commissions and legal fees. The recognition of interest income reflects a constant rate of return on the net investment of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING and is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income under Interest and similar income. XAllowance for loan and lease losses General ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING periodically assesses whether there is any objective evidence that a receivable or group of receivables is impaired. A receivable or group of receivables is impaired and there is a need for recognizing an impairment loss if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a loss event) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows that can be reliably estimated. The allowance for loan and lease losses is recognized as probable losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The determination of the level of the allowance rests upon various judgments and assumptions, including current economic conditions, loan portfolio composition, prior loan and lease loss experience and evaluation of credit risk related to individual loans. Our process for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses includes Management's judgment and the use of estimates. The adequacy of the allowance is regularly analyzed by Management. The criteria adopted by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING for determining whether there is objective evidence of impairment include the following: • Default in principal or interest payment. • Financial difficulties of the debtor and other objective evidence that results in the deterioration of the financial position of the debtor (for example, debt-to-equity ratio, percentage of net sales or other indicators obtained through processes adopted to monitor credit, particularly for retail portfolios). • Breach of loan clauses or terms. • Entering into bankruptcy. • Loss of competitive position of the debtor. The estimated period between the loss event and its identification is defined by Management for each portfolio of similar receivables. Considering the representativeness of several homogeneous groups, management chose to use a twelve month period as being the most representative. For portfolios of loans that are individually evaluated for impairment this period is at most 12 months, considering the review cycle for each loan operation. Performance F-210 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Assessment ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for receivables that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for receivables that are not individually significant. To determine the amount of the allowance for individually significant receivables with objective evidence of impairment, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING used methodologies are that consider both the quality of the client and the nature of the transaction, including its collateral, to estimate the cash flows expected from these loans. If no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed receivable, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of receivables with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Receivables that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is recognized are not included in the collective assessment. The amount of loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. For collectively assessed loans, the calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows for which there is collateral reflects the historical performance of the foreclosure and recovery of fair value, considering the cash flows that may arise from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling that collateral. For the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, receivables are grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics. The characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for such receivables by being indicative of the debtors’ ability to pay all amounts due, according to the contractual terms of the receivables being evaluated. Future cash flows in a group of receivables that are collectively evaluated for purposes of identifying the need for recognizing impairment are estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the group of receivables and historical loss experience for receivables with similar credit risk characteristics. The historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently. For individually significant receivables with no objective evidence of impairment, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING classifies these loans into certain rating categories based on several qualitative and quantitative factors applied through internally developed models. Considering the size and the different risk characteristics of each contract, the rating category determined according to internal models can be reviewed and modified by our Corporate Credit Committee, the members of which are executives and officers in corporate credit risk. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING estimates inherent losses for each rating category considering an internally developed approach for low-default portfolios, that uses our historical experience for building internal models, that are used both to estimate the PD (probability of default) and to estimate the LGD (loss given default). To determine the amount of the allowance for individually insignificant items loans are segregated into classes considering the underlying risks and characteristics of each group. The allowance for loan and lease losses is determined for each of those classes through a process that considers historical delinquency and loan loss experience over the most recent years. Measurement The methodology used to measure the allowance for loan and lease losses was developed internally by the credit risk and finance areas at the corporate level. In those areas and considering the different characteristics of the portfolios, different areas are responsible for defining the methodology to measure the allowance for each: Corporate (including loan operations with objective evidence of impairment and individually significant loan operations but with no objective evidence of impairment), Individuals, Small and Medium Businesses, and Foreign Units Latin America. Each of the four portfolio areas responsible for defining the methodology to measure the allowance for loan and lease losses is further divided into groups, including groups that develop the methodology and groups that validate the methodology. A centralized group in the credit risk area is responsible for measuring the allowance on a recurring basis following the methodologies developed and approved for each of the four areas. Performance F-211 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 The methodology is based on two components to determine the amount of the allowance: The probability of default by the client or counterparty (PD), and the potential economic loss that may occur in the event of default, being the debt that cannot be recovered (LGD) which are applied to the outstanding balance of the loan. Measurement and assessment of these risk components is part of the process for granting credit and for managing the portfolio. The estimated amounts of PD and LGD are measured based on statistical models that consider a significant number of variables which are different for each class and include, among others, income, equity, past loan experiences, level of indebtedness, economic sectors that affect collectability and other attributes of each counterparty and of the economic environment. These models are regularly updated for changes in economic and business conditions. A model updating process is started when the modeling area identifies that it is not capturing significant effects of the changes of economic conditions, in the performance of the portfolio or when a change is made in the methodology for calculating the allowance for loan and lease losses. When a change in the model is made, the model is validated through back-testing and statistical methods are used to measure its performance through detailed analysis of its documentation, by describing step-by-step how the process is carried out. The models are validated by an area independent from the one developing it, by issuing a technical report on the assumptions used (integrity, consistency, and replicability of the bases) and on the mathematical methodology used. The technical report is subsequently submitted to CTAM (Model assessment technical committee), which is the highest level of approval of model reviews. Considering the different characteristics of the loans at each of the four portfolio areas (Corporate (with no objective evidence of impairment), Individuals, Small and Medium Businesses, and Foreign Units Latin America), different areas within the corporate credit risk area are responsible for developing and approving the methodologies for loans in each of those four portfolio areas. Management believes that the fact that different areas focus on each of the four portfolios results in increased knowledge, specialization and awareness of the teams as to the factors that are more relevant for each portfolio area in measuring the loan losses. Also considering such different characteristics and other factors, different inputs and information are used to estimate the PD and LGD as further detailed below: • Corporate (with no evidence of impairment) factors considered and inputs used are mainly the history of the customer relationship with us, the results of analysis of the customer’s accounting statements and the information obtained through frequent contacts with its officers, aiming at understanding the strategy and the quality of its management. Additionally, industry and macroeconomic factors are also included in the analysis. All those factors (which are quantitative and qualitative) are used as inputs to the internal model developed to determine the corresponding rating category. This approach is also applied to the corporate credit portfolio inside and outside Brazil; • Individuals – factors considered and inputs used are mainly the history of the customer relationship with us, and information available through credit bureaus (negative information); • Small / Medium Businesses – factors considered and inputs used include, in addition to the history of the customer relationship and credit bureau information about the customer’s revenues, industry expertise, and information about its shareholders and officers, among others; • Foreign Units – Latin America – considering the relative smaller size of this portfolio and its more recent nature, the models are simpler and use the past due status and an internal rating of the customer as main factors. Reversal, write-off, and renegotiation If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease is objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the previously recognized impairment is reversed. The amount of reversal is recognized in the consolidated statement of Income under Expense for allowance for loan and lease losses. Performance F-212 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 When a loan is uncollectible, it is written-off in the balance sheet under allowance for loan and lease losses. Write-off as losses occur after 360 days of credits have matured or after 540 days for loans with maturities over 36 months. In almost all cases for loan products, renegotiated loans require at least one payment to be made under the renegotiated terms in order for it to be removed from nonperforming and nonaccrual status. Renegotiated loans return to nonperforming and nonaccrual status when they reach 60 days past due under the renegotiated terms, which typically corresponds to the borrower missing two or more payments. e) Investments in associates and joint ventures I – Associates In conformity with IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, associates are companies in which the investor has a significant influence but does not hold control. Investments in these companies are initially recognized at cost of acquisition and subsequently accounted for using the equity method. Investments in associates and joint ventures include the goodwill identified upon acquisition, net of any cumulative impairment loss. II – Joint arrangements ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING reviews the nature of its joint business to assess whether it has joint operations and joint ventures. Joint ventures are recognized by the equity method in conformity with the requirements of IFRS 11 – Joint Arrangements. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING’s share in profits or losses of its associates and joint ventures after acquisition is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income. Its share of the changes in the reserves of corresponding stockholders’ equity of its associates and joint ventures is recognized in its own reserves of stockholders’ equity. The cumulative changes after acquisition are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING share of losses of an associates and joint ventures is equal or above its interest in the associates and joint ventures, including any other receivables, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING does not recognize additional losses, unless it has incurred any obligations or made payments on behalf of the associates and joint ventures. Unrealized profits on transactions between ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the interest of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING. Unrealized losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the transferred asset. The accounting policies on associates and joint ventures are consistent with the policies adopted by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING. If the interest in the associates and joint ventures decreases, but ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING retains significant influence or joint control, only the proportional amount of the previously recognized amounts in Other comprehensive income is reclassified in Income, when appropriate. Gains and losses from dilution arising from investments in associates and joint ventures are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. f) Lease commitments (as lessee) As a lessee, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has finance and operating lease agreements. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING leases certain fixed assets, and those substantially holding the risks and benefits incidental to the ownership are classified as finance leases. Performance F-213 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Each lease installment paid is allocated part to liabilities and part to financial charges, so that a constant rate is obtained for the outstanding debt balance. Corresponding obligations, net of future financial charges, are included in Other financial liabilities. Interest expenses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income over the lease term, to produce a constant periodic interest rate on the remaining liabilities balance for each period. Expenses related to operating leases are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income, on a straight-line basis, over the period of lease. When an operating lease is terminated before the end of the lease term, any payment to be made to the lessor as a penalty is recognized as an expense in the period the termination occurs. g) Fixed assets According to IAS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment, fixed assets are recognized at cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation, and adjusted for impairment, if applicable. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method and rates based on the estimated useful lives of these assets. These rates and other information are presented in Note 15. The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each year. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING reviews its assets in order to identify whether any indications of impairment exist. If such indications are identified, fixed assets are tested for impairment. In accordance with IAS 36 – Impairment of assets, impairment losses are recognized for the difference between the carrying and recoverable amount of an asset (or group of assets), in the Consolidated statement of income. The recoverable amount of an asset is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified (cash-generating units). The assessment may be made at an individual asset level when the fair value less the cost to sell may be reliably determined. Gains and losses on disposals of fixed assets are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income under Other income or General and administrative expenses. h) Goodwill In accordance with IFRS 3 – Business combinations, goodwill may arise on an acquisition and represents the excess of the consideration transferred plus non-controlling interest over the net fair value of the net identifiable assets and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. Goodwill is not amortized, but its recoverable amount is tested for impairment semi-annually or when there is any indication of impairment, using an approach that involves the identification of cash-generating units and estimates of fair value less cost to sell and/or value in use. As defined in IAS 36 – Impairment of assets, a cash-generating unit is the lowest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination. IAS 36 determines that an impairment loss shall be recognized for a cash-generating unit if the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount. The loss shall be allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit, and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro rata basis applied to the carrying amount of each asset. The loss cannot reduce the carrying amount of an asset below the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The impairment loss of goodwill cannot be reversed. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet under the line Goodwill. Goodwill of associates and joint ventures is reported as part of investment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet under Investments in associates and joint ventures, and the impairment test is carried out in relation to the total balance of the investments (including goodwill). Performance F-214 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 i) Intangible assets Intangible assets are non-physical assets, including software and other assets, and are initially recognized at cost. Intangible assets are recognized when they arise from legal or contractual rights, their costs can be reliably measured, and in the case of intangible assets not arising from separate acquisitions or business combinations, it is probable that future economic benefits may arise from their use. The balance of intangible assets refers to acquired assets or those internally generated. Intangible assets may have finite or indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but periodically tested in order to identify any impairment. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING semi-annually assesses its intangible assets in order to identify whether any indications of impairment exist, as well as possible reversal of previous impairment losses. If such indications are found, intangible assets are tested for impairment. In accordance with IAS 36, impairment losses are recognized as the difference between the carrying and the recoverable amount of an asset (or group of assets), and recognized in the Consolidated statement of income. The recoverable amount of an asset is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified (cash-generating units). The assessment may be made at an individual asset level when the fair value less the cost to sell may be reliably determined. As set forth in IAS 38, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING elected the cost model to measure its intangible assets after its initial recognition. The breakdown of intangible assets is described in Note 16. j) Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are recognized in the balance sheet when they are actually repossessed or there is intention to sell. These assets are initially recorded at the lower of: (i) the fair value of the asset less the estimated selling expenses, or (ii) the carrying amount of the related asset held for sale. k) Income tax and social contribution There are two components of the provision for income tax and social contribution: current and deferred. Current income tax expense approximates taxes to be paid or recovered for the applicable period. Current assets and liabilities are recorded in the balance sheet under Tax assets – income tax and social contribution current and tax liabilities – income tax and Social contribution – current, respectively. Deferred income tax and social contribution represented by deferred tax assets and liabilities are obtained based on the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the financial statements at each year end. The tax benefit of tax loss carry forwards is recognized as an asset. Deferred tax assets are only recognized when it is probable that future taxable income will be available for offsetting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet under Tax assets – Income tax and social contribution – Deferred and Tax liabilities – Income tax and social contribution Deferred, respectively. Income tax and social contribution expense is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income under Income tax and social contribution, except when it refers to items directly recognized in Other comprehensive income, such as: deferred tax on fair value measurement of available-for-sale financial assets, and tax on cash flow hedges. Deferred taxes of such items are initially recognized in Other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in Income together with the recognition of the gain / loss originally deferred. Changes in tax legislation and rates are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income under Income tax and social contribution in the period in which they are enacted. Interest and fines are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income under General and administrative expenses. Income tax and social contribution are calculated at the rates shown below, considering the respective taxable bases, based on the current legislation related to each tax, which in the case of the operations in Brazil are for all the reporting periods as follows: Performance F-215 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Income tax 15.00% Additional income tax 10.00% (*) Social contribution 20.00% (*) On october 06, 2015, Law No. 13,169, a conversion of Provisional Measure No. 675, which increased the Social Contribution tax rate from 15.00% to 20.00% until december 31, 2018, for financial institutions, insurance companies and credit card management companies, was introduced. For the other companies, the tax rate remains at 9.00%. To determine the proper level of provisions for taxes to be maintained for uncertain tax positions, a two-phased approach was applied, according to which a tax benefit is recognized if it is more probable than not that a position can be sustained. The benefit amount is then measured to be the highest tax benefit which probability of realization is over 50%. l) Insurance contracts and private pension IFRS 4 – “Insurance contracts” defines insurance contracts as contracts under which the issuer accepts a significant insurance risk of the counterparty, by agreeing to compensate it if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects it. An insurance risk is significant only if the insurance event could cause an issuer to pay significant additional benefits in any scenario, except for those that do not have commercial substance. Additional benefits refer to amounts that exceed those that would be payable if no insured event occurred. At the time of the first-time adoption of IFRS, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING decided not to change its accounting policies for insurance contracts, which follow the accounting practices generally accepted in Brazil (“BRGAAP”). Although investment agreements with discretionary participation characteristics are financial instruments, they are treated as insurance contracts, as established by IFRS 4, as well as those transferring a significant financial risk. These agreements may be reclassified as insurance contracts after their initial classification should the insurance risk become significant. Once the contract is classified as an insurance contract, it remains as such until the end of its life, even if the insurance risk is significantly reduced during such period, unless all rights and obligations are extinguished or expired. Note 30 presents a detailed description of all products classified as insurance contracts. Private pension plans Contracts that contemplate retirement benefits after an accumulation period (known as PGBL, VGBL and FGB) assure, at the commencement date of the contract, the basis for calculating the retirement benefit (mortality table and minimum interest). The contracts specify the annuity fees and, therefore, the contract transfers the insurance risk to the issuer at the commencement date, and they are classified as insurance contracts. Insurance premiums Insurance premiums are recognized by issuing an insurance policy or over the period of the contracts in proportion to the amount of the insurance coverage. Insurance premiums are recognized as income in the Consolidated statement of income. If there is evidence of impairment losses with respect to receivables for insurance premiums, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING recognizes a provision, sufficient to cover this loss, based on the risk analysis of realization of insurance premiums receivable with installments overdue for over 60 days. Reinsurance Reinsurance premiums are recognized over the same period in which the related insurance premiums are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Performance F-216 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 In the ordinary course of business, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING reinsures a portion of the risks underwritten, particularly property and casualty risks that exceed the maximum limits of responsibility that we determine to be appropriate for each segment and product (after a study which considers size, experience, specificities, and the necessary capital to support these limits). These reinsurance agreements allow the recovery of a portion of the losses from the reinsurer, although they do not release the insurer from the main obligation as direct insurer of the risks contemplated in the reinsurance. Acquisition costs Acquisition costs include direct and indirect costs related to the origination of insurance. These costs, except for the commissions paid to brokers and others, are expensed directly in income as incurred. Commissions, on the other hand, are deferred and expensed in proportion to the recognition of the premium revenue, i.e. over the period of the corresponding insurance contract. Liabilities Reserves for claims are established based on historical experience, claims in process of payment, estimated amounts of claims incurred but not yet reported, and other factors relevant to the required reserve levels. A liability for premium deficiencies is recognized if the estimated amount of premium deficiencies exceeds deferred acquisition costs. Expenses related to recognition of liabilities for insurance contracts are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income under Change in reserves for insurance and private pension. Embedded derivatives We have not identified any embedded derivatives in our insurance contracts, which may be separated or measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 4 requirements. Liability adequacy test IFRS 4 requires that the insurance companies analyze the adequacy of their insurance liabilities in each reporting period through a minimum adequacy test. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING conducts the liability adequacy test under IFRS by adopting current actuarial assumptions for future cash flows of all insurance contracts in force at the balance sheet date. Should the analysis show insufficiency, any deficiency identified will be immediately accounted for in income for the period. The assumptions used to conduct the liability adequacy test are detailed in Note 30f. m) Capitalization plans For regulatory purposes in Brazil they are regulated by the insurance regulator. These plans do not meet the definition of an insurance contract under IFRS 4, and therefore they are classified as a financial liability at amortized cost under IAS 39. Revenue from capitalization plans is recognized during the period of the contract and measured as the difference between the amount deposited by the client and the amount that ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has to reimburse. n) Post-employments benefits ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING is required to make contributions to government social security and labor indemnity plans, in Brazil and in other countries where it operates, which are expensed in the consolidated statement of income as an integral part of general and administrative expenses, when incurred. Additionally, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING also sponsors Defined Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans, accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 – “Employee benefits”. Performance F-217 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Pension plans Defined benefit plans The liability (or asset, as the case may be) recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with respect to the defined benefit plan corresponds to the present value of defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. Defined benefit obligations are calculated on a yearly basis by an independent actuarial advisor based on the projected unit credit method. The present value of defined benefit obligations is determined by discounting the estimated amount of future cash flows of benefit payments based on Brazilian government securities denominated in Reais and with maturity periods similar to the term of the pension plan liabilities. They are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income: • current service cost – defined as the increase in the present value of obligations resulting from employee service in the current period. • interest on the net amount of assets (liabilities) of defined benefit plans is the change, during the period, in the net amount recognized in assets and liabilities, due to the time elapsed, which comprises the interest income on plan assets, interest expense on the obligations of the defined benefit plan and interest on the asset ceiling effects. Actuarial gains and losses arising from the non-adoption of the assumptions established in the latest evaluation, as compared to those effectively carried out or changes in such assumptions, as well as the effects of changes in these assumptions. Gains and losses are fully recognized in Other comprehensive income. Pension plans defined contribution For defined contribution plans, contributions to plans made by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, through pension plan funds, are recognized as an expense when due. Other post-employment benefit obligations Certain companies that merged into ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING over the past few years were sponsors of post-employment healthcare benefit plans and ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING is contractual committed to maintain such benefits over specific periods, as well as in relation to the benefits granted due to a judicial ruling. Likewise the defined benefit pension plans, these obligations are assessed annually by independent and qualified actuaries, and costs expected from these benefits are accumulated during the employment period and gains and losses arising from adjustments of practices and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in Stockholders’ equity, under Other comprehensive income, in the period they occurred. Performance F-218 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 o) Share-based payment Share-based payment is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based payment” which requires the entity to measure the value of equity instruments granted, based on their fair value at the option grant date. This cost is recognized during the vesting period of the right to exercise the instruments. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (notably remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period). The fulfillment of on-market vesting conditions is included in the assumptions about the number of options that are expected to be exercised. At the end of each period, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to be exercised based on non-market vesting conditions. It recognizes the impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, in the consolidated statement of income, with a corresponding adjustment to stockholders’ equity. When the options are exercised, the ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING treasury shares are generally delivered to the beneficiaries. The fair value of stock options is estimated by using option pricing models that take into account the exercise price of the option, the current stock price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the stock price and the life of the option. All stock based compensation plans established by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING correspond to plans that can be settled exclusively through the delivery of shares. p) Financial guarantees ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING recognizes the fair value of the guarantees issued in the Consolidated balance sheet under Other liabilities. Fair value is generally represented by the fee charged to client for issuing the guarantee. This amount at the issuance date is amortized over the life of the guarantee issued and recognized in the Consolidated statement of income under Banking service fees. After issuance, based on the best estimate, if ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING concludes that the occurrence of a loss regarding a guarantee issued is probable, and if the loss amount is higher than the initial fair value less cumulative amortization, a provision will be recognized for such amount. q) Provisions, contingent assets and contingent liabilities Provisions, contingent assets and contingent liabilities are assessed, recognized and disclosed in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. Contingent assets and liabilities are potential rights and obligations arising from past events for which materialization depends on uncertain future events. Contingent assets are not recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, except when the Management of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING understands that realization is virtually certain, which generally corresponds to lawsuits with favorable rulings, in final and unappealable judgments, withdrawal from lawsuits as a result of a payment in settlement or as a result of an agreement to offset against an existing liability. Contingent liabilities mainly arise from administrative proceedings and lawsuits, inherent in the ordinary course of business, filed by third parties, former employees and governmental bodies, in connection with civil, labor, and tax and social security claims. These contingencies are evaluated based on Management’s best estimates, and are classified as: • Probable: in which liabilities are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet under Provisions. • Possible: which are disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements, but no provision is recorded. • Remote: which require neither a provision nor disclosure. Contingent liabilities recorded under Provisions and those disclosed as possible are measured using best estimates through the use of models and criteria which allow their appropriate measurement even if there is uncertainty as to their ultimate timing and amount, and the criteria are detailed in Note 32. Performance F-219 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 The amount of court escrow deposits is adjusted in accordance with current legislation. Contingent liabilities guaranteed by indemnity clauses provided by third parties, such as in business combinations carried out before the transition date to IFRS, are recognized when a claim is asserted, and a receivable is recognized simultaneously subject to its collectability. For business combinations carried out after the transition date, indemnification assets are recognized at the same time and measured on the same basis as the indemnified item, subject to collectability or contractual limitations on the indemnified amount. r) Capital Common and preferred shares, which are equivalent to common shares but without voting rights are classified in Stockholders’ equity. The additional costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are included in Stockholders’ equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of taxes. s) Treasury shares Common and preferred shares repurchased are recorded in Stockholders’ equity under Treasury shares at their average purchase price. Shares that are subsequently sold, such as those sold to grantees under our share-based payment, are recorded as a reduction in treasury shares, measured at the average price of treasury stock held at such date. The difference between the sale price and the average price of the treasury shares is recorded as a reduction or increase in Additional paid-in capital. The cancellation of treasury shares is recorded as a reduction in Treasury shares against Appropriated reserves, at the average price of treasury shares at the cancellation date. t) Dividends and interest on capital Minimum dividend amounts established in the bylaws are recorded as liabilities at the end of each year. Any other amount above the mandatory minimum dividend is accounted for as a liability when approved by stockholders at a Stockholders´ Meeting. Interest on capital is treated for accounting purposes as a dividend, and it is presented as a reduction of stockholders' equity in the consolidated financial statements. The related tax benefit is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. Dividends have been and continue to be calculated and paid based on the financial statements prepared under Brazilian accounting standards and regulations for financial institutions and not based on these Consolidated financial statements prepared under IFRS. Dividends and interest on capital are presented in Note 21. u) Earnings per share Earnings per share are computed by dividing net income attributable to the owners of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING by the weighted average number of common and preferred shares outstanding for each reporting year. Weighted average shares are computed based on the periods for which the shares were outstanding. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING grants stock-based compensation whose dilutive effect is reflected in diluted earnings per share, with the application of the “treasury stock method“. Under the treasury stock method, earnings per share are calculated as if shares under stock-based compensation plans had been issued and as if the assumed proceeds were used to purchase shares of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING. Earnings per share are presented in Note 28. Performance F-220 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 v) Revenue from services Services related to current accounts are offered to clients either in formal packages or individually, and their income is recognized when these services are provided. Revenue from certain services, such as fees from funds management, performance, collection for retail clients and custody, is recognized over the life of the related contracts on a straight-line basis. The breakdown of the banking service fees is detailed in Note 24. w) Segment information Segment information is disclosed consistently with the internal report prepared for the Executive Committee, which makes the operational decisions of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has three reportable segments: (i) Retail Banking (ii) Wholesale Banking and (iii) Activities with the Market + Corporation. Segment information is presented in Note 34. Performance F-221 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Note 3 – Business development Citibank’s Retail Operations On October 08, 2016, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING entered, by means of its subsidiaries Itaú Unibanco S.A. (ITAÚ UNIBANCO) and Itaú Corretora de Valores S.A., into a share purchase and sale agreement with Banco Citibank S.A. and with other companies of its conglomerate (CITIBANK) for the acquisition of the retail banking activities carried out by CITIBANK in Brazil, including loans, deposits, credit cards, branches, assets under management and insurance brokerage, as well as the equity investments held by CITIBANK in TECBAN – Tecnologia Bancária S.A. (representing 5.64% of its capital) and in CIBRASEC – Companhia Brasileira de Securitização (representing 3.60% of its capital), for R$ 628. The operation was structured in three phases: i. Acquisition of retail operations, cards and insurance brokerage on October 31, 2017; ii. Acquisition of securities brokerage on December 1st, 2017; iii. Acquisition of ownership interest in TECBAN and CIBRASEC on December 26, 2017. The difference between the amount paid and net assets acquired resulted in the recognition of goodwill due to expected future profitability on the acquisition date of R$ 631. Gestora de Inteligência de Crédito S.A. On January 21, 2016, o ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, through its subsidiary ITAÚ UNIBANCO, executing a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with Banco Bradesco S.A., Banco do Brasil S.A., Banco Santander S.A. and Caixa Econômica Federal, aiming at the creation of a credit intelligence bureau that will develop a databank with the purpose of aggregating, reconciling and addressing master file and credit data of individuals and legal entities. Gestora de Inteligência de Crédito S.A., located in the city of São Paulo, was organized as a corporation, and each of its shareholders will have a 20% interest in its capital. After compliance with conditions precedent and approval by proper regulatory authorities, the operation was closed on June 14, 2017. Ownership interest acquired will be assessed under the Equity Method. Banco Itaú BMG Consignado S.A. On September 29, 2016, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, through its subsidiary ITAÚ UNIBANCO, entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Banco BMG S.A. (BMG) for acquisition of a 40% interest in the capital of Banco Itaú BMG Consignado S.A. (ITAÚ BMG CONSIGNADO), corresponding to BMG’s total interest in ITAÚ BMG CONSIGNADO, for the amount of R$ 1,460, and now holds 100% of ITAÚ BMG CONSIGNADO. ITAÚ UNIBANCO and BMG will maintain an association by means of the execution of a new commercial agreement for the distribution of payroll loans of ITAÚ BMG CONSIGNADO and its affiliates, on an exclusive basis, through certain distribution channels linked to BMG and its affiliates. After compliance with conditions precedent and approval by proper regulatory authorities, the transaction was closed on December 28, 2016. Currently, Itaú Consignado S.A. (current corporate name of ITAÚ BMG CONSIGNADO) is controlled by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING. ConectCar Soluções de Mobilidade Eletrônica S.A. On October 21, 2015, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, through its subsidiary Redecard S.A.

Futures – Interest rate and foreign currency futures contracts are commitments to buy or sell a financial instrument at a future date, at a contracted price or yield and may be settled in cash or through delivery. The notional amount represents the face value of the underlying instrument. Commodity futures contracts or financial instruments are commitments to buy or sell commodities (mainly gold, coffee and orange juice), at a future date, at a contracted price, which are settled in cash. The notional amount represents the quantity of such commodities multiplied by the future price at the contract date. Daily cash settlements of price movements are made for all instruments. Forwards – Interest forward contracts are agreements to exchange payments on a specified future date, based on a market change in interest rates from trade date to contract settlement date. Foreign exchange forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed price, at an agreed settlement date. Financial instrument forward contracts are commitments to buy or sell a financial instrument on a future date at a contracted price and are settled in cash. Swaps – Interest rate and foreign exchange swap contracts are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates, based on differentials between specified financial indices (either two different interest rates in a single currency or two different rates each in a different currency), as applied to a notional principal amount. Swap contracts presented in Other in the table below correspond substantially to inflation rate swap contracts. Options – Option contracts give the purchaser, for a fee, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell within a limited time a financial instrument including a flow of interest, foreign currencies, commodities, or financial instruments at a contracted price that may also be settled in cash, based on differentials between specific indices. Credit Derivatives – Credit derivatives are financial instruments with value relating to the credit risk associated to the debt issued by a third party (the reference entity), which permits that one party (the purchaser of the hedge) transfers the risk to the counterparty (the seller of the hedge). The seller of the hedge should make payments as set forth in the contract when the reference entity undergoes a credit event, such as bankruptcy, default or debt restructuring. The seller of the hedge receives a premium for the hedge, but, on the other hand, assumes the risk that the underlying asset referenced in the contract undergoes a credit event, and the seller would have to make the payment to the purchaser of the hedge, which could be the notional amount of the credit derivative. The total value of margins pledged in guarantee by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING was R$ 18,284 (R$ 12,246 at 12/31/2016) and was basically comprised of government securities.

Performance F-238 Context Our profile Our governance Our risk management Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 a) Information on credit derivatives ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING buys and sells credit protection mainly related to securities of Brazilian listed companies in order to meet the needs of its customers. When ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING sells contracts for credit protection, the exposure for a given reference entity may be partially or totally offset by a credit protection purchase contract of another counterparty for the same reference entity or similar entity. The credit derivatives for which ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING is protection seller are credit default swaps. Credit Default Swaps – CDS CDS are credit derivatives in which, upon a credit event related to the reference entity pursuant to the terms of the contract, the protection buyer is entitled to receive, from the protection seller, the amount equivalent to the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the liability on the date the contract was settled, also known as the recovered amount. The protection buyer does not need to hold the debt instrument of the reference entity for it to receive the amounts due pursuant to the CDS contract terms when a credit event occurs. The table below presents the portfolio of credit derivatives in which ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING sells protection to third parties, by maturity, and the maximum potential of future payments, gross of any guarantees, as well as its classification by instrument, risk and reference entity. 12/31/2017 Maximum potential From 1 to 3 From 3 to 5 of future payments, Before 1 year Over 5 years years years gross By instrument CDS 6,416 1,200 2,412 2,804 Total by instrument 6,416 1,200 2,412 2,804 By risk rating Investment grade 1,416 449 347 620 Below investment grade 5,000 751 2,065 2,184 Total by risk 6,416 1,200 2,412 2,804 By reference entity Brazilian government 3,597 406 1,671 1,520 Government – abroad 329 144 90 95 Private entities 2,490 650 651 1,189 Total by entity 6,416 1,200 2,412 2,804 12/31/2016 Maximum potential From 1 to 3 From 3 to 5 of future payments, Before 1 year Over 5 years years years gross By instrument CDS 8,094 1,989 3,487 2,585 33 Total by instrument 8,094 1,989 3,487 2,585 33 By risk rating Investment grade 1,854 564 974 283 33 Below investment grade 6,240 1,425 2,513 2,302 Total by risk 8,094 1,989 3,487 2,585 33 By reference entity Brazilian government 5,163 1,291 1,806 2,066 Government – abroad 529 81 413 35 Private entities 2,402 617 1,268 484 33 Total by entity 8,094 1,989 3,487 2,585 33 ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING assesses the risk of a credit derivative based on the credit ratings attributed to the reference entity by independent credit rating agencies. Investment grade are those entities for which credit risk is rated as Baa3 or higher, as rated by Moody's, and BBBor higher, according to the ratings of Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. The maximum potential loss that may be incurred with the credit derivative is based on the notional amount of the derivative. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING believes, based on its historical experience, that the amount of the maximum potential loss does not represent the actual level of loss. This is so because, should there be an event of loss, the amount of maximum potential loss should be reduced from the notional amount by the recoverable amount.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset in the balance sheet only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Derivatives and repurchase agreements not set off in the balance sheet relate to transactions in which there are enforceable master netting agreements or similar agreements, but the offset criteria have not been met in accordance with paragraph 42 of IAS 32 mainly because ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has no intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Performance F-241 Context Our profile Our governance Our risk management Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Note 9 – Hedge accounting There are three types of hedge relations: Fair value hedge, Cash flow hedge, and Hedge of net investment in foreign operations. a) Cash flow hedge To hedge the variation of future cash flows of interest payment and receipts and exposure to futures interest rate, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses futures contracts traded at B3 and Chicago Stock Exchange, related to certain fixed assets and liabilities, denominated in Brazilian Reais and US Dollars, futures Euro-Dollar and interest rate swaps, related to redeemable preferred shares, denominated in US Dollars, issued by one of our subsidiaries, DDI Futures contracts and Dollar Purchase Options, traded on B3, related to highly probable forecast transactions denominated in US Dollars and NDF (Non Deliverable Forward) and currency swap, contracts traded in the over-the-counter market, related to highly probable forecast transactions not accounted for. Under a DI Futures contract, a net payment (receipt) is made for the difference between an amount multiplied by the CDI rate and an amount computed and multiplied by a fixed rate. Under an interest rate swap, currency and futures Euro-Dollar, a net payment (receipt) is made for the difference between an amount computed multiplied by the LIBOR rate and an amount computed and multiplied by a fixed rate. In DDI Future contracts, NDF and Forwards, the gain (loss) on exchange variation is computed as the difference between two periods of market quotation between the US Dollar and the contracted currency. The cash flow hedge strategies of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING consist of a hedge of exposure to variations in cash flows, payment of interest and exposure to interest rate, which are attributable to changes in interest rates related to assets and liabilities recognized and changes in interest rates of unrecognized assets and liabilities. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has applied cash flow hedge strategies as follows: • Hedge of time deposits and repurchase agreements: hedge of the variability in cash flows of interest payments resulting from changes in the CDI interest rate; • Hedge of highly probable forecast transactions: to protect the payment cash flow of contractual agreements in foreign currency related to the volatility risk of foreign exchange rate; • Hedge of Syndicated Loan: hedge the variability in cash flow of interest payments resulting from changes in the LIBOR interest rate; • Hedge of asset transactions: to hedge the variations in cash flows of interest receipts resulting from changes in the CDI rate; • Hedge of assets denominated in UF*: to hedge the variations in cash flows of interest receipts resulting from changes in the UF*; • Hedge of Funding: to hedge the variations in cash flows of interest payments resulting from changes in the TPM* rate and foreign exchange; • Hedge of loan operations: variations in cash flows of interest receipts resulting from changes in the TPM* rate; • Hedge of asset-backed securities under repurchase agreements: changes in cash flows from interest received on changes in Selic (benchmark interest rate). *UF – Chilean unit of account / TPM – Monetary policy rate To evaluate the effectiveness and to measure the ineffectiveness of such strategies, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses the hypothetical derivative method. The hypothetical derivative method is based on a comparison of the change in the fair value of a hypothetical derivative with terms identical to the critical terms of the variable-rate liability, and this change in the fair value of a hypothetical derivative is considered a proxy of the present value of the cumulative change in the future cash flow expected for the hedged liability. All hedge relationships were designated between 2008 and 2017. Periods in which expected cash flows should be paid and affect the income statement are as follows: • Hedge of time deposits and agreements to resell: interest paid / received daily; • Hedge of highly probable forecast transactions: foreign exchange amount paid / received on future dates; • Hedge of Syndicated Loan: interest paid / received daily; • Hedge of asset transactions: interest paid / received monthly; • Hedge of assets denominated in UF: interest received monthly; • Hedge of funding: interest paid monthly; • Hedge of loan operations: interest received monthly; • Hedge of redeemable preferred shares: interest paid / received every monthly. Following we present gains (or losses) of the effective and ineffective of the strategies of cash flow hedge.

To hedge future cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions, arising from futures contracts in foreign currency, against the exposure to future interest rate, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING negotiated DDI Futures contracts and Dollar Purchase Options, traded on B3 and NDF (Non Deliverable Forward) contracts traded in the over-the-counter market. At 12/31/2017, the gain (loss) on cash flow hedge expected to be reclassified from Comprehensive Income to Income in the following 12 months is R$ (1,750) (R$ 130 at 12/31/2016). Performance F-243 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 b) Hedge of net investment in foreign operations ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING strategies of net investments in foreign operations consist of a hedge of the exposure in foreign currency arising from the functional currency of the foreign operation, with respect to the functional currency of the head office. To hedge the changes of future cash flows of exchange variation of net investments in foreign operations, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses DDI Futures contracts traded at B3, Financial Assets and Forward contracts or NDF contracts entered into by our subsidiaries abroad. In DDI Future contracts, the gain (loss) on exchange variation is computed as the difference between two periods of market quotation between the US Dollar and Brazilian Real. In the Forward or NDF contracts and Financial Assets, the gain (loss) on exchange variation is computed as the difference between two periods of market quotation between the functional currency and the US Dollar. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING applies the hedge of net investment in foreign operations as follows: To hedge the risk of variation in the investment amount, when measured in Brazilian Reais (the head office’s functional currency), arising from changes in exchange rates between the functional currency of the investment abroad and the Brazilian Real. To evaluate the effectiveness and to measure the ineffectiveness of such strategies, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses the Dollar Offset Method. The Dollar Offset Method is based on a comparison of the change in fair value (cash flow) of the hedge instrument, attributable to changes in exchange rate and gain (loss) arising from the variation in exchange rates, on the amount of investment abroad designated as a hedged item. Hedge relationships were designated in 2011 and 2017 and the hedge instruments will mature on the sale of investments abroad, which will be in the period when the cash flows of exchange variation are expected to occur and affect the statement of income. Following we present gains (or losses) of the effective and ineffective of the strategies of Hedge of net investment in foreign operations: 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 Hedge instrument Accumulated Accumulated Ineffective portion Ineffective portion effective portion effective portion DDI futures (7,501) (41) (7,490) (51) Forward 623 38 683 (48) NDF 1,411 9 2,312 (35) Financial assets (40) (2) 43 2 Total (5,507) 5 (4,452) (132) The effective portion is recognized in the stockholders' equity, under other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognized in the statement of income under net gain (loss) on investment securities and derivatives. DDI Futures is a futures contract in which participants may trade a clean coupon for any period between the first maturity of the futures contract of foreign currency coupon (DDI) and a later maturity. NDF (Non Deliverable Forward), or Forward Contract of Currency without Physical Delivery is a derivative traded on overthe-counter market, which has the foreign exchange rate of a given currency as its subject. Performance F-244 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 c) Fair value hedge The fair value hedge strategy of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING consists in hedging the exposure to variation in fair value, in the receipt and payment of interest related to recognized assets and liabilities. To hedge the market risk variation in the receipt and payment of interest, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses interest rate swap contracts related to prefixed operations expressed in Chilean Unit of Account CLF, fixed rate and denominated in Euros and US dollars, issued by subsidiaries in Chile, London, and Colombia, respectively. Under an interest rate swap contract, net receipt (payment) is made for the difference between the amount computed and multiplied by variable rate and an amount computed and multiplied by a fixed rate. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has applied fair value hedge as follows: • To protect the risk of variation in the fair value of receipt and payment of interest resulting from variations in the fair value of variable rates involved. • To hedge the variations in cash flows of interest receipts resulting from changes in the CDI rate. To evaluate the effectiveness and to measure the ineffectiveness of such strategy, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses the percentage approach and dollar offset method: • The percentage approach is based on the calculation of change in the fair value of the reviewed estimate for the hedged position (hedge item) attributable to the protected risk versus the change in the fair value of the hedged derivative instrument. • The dollar offset method is calculated based on the difference between the variation of the fair value of the hedging instrument and the variation in the fair value of the hedged item attributed to changes in the interest rate. Hedge relationships were designated between 2012 and 2017, and maturities of related swaps will occur between 2018 and 2035. Receipts (payments) of interest flows are expected to occur on a monthly basis, and they will affect the statement of income.

These payments are only made in years where there are sufficient profits to enable the distribution of mandatory dividends, in order to limit the maximum dilutive effect to which stockholders are subject, and at a quantity that does not exceed the limit of 0.5% of the total shares held by the controlling and minority stockholders at the balance sheet date. These programs are settled through the delivery of ITUB4 treasury shares to stockholders. From 01/01 to 12/31/2017, the accounting effect of the share-based payment in income was R$ (536) (R$ (591) from 01/01 to 12/31/2016 and R$ (734) from 01/01 to 12/31/2015). I – Stock Option Plan (Simple Options) ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has a Stock Option Plan (“Simple Options”) aimed at involving management members and employees in the medium and long term corporate development program of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING and its subsidiaries, offering them the opportunity benefit from the appreciation that their work and dedication bring to the shares. In addition to the awards provided under the Plan, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING also maintains control over the rights and obligations in connection with the options granted under the plans approved at the Extraordinary Stockholders’ Meetings held on April 24, 2009 and April 19, 2013 related to the Unibanco – União de Bancos Brasileiros S.A. and to Unibanco Holdings S.A., and to Redecard S.A. (“Rede”) stock option plans, respectively. Accordingly, the exchange of shares for ITUB4 did not have a relevant financial impact. Simple options have the following characteristics: a) Exercise price: calculated based on the average prices of shares in the three months of the year prior to the grant date. The prices determined will be inflation-adjusted to the last business day of the month prior to the option exercise date based on IGP-M or, in its absence, on an index to be determined internally, and should be paid within the period in force for the settlement of operations on B3. b) Vesting period: determined upon issue, from one to seven years, counted from the grant date. The vesting period is normally determined at five years. c) Fair value and economic assumptions for cost recognition: the fair value of Simple Options is calculated on the grant date based on the Binominal model. Economic assumptions used are as follows: (i) Exercise price: exercise price previously agreed upon the option issue, adjusted by the IGP-M variation; (ii) Price of the underlying asset (ITUB4 shares): closing price on B3 on the calculation base date. (iii) Expected dividends: the average annual return rate for the last three years of dividends paid plus interest on capital of the ITUB4 share; (iv) Risk-free interest rate: IGP-M coupon rate at the expiration date of the Simple Option; (v) Expected volatility: calculated based on the standard deviation from the history of the last 84 monthly returns of the ITUB4 share closing prices, disclosed by B3, adjusted by the IGP-M variation.

Accordingly, the ownership of these shares should be held by the beneficiaries for a period from three to five years, counted from the initial investment, and are thus subject to market price variations. After complying with the suspensive conditions set forth in the program, beneficiaries will be entitled to receive ITUB4 as consideration, in accordance with the numbers of shares provided for in the program regulations. The acquisition prices of own shares and Share-Based Instruments are established every six months and is equivalent to the average of the ITUB4 quotation in the 30 days prior to the determination of the acquisition price. The fair value of the ITUB4 as consideration is the market price at the grant date, less expected dividends.

The projections of future taxable income include estimates related to macroeconomic variables, exchange rates, interest rates, volume of financial operations and services fees and others, which can vary in relation to actual data and amounts. Net income in the financial statements is not directly related to the taxable income, due to differences between the accounting criteria and tax legislation, in addition to corporate aspects. Accordingly, it is recommended that the trends for the realization of deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, and tax loss carry forwards should not be used as an indication of future net income. Considering the temporary effects of Law 13,169/15, which increases the Social Contribution tax rate to 20% until December 31, 2018, tax credits were accounted for based on their expected realization. There are no unrecorded deferred tax assets at 12/31/2017 and 12/31/2016.

They also sponsor defined contribution plans, the benefit of which is calculated based on the accumulated balance of individual accounts at the eligibility date, according to the plan’s regulations, which does not require actuarial calculation, except as described in Note 29c. Employees hired prior to July 31, 2002, for those who came from Itaú, and prior to February 27, 2009 for those who came from Unibanco, are beneficiaries of the above-mentioned plans. As regards the new employees hired after these dates, they have the option to voluntarily participate in a variable contribution plan (PGBL), managed by Itaú Vida e Previdência S.A.

(2) The mortality tables adopted correspond to those disclosed by Society of Actuaries (SOA), the North-American entity which corresponds to Brazilian Institute of Actuarial Science (IBA), which reflects a 10% increase in the probabilities of survival compared to the respective basic tables.The life expectancy in years per the AT-2000 mortality table for participants aged 55 years is 27 and 31 years for men and women, respectively. (3) The turnover assumption is based on the effective experience of active participants linked to ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, resulting in the average of 2.4 % p.a. based on the 2008/2010 experience. (4) Using the Projected Unit Credit method, the mathematical reserve is determined based on the current projected benefit amount multiplied by the ratio between the length of service at the assessment date and the length of service that will be reached at the date when the benefit is granted. The cost is determined taking into account the current projected benefit amount distributed over the years that each participant is employed. In case of benefits sponsored by foreign subsidiaries, actuarial assumptions adequate to the group of participants and the country's economic scenario are adopted. Biometric/demographic assumptions adopted are consistent with the group of participants of each benefit plan, pursuant to the studies carried out by an independent external actuarial consulting company. IIRisk Exposure Through its defined benefit plans, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant ones are: Volatility of Assets The actuarial liability is calculated by adopting a discount rate defined on the income related to securities issued by the Brazilian treasury (government securities). If the actual income related to plan assets is lower than expected, this may give rise to a deficit. The plans have a significant percentage of fixed-income securities pegged to the plan commitments, aimed at minimizing volatility and short and medium term risk. Changes in Investment Income A decrease in income related to public securities will imply a decrease in the discount rate and, therefore, will increase the plan's actuarial liability. The effect will be partially offset by the recognition of these securities at market value. Inflation Risk Most of the employee benefit plans are pegged to the inflation rates, and a higher inflation will lead to higher obligations. The effect will also be partially offset because a significant portion of the plan assets is pegged to government securities restated at the inflation rate. Life Expectancy Most of the plan obligations are to provide life benefits, and therefore an increase in life expectancy will result in increased plan liabilities. III Management of defined benefit plan assets The general purpose of managing EFPCs funds is to search for a long term balance between assets and obligations to pay retirement benefits, by exceeding the actuarial targets (discount rate plus benefit adjustment index, established in the plan regulations). Regarding the assets guaranteeing the actuarial liability reserves, management should ensure the payment capacity of retirement benefits in the long term by avoiding the risk of mismatching assets and liabilities in each pension plan.

Fair Value The fair value of the plan assets is adjusted up to the Balance Sheet date, as follows: Fixed-Income Securities and Structured Investments – accounted for at market value, considering the average trading price on the calculation date, net realizable value obtained upon the technical addition of pricing, considering, at least, the payment terms and maturity, credit risk and the indexing unit. Variable income securities – accounted for at market value, taken to be the share average quotation at the last day of the month or at the closest date on the stock exchange on which the share has posted the highest liquidity rate. Real Estate – stated at acquisition or construction cost, adjusted to market value based on reappraisals made in 2017, supported by technical appraisal reports. Depreciation is calculated under the straight line method, considering the useful life of the real estate. Loans to participants – adjusted up to the report date, in compliance with the respective agreements. Fund Allocation Target The fund allocation target is based on Investment Policies that are currently revised and approved by the Advisory Council of each EFPC, considering a five-year period, which establishes guidelines for investing funds guaranteeing Actuarial Liability and for classifying securities.

Products are offered through insurance brokers (third parties operating in the market and its own brokers), Itaú Unibanco branches and electronic channels, according to their characteristics and regulatory requirements. b) Main products I Insurance The contract entered into between the parties aims at guaranteeing the protection of the client's assets. Upon payment of a premium, the policyholder is protected through previously-agreed replacement or indemnification clauses for damages. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING insurance companies then recognize technical reserves administered by themselves, through specialized areas within the conglomerate, with the objective of indemnifying the policyholder's loss in the event of claims of insured risks. The insurance risks sold by insurance companies of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING are divided into property and casualty, that covers losses, damages or liabilities for assets or persons, and life insurance that includes coverage for death and personal accidents.

Recommended for clients that file the full version of income tax return, because they can deduct contributions paid for tax purposes up to 12% of the annual taxable gross income. • VGBL Redeemable Life Insurance: This is an insurance structured as a pension plan. Its taxation differs from the PGBL; in this case, the tax basis is the earned income. • FGB Fund Generator of Benefits: This is a pension plan with minimum income guarantee, and possibility of receiving earnings from asset performance. Once recognized the distribution of earnings at a certain percentage, as established by the FGB policy, it is not at management's discretion, but instead represents an obligation to ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING.

Performance F-292 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 f) Liability adequacy test As established in IFRS 4 – “Insurance contracts”, an insurance company must carry out the Liability Adequacy Test, comparing the amount recognized for its technical reserves with the current estimate of cash flow of its future obligations. The estimate should consider all cash flows related to the business, which is the minimum requirement for carrying out the adequacy test. The Liability adequacy test did not indicate insufficiency in the periods ended of 2017, 2016 and 2015. The assumptions used in the test are periodically reviewed and are based on the best practices and the analysis of subsidiaries’ experience, therefore representing the best estimates for cash flow projections. Methodology and Test Grouping The methodology for testing all products is based on the projection of cash flows. Specifically for insurance products, cash flows were projected using the method known as run-off triangle of quarterly frequency. Cash flows for the deferral and the assignment phases are tested on a separate basis for social security products. The risk grouping criterion considers groups subject to similar risks that are jointly managed as a single portfolio. Biometric Tables Biometric tables are instruments to measure the biometric risk represented by the probability of death, survival or disability of a participant. For death and survival estimates, the Brazilian Market Insurer Experience (BR-EMS) tables in effect are used, adjusted according to life expectancy development of Scale G, and the Álvaro Vindas table is adopted to estimate benefit requests for disability. Risk-free Interest Rate The relevant risk-free forward interest-rate structure is an indicator of the pure time value of money used to price the set of projected cash flows. The relevant structure of risk-free interest rate was obtained from the curve of securities deemed to be credit risk free, available in the Brazilian financial market and determined pursuant to an internal policy of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, considering the addition of spread, which took into account the impact of the market result of held-to-maturity securities of the guarantee assets portfolio. Income conversion rate The income conversion rate represents the expected conversion of balances accumulated by participants in retirement benefits. The decision of conversion into income by participants is influenced by behavioral, economic and tax factors. Other Assumptions Related expenses, cancellations and partial redemptions, future increases and contributions, among others, are assumptions that affect the estimate of projected cash flows since they represent expenses and income arising from insurance agreements assumed. Performance F-293 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 g) Insurance risk – effect of changes on actuarial assumptions Property insurance is a short-lived insurance, and the main actuarial assumptions involved in the management and pricing of the associated risks are claims frequency and severity. Volatility above the expected number of claims and/or amount of claim indemnities may result in unexpected losses. Life insurance and pension plans are, in general, medium or long-lived products and the main risks involved in the business may be classified as biometric risk, financial risk and behavioral risk. Biometric risk relates to: i) more than expected increase in life expectancies for products with survivorship coverage (mostly pension plans); ii) more than expected decrease in mortality rates for products with survivorship coverage (mostly life insurance). Products offering financial guarantee predetermined under contract involve financial risk inherent in the underwriting risk, with such risk being considered insurance risk. Behavioral risk relates to a more than expected increase in the rates of conversion into annuity income, resulting in increased payments of retirement benefits. The estimated actuarial assumptions are based on the historical evaluation of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, on benchmarks and the experience of the actuaries. To measure the effects of changes in the key actuarial assumptions, sensitivity tests were conducted in the amounts of current estimates of future liability cash flows. The sensitivity analysis considers a vision of the impacts caused by changes in assumptions, which could affect the income for the period and stockholders’ equity at the balance sheet date. This type of analysis is usually conducted under the ceteris paribus condition, in which the sensitivity of a system is measured when one variable of interest is changed and all the others remain unchanged. The results obtained are shown in the table below: Performance F-294 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 The sensitivity analysis considers a vision of the impacts caused by changes in assumptions, which could affect the income for the period and stockholders’ equity at the balance sheet date.

The liquidity risk is managed, for insurance operation, continuously based on the monitoring of payment flows related to its liabilities vis a vis the inflows generated by its operations and financial assets portfolio. Financial assets are managed in order to optimize the risk-return ratio of investments, considering, on a careful basis, the characteristics of their liabilities. The risk integrated control considers the concentration limits by issuer and credit risk, sensitivities and market risk limits and control over asset liquidity risk. Thus, investments are concentrated in government and private securities with good credit quality in active and liquid markets, keeping a considerable amount invested in shortterm assets, available on demand, to cover regular needs and any liquidity contingencies.

Analyses of reinsurance required are made to meet the current needs of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, maintaining the necessary flexibility to comply with changes in management strategy in response to the various scenarios to which it may exposed. Reinsurance assets Reinsurance assets are valued according to consistent basis of risk assignment contracts, and in the event of losses effectively paid, as from December 2015, they are revalued after 180 days have elapsed in relation to the possibility of non-recovery. For previous periods, revaluation term is 365 days. This amendment was for compliance with the SUSEP Circular in force. In case of doubt, these assets are reduced based on the provision recognized for credit risk associated to reinsurance. Reinsurance transferred ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING transfers, in the normal course of its businesses, reinsurance premiums to cover losses on underwriting risks to its policy holders and is in compliance with the operational limits established by the regulating authority. In addition to proportional contracts, non-proportional contracts are also entered into in order to transfer a portion of the responsibility to the reinsurance company for losses that exceed a certain level of losses in the portfolio. Non-proportional reinsurance premiums are included in Other assets prepaid expenses and amortized to Other operating expenses over the effectiveness period of the contract on a daily accrual basis.

These authorities are responsible for regulating the market and consequently for assisting in the mitigation of risks inherent in the business. The CNSP is the regulatory authority of insurance activities in Brazil, created by Decree-Law N° 73, of November 21, 1966. The main attribution of CNSP, at the time of its creation, was to set out the guidelines and rules of government policy on private insurance segments, and with the enactment of Law N° 6,435, of July 15, 1977, its attributions included private pension of public companies. The Superintendence of Private Insurance (SUSEP) is the authority responsible for controlling and overseeing the insurance, and reinsurance markets. An agency of the Ministry of Finance, it was created by the Decree-Law N° 73, of November 21, 1966, which also created the National System of Private Insurance, comprising the National Council of Private Insurance (CNSP), IRB Brasil Resseguros S.A. – IRB Brasil Re, the companies authorized to have plans and the open-ended private pension companies. Performance F-303 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Note 31 – Fair value of financial instruments In cases where market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques. These techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions adopted, including the discount rate and estimate of future cash flows. The estimated fair value achieved through these techniques cannot be substantiated by comparison with independent markets and, in many cases, it cannot be realized in the immediate settlement of the instrument. The following table summarizes the carrying and estimated fair values for financial instruments: 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 Estimated Estimated Carrying value Carrying value fair value fair value Financial assets Cash and deposits on demand and Central Bank compulsory deposits 117,586 117,586 104,242 104,242 Interbank deposits 29,053 29,117 22,692 22,731 Securities purchased under agreements to resell 244,707 244,707 265,051 265,051 Financial assets held for trading (*) 270,121 270,121 204,648 204,648 (*) Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss 1,746 1,746 1,191 1,191 Derivatives (*) 22,843 22,843 24,231 24,231 Available-for-sale financial assets (*) 102,284 102,284 88,277 88,277 Held-to-maturity financial assets 36,560 37,792 40,495 40,749 Loan operations and lease operations 465,472 471,846 463,394 472,704 Other financial assets 59,568 59,568 53,917 53,917 Financial liabilities Deposits 402,938 402,911 329,414 329,371 Securities sold under repurchase agreements 312,634 312,634 349,164 349,164 Financial liabilities held for trading (*) 465 465 519 519 Derivatives (*) 26,746 26,746 24,698 24,698 Interbank market debt 129,616 129,286 135,483 134,730 Institutional market debt 98,482 97,103 96,239 95,012 Liabilities for capitalization plans 3,301 3,301 3,147 3,147 Other financial liabilities 77,613 77,613 71,832 71,832 (*) These assets and liabilities are recorded in the balance sheet at their fair value. Financial instruments not included in the Balance Sheet (Note 36) are represented by Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees provided, which amount to R$ 79,703 (R$ 77,453 at 12/31/2016) with an estimated fair value of R$ 935 (R$ 1,066 at 12/31/2016). The methods and assumptions adopted to estimate the fair value are defined below: a) Cash and deposits on demand, Central Bank compulsory deposits, Securities purchased under agreements to resell, Securities sold under repurchase agreements and liabilities for capitalization plans – The carrying amounts for these instruments approximate their fair values. b) Interbank deposits, deposits, Interbank market debt and Institutional market debt – ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING estimates the fair values by discounting the estimated cash flows and adopting the market interest rates. c) Financial assets held for trading, including Derivatives (assets and liabilities), Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss, Available-for-sale financial assets, Held-to-maturity financial assets and Financial liabilities held for trading – Under normal conditions, market prices are the best indicators of the fair values of financial instruments. However, not all instruments have liquidity or quoted market prices and, in such cases, the adoption of present value estimates and other pricing techniques are required. In the absence of quoted prices from National Association of Financial Market Institutions (ANBIMA), the fair values of bonds are calculated based on the interest rates provided by others on the market (brokers). The fair values of corporate debt securities are computed by adopting criteria similar to those applied to interbank deposits, as described above. The fair values of shares are computed based on their prices quoted in the market. The fair values of derivative financial instruments were determined as follows: • Swaps: The cash flows are discounted to present value based on yield curves that reflect the appropriate risk factors. These yield curves may be drawn mainly based on the exchange price of derivatives at B3, of Brazilian government securities in the secondary market or derivatives and securities traded abroad. These yield curves may be used to obtain the fair value of currency swaps, interest rate swaps and swaps based on other risk factors (commodities, stock exchange indices, etc.). Performance F-304 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 • Futures and forwards: Quotations on exchanges or criteria identical to those applied to swaps. • Options: The fair values are determined based on mathematical models (such as Black&Scholes) that are fed with implicit volatility data, interest rate yield curve and fair value of the underlying asset. Current market prices of options are used to compute the implicit volatilities. All these data are obtained from different sources (usually Bloomberg). • Credit: Inversely related to the probability of default (PD) in a financial instrument subject to credit risk. The process of adjusting the market price of these spreads is based on the differences between the yield curves with no risk and the yield curves adjusted for credit risk. d) Loan operations and lease operations – Fair value is estimated based on groups of loans with similar financial and risk characteristics, using valuation models. The fair value of fixed-rate loans was determined by discounting estimated cash flows, applying current interest rates for similar loans. For the majority of loans at floating rate, the carrying amount was considered close to their fair value. The fair value of loan and lease operations not overdue was calculated by discounting the expected payments of principal and interest through maturity, at the aforementioned rates. The fair value of overdue loan and lease transactions was based on the discount of estimated cash flows, using a rate proportional to the risk associated with the estimated cash flows, or on the underlying collateral. The assumptions related to cash flows and discount rates are determined using information available in the market and the borrower’s specific information of the debtor. e) Deposits – The fair value of fixed-rate loans with maturity dates was determined by discounting estimated cash flows, applying current interest rates for similar funding operations. Cash deposits are not considered in the fair value estimate. The assumptions related to cash flows and discount rates are determined based on information available in the market and information specific for each operation. f) Other financial assets / liabilities – primarily composed of receivables from credit card issuers, deposits in guarantee for contingent liabilities and trading and intermediation of securities. The carrying amounts for these assets/liabilities substantially approximate their fair values, since they principally represent amounts to be received in the short term from credit card holders and to be paid to credit card acquirers, judicially required deposits (indexed to market rates) made by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING as guarantees for lawsuits or very short-term receivables (generally with a maturity of approximately 5 (five) business days). All of these items represent assets / liabilities without significant associated market, credit and liquidity risks. In accordance with IFRS, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING classifies fair value measurements in a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs adopted in the measurement process. Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. An active market is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability being measured occur often enough and with sufficient volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. Level 2 generally includes: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or quoted prices vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly; (iii) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, etc.); (iv) inputs that are mainly derived from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or by other means. Level 3: Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable information shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable information is not available, thus allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Performance F-305 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Financial assets for trading, Available for sale, and Designated at fair value through profit or loss: Level 1: Highly-liquid securities with prices available in an active market are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. This classification level includes most of the Brazilian Government Securities, securities of foreign governments, shares and debentures traded on stock exchanges and other securities traded in an active market. Level 2: When the pricing information is not available for a specific security, the assessment is usually based on prices quoted in the market for similar instruments, pricing information obtained for pricing services, such as Bloomberg, Reuters and brokers (only when the prices represent actual transactions) or discounted cash flows, which use information for assets actively traded in an active market. These securities are classified into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are comprised of certain Brazilian government securities, debentures, some government securities quoted in a less-liquid market in relation to those classified into Level 1, and some share prices in investment funds. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING does not hold positions in alternative investment funds or private equity funds. Level 3: When no pricing information in an active market, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses internally developed models, from curves generated according to the proprietary model. The Level 3 classification includes some Brazilian government and private securities falling due after 2025 and securities that are not usually traded in an active market. Derivatives: Level 1: Derivatives traded on stock exchanges are classified in Level 1 of the hierarchy. Level 2: For derivatives not traded on stock exchanges, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING estimates the fair value by adopting a variety of techniques, such as Black&Scholes, Garman & Kohlhagen, Monte Carlo or even the discounted cash flow models usually adopted in the financial market. Derivatives included in Level 2 are credit default swaps, cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps, plain vanilla options, certain forwards and generally all swaps. All models adopted by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING are widely accepted in the financial services industry and reflect all derivative contractual terms. Considering that many of these models do not require a high level of subjectivity, since the methodologies adopted in the models do not require major decisions and information for the model are readily observed in the actively quotation markets, these products were classified in Level 2 of the measurement hierarchy. Level 3: The derivatives with fair values based on non-observable information in an active market were classified into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, and are comprised of non-standard options, certain swaps indexed to non-observable information, and swaps with other products, such as swap with option and USD Check, credit derivatives and futures of certain commodities. These operations have their pricing derived from a range of volatility using the basis of historical volatility. All aforementioned valuation methodologies may result in a fair value that may not be indicative of the net realizable value or future fair values. However, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING believes that all methodologies used are appropriate and consistent with the other market participants. However, the adoption of other methodologies or assumptions different than those used to estimate fair value may result in different fair value estimates at the balance sheet date.

Performance F-307 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Measurement of fair value Level 2 based on pricing services and brokers When pricing information is not available for securities classified as Level 2, pricing services, such as Bloomberg or brokers, are used to value such instruments. In all cases, to assure that the fair value of these instruments is properly classified as Level 2, internal analysis of the information received are conducted, so as to understand the nature of the input used in the establishment of such values by the service provider. Prices provided by pricing services that meet the following requirements are considered Level 2: input is immediately available, regularly distributed, provided by sources actively involved in significant markets and it is not proprietary. Of the total of R$ 81,210 in financial instruments classified as Level 2, at December 31, 2017, pricing service or brokers were used to evaluate securities at the fair value of R$ 47,187, substantially represented by: • Debentures: When available, we use price information for transactions recorded in the Brazilian Debenture System (SND), an electronic platform operated by CETIP, which provides multiple services for transactions involving debentures in the secondary market. Alternatively, prices of debentures provided by ANBIMA are used. Its methodology includes obtaining, on a daily basis, illustration and non-binding prices from a group of market players deemed to be significant. Such information is subject to statistical filters established in the methodology, with the purpose of eliminating outliers. • Global and corporate securities: The pricing process for these securities consists in capturing from 2 to 8 quotes from Bloomberg, depending on the asset. The methodology consists in comparing the highest purchase prices and the lowest sale prices of trades provided by Bloomberg for the last day of the month. Such prices are compared with information from purchase orders that the Institutional Treasury of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING provides for Bloomberg. Should the difference between them be lower than 0.5%, the average price of Bloomberg is used. Should it be higher than 0.5% or if the Institutional Treasury does not provide information on this specific security, the average price gathered directly from other banks is used. The price of the Institutional Treasury is used as a reference only and never in the computation of the final price. Level 3 recurring fair value measurements The departments in charge of defining and applying the pricing models are segregated from the business areas. The models are documented, submitted to validation by an independent area and approved by a specific committee. The daily process of price capture, calculation and disclosure are periodically checked according to formally defined testing and criteria and the information is stored in a single and corporate history data base. The most recurring cases of assets classified as Level 3 are justified by the discount factors used. Factors such as the fixed interest curve in Brazilian Reais and the TR coupon curve – and, as a result, its related factors – have inputs with terms shorter than the maturities of these fixed-income assets. For swaps, the analysis is carried out by index for both parties. There are some cases in which the inputs periods are shorter than the maturity of the derivative.

Significant unverifiable inputs used for measurement of the fair value of instruments classified in Level 3 are: interest rates, underlying asset prices and volatility. Significant variations in any of these inputs separately may give rise to significant changes in the fair value.

The contingencies related to these lawsuits are classified as follows: a) Contingent assets: there are no contingent assets recorded. b) Provisions and contingencies: The criteria to quantify contingencies are adequate in relation to the specific characteristics of civil, labor and tax lawsuits portfolios, as well as other risks, taking into consideration the opinion of its legal advisors, the nature of the lawsuits, the similarity with previous lawsuits and the prevailing previous court decisions. Civil lawsuits In general, contingencies arise from claims related to the revision of contracts and compensation for damages and pain and suffering and the lawsuits are classified as follows: Collective lawsuits (related to claims of a similar nature and with individual amounts that are not considered significant): contingencies are determined on a monthly basis and the expected amount of losses is accrued according to statistical references that take into account the nature of the lawsuit and the characteristics of the court (Small Claims Court or Regular Court). Contingencies and provisions are adjusted to reflect the amounts deposited as guarantee for their execution when realized. Individual lawsuits (related to claims with unusual characteristics or involving significant amounts): These are periodically calculated based on the calculation of the amount claimed. Probability of loss, which is estimated based on the characteristics of the lawsuit. The amounts considered as probable losses are recorded as provisions. It should be mentioned that ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING is a party to specific lawsuits related to the collection of understated inflation adjustments to savings accounts resulting from economic plans implemented in the 80’s and 90’s as a measure to combat inflation. Although ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING complied with the rules in effect at the time, the company is a defendant in lawsuits filed by individuals that address this topic, as well as in class actions filed by: (i) consumer protection associations; and (ii) the Public Prosecution Office on behalf of savings account holders. With respect to these lawsuits, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING records provisions when it is served and when the individuals apply to enforce the decision rendered by the Judicial Branch, using the same criteria adopted to determine provisions for individual lawsuits. The Federal Supreme Court (STF) has issued some decisions favorable to savings account holders, but it has not established its understanding with respect to the constitutionality of the economic plans and their applicability to savings accounts. Currently, the appeals involving these matters are suspended, as determined by the STF, until it pronounces a final decision. In December 2017, through mediation of the Federal Attorney’s Office (AGU) and supervision of the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB), savers (represented by two civil associations, FEBRAPO and IDEC) and FEBRABAN entered into an instrument of agreement aiming at resolving lawsuits related to economic plans, and Itaú has already adhered to its terms. For effectiveness and validity of the agreement, it needs to be approved by the STF, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2018. As from that approval, the savers will have 24 months to adhere to the terms of the agreement. Performance F-311 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 No amount is recorded as a provision in relation to Civil lawsuits which likelihood of loss is considered possible, which total estimated risk is R$ 3,494 (R$ 3,388 at 12/31/2016), in this amount there are no values resulting from interests in joint ventures. Labor claims Contingencies arise from lawsuits in which labor rights provided for in labor legislation specific to the related profession are discussed, such as: overtime, salary equalization, reinstatement, transfer allowance, pension plan supplement, among others, are discussed. These lawsuits are classified as follows: Collective lawsuits (related to claims considered similar and with individual amounts that are not considered relevant): The expected amount of loss is determined and accrued on a monthly basis in accordance with a statistical share pricing model and is reassessed taking into account the court rulings. These contingencies are adjusted to the amounts deposited as guarantee for their execution when realized. Individual lawsuits (related to claims with unusual characteristics or involving significant amounts): These are periodically calculated based on the calculation of the amount claimed. Probability of loss which, in turn, is estimated in accordance with the actual and legal characteristics related to that lawsuit.

The programs permitted to regularize tax or other debts, with discounts on interest and fine amounts. f) Special Tax Regularization Program PERT In the federal levels, ITAÚ UNIBANCO conglomerate companies adhered to the Special Tax Regularization Program PERT, established by Law No. 13.496, of October 24, 2017, related to tax and social security debts management by the Federal Revenue Service and by the General Attorney’s Office of the National Treasury. Performance F-316 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Note 33 – Regulatory capital ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING is subject to regulation by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), which issues rules and instructions regarding currency and credit policies for financial institutions operating in Brazil. BACEN also determines minimum capital requirements, procedures for verification of information for assessment of the global systemic importance of financial institutions, limits for fixed assets, limits for loans, accounting practices and requirements of compulsory deposits, requiring banks to comply with the regulation based on the Basel Accord on capital adequacy. Additionally, the National Council of Private Insurance (CNSP) and SUSEP issue regulations on capital requirement, which affect our insurance, pension plan and capitalization operations. a) Capital Requirements in Place and In Progress ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING’s minimum capital requirements comply with the set of BACEN resolutions and circulars, which established in Brazil the global capital requirement standards known as Basel III. They are expressed as indices obtained from the ratio between available capital represented by Referential Equity (PR), or Total Capital, composed of Tier I Capital (which comprises Common Equity and Additional Tier I Capital) and Tier II Capital, and the Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA). The Total Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier I Capital ratios are calculated on a consolidated basis, applied to entities that are part of Prudential Conglomerate, which comprises not only financial institutions but also collective financing plans (“consórcios”), payment entities, factoring companies or companies that directly or indirectly assume credit risk, and investment funds in which ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING retains substantially all risks and rewards. For purposes of calculating these minimum capital requirements, the total RWA is determined as the sum of the risk weighted asset amounts for credit, market, and operational risks. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses the standardized approaches to calculate credit and operational risk-weighted asset amounts. As from September 1, 2016, BACEN authorized ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING to use market risk internal models to determine the total amount of regulatory capital (RWA MINT), replacing the RWAMPAD portion, as set forth in BACEN Circular 3,646. For foreign units, the standardized approach is adopted. Therefore, the internal models are not used for Argentina, Chile, Itaú BBA International, Itaú BBA Colombia, Paraguay, and Uruguay units. From January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the minimum capital ratio required is 9.25%, and, following the gradual decrease schedule, it will be 8% on January 1, 2019. In addition to minimum regulatory capital requirements, BACEN rules established the Additional Common Equity (ACP), corresponding to the sum of the portions of ACP Conservation, ACPCountercyclical and ACPSystemic, which, in conjunction with the above-mentioned requirements, increase the need for capital over time. The amounts of each one of the portions, as established by CMN Resolution 4,193, are shown in the table below. Basel III also reformulated the requirements for qualification of instruments eligible for Tier I and Tier II Capital, as regulated in Brazil by CMN Resolution 4,192. This reform includes a phase-out schedule for instruments already considered in capital, issued prior to the effectiveness of the rule, and that do not fully meet the new requirements. The table below shows the schedule for implementation of Basel III rules in Brazil, as established by BACEN, and the figures refer to the percentage of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING’s risk-weighted assets.

Furthermore, in the event of increase in ACP Countercyclical , the new percentage will be effective only twelve months after it is announced. Additionally, in March 2015, Circular BACEN 3,751, of March 19, 2015 came into force, it provides for the calculation of the relevant indicators for assessing the Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) of financial institutions in Brazil. Information on the values of the G-SIBs indicators, which are not part of its financial statements, can be found at www.itau.com.br/investor-relations, “Corporate Governance” section, “Global Systemically Important Banks”. In March 2017, Additional Common Equity Tier I Capital of systemic importance (ACP Systemic) went into effect, regulated by BACEN Circular 3,768, of October 29, 2015. The purpose of ACPSystemic is to reduce the probability of insolvency of an institution systemically important in the domestic level (D-SIB: Domestic Systemically Important Bank) and the impact on the stability of the financial system and economy. The calculation of ACPSystemic associates the system importance, represented by the institution’s total exposure, with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Further details on ACPSystemic, which are not part of the financial statements, can be viewed on the website www.itau.com.br/investor-relations, “Corporate Governance” / Risk and Capital Management – Pillar 3. The Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio between the Tier I Capital and Total Exposure, calculated as prescribed by BACEN Circular 3,748. The objective of this ratio is to be a simple, risk-insensitive leverage measure. Therefore, it does not take into consideration risk-weighting or mitigation factors. In line with the instructions set out in BACEN Circular 3,706, since October 2015, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has reported its Leverage Ratio to BACEN on a monthly basis. However, according to recommendations in Basel III Accord, a minimum Leverage Ratio should be required in 2018, which will be defined based on the period over which the ratio’s behavior was monitored, since its implementation in 2011 up to 2017. More information on the composition of the Leverage Ratio, which are not part of its financial statements, is available at www.itau.com.br/investors-relations, “Corporate Governance section/Risk and Capital Management – Pillar 3. b) Capital Management The Board of Directors is the main body in the management of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING’s capital and it is responsible for approving the institutional capital management policy and guidelines for the institution’s capitalization level. The Board is also responsible for fully approving the ICAAP report (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process), which is intended to assess the adequacy of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING’s capital. At the executive level, corporate bodies are responsible for approving risk assessment and capital calculation methodologies, as well as revising, monitoring and recommending capital-related documents and topics to the Board of Directors. In order to provide the Board of Directors with necessary information, management reports are prepared to inform on the institution’s capital adequacy, and the projections of capital levels under normal and stress situations. There is a structure that coordinates and consolidates related information and processes, all of them subject to verification by the independent validation, internal controls and audit areas. The “Public Access Report – Capital Management“, which are not part of its financial statements, which provides the guidelines established in the institutional capital management policy can be accessed at www.itau.com.br/investor-relations, under Corporate Governance, Regulations and Policies. Performance F-318 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 c) Risk appetite In 2016 ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING revisited its risk appetite policy, established and approved by the Board of Directors, which guides its business strategy. The institute’s risk appetite is based on the following statement issued by the Board of Directors: “We are a universal bank, operating mostly in Latin America. Supported by our risk culture, we operate within the highest ethical standards and regulatory compliance, seeking increasingly improved results, with low volatility, through an ongoing client relationship, accurate risk pricing, diversified funding and proper use of capital.” Based on this statement, defined five dimensions, each composed of a series of metrics associated with the main risks involved, by combining supplementary manners of measurement and seeking to reach a comprehensive vision of our exposures: • Capitalization: establishes that ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING must have capital sufficient to face any serious recession period or a stress event without the need to adjust its capital structure under unfavorable circumstances. It is monitored through the follow-up of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING’s capital ratios, both in normal and stress scenarios, and of the ratings of the institution's debt issues. • Liquidity: establishes that the institution’s liquidity must withstand long stress periods. It is monitored through the follow-up of liquidity ratios. • Composition of results: defines that business will be focused primarily in Latin America, where ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has a diversified base of clients and products, with low appetite for volatility of results and high risks. This dimension comprises aspects related to business and profitability, and market and credit risks. By adopting exposure concentration limits, such as industry sectors, counterparty quality, countries and geographical regions and risk factors, these monitored metrics seek to ensure the proper composition of our portfolios, aimed at the low volatility of results and business sustainability. • Operational risk: focuses on the control of operational risk events that may adversely impact the operation and business strategy, and is carried out by monitoring the main operational risk events and incurred losses. • Reputation: addresses risks that may impact the institution’s brand value and reputation with clients, employees, regulatory bodies, investors and the general public. The risk monitoring in this dimension is carried out by the follow-up of client satisfaction and dissatisfaction and media exposure, in addition to monitoring the institution’s conduct. The Board of Directors is responsible for approving risk appetite limits and guidelines, performing its duties with the support of the Risk and Capital Management Committee (CGRC) and the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). These metrics are monitored from time to time and must respect the defined limits. Monitoring is reported to the risk committees and the Board of Directors, and guides preventive measures to ensure that any exposures are within the limits established and in line with our strategy. d) Composition of capital The Referential Equity (PR) used to monitor compliance with the operational limits imposed by BACEN is the sum of three items, namely: Common Equity Tier I: the sum of capital, reserves and retained earnings, less deductions and prudential adjustments. Additional Tier I Capital: consists of instruments of a perpetual nature, which meet eligibility requirements. Together with Common Equity Tier I it makes up Tier I. Tier II: consists of subordinated debt instruments with defined maturity dates that meet eligibility requirements. Together with Common Equity Tier I and Additional Tier I Capital, makes up Total Capital.

These shares are recorded in line item “Treasury Shares”, which totaled R$ (2,743) as at December 31, 2017. Treasury shares reduce the institution´s Equity, causing its capital base to be decreased. In this period, the amount of dividends and interest on capital paid / accrued that affected the base of the institution’s capital totaled R$ 10,582. Dividends are deducted from the institution´s Equity, thus reducing the base of its capital. Whereas, interest on capital, which is accounted for as an expense directly in profit (loss), reduces the institution´s net income and, consequently, the base of its capital.

Adopting a prospective attitude to manage its capital, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING implemented its capital management structure and ICAAP, thus complying with CMN Resolution 3,988, BACEN Circular 3,547 and BACEN Circular Letter 3,774. The result of the last ICAAP – conducted as of December 2016 – indicated that, in addition to capital to face all material risks, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has significant capital surplus, thus assuring the institution’s equity soundness. g) Capital Adequacy ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, through the ICAAP, assesses the sufficiency of capital to face its risks, represented by regulatory capital for credit, market and operational risk and capital required to cover the other risks. In order to ensure the soundness of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING and the availability of capital to support business growth, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING maintains PR levels above the minimum level required to face risks, as evidenced by the Common Equity, Tier I Capital and Basel ratios.

The institution has conducted this test since 2010 aiming at assessing its solvency in plausible scenarios of a systemic crisis, as well as at identifying areas that are more susceptible to the impact of stress, and that can be subject to risk mitigation. Performance F-323 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 To perform the test, macroeconomic variables for each stress scenario are estimated by the economic research department. The scenarios are established considering their relevance to the bank’s result, and the probability of occurrence, and they are submitted to the approval of the Board of Directors on an annual basis. Projections of macroeconomic variables (GDP, benchmark interest rate and inflation) and of the credit market (fundraising, loans, default rate, spread and fees) for these scenarios are generated based on exogenous shocks or by using models validated by an independent area. These projections affect the budgeted result and balance sheet that then change the risk-weighted assets and capital and liquidity ratios. The stress test is also an integral part of ICAAP, with the main purpose of assessing whether, even in severe adverse conditions, the institution would have appropriate capital levels, not impacting the development of its activities. This information allows to identify potential factors of risks on businesses, supporting the Board of Directors’ strategic decisions, the budgetary process and discussions on credit granting policies, in addition to being used as input for risk appetite metrics. Performance F-324 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Note 34 – Segment Information ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING is a banking institution that offers its customers a wide range of financial products and services. The current operational and reporting segments of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING are described below: • Retail Banking The result of the Retail Banking segment arises from the offer of banking products and services to a diversified client base of account holders and non-account holders, individuals and companies. The segment includes retail clients, high net worth clients (Itaú Uniclass and Personnalité), and the corporate segment (very small and small companies). This segment comprises financing and lending activities carried out in units other than the branch network, and offering of credit cards, in addition to operations with Itaú Consignado. • Wholesale Banking The result of the Wholesale Banking segment arises from the products and services offered to middle-market companies, private banking clients, from the activities of Latin America units, and the activities of Itaú BBA, the unit in charge of commercial operations with large companies and performing as an investment banking unit. • Activities with the Market + Corporation This segment records the result arising from capital surplus, subordinated debt surplus and the net balance of tax credits and debits. It also shows the financial margin with the market, the Treasury operating cost, the equity in earnings of companies not associated to each segment and the interest in Porto Seguro. Basis of presentation of segment information Segment information is prepared based on the reports used by top management (Executive Committee) to assess the performance and to make decisions regarding the allocation of funds for investment and other purposes. The top management (Executive Committee) of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses a variety of information for such purposes including financial and non-financial information that is measured on different bases as well as information prepared based on accounting practices adopted in Brazil. The main index used to monitor the business performance is the Recurring Net Income and the Economic Capital allocated to each segment. The segment information has been prepared following accounting practices adopted in Brazil modified for the adjustments described below: • Allocated capital and income tax rate Based on the managerial income statement, the segment information considers the application of the following criteria: Allocated capital: The impacts associated to capital allocation are included in the financial information. Accordingly, adjustments were made to the financial statements, based on a proprietary model. The Allocated Economic Capital (AEC) model was adopted for the financial statements by segments, and as from 2015, we changed the calculation methodology. The AEC considers, in addition to Tier l allocated capital, the effects of the calculation of expected loan losses, supplementary to the requirements of the Central Bank of Brazil, pursuant to CMN Circular No. 2,682/99. Accordingly, the Allocated Capital comprises the following components: Credit risk (including expected loss), operational risk, market risk and insurance underwriting risk. Based on the portion of allocated capital tier I, we calculated the Return on Allocated Economic Capital, which corresponds to an operational performance indicator consistently adjusted to the capital required to support the risk associated to asset and liability positions assumed, in conformity with our risk appetite. Income tax rate: We consider the total income tax rate, net of the tax effect from the payment of interest on capital, for the Retail Banking, Wholesale Bank and Activities with the Market segments. The difference between the income tax amount calculated by segment and the effective income tax amount, as stated in the consolidated financial statements, is allocated to the Activities with the Market + Corporation column. Performance F-325 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 • Reclassification and application of managerial criteria The managerial statement of income was used to prepare information per segment. These statements were obtained based on the statement of income adjusted by the impact of non-recurring events and the managerial reclassifications in income. We describe below the main reclassifications between the accounting and managerial results: Banking product: The banking product considers the opportunity cost for each operation. The financial statements were adjusted so that the stockholders' equity was replaced by funding at market price. Subsequently, the financial statements were adjusted to include revenues related to capital allocated to each segment. The cost of subordinated debt and the respective remuneration at market price were proportionally allocated to the segments, based on the economic allocated capital. Hedge tax effects: The tax effects of the hedge of investments abroad were adjusted – these were originally recorded in the tax expenses (PIS and COFINS) and Income Tax and Social Contribution on net income lines – and are now reclassified to the margin. The strategy to manage the foreign exchange risk associated to the capital invested abroad aims at preventing the effects of the exchange rates variation on income. In order to achieve this objective, we used derivative instruments to hedge against such foreign currency risk, with investments remunerated in Brazilian Reais. The hedge strategy for foreign investments also considers the impact of all tax effects levied. Insurance: Insurance business revenues and expenses were concentrated in Income related to Insurance, pension plan and capitalization operations. The main reclassifications of revenues refer to the financial margins obtained with the technical provisions of insurance, pension plan and capitalization, in addition to revenue from management of pension plan funds. Other reclassifications: Other Income, Share of Income of Associates, Non-Operating Income, Profit Sharing of Management Members and Expenses for Credit Card Reward Program were reclassified to those lines representing the way the institution manages its business, enabling greater understanding for performance analysis. Accordingly, equity in earnings of investment in Banco CSF S.A. (“Banco Carrefour”) was reclassified to the financial margin line. The adjustments and reclassifications column shows the effects of the differences between the accounting principles followed for the presentation of segment information, which are substantially in line with the accounting practices adopted for financial institutions in Brazil, except as described above, and the policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements according to IFRS. Main adjustments are as follows: • Allowance for Loan Losses, which, under IFRS (IAS 39), should be recognized upon objective evidence that loan operations are impaired (incurred loss), and the Expected Loss concept is adopted according to Brazilian accounting standards; • Shares and units classified as permanent investments were stated at fair value under IFRS (IAS 39 and 32), and their gains and losses were directly recorded to Stockholders’ Equity, not passing through income for the period; • Effective interest rates, financial assets and liabilities stated at amortized cost, are recognized by the effective interest rate method, allocating revenues and costs directly attributable to acquisition, issue or disposal for the transaction period of the operation; according to Brazilian standards, fee expenses and income are recognized as these transactions are engaged; • Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method in IFRS (IFRS 3), in which the purchase price is allocated among assets and liabilities of the acquired company, and the amount not subject to allocation, if any, is recognized as goodwill. Such amount is not amortized, but is subject to an impairment test.

Credit risk measurement ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING understands credit risk is the possibility of losses arising from the breach by the borrower, issuer or counterparty of the respective agreed-upon financial obligations, the devaluation of loan agreement due to downgrading of the borrower’s, the issuer’s, the counterparty’s risk rating, the reduction in gains or compensation, the advantages given upon posterior renegotiation and the recovery costs. There is a credit risk control and management structure, centralized and independent from the business units, that provides for operational limits and risk mitigating mechanisms, in addition to establishing processes and tools to measure, monitor and control the credit risk inherent in all products, portfolio concentrations and impacts of potential changes in the economic environment. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING establishes its credit policy based on internal factors, such as client rating criteria, performance of and changes in portfolio, default levels, return rates, and allocated economic capital, among others, also considering external factors, such as interest rates, market default indicators, inflation, changes in consumption, among others. The continuous monitoring of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING’ portfolio concentration levels, assessing the economic industries and largest enables, allows to take preventive measures to avoid that the established limits are breached. The table below shows the correspondence between risk levels attributed by all segments of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING internal models (lower risk, satisfactory, higher risk and impaired) and the probability of default associated with each of these levels, and the risk levels assigned by the respective market models. External rating Internal rating PD Moody's S&P Fitch Lower risk Lower or equal than 4.44% Aaa to B2 AAA to B AAA to BSatisfactory From 4.44% up to 25.95% B3 to Caa3 Bto CCCCCC+ to CCCHigher risk Higher than 25.95% Ca1 to D CC+ to D CC+ to D Impairment Corporate operations with a PD higher than 31.84% Operations past due for over 90 days Ca1 to D CC+ to D CC+ to D Renegotiated operations past due for over 60 days For individual, small and middle-market companies, credit rating is attributed based on application statistical models (in the early phases of relationship with the client) and behavior score (used for clients with which ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING already has a relationship). For large companies, the rating is based on information such as economic and financial condition of the counterparty, their cash-generating capability, the economic group to which they belong, and the current and prospective situation of the economic sector in which they operate. The credit proposals are analyzed on a case by case basis, through an approval-level mechanism. In compliance with CMN Resolution 3,721, the document “Public Access Report – Credit Risk“, which includes the guidelines established by the institutional credit risk control policy can be viewed at www.itau.com.br/investor-relations, under Corporate Governance, Regulations and Policies. Performance F-333 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 2. Credit risk management ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING strictly controls the credit exposure of clients and counterparties, taking action to address situations in which the actual exposure exceeds the desired one. For this purpose, contractually provided actions can be taken, such as early settlement or requirement of additional collateral. 3. Collateral and policies for mitigating credit risk ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses collateral to increase its recovery capacity in transactions subject to credit risk. Collateral used may be personal security, secured guarantee, legal structures with mitigation power and offset agreements. For collateral to be considered instruments that mitigate credit risk, they must comply with the requirements and standards that regulate them, be them internal or external ones, be legally valid (effective), enforceable, and assessed on a regular basis. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING also uses credit derivatives, to mitigate credit risk of its portfolios of loans and securities. These instruments are priced based on models that use the fair value of market inputs, such as credit spreads, recovery rates, correlations and interest rates. 4. Policy on the provision The policies on the provision adopted by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING are aligned with the guidelines of IFRS and the Basel Accord. As a result, an allowance for loan losses is recognized when there are indications of the impairment of the portfolio and takes into account a horizon of loss appropriate for each type of transaction. We consider as impaired loans overdue for more than 90 days, renegotiated loans overdue by more than 60 days and Corporate loans below a specific internal rating. Loans are written-down 360 days after such loans become past due or 540 days of being past due in the case of loans with original maturities over 36 months. 5.

For assets recognized in the balance sheet, the exposures presented are based on net carrying amounts. This analysis includes only financial assets subject to credit risk and excludes non-financial assets. The contractual amounts of Financial Guarantees Provided and letters of credit represent the maximum potential of credit risk in the event the counterparty does not meet the terms of the agreement. The vast majority of commitments (real estate loans, overdraft accounts and other pre-approved limits) mature without being drawn, since they are renewed monthly and we have the power to cancel them at any time. As a result, the total contractual amount does not represent our effective future exposure to credit risk or the liquidity needs arising from such commitments. As shown in the table, the most significant exposures correspond to Loan Operations, Financial Assets Held for Trading, and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, in addition to Financial Guarantees Provided and Other Commitments. The maximum exposure to the quality of the financial assets presented highlights that: • 89.0% of loan operations and other financial assets exposure (Table 6.1 and 6.1.2) are categorized as low probability of default in accordance with our internal rating; • only 4.8% of the total loans exposure (Table 6.1) is represented by overdue credits not impaired; • 6.1% of the total loans exposure (Table 6.1) corresponds to overdue loans impaired. 5.1 Maximum exposure of financial assets segregated by business sector a) Loan operations and lease operations portfolio 12/31/2017 % 12/31/2016 % Public sector 2,366 0.5 3,051 0.6 Industry and commerce 106,620 21.6 112,067 22.8 Services 113,981 23.1 118,102 24.1 Natural resources 23,013 4.7 24,362 5.0 Other sectors 3,642 0.7 2,839 0.6 Individuals 243,745 49.4 229,945 46.9 Total 493,367 100.0 490,366 100.0 b) Other financial assets (*) 12/31/2017 % 12/31/2016 % Natural resources 2,836 0.4 2,466 0.4 Public sector 328,293 46.4 249,745 38.7 Industry and commerce 11,299 1.6 10,435 1.6 Services 85,431 12.1 2,741 0.4 Other sectors 5,141 0.7 93,165 14.4 Individuals 554 0.1 290 0.0 Financial 273,760 38.7 287,743 44.5 Total 707,314 100.0 646,585 100.0 (*) Includes financial assets held for trading, derivatives, assets designated at fair value through profit or loss, available-forsale financial assets, held-to-maturity financial assets, interbank deposits and securities purchased under agreements to resell. c) The credit risks of off balance sheet items (financial guarantees provided, letters of credit and commitments to be released) are not categorized or managed by business sector.

Thus, collateral is used to maximize the recoverability potential of impaired loans and not to reduce the exposure value of customers and counterparties. Individuals Personal – This category of credit products usually requires collateral, focusing on financial guarantees provided. Vehicles – For this type of operation, clients' assets serve as collateral, which are also the leased assets in leasing operations. Mortgage loans – Regards buildings themselves given in guarantee.

Repossessed assets Repossessed assets are recognized as assets when possession is effectively obtained. Assets received from the foreclosure of loans, including real estate, are initially recorded at the lower of: (i) the fair value of the asset less the estimated selling expenses, or (ii) the carrying amount of the loan. Further impairment of assets is recorded as a provision, with a corresponding charge to income. The maintenance costs of these assets are expensed as incurred. The policy for sales of these assets (assets not for use) includes periodic auctions that are announced in advance and considers that the assets cannot be held for more than one year as stipulated by the BACEN.

The purpose of market risk control of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING structure is: • Providing visibility and assurance to all executive levels that the assumption of market risks is in line with ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING and the risk-return objective; • Promoting a disciplined and informed discussion on the global risk profile and its evolution over time; • Increasing transparency on the way the business seeks to optimize results; • Providing early warning mechanisms in order to make the effective risk management easier, without jeopardizing the business purposes; and • Monitoring and avoiding risk concentration. The market risk is controlled by an area independent from the business areas, which is responsible for the daily activities of: (i) risk measurement and assessment, (ii) monitoring of stress scenarios, limits and warnings, (iii) application, analysis and tests of stress scenarios, (iv) risk reporting for individuals responsible within the business areas, in compliance with governance of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING, (v) monitoring of actions required for adjustment of positions and/or risk levels to make them feasible, and (vi) support to the launch of new financial products with security. The CMN has regulations that establish the segregation of exposure to market risk in risk factors, such as interest rate, exchange rate, shares and commodities. Brazilian inflation indexes are also treated as a group of risk factors and follow the same governance structure of limits. The limit and warning structure is aligned with the Board of Directors’ structure, and it is reviewed and approved on an annual basis. This structure has specific limits that aim at improvement the monitoring process and understanding of risks, as well as avoid their concentration. These limits are quantified by assessing the forecasted results of the balance sheet, size of stockholders’ equity, liquidity, market complexity and volatility, as well as the institution’s appetite for risk. Aiming at adjusting risks to the established limits, ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING hedges transactions with clients and proprietary positions, including foreign investments. Derivatives are the instruments most frequently used to carry out these hedge activities, and they may be characterized as accounting or economic hedge, both governed by the internal policies at ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING. For a detailed vision of the accounting hedge topic, see Note 9 – Accounting Hedge. Market risk management follows the segregation of operations in Trading Portfolio and Banking Portfolio, pursuant to the general criteria set forth in CMN Resolution No. 3,464, and BACEN Circular No. 3,354. The trading portfolio consists of all transactions involving financial instruments and commodities, including derivatives, which are carried out for trading purposes. The banking portfolio is mainly characterized by the operations arising from banking activities and related to the management of the institutions’ balance sheet, conducted with no intent of trading and with a horizon of time of medium and long terms. Market risk management is conducted based on the following metrics: Performance F-341 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 • Value at risk (VaR): statistical measure that estimates the expected maximum potential economic loss under normal market conditions, considering a certain time horizon and confidence level; • Losses in stress scenarios: simulation technique to assess the behavior of assets, liabilities and derivatives of a portfolio when several risk factors are taken to extreme market situations (based on prospective and historical scenarios); • Stop loss: metrics which purpose is to review positions, should losses accumulated in a certain period reach a certain amount; • Concentration: cumulative exposure of a certain financial instrument or risk factor, calculated at market value (“MtM – Mark to Market”); and • Stressed VaR: statistical metric arising from VaR calculation, which purpose is to capture higher risk in simulations for the trading portfolio, considering returns that can be seen in historical scenarios of extreme volatility. In addition to the aforementioned risk measures, sensitivity and loss control measures are also analyzed. They comprise: • Mismatching analysis (GAPS): accumulated exposure by risk factor of cash flows expressed at market value, allocated at the maturity dates; • Sensitivity (DV01Delta Variation): impact on the market value of cash flows, when submitted to an one annual basis point increase in the current interest rates or index rate; • Sensitivity to several risk factors (Greeks): partial derivatives of an option portfolio in relation to the prices of underlying assets, implied volatilities, interest rates and time. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING uses proprietary systems to measure the consolidated market risk. The processing of these systems occur, in an access-controlled environment, being highly available, which has data safekeeping and recovery processes, and counts on such an infrastructure to ensure the continuity of business in contingency (disaster recovery) situations. The document that details the guidelines established by the internal policy on market risk management, that is not part of the financial statements, may be viewed on the website www.itau.com.br/investor-relations, in the section Corporate Governance/Rules and Policies / Public Access Report – Market Risk. VaR Consolidated ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING Consolidated VaR of Itaú Unibanco is calculated by Historical Simulation, i.e., the expected distribution for profit and loss (P&L’s Profit and loss statement) of a portfolio over a time horizon that can be estimated based on the historical behavior of returns of market risk factors of this portfolio. VaR is calculated at a confidence level of 99%, historical period of 4 years (1000 business days) and a holding period of one day. In addition, in a conservative approach, VaR is calculated daily, being or not volatility-weighted, and the final VaR is the most restrictive value between both methodologies. From January 1 to December 31, 2017, the average total VaR in Historical Simulation was R$ 409.9, or 0.28% of total stockholders’ equity (throughout 2016 it was R$ 236.6 or 0.18% of total stockholders’ equity).

Performance F-344 Context Our profile Our governance Our governance Sustainability Attachments Annual Report 2017 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the possibility of the institution not being able to efficiently honor its expected and unexpected, current and future obligations, including those arising from guarantee binding, without affecting its daily operations and not incurring in significant losses. Policies and procedures Liquidity risk control is performed by an area independent of the business areas and is responsible for determining the composition of the reserve; proposing assumptions for the behavior of cash flow; identifying, assessing, monitoring, controlling and reporting, on a daily basis, the exposure to liquidity risk in different time horizons; proposing and monitoring liquidity risk limits consistent with the institution’s appetite for risk, reporting possible mismatches; considering the liquidity risk individually in the countries where ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING operates; simulating the behavior of cash flow under stress conditions; assessing and reporting in advance the risks inherent in new products and transactions, and reporting the information required regulatory bodies. All activities are subject to checking by validation, internal control and audit independent areas. The measurement of liquidity risk covers all financial transactions of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING companies, as well as possible contingent or unexpected exposures, such as those arising from settlement services, provision of collaterals and guarantees, and credit facilities contracted and not used. This process is conducted by means of corporate systems and proprietary applications developed and managed in-house. The liquidity management policies and respective limits are established based on prospective scenarios and top management’s guidelines. These scenarios are reviewed on a periodic basis, by analyzing the need for cash due to atypical market conditions or resulting from strategic decisions of ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING. The document that details the guidelines established by the internal policy on liquidity risk management, that is not part of the financial statements, may be viewed on the website www.itau.com.br/investor-relations, in the section Corporate Governance/Rules and Policies / Public Access Report – Liquidity Risk. ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING conducts the control over and management of liquidity risk on a daily basis, through a governance approved in superior committees, which sets forth, among other activities, the adoption of liquidity minimum limits, sufficient to absorb possible cash losses in stress scenarios, measured through internal and regulatory methodologies. Additionally, and in compliance with the requirements of CMN Resolution No. 4,090 of May 24, 2012 and BACEN Circular N° 3,749 of March 5, 2015 , the Statement of Liquidity Risk (DRL) is sent to BACEN on a monthly basis, and the following items for monitoring and supporting decisions are periodically prepared and submitted to top management: • Different scenarios projected for changes in liquidity; • Contingency plans for crisis situations; • Reports and charts that describe the risk positions; • Assessment of funding costs and alternative sources of funding; • Monitoring of changes in funding through a constant control over sources of funding, considering the type of investor and maturities, among other factors. In compliance with BACEN Circular Letter 3.775, of July 14, 2016, banks holding total assets over R$ 100 billion are required, since October 2015, to report a standardized Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) ratio to the Central Bank of Brazil, which is reported on a consolidated basis for institutions that are part of the Prudential Conglomerate. This ratio is calculated based on a methodology defined by the Central Bank of Brazil itself, and is in line with international guidelines of Basel. The summarized index calculation is presented in the table below. In 2017, the index minimum requirement is 80%. Further details on the LCR for the period may be accessed at www.itau.com.br/investor-relations, section Corporate Governance/ Capital and Risk Management Pillar 3.

Primary sources of funding ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING has different sources of funding, of which a significant portion is from the retail segment. Total funding from clients reached R$ 622,1 billion (R$ 612.7 billion at 12/31/2016), particularly funding from time deposits. A considerable portion of these funds – 36.6% of total, or R$ 277.5 billion – is available on demand to the client.

In addition to the classic Photo-voltaic panel technology, aimed towards a dedicated system to convert solar into electric energy, we seek other technologies that may be integrated into spaces, constructions, and facades, and therefore be used in Itaú’s other projects. These technologies use as base Organic Photovoltaics (OPV), a thin, light, and flexible model, with different transparency levels and highly customized, able to generate electric energy from the sunlight. These three projects will have a capacity to generate approximately 31,500 kWh/year, and represent just the first step for the practical use of these technologies at Itaú, which will guide us to expand operations the coming years.

It means that ways to bring together economic the stakeholders relations – “Workers relations”, “Community development and the protection of the climate system have relations”, “Client relations” and “Supplier relations” –, and four increasingly been sought after. The financial sector may have related to environmental dimensions – “Water, energy and a leading role in the transition to the low-carbon economy, materials”, “Biodiversity and land use”, “Waste management”, since it has the choice to direct investments and financing and “Climate change”. The method we apply here is a cut-off to less intensive carbon activities. Therefore, we go through from this analysis, focused on climate change impacts. constant learning, take part in internal and external forums, and develop projects and studies aligned with new trends. All In general, this method consists of including environmental of this enables us to foster the best practices and mitigate a and social variables in traditional valuation approaches number of risks we identify in the way. by analyzing their impact on the companies’ cash flows over time. This process consists of a stage for research and development of sector scenarios followed by another stage for valuing impacts on companies, taking into account their idiosyncrasies and management capacity.
