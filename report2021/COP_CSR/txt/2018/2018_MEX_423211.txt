Our operating margin remains close to 80% and our gross leasable area now stands at 8.4 million square meters, with a consolidated total occupancy rate of 94.3%. I’d like to point out that the sale of the Celaya property shows how we view the disposal of assets in this phase of our Portfolio’s development.

These are significant milestones, turbulent waters we were called upon to navigate because we at FUNO have always devoted a substantial amount of resources during the past year. to developing new properties. This benefits us with a higher return on invested capital, but “costs” us in the sense of having capital locked away in investments that do not generate flows in the early years of investment. 7 8 FUNO / 2017 Annual and Sustainability Report We added some new projects to our Development Portfolio, like retail sites in MESSAGE FROM THE DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Guanajuato and Tapachula, which we received with the Turbo Portfolio, and the 102-14, 102-15 Escato industrial project, which is part of the Frimax Portfolio, and we have already begun development of La Isla II in Cancun.

In most cases, especially in those where our properties are under development, we carry out mitigation and infrastructure improvement programs. GRI 413: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 Some examples of this are: 413-1, 413-2 In Mexico today, it is an undeniable reality that shopping malls play a fundamental role in community relations, and have come to replace the town square or central Twelve of our plaza as a place for gathering and leisure activities. shopping centers were in the top 20 of FUNO has analyzed the communities where we operate and have identified two main stakeholder groups: the Digital Marketing ■■Visitors, those who come to our buildings and contribute to our tenants’ revenues. benchmarking 2017 ■■Neighbors, who are directly affected by our buildings, either positively or negatively. For this reason, effective communication with visitors, neighbors and tenants is a highly important commitment. To this end, we conduct regular visits, surveys, monthly audits and interest-monitoring, in order to gather the information we need to understand their preferences and meet their expectations. Furthermore, today, social networks play a key role in the trust’s communication with the world around it, and are a crucial mechanisms for understanding FUNO’s position in the market. We participate in a Digital Marketing benchmarking study, which in 2017 encompassed 56 shopping centers, among which were 33 of our properties; 12 of FUNO’s buildings were in the top 20. Through these channels of communication –particularly through surveys– we have found that one of the most important issues for communities is security. This is a matter that lies outside of our building operations, but we are clearly responsible for dealing with it in the areas surrounding our properties. We have therefore taken steps to guarantee this: security and civil defense protocols, manuals, and policies, and hiring private security firms. 97 Galerias Diana, Acapulco FUNO / 2017 Annual and Sustainability Report CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT Mitikah Patio Tlalpan Drainage Water Topographic survey and master plans for wastewater treatment in Drilling and equipping a well. remediation works.
