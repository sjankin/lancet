Shaw Floors, Bellera, Outside the Lines 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Dear Stakeholders, 2017 was a positive year for Shaw, as we continued to accelerate the evolution of our company. We are on track to further advance our strategic direction in 2018. As our product mix continued to evolve to meet market demands, we placed even more emphasis on innovation and investment in our people and processes. We are honored to be among Forbes Magazine’s 2018 list of America’s Best Large Employers. Our robust talent management strategy supports our associates in achieving their full potential. It helps us foster a culture that spurs innovation by leveraging market insights, diverse experiences and perspectives and collaborative approaches. All of this is aimed at creating a better future for our customers, associates, communities and the company. In addition to investing in our people, Shaw has invested in the expansion of our capabilities including: • Modernization of plants in Andalusia, Ala. and Decatur, Tenn. focused on key components of our carpet manufacturing; • Expansion of capabilities at our Ringgold, Ga., resilient / LVT manufacturing facility; • Investments in our logistics and distribution network from Savannah, Ga., to Elkhart, Ind., and Portland, Ore., to ensure superb service; • Completion of our Create Centre in Cartersville, Ga., home to our commercial division’s marketing, design and innovation associates; • Acquisitions of: — USFloors -the fastest growing composite core supplier in late 2016; — Tricycle -a technology innovator supporting commercial interiors sampling and design in late 2017; and — STS -a Scotland-based carpet tile manufacturer in early 2018. As we continue to grow and work to ensure that our people thrive and our processes evolve, Shaw’s dedication to Cradle to Cradle design philosophies is unwavering. Cradle to Cradle guides us with even greater focus on human health and well-being as the sustainability landscape continues to evolve. Our new sustainable sourcing policy emphasizes chemical management and aligns with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. Shaw became a signatory in 2017 to this widely-recognized set of principles focused on upholding and protecting human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption standards. These measures hold our suppliers to the same high standards we set for ourselves, regardless of where or by whom a product is manufactured or ingredients are sourced. We are proud to have achieved carbon neutrality in our commercial carpet manufacturing operations and opened a combined heat and power facility in Columbia, S.C., in the first half of 2018 as we continue to reduce our carbon and energy impact throughout the company. As with all innovation, we have seen both success and failure along the way. But we remain steadfast in our dedication to creating a better future. Sincerely, Vance D. Bell Chairman and CEO Vance D.

It clears my head, allows me to enjoy the beautiful surroundings of north Georgia and helps keep me healthy. But, like so many others, I spend the vast majority of my time indoors. In fact, according to research, people spend an average of 90 percent of our time inside. That means we need to ensure our indoor environments are safe, healthy and supportive. The spaces in which we live, work, play, learn and heal have a huge impact on our lives. Their design – as well as the products that go into them – play an important role in how we function every day, the quality of our interaction with others and our physical comfort and health. Are these spaces noisy and chaotic or comfortable and calming? Do they encourage collaboration and allow innovation to flourish? Do they irritate our senses or promote and restore healthy life choices? At Shaw, we fundamentally believe that everyone should have access to safe, sustainable products for their homes and workspaces. We’re proud that 88 percent of the products we manufacture are Cradle to Cradle Certified. Our products adhere to a rigorous methodology for assessing material health, based on understanding and evaluating the ingredients that go into our products whether made by Shaw or others. It’s codified in our new sustainable sourcing policy. Our products are at the heart of places where countless life moments happen – where thinkers innovate, students learn, patients heal and champions are made. Our view of sustainability encompasses not only the environmental health of our products and our operations, but also how our products impact human health. We use that lens whether we’re looking at water, waste, material health or carbon and energy. Let’s face it, the Earth is fairly resilient. But what quality of life can we help create for the people living on it? Big or small, near or far, we work to positively impact the communities where we operate, where our associates and customers work and live. Beyond our focus on the quality and impact of our products, we are committed to helping our associates thrive. We work every day to foster a culture that respects and values diverse perspectives in which we can achieve our fullest potential as individuals and as a global company. Our effort matters, because people matter. I invite you to learn more about Shaw’s approach to sustainability and how we’re fulfilling our vision to create a better future through the pages of this year’s report.

Sustainability is an engine for innovation at Shaw. We continually improve our processes and production and design beautiful, sustainable surfaces to contribute to beautiful, impactful lives.
