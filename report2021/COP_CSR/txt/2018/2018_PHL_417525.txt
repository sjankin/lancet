The improving trajectory for the global economy continued in 2017, with a recovery in trade, investment, and manufacturing recorded in a majority of economies across the world. However, economists cited the need for productivity-enhancing structural reforms in both advanced and developing economies to sustain this level of growth. Aging populations, most evident in advanced economies, are expected to depress the expansion of employment. In the case of developing economies, the challenge lies in improving physical infrastructure and human capital, aggravated by the fast pace at which disruptive technologies are changing the business landscape. INTO THE FUTURE 21 Strong domestic consumption, continued investor confidence, and the government’s aggressive infrastructure plan have created significant potential for sustained growth. In ASEAN, despite worries of a have emerged as a result of rising slowdown brought about by commodity prices arising from higher protectionist initiatives in the US and global energy prices and a weaker geopolitical tensions in the Asiapeso.

INTO THE FUTURE 25 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT Fellow shareholders, Underpinned by the strong fundamental drivers of our economy that continued to be in place, we are pleased to report that 2017 was another year of strong earnings growth. The aggressive growth agenda we embarked on several years ago bolstered the sixth year of Ayala’s strong performance. Our net profit climbed 16 percent to P30.3 billion, boosted by the solid performance of our real estate and power units. This sustained earnings momentum validates our long-term growth strategy, which is largely focused on expanding into new markets and customer segments, diversifying geographically, strengthening our core markets, and entering new businesses to create a platform for future growth. This brings us closer to our strategic aspirations for 2020. On our profitability targets, we ended the year with a return on common equity of 13.2 percent against our target of 15 percent for 2020. Our diversification strategy is also increasingly coming to fruition. Our emerging businesses, primarily AC Energy and AC Industrials, contributed 16 percent to our equity earnings in 2017, versus our target of 20 percent at the end of the decade. Meanwhile, international platforms contributed 7 percent to our equity earnings during the year, against our goal of 10 percent in 2020. 26 2017 Ayala Corporation Integrated Report INTO THE FUTURE 27 percent of its service revenues in 2017, which reached P127.9 billion, six percent higher from a year ago.

INTO THE FUTURE 61 MATERIALITY (102-29) Ayala has a varied range of material factors for each of its businesses. Guided by the GRI framework on defining material topics and processes, we undertook a collaborative review with the different business units to determine their material factors, taking into consideration the various stakeholders of the group and local and global sustainable development challenges. Further identification of external factors that affect Ayala’s operations allowed us to identify the possible risks and opportunities per material factor. The following table depicts our materiality process based on the GRI Standards: Core Option. DEFINING OUR MATERIAL FACTORS AND BOUNDARIES Steps and Governing Principles Our Process Identification As Ayala supports the country’s growth through its core businesses and Sustainability Context contributes to the progress of emerging industries, we reviewed local and global sustainability topics relevant to the group and in alignment with the UN SDGs. We worked with each company to align and identify the material factors related to their respective businesses, ensuring that the aspect boundaries are defined. We used our existing stakeholder engagement channels to understand our Stakeholder Inclusiveness stakeholders’ areas of concern. Prioritization We prioritized key material factors based on the extent that these affect our Materiality and Stakeholder Inclusiveness businesses, stakeholders, and the sustainable development of the country. Validation We considered stakeholder interests and concerns vis-à-vis our list of material Completeness and Stakeholder Inclusiveness aspects and identified topics. Review We analyzed three-year data to determine our businesses’ performance in Sustainability Context and Stakeholder Inclusiveness identified factors and qualified areas for improvement and the respective management approaches employed. We also reviewed their relevance to our overall sustainability performance, to help improve our list of material factors for the next reporting cycle. Materiality roadshows were conducted across business units to help them identify their material factors. 62 2017 Ayala Corporation Integrated Report IDENTIFYING OUR MATERIAL FACTORS Ayala conducts its businesses in an ethical manner and contributes to the SDGs through our shared value creation process. Part of this is the commitment to continue managing our key economic, social and environmental impacts. We established our materiality matrix in 2013, and since then, periodically review and assess our material factors. In 2017, we took a deeper look at our sustainability indicators. Acknowledging that economic, environmental and social aspects of our businesses have varying metrics and level of impact, we used fundamental questions to further identify our material factors. Economic We look at our economic performance based on how much value our companies contribute to society. Our direct contributions are material because they come from the economic value we generate and distribute to our stakeholders, as well as the foreign and domestic investments we have enabled. To further understand the breadth and depth of our economic efforts and performance, we also looked into our indirect contributions.

This assurance engagement was planned and carried out using DNV GL’s assurance methodology VeriSustainTM1 (Version 5.0) which is based on our professional experience, international assurance best practice including the International Standard on Assurance Engagement 3000 (ISAE3000) Revised2 and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. Scope of Assurance The scope of assurance included a review of sustainability disclosures and performance data from Ayala Corp. and its business units in the Philippines. The boundary of the Report for identified material topics and topic-specific disclosures are set out in ‘About this report’ section, the respective chapters and Materiality section. We evaluated the Report for adherence to the reporting principles for defining the sustainability report content as set forth in the GRI Standards and the guiding principles in the International <IR> Framework (“<IR> Framework”). We understand that the reported financial data and information are based on Ayala Corp.’s and respective business units’ financial statements, which are subject to a separate independent audit process. The review of financial data taken from the Financial statements is not within the scope of our work. Responsibilities of Ayala Corp. and of the assurance provider The Board of Ayala Corp. has sole responsibility for the integrity of the Report. The responsibility includes designing, implementing, and maintaining internal controls over collection, analysis, aggregation and preparation, fair presentation of the information, and data that are free from material misstatement including maintenance of integrity of their website. In performing our assurance work, our responsibility is solely towards the management of Ayala Corp. in accordance with the terms of reference agreed on with Ayala Corp., however our statement represents our independent opinion and is intended to inform Ayala Corp.’s stakeholders. DNV GL’s responsibility is to form an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. DNV GL is responsible for planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the selected information is free from material misstatement and meets the disclosure requirements. Basis of our opinion To test the reliability of data and the robustness of the data aggregation process including related management approach for identified material topics, a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed the work at Ayala Corp.’s headquarters (in Makati City) and its business units in the Philippines, from February to March 2018. As part of the verification, we planned and performed our work based on DNV GL’s Risk Based Approach to obtain the evidence that we considered necessary to provide a basis for our assurance opinion. Within the framework of our assessment, we performed the following procedures and other activities including; 1 The VeriSustain protocol is available on request from www.dnvgl.com. 2 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information AS-PRJC-576876-2018-AST-PHL INTO THE FUTURE 189 • conducted interview with data owners from Ayala Corp. and its business units including Ayala Land, Inc., Manila Water Company, Inc., Globe Telecom, Inc. and Integrated Micro-Electronics Inc., Bank of the Philippine Islands, AC Infrastructure Holdings Corporation, AC Automotive Holdings Corporation, AC Energy Holdings, Inc., AC Health, AC Education and Ayala Foundation to understand the key processes and controls for reporting business units’ performance data; • assessed the robustness of the underlying data and information flow and controls; • performed data analysis using a risk-based approach and materiality; and • challenged the sustainability-related disclosure, statements and claims; • performed limited testing on a sampling basis of the selected information at corporate Headquarters, at business units’ Headquarters and at facilities operated by business units to check that the selected environmental and social data had been properly measured, gathered, recorded, collated and reported. We also performed the following activities to assess the adherence to reporting principles; • interviewed senior managers and representatives responsible for sustainability management and made enquiries to determine their understanding of stakeholder engagement and materiality; • reviewed the current sustainability issues that could affect Ayala Corp. and could be of interest of stakeholders. Conclusion Based on the work undertaken, we provide a limited level of assurance over non-financial disclosure presented in Ayala Corp.’s 2017 Integrated Report i.e. nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the reported data and information disclosed in the Report does not give a fair representation of Ayala Corp.’s related sustainability performance. Without affecting our assurance opinion, we also provide the following observations regarding the adherence to the reporting principles for defining the sustainability report content and for defining report quality as defined in the GRI Standards and the guiding principles in <IR> Framework; Stakeholder Inclusiveness (GRI), Stakeholder relationships (<IR> Framework) Ayala Corp. has identified key internal and external stakeholder groups including Investors and Shareholders, Creditors, Investment Community, Government agencies and regulators, Employees, Customers, Industry Association, Media, Communities, NGOs and Civil Societies. Ayala Corp. engages with the stakeholders at the Conglomerate and business units levels through various channels to identify sustainability concerns and expectations. The Report discloses how Ayala Group engages with stakeholders, what are their concerns with relevant material topics and how Ayala Group responds. Sustainability Context (GRI) The Report presents Ayala Corp.’s non-financial performance in the wide context of sustainability. Ayala Corp. commits to creating shared value and improving the impact on society and the environment in its Sustainability philosophy and updated 360° Sustainability framework. The Report explains how Ayala Corp. and its business units have created shared value with its core businesses and how various initiatives are aligned with achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Materiality (GRI, <IR> Framework) Ayala Corp. established a materiality matrix in 2013 and has revisited its material topics in 2017 through group-wide materiality workshop and roadshows to business units. The Sustainability representatives from each Ayala business unit , together with senior management and data holders, participated in the workshop and roadshow to identify material topics and business outputs for Ayala Corp. and the a Group as well as to validate the list of material topics at the business unit level. A detailed materiality assessment process is addressed in the Report and Ayala Corp. provides a matrix of mapping material topics and enterprise risks in the materiality section of the Report. Reliability and Completeness (GRI, <IR> Framework) AS-PRJC-576876-2018-AST-PHL 190 2017 Ayala Corporation Integrated Report The Report has fairly attempted to disclose material topics and relevant topic-specific disclosures. Ayala Corp. has selected, compiled and reported information in a relatively consistent manner. The presentation within the Report enables stakeholders to analyze changes in the sustainability performance over time. Data owners could demonstrate the origin and interpretation of the data in a reliable manner. The Report covers global sustainability disclosures of Ayala Group for the identified material topics. Strategic focus and future orientation (<IR> Framework) Risk description, potential impact, and corresponding control/mitigation measures addressed in ‘Risk management’ provides insight into Ayala group’s strategy on risk management. The Report shows the value chain maps of each business unit with six (6) capitals, key activities in the value chain, outputs and targets. The Report also presents how its capitals are managed and its future strategy. Connectivity of information (<IR> Framework) The business models of Ayala Corp. and its business units describe the unique portfolio of businesses and the connection with the respective business units’ roles and contribution to create the values in their unique value chain. Past and current capability of Ayala Corp. and its business units are presented in terms of six (6) capitals and performances. Narrative and quantitative information in the Report represents the Ayala Group’s ability on creating values. The Report also provides the connection to references in relevant websites. Conciseness (<IR> Framework) Considering the principle of conciseness, infographics and graphs are appropriately used to convey information. The Report clearly addresses stakeholder engagement results and materiality of Ayala Corporation. Relevant information on sustainability performance and prospects are presented in a simple and succinct manner. Consistency and Comparability (GRI and <IR> Framework) Ayala Corp. has applied a consistent process to select, compile and report the selected information across the business units. The Report in general presents its performance over time so that the reader can analyse changes and compare the performances. Balance (GRI and <IR> Framework) In our opinion, the tone in the Report is generally neutral and with no obvious and deliberate intent to unduly influence the stakeholders. Accuracy (GRI) The data measurement techniques and basis for calculations have been duly described to us and can be replicated with same results. We have evaluated the accuracy of the selected data and information by sampling. Any errors or misstatements identified during the engagement were communicated for correction prior to the Report being published. Certain restatements are provided to changes in historical disclosure. Ayala Corp. has rolled out data collection portal which enables data collection process faster and easier and reduces risk of human error during collating, compiling and computing process, however some historical activity data provided by respective business units were found not accurate, which causes restatement of disclosures. Ayala Corp. together with its business units could establish robust internal check process to improve the quality and integrity of data. Any errors or misstatements identified during the assurance engagement were communicated for correction prior to the Report being published. Timeliness (GRI) Ayala Corp. is committed to disclose its sustainability performance on annual basis and this is the second Integrated Report from Ayala Corp. reporting its sustainability performance in the annual integrated report. Clarity (GRI) AS-PRJC-576876-2018-AST-PHL INTO THE FUTURE 191 The information is presented in the Report in a simple and logical manner and consolidated non-financial data tables help to make the information understandable. All the information in this report will be made available to stakeholders through printed hard copies and pdf soft copies which will be made accessible through the Ayala Corporation website. Limitation Our assurance relies on the premise that the data and information provided by Ayala Corp. to us as part of our review procedures have been provided in good faith and free from misstatements. Because of the selected nature (sampling) and other inherent limitation of both procedures and systems of internal control, there remains the unavoidable risk that errors or irregularities, possibly significant, may not have been detected. The engagement excludes the sustainability management, performance and reporting practices of Ayala Corp.’s associated companies, suppliers, contractors and any third-parties mentioned in the Report. The company position statements, the statements for the management approach, and case studies and examples are excluded from the scope of our work. We did not interview external stakeholders as part of this assurance engagement. The reported disclosures related to Economic performances are based on the financial disclosures and data, which were cross-checked with internal documents and the audited consolidated financial statements. Limited depth of evidence gathering including inquiry and analytical procedures and limited sampling at lower levels in the organization were applied as per agreed scope of engagement. The baseline data for Environmental and Social performance are verified with samples randomly taken by and the aggregated data at the corporate level are used for the verification. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained if a reasonable assurance engagement had been performed. We expressly disclaim any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this Assurance Statement. Statement of Competence and Independence DNV GL applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17021:2011 Conformity Assessment Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied with the DNV GL Code of Conduct3 during the assurance engagement and maintain independence where required by relevant ethical requirements. This engagement work was carried out by an independent team of sustainability assurance professionals. DNV GL was not involved in the preparation of any statements or data included in the Report except for this Assurance Statement. DNV GL maintains complete impartiality toward stakeholders interviewed during the assurance process. DNV GL has provided assurance to Ayala Land, Inc., Globe Telecom, Inc and Manila Water which are business units of Ayala Corp. In our opinion, there is no conflict of interest in the assurance engagement provided to the business units. DNV GL did not provide any services to Ayala Corp. during 2017 that could compromise the independence or impartiality of our work.
