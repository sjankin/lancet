PURPOSE The United Nations (UN) Global Compact is a strategic initiative for businesses that are committed to corporate sustainability and who work to align their operations and strategies to the ten universally accepted UNGC principles. Automotive Management Services (AMS) has partnered with the United Nations through our expression of commitment to these principles and by the integration of these into our corporate culture and daily operations. AMS requires its employees, within their area of influence, to adopt core values/principles in the areas of Human Rights, Labour Standards, the Environment and Anti-Corruption. 2.

STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) To our stakeholders, Automotive Management Services (AMS) continues our commitment to support the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. In our capacity as global providers of resilient, cost-effective mission support solutions for governments and defence sector clients operating in high-risk locations, AMS aims to support and respect the protection of human rights within the Company’s scope of influence, and endeavours to conduct our business operations accordingly.

Our reputation for integrity is central to achieving our commercial goals and leverages all we do to fulfil our corporate and social responsibilities. At AMS our is an essential value we are devoted to protect and strengthen. We therefore expect every AMS employee to uphold high professional and ethical standards in all business conduct. Our 2018 Communication on Progress will validate our continual support of the Ten Principles. These principles continue to play an important role at AMS and uphold our promise to further integrate the United Nations Global Compact Principles into our corporate strategy, culture and daily operations. Over the course of 2017 all polices were audited and enhanced to ensure compliance and clear guidelines for employees, contractors, consultants and suppliers We pledge to: • Live the Global Compact principles. • Collaborate more. • Become a corporate statesman. • Be an ambassador for change. Yours sincerely, Andrew Robertson Chief Executive Officer Automotive Management Services Title: AMS UNGC COP Document No / Revision No: Original Issue Date: Revise Issue Date: Page 4 of 11 DHOHR-PL-015/ 1.0 2018-02-14 3.2. HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses 3.2.1. Corporate Policy and Goals As a leading fleet management solutions provider operating in austere environments we feel it is our duty to promote human rights in every aspect of our business. We have adopted and aligned our approach towards human rights to the United Nations Guiding Principles for Human Rights. Our company policies are based on many human and labour rights building blocks that are based on the following international standards: • Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) • International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) • International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) • International Labour Organization Declarations & Conventions on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work AMS issues all employees with an Employee Handbook as well as corporate policies which promote and protect the rights of our employees as well as other individuals within our range of impact. These actions include but are not limited to: • Education and training of employees through an awareness induction; the aim of which is to enable employees to identify human trafficking and to understand the ramifications thereof • Prevention mechanisms are implemented through ensuring every employee understand and signs the Combatting Trafficking in Person (CTIPs) declaration, showing the company stance of zero tolerance for all activities relating to human rights atrocities and human trafficking. • AMS ensures that all employees are provided adequate employee living conditions, commensurate with the minimum country guidelines surrounding accommodation 3.2.1.1. Risk Assessment AMS uses Maplecroft’s Human Rights Risk Atlas, and / or other tools like this, to assess, quantify and compare human rights risks and responsibilities for our global operations. The table below outlines our countries of operation as well as their associated risk ratings: Country of Operation Human Rights Risk Rating Afghanistan Extreme Somalia Extreme United Arab Emirates High Kazakhstan High Liberia High USA Medium United Kingdom Low The said Human Rights Risk clearly illustrates that the majority of our operations and human capital continue to be based in countries associated with a high to extreme human rights related risk. This magnifies the importance of a corporate commitment towards Human Rights.

Measurement The AMS Compliance Department conducts regular audits throughout the organization to ensure compliance with these policies and to confirm that business practice respects and promotes fundamental human rights. Violations detected through these audits were minimal and addressed appropriately. The reporting year can be closed with no outstanding corrective actions. 3.3. LABOUR PRINCIPLES Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation 3.3.1. Corporate Policy and Goals AMS respects and supports the values of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The commitment is shown by integrating its four fundamental principles into our corporate Human Rights awareness and standard business practice on a global scale. These four fundamental principles are aligned with the United Nations Global Compact principles on Labour. AMS issues all employees with an Employee Handbook as well as corporate policies which are aimed at promoting, respecting and realizing the ILO Four Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. These details are outlined in the employee handbook and held within many of our Company policies.

Risk Assessment The Human Rights related risks which were assessed in the overview in section 2.1.1. include the risks associated with the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The results emphasized that the majority of our operations and human capital are exposed to human and labour rights related risks with ratings ranging from high to extreme. AMS subsequently primarily operates in areas which do not automate the integration of basic human and labour rights into everyday business practice. AMS purposefully encourages the adherence to human and labour rights international standards through a commitment to abide to our own policies or local legislation, whichever sets the highest standards. 3.3.1.2. Goals AMS aims to initiate the following additional initiatives to continue our progress on the enactment and promotion of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work: • Continue to review the policy for handling employees leaving the company • Continued annual review of salary structure for local nationals, based on cost of living and performance • Ensure managers are competent to manage performance, ensuring employees are treated fairly and equally 3.3.2.

Title: AMS UNGC COP Document No / Revision No: Original Issue Date: Revise Issue Date: Page 8 of 11 DHOHR-PL-015/ 1.0 2018-02-14 3.3.3. Measurement Outcome The AMS Compliance Department conducts regular audits throughout the organization to ensure compliance with these policies and to confirm that business practice respects and promotes fundamental human rights. Violations detected through these audits were minimal and addressed appropriately. The reporting year can be closed with no outstanding corrective actions. 3.4. ENVIRONMENTAL PRINCIPLES Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies 3.4.1. Corporate Policy and Goals AMS specializes in providing large dedicated automotive and fleet maintenance solutions to customers operating in austere environments, many of which are in conflict or post-conflict situations. The nature of many of these countries is such that they have been seriously impacted by years of insecurity and poverty, and generally they have poorly defined regulations and codes in relation to environmental protection. Despite the lack of environmental regulation and protection guidelines determined by the host states, AMS is committed to meet international standards on environmental and sustainability issues, and hence has become a signatory to the UN Global Compact. We recognize the significant importance of improving awareness of environmental and sustainability issues and will make further concrete commitments and actions to meet clearly defined targets. Current AMS policies and procedures in relation to the environment are focused on Quality Control and Health and Safety, where we ensure a safe working environment for our employees, sub-contractors and customers, and deliver a very high level of service. By providing very clear quality control procedures, underpinned by the principles of ISO 9001:2015 Certification, we significantly reduce risk in our operations, and therefore reduce environmental impact through preventative processes. 3.4.1.1. Goals We recognize that realizing positive environmental impacts must not simply be a by-product of existing procedures but must become a priority policy driving sustainable changes in the organization, and the environments within which we operate. It is with this goal in mind that AMS will continue to focus on the following initiatives: • Provide advanced HSE Awareness Training for all employees • Educate the local communities on environmental areas where they can make a difference • Introduce a Reduce, Reuse and Recycle campaign across all functions of AMS 3.4.2. Implementation EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY AMS has made commitments in relation to the provision of the best possible living conditions for our employees under the circumstances that they work in, in the Policy on Identification Documents, Adequate Employee Living Conditions and Human Trafficking. This policy covers the provision of a living environment including good sanitization to ensure the hygiene and health of our employees are protected, adherence to Health and Safety regulations in relation to accommodation, canteen and life support areas, and effective waste management in line with local regulations and world standards. Whilst AMS exceeds the minimum criteria for the provision of these basic environmental conditions we will continuously strive to improve these to secure the well-being of our employees. Title: AMS UNGC COP Document No / Revision No: Original Issue Date: Revise Issue Date: Page 9 of 11 DHOHR-PL-015/ 1.0 2018-02-14 HAZMAT AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL PLAN Where possible AMS will work to limit the use of hazardous materials in our operations, and to choose nonhazardous and non-polluting alternatives, we also acknowledge that it is impossible to completely avoid using hazardous materials when performing automotive repairs and services. AMS has a comprehensive HAZMAT Policy and Procedure in place to cover all aspects of hazardous goods handling in our operations. Training our employees to identify and handle HAZMAT as part of their job is a mandatory part of the induction process, and there are ongoing annual refresher trainings as part of the HSE training program. The use of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are mandatory, and all hazardous substances are properly labelled with colour coded MSDS labels and segregated from other products in isolated protected lockable areas. All HAZMAT is stored in approved drums and containers, free from rust and bulging, and protected from severe heat and / or cold. HAZMAT storage areas are well-ventilated and have concrete floors to reduce the risk of spills and potential seepage into the ground. Whilst these preventative procedures are in place, occasional spills are possible, and AMS has an effective spill response process in place should that occur. Contaminated hazardous waste resulting from spills will be contained and as a minimum are disposed of in accordance with local regulations. The initiative to protect our environment is the responsibility of every staff member. The management of programs and policies in support hereof is however, the responsibility of the Compliance Department and is endorsed by Executive Management and the Chief Executive Officer. 3.4.3. Measurement of Outcomes AMS uses a rigorous Quality Control Plan and Compliance Assurance Program to monitor and maintain standards and performance in environmental safety and protection and the reporting year can be closed with no outstanding corrective actions. THE QUALITY CONTROL PLAN The Quality Control Plan is built around the inclusive participation of our workforce, and uses the principles of ISO 9001:2015, to implement processes and procedures to measure and hold people to account through a process of continuous improvement and prevention For effective quality control management AMS has developed an application called Tools and Assets Management System (TAMS), that helps track and report areas of non-conformity, corrective action steps, and responsibility. TAMS has modules covering facilities, health and safety, first aid and asset management, and includes incident reporting functionality. The AMS incident reporting procedure has recently been improved and expanded to cover all incidents across the organization from minor vehicle accidents to serious environmental or security situations. The new procedure includes a rigorous decision-making escalation process, and investigation follow up to ensure corrective measures are identified and implemented. COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE PROGRAM The Compliance Assurance Program supports the Quality Control Plan, and is controlled by a team of internal Compliance Managers. This structured program ensures that AMS maintains effective compliance to our contractual obligations, including health and safety and environmental commitments, as well as compliance to local and international standards. Compliance audits are carried out according to a structured calendar across all of the operations, where non-conformities are highlighted and reported to Program Managers and Vice President of Operations for their corrective actions. The AMS CEO has full visibility of all audit findings and will hold the operation to account to meet corrective actions on time.

ANTI CORRUPTION PRICIPLE Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery 3.5.1. Corporate Policy and Goals AMS has a stringent Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, an Anti-Corruption, Bribery and Money Laundering Policy along with a Whistle-blowing Policy. These policies form an integral part of who AMS is and what the Company expects from its employees. Policies are made available to all our stakeholders, including shareholders, personnel and third-parties via our internal Document Control Management System (DCMS) and throughout training programs. 3.5.1.1. Risk Assessment AMS used the Transparency International 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index to assess and compare corruption risks and anti-corruption responsibilities for our global operations. Transparency International advised that “More countries declined than improved in this year's results, showing the urgent need for committed action to thwart corruption”. The Corruption Perceptions Index ranks countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be. A country or territory’s score indicates the perceived level of public sector corruption on a scale of 0 – 100, where 0 means that a country is perceived as highly corrupt and 100 means it is perceived as corruption free. The table below outlines the countries of operation and their associated global rank and index score: Corruption Score 2017 Country of Operation (0 = highly corrupt) Global Rank Rating 2016 (100 = corruption free) Somalia 10 176 Afghanistan 15 169 Kazakhstan 29 131 Liberia 37 90 United Arab Emirates 66 24 United States 76 16 United Kingdom 81 10 The most recent Corruption Perception Index is only due to be released on the 21st February 2018 and therefore statistics are based on the one released in early February 2017, which indicate that over half of our AMS operations and resources are working in countries related with high to extreme corruption related risks. This validates the significance of an ongoing corporate commitment to support anti-corruption in environments where this is often outside of norm practice. 3.5.1.2. Goals AMS aims to continue with the execution of the following initiatives to ensure our progress on the enactment of Anti-Corruption Principles: • Ongoing Anti-Corruption education across all areas of operation • Continue to practice rigid, unbiased, objective and formal recruitment, supplier selection and purchasing processes throughout the AMS operations • Continuously support and operate in accordance with the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act • Regularly review our contracts with business partners and suppliers and where possible ensure that they adhere to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact which includes the abolition of AntiCorruption Title: AMS UNGC COP Document No / Revision No: Original Issue Date: Revise Issue Date: Page 11 of 11 DHOHR-PL-015/ 1.0 2018-02-14 3.5.2. Implementation CODE OF ETHICS The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct introduced and implemented by AMS in October 2010 and further developed in 2016. The updated copy has been shared with all employees. Further to this all employees, upon joining the company, undergo an induction course and are provided with an employee handbook, which both clearly and openly address our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct as well as the Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy. UNGC COMMITMENT AMS uses a formal training program on the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, which has been rolled out to all existing employees and is continuously provided to all new staff members. These principles are also addressed in the Induction process and all new joiners commit to their compliance and obligation to the 10 principles. ANNUAL REVIEW OF ANTI-CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY POLICY The AMS Compliance Department reviews the Anti-Corruption and Bribery policy on an annual basis prior to the anniversary of the policy. This policy is measured against and adapted to industry best practice. The initiative to promote activities against corruption within corporate guidelines is the responsibility of all AMS employees, regardless of their job function. However, the management hereof is the responsibility of the Head Office Compliance Department and is endorsed by the Executive Management. 3.5.3. Measurement of Outcomes All payment approvals for any and all payments to government organizations, suppliers and or business partners are centralized through our Finance Department in Dubai, thereby ensuring a strong control mechanism is in place and that corruption does not occur throughout our operations across the world. AMS has not received any reports or requests claiming money or any other form of compensation from any source for the period covered in this Communication on Progress. To this end we are pleased to advise that we close the reporting year with no outstanding corrective actions.
