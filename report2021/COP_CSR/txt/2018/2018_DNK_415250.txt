The report is based on our activities in Denmark through our 5 factories in Støvring, Aalborg and Hornslet. The next Mekoprint group CSR report will aim to include activities in Poland and Hong Kong. The report is based on our membership and adherence to the UN Global Compact, which establishes ten basic principles, derived from internationally applied conventions about human rights, labor rights and the environment. Additionally, we complement the report with some of the CSR initiatives which are not part of the UN Global Compact’s ten principles, but which we deem every socially responsible company should keep in mind. This is notably social responsibility within good and ethical business practices, local community developmentand involvement as well as a sustainable approach to our overall business operations. These initiatives as well as a the Global Compact principles are addressed in the report in the paragraphs Social Reponsibility and Climateand Environmental Impact. Finally we list the strategic CSR objectives for 2020 and actions for 2018 through division of our 6 key stakeholders: Employees, Environment, Suppliers, Customers, Society and Finance with a sustainable future as the common focal point. 2 > ABOUT MEKOPRINT > FAMILY OWNED COMPANY FOR MORE THAN 60 YEARS Mekoprint is a family owned company established in 1954 by Erland Kold. The history of Mekoprint ban office egan, when Erland Kold bought a share of Aalborg Klichéand Metal sign factory. The metal sign factory became Mekoprint, who produced etched metal signs and self adhesive transfers for marking of motors, pumps and agricultural machines. In 1973, Esben Kold took over the management, and with a background as a chemical engineer and graduate in business administration, the company developed into a hightech, growth oriented company with a wide range of technologies, competences and product solutions. After more than 40 years, Esben Kold passed on the baton to his son Anders Kold, who since March 1st 2015 has been in charge of the company as the third generation in the company. > GROUP FACTS Mekoprint is a 100% order producing high-tech company with a focus on innovative, partner based relations with customers and suppliers. The customer specific solutions, created together with the customers, are based on a close cooperation, a common goal, and the ideal combination and exploitation of our own and customers’ strengths. Mekoprint primarily work with customers who have special requirements for customer specific products and total solutions within user interfaces, high volume flexible foils, EMC shields, cable harnessing, metal signs and manufactured metal parts. Mekoprint offers more than 30 manufacturing technologies, have more than 20000 customer specific part numbers and supply to all major industries from industrial automation to medico. Mekoprint is headquartered in Støvring and has around 450 employees within 40.000 m2 production areas with majority of the manufacturing in Denmark. Aside from the three factories in Støvringg, Mekoprint has one factory in Aalborg and two factories in Poland in Szczecin and Warsaw. In 2012 Mekoprint further established an office in Hong Kong in order to engage with the increased activity in Asia with regional partner production, logistics, sales and customer service. The engagement with Asia, however, goes all the way back to the early 1990’s when Mekoprint signed the first partnership agreement with an Asian supplier. Since then the focus has been on producing high quality, at a competitive price. Organizationally, Mekoprint is divided into four divisions each with their own specialized product focus: Graphic Electronics, Chemigraphics, Mechanics and Cables. 4 Mekoprint Graphic Electronics develops and produces industrial user interface solutions, foil based high volume products, flexible touch and LED foils, industrial graphical design, production of labels, front foils and transfers based on highly automated digital and silk screen printing. The manufacturing is mainly in Støvring, Denmark, but also with production partners in Asia. Mekoprint Chemigraphics Chemigraphics develops and produces precision metal parts, EMC shields and metal signs to everything from pumps to microphones and hearing aids. The manufacturing is primarily in Støvring, Denmark with etched metal parts in low to medium volume and punched parts in high volume. Additionally Chemigraphics has a highly automated setup in multi axis micro machining of micro precision parts. Mekoprint Mechanics develops and produces cabinets, chassis components, front panels and heatsinks through a range of in-house technologies. These technologies include fiber laser cutting, milling, punching, bending, progressive deep drawing, anodizing, powder coating and graphical printing. The manufacturing takes place at two sites in Denmark and one in Poland. Mekoprint Cables develops and produces Mekoprint cable solutions for industrial use from single wire to complex cable harnesses for use in larger appliances within several industries eg. Industrial automation, pumps and machines. The manufacturing takes place in Poland with around 175 employees while sales activities are centered in Denmark. 5 > SUSTAINABLE VALUES Every day Mekoprint strives to create a more sustainable production together with select customers by creating the best solutions that maximize value with a minimum of resources and environmental impact. We can only do that by abiding by sustainable values: We are… …tirelessly curious and ambitious in finding better ways to engineer, produce and deliver, by constantly having focus on optimizing resources throughout the entire value chain. …actionable actionable in everything we do, not least our social responsibility. This is why we measure specific indicators that ensure that we focus on the right pointers, so we constantly advance in a sustainable direction. …responsib responsible by showing a high level of respect and attention towards our responsible customers, colleagues, suppliers, the environment and society. 6 > MEKOPRINT CSR TIMELINE > SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Addresses UN Global Compact principles 1-6 & 10 7 > ETHICAL BUSINESS CONDUCT It is not enough, that Mekoprint conducts business responsibly. Our business and trading partners should also conduct their businesses responsibly. This is why we ask our suppliers to live up to, sign and be audited on our Code of Conduct, when they do business with us. Our Code of Conduct ensures that both long term as well as new suppliers and partners deal with their own social responsibility throughout the value chain. We are not interested in lower prices at the expense of the environmental conditions of workers or the climate, and we expect that both customers and suppliers share this position. Mekoprint has a huge responsibility in ensuring healthy and safe working conditions for the employees. We must continually work to improve working conditions and reduce work related risks by constantly setting the bar higher and giving the employees the necessary knowledge and training. This applies both for employees of Mekoprint and of the partners we work with, since the working conditions are a substantial part of our Code of Conduct. A transparent tax policy is often touched upon when the subject is ethical business conduct. As we have subsidiaries in other countries with lower business taxes, we of course work with the arm’s-length principle and other transfer pricing guidelines of the OECD. The arm’s-length principle ensures that we make transactions on the same conditions as independent parties under market conditions. > GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE We want an open dialogue with both employees, supplier and customers. Through our annual reports, which are also available on our website, we inform about the company’s development and activities. Aside from this we regularly communicate about the development of Mekoprint through quarterly presentations, digital information boards, intranet, divisional meetings, newsletters and status mails. We express all the things that are going well, but also where we can improve. Despite being around 500 employees, there is a flat organizational structure where the door is always open to the management. This ensures that everybody, both in the administrative functions and the production, can share information across job functions and have open dialogues about the company’s development and challenges. We also put our commitment to an open company culture to the test through the Great Place To Work survey. This survey showed a steady increase of 20% from 71% in 2014 to 91% in 2017 in employees perceiving the management as accommodating and easy to talk to. > WORKING CONDITIONS Mekoprint was one the first companies in Denmark, who in 1999 was certified in the internationally renowned Occupational Health and Safety Assessment 8 standard OHSAS 18001. This certificate ensures a continual focus on improving healthy and safe working conditions for the employees. At mekoprint it is essential that there is focus on the physical work environment with dust, noise and climatic conditions and psychological work environment with well-being, motivation and job satisfaction. We constantly work to minimize noise and odors through among other things separate exhausts and fitting of acoustic panels to reduce noise. > EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION The employees are and have always been Mekoprint’s most important asset. Mekoprint has always made employee satisfaction and work environment a top priority and each year we aim to improve by setting new goals. In 2014 and 2015 Mekoprint launched an extensive employee satisfaction survey in cooperation with Great Place To Work. Based on these results we selected specific focus areas with action plans for improvements. The first step was establishment of an HR group with 10 representatives across the organization. The HR group initiated a new Individual Development Plan process and kicked off our efforts into activating and incorporating Mekoprint’s values under the headline “Creating Together”. In order to make sure this effort creates value, we continually conduct employee satisfaction surveys annually in cooperation with Great Place To Work. The results speak for themselves Mekoprint was in 2016 named as one the best workplaces in Denmark with a top 40 placement, and in 2017 we moved up to 23rd place. Our ambition for 2020 is a top 10 placement. In extension of this our employee satisfaction results has in one year increased from 77% to 89% on the Trust Index. Employee involvement and job satisfaction are often closely connected, which is why we are delighted to see employees engaging in different groups and committees to make their daily life and well-being even better. There are two committees at Mekoprint who make decisions which impacts the working environment and job satisfaction. One is the Work Environment Committee, which focuses on a healthy work environment, the other is a Cooperation Committee whose purpose is to increase job satisfaction and employee security through improving the cooperation between the management and the employees. All minutes of meetings and Summary of Decisions are internally available for all employees. For a lot of people it can be a challenge to obtain the perfect work life balnace. At Mekoprint we do not have a written policy about this, but we show consideration and flexibility in relation to e.g. work hours, light jobs, senior program, etc. The employee handbook has clear guidelines for sickness, so employees know exactly how to handle this, and often there is shown individual consideration – this helps to create security. 9 > HEALTHY WORK ENVINROMENT There is a direct connection between a healthy lifestyle and a healthy work environment. Health is an integrated part of the Mekoprint culture, and this has led to both a varied salad buffet for lunch and a free homemade vegetable omelet during the morning break. Through the staff association it is possible to get discounts for fitness centres, public swimming pools and an active cultural life. During the past few years, there has been a significant reduction in sick days and sick leave. > SAFETY Mekoprint must remain a safe workplace for employees. It is our ambition to have zero accidents and zero employees suffering from stress. We record all accidents and near miss accidents and put efforts into place by implementing initiatives to eliminate the cause of the accident or near miss accident. Several times a year we conduct safety inspections in the production areas and once a year in the administration to take the necessary safety measures and precautions. This is accompanied by biannual safety meetings at all divisions. Mekoprint wants to keep the mental focus on safety in place, so we all work to avoid accidents through initiating the right safety measures in a timely manner. In the production and the administration, we have installed defibrillators and first aid kits. The employees are annually trained in operating the AEDs. In terms of emergency response there are clear guidelines and procedures for preparedness and each location has an emergency response leader. > COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTS Mekoprint acknowledges the right to and allow employees freely to organize in legal unions and to take part in collective bargaining. Mekoprint is a member of the Confederation of Danish Industry and in Denmark, Mekoprint’s wage-earning and salaried employees are regulated by ‘The Industrial Agreement’. The agreement is among others followed in relation to salary, maternity leave, holiday, sickness, termination and industrial injury insurance. Additionally all Mekoprint employees are covered by a pension of 12%, where Mekoprint pays 8% and the employee pays 4%. In Poland and in Hong Kong we comply with all local legislation regarding salaries incl. the statutory pension contributions. > DIVERSITY At Mekoprint we appreciate and value diversity and we want to reflect the multiethnic development in society. When we hire people, we are blind to gender, ethnicity, marital status and similar. At Mekoprint we all work on equal terms. 10 > LOCAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND INVOLVEMENT It is in our DNA to take active responsibility for local community and thereby also for the integration and activation of unemployed. Mekoprint has through many years had a cooperation with job centres in Rebild and Aalborg in getting citizens with different backgrounds in internships and back on the labor market. This has been unemployed academics, citizens with physical injuries, Syrian refugees and challenged youth. As an example we have had two Syrian refugees in internship positions to days a week, while they have attended language classes the other days of the week. Aside from the internship positions, Mekoprint also works closely with several educational institutions from public schools to universities where kids and students get an insight to the company. > AID AND SPONSORSHIP POLICY Historically, Mekoprint has supported the local cultural life with, among others, a contribution of 500.000 DKK for the establishment of Musikkens Hus (House of Music) in Aalborg, the annual Rebild Music award, and by having a number of opera performances at Mekoprint with free entrance for local citizens. Moving forward our support and sponsorships will primarily focus on children and young people’s development with an aim to create more sustainable solutions for themselves their surroundings through educational cooperation and general well-being projects. In December 2016, 10 employees donated their optional Christmas present for the Christmas Seal Foundation home. Aside from this Mekoprint supports UNICEF’s work with challenged children by sponsoring 10 Euro for each response to our customer satisfaction survey, which contributed to more than 3000 Euro in 2016/2017. Locally Mekoprint engages both technologically in relation to development of more sustainable production processes and educationally with a cooperation with Aalborg University. We also support, when students from Aalborg University and University College Nordjylland want to use Mekoprint as a case for projects and master thesis projects as well as internships. Aside from standalone charitable purposes, we strive to give financial aid and support to sustainable innovation and a sustainable local community. Sustainable innovation could include funding of research of new materials and processes of production optimization, minimization of waste and energy consumption etc. The more we can do something proactively for the local community, the closer relations we can link in the local communities where Mekoprint operates. 11 > ENVIRONMENTALAND CLIMATE IMPACT Addresses UN Global Compact principles 7-9 > GREEN BUSINESS – GREAT BUSINESS When we say we fight for a sustainable future we especially have our environmentaland climate impact in mind. In our nature as a manufacturing sub-supplier, we have both an economic and environmental interest in focusing on minimizing our resource consumption. Mekoprint has always had shortand long term environmental impacts on the agenda, and even more so since our ISO 14001 certification. We constantly strive to minimize our energy consumption by putting up power meters on different machines and areas of the production in order to replace older and less power efficient machines. Aside from a well-documented and certified environmental control system, our work with ISO 14001 involves a continual reduction of our resource consumption and thereby environmental impact. This is not only great for the environment; this is great for the productivity and the bottom line. > SUSTAINABLE USE OF RESOURCES Our overall goal is to maximize value with a minimum of resources, and we can only achieve that goal if we consistently challenge our resource consumption and optimize wherever it is possible. It is self-evident that producing more with fewer resources is sound business practice. Having a sound approach to business practice has always been a part of our strategy, and since the last 20 years we have been working with this under the name LEAN. LEAN is in all its simplicity about minimizing waste, and we do that in several areas. When we streamline the administration and manufacturing we save time, energy and materials. This has led to several innovative solutions at the different divisions in Mekoprint. We increasingly produce on fewer, but more automated machines from rolls and coils instead of sheets, which both minimizes energy usage and material waste. Additionally we have since 2012 had a 100% paperless production where all shop orders and work instructions are accessible through iPads. With almost 20.000 orders per year this has saved both the environment and our cost base at a benefit to ourselves and our customers. 12 > WASTE & RECYCLING As far as possible, all waste, at all divisions are sorted and disposed for recycling in the following order. 1) Disposal for recycling 2) Incineration for heat utilization 3) Incineration for disposal 4) Disposal for destruction (purely chemical waste through RenoNord) We receive sample results and have annual security counseling audits by RenoNord on an ongoing basis. > KEY FIGURES The table below shows specific energy key figures for Mekoprint A/S. We strive to be able to get the same level of measuring details and include the results from the other business units: Mekoprint Hong Kong Ltd., Mekoprint Mechanics Hornslet, Mekoprint Poland Sp.z.o.o. and Mekoprint Cables Sp.z.o.o. Index figures are calculated based on the change in energy use relative to the revenue with basis year 2011/2012. CO2 emission figures and key figures for these are calculated through Green Networks’ manual for environmental statements Key2Green. The key figures are also shown on a divisional basis in appendix 4. 13 > CSR AMBITIONS TOWARDS 2020 Even though sustainability already is an integral part of our operations, we want to further our work with CSR even more. We can only do that through ambitions goals for the future. We want to maintain and continue our work with our current qualityand environmental certificates, improve working conditions and improve overall employee satisfaction, visualize and develop sustainability in the organization and push suppliers and partners towards more sustainable raw material and cooperation processes. Furthermore, we have an ambition to becoming a CO2 neutral company, reducing our energy consumption and minimize waste. We are facing a lot of exciting and demanding tasks in order to reach our overall goal of creating a more sustainable future together. But we are very much looking forward to working with precisely these tasks, divided between our 6 key stakeholders. 14 > APPENDICES > APPENDIX 1 – UN GLOBAL COMPACT AND MEKOPRINT How we work with the principle Reference SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CERTIFICATE: OHSAS 18001 Principle 1 Businesses should support and With our code of conduct and audits, we Page xx respect the protection of ensure that our suppliers live up to internationally proclaimed internationally proclaimed human rights. human rights; and Principle 2 make sure that they are not We regularly audit our cooperation partners Page xx complicit in human rights abuses. and suppliers to ensure they live up to the signed code of conduct.
