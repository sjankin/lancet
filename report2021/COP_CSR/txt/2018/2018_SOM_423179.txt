Description of our Processes or Systems We support the principle of “wiseand efficient use” and Management and see this as key to sustainability development goals and tnew technology engagement and the long term preservation of our natural resources. As part of our business objectives we therefore: Seek the efficient use of natural resources; Seek investment opportunities where sound Economic development is coupled with the Protection and improvement of the Environment; Avoid investments where impacts on Communities and the environment have not been properly considered and mitigated in their design. The Company has the necessary processes for follow up, measurement and analysis, including that of claims by workers or other persons or groups, to evaluate the functioning of our social and environmental management system. The results of these processes are recorded and incorporated into the policies through a continual improvement plan and program.

The employees and clients are both covered in our trainings and educational events . Waste management Our operations have an integrated waste management program for the waste products generated in the our activities and that of the vulnerable groups in the communities we serve and programmes supported by humanitarian agencies benefitting humanitarian aid beneficiaries . This is based on the concepts of refusing or reducing the use of products that have actual or potential negative impacts on the environment or human health waste as well as reusing and recycling waste. The sources and types of waste have been identified and the quantity (weight or volume) estimated. The activities of the integrated waste management program are in accordance with the types and quantities of waste generated. We have appropriate treatment systems for all of Wastes solid and liquids generated. The treatment systems comply with applicable national and local laws and customs and have the respective operating permits. There are operating procedures for wastes Systems management and biological indicators such as fauna and flora showing good growth and diversification in species proving that it is effective , this is for waste water management Ashes and clinkers generated from the combustion of firewood are placed on the compost heap. On the other hand Solid waste i.e are placed on compost heap for recycling i.e used as manure, an alternative fertilizer source.. Office refuse is sorted and the combustible materials are burnt in boilers and other material disposed of in a pit. The metal scraps are collected and sold to a scrap dealer. Paper and plastic is disposed of by recycling where possible. Solid factory waste consists mainly of plastics, paper, textiles, cotton wool, glass, pieces of wood etc. Litterbins are provided at each factory for collection of waste with separation at source. Incinerators are available to dispose off and the ash from the incinerator is buried accordingly. Human waste from management houses and factories are collected in septic tanks. The human waste from the village is handled by use of the pit latrines, which are properly decommissioned when full. The ‘VIP’ pit latrine types, are well ventilated for reduction of bad odour and flies. The compost heaps for biodegradable rubbish generated in the estate villages are built according to a very specific design from our social/ environmental consultant. As a further waste management strategy a waste classification report has been compiled and the analysis conducted. Energy consumption Zonal company farming and production of Banana , lemon juice , seism , onion , beans and fresh fruits and green vegetables consumes mainly thermal and efficient solar energy installed system and electrical energy as alternative source of energy when need be . Our goal is to reduce related environmental hazardous and impacts by investing /marketing new efficient and effective high energy products and services like solar lights and system installations , capacity building for repair and maintenance , thermal energy use and by doing this we are turning the global goals in to business actions and implementations across our operations Energy use is continuously monitored at each Sector and area . Staff are well trained on utilization of energy recourses – with principles of observations of switching off light when leaving office and living quarters , avoid printing un necessarily , printing and preserving the environment . Transportation The impact exerted on the environment as a result of Transport activities related to our operations cannot be overlooked and therefore Smart route planning, full utilization of the volume capacity in a trailer as well as the filling with the right weight of goods is the most effective weapon to reduce the environmental impact and cost of transport , in time transport reservising Households Households levels main sources of energies are still fuelwood, Kerosene, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) , but The shift to high efficient energy products investment has contributed to great change at village levels whereby the solar energy system is gaining popularity and becoming clients choice . Water Management We have instituted a water conservation program that ensures the rational use of water resources. The program activities make use of the best available technology and resources. We consider water re-circulation and reuse, maintenance of the water distribution network and the minimizing of water use. We keep an inventory and indicate on a map the surface and underground water sources found on our farms. The operations record the annual water volume provided by these sources and the amount of water consumed. We have obtained the relevant permits for the abstraction of water for all extraction points. We have maintained vegetations growth along the Rivers and streams and canals and wetland sections are conserved accordingly. Monthly water quality analysis is carried out and the verification of the parameters done by External laboratories. The parameters analyzed for include chemical, physical, Microbiological and nutrient composition. A possible source of contamination of the surface water wash-down effluents, runoff and the nutrients in the form of the fertilizers applied in the fields. Fertilizer runoff has been monitored in recent years. No pollution of watercourses or swamps has been detected . Regular audits, of water pumps are conducted to determine deviations and enquiries done to ascertain whether the storage tanks are leaking. Air Quality management The estates emissions into the air include smoke from the boilers, gases from maceration, dust from tractors, vehicle emissions, as well as smoke from within the households (Charcoal stoves) and firewood across the estates. The point sources of emissions are the generators and the boilers. Air pollution may be caused by emission from the combustion of fuel wood. The main pollutants of concern are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, dust, fly ash, and particulate matter, which are produced during combustion. Indoor pollution may lead to negative impact to occupants and exposed workers. Common effects are respiratory disease including allergies and bronchitis. Mitigation measures including proper ventilations, tall stacks, provision of chimneys in kitchens, and fuel efficient high energy cooking stoves , Jikos are practiced on the estates. No evidence of any significant air pollution from our activities or vehicles is apparent and no complaints have been received. A dust analysis was conducted by an independent consultant and remedial actions implemented as recommended. Households within the villages are using high energy efficient products like solar nergy conservation efficiency and ventilation. The use of improved cooking stoves using noise less efficient energy has reduced fuel consumption and ensured that there is less smoke in workers homes and environment . Soil management and conservation High rainfall and undulating hills favor erosion. Isolated areas are prone to erosion but these are identified by conducting soil profile analysis prior to fields being uprooted and replanted. The Company implemented erosion control measures to combat the problem in all fields that were replanted which included, contours, soak pits, vetiver grass, oats etc. The operating policy of the management is to leave 30 m from water bodies/courses uncultivated, to retain its natural vegetation. This policy has been continued with felled areas in riverine areas being rehabilitated. Erosion control measures have been put in place to secure areas that are unstable and on steep slopes. The management has continually carried out rehabilitation of riparian vegetation river catchments as a way of conserving the environments while protecting the riverbanks and hence controlling erosion and flooding incidences downstream. prunings are left in the field as in previous years to improve organic matter, water retention, soil cohesion and fertility. Vegetative protection to prevent soil erosion at the edges includes Lemon grass, Agapanthus and vetiver grass. Sediment traps, spillways and barriers are dug in the gutters to reduce the velocity of water and prevent erosion from the roadways into farm field . Natural resources Apart from the indigenous forests there are no other natural resources of significance in the area. No mineral resources have been found on any of the estates. Annual Environmental audits are done within our operation and environmental management and integration plans developed and incorporated with implementations The plans have indicators and clear implementation timelines. Any new developments with anticipated major impacts are only implemented after Environmental Impact Assessment has been done and an elaborate Environmental management plan put in place.
