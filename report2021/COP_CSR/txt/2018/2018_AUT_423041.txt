Financial risks Internal control system The A1 Telekom Austria Group is exposed to liquidity, credit, for financial reporting foreign currency exchange rate, transfer and interest rate risks (see Note (32)).

To this end, result of the European Commission’s recommendation on an adjustment and amendment of the internal control system to termination rates, could negatively affect the A1 Telekom reflect this standard was implemented in the 2015 financial year. Austria Group’s earnings development. As described in the ‘Regulation’ section, a new regulation on net neutrality and roaming (previously known as ‘Connected Continent’ or the ‘Telecom Single Market’ package) came into force in 2016 with extensive consequences for A1 and other subsidiaries within the EU. The Body of European Regulators has issued guiding principles on net neutrality in order to specify how the regulation should be applied in more detail. The regulation and the guiding principles are open to interpretation on the subjects of both net neutrality and roaming, so that harmonised, uniform implementation within the EU is not guaranteed. Therefore the extent of their effects cannot be fully predicted and may vary between member states. In turn, this gives rise to legal, regulatory and financial uncertainty. The draft of the European Electronic Communications Code described in the ‘Regulation’ section includes policy objectives for a ‘gigabit society’ and a 5G plan of action. In this context, the European Parliament has again brought forward a previous proposal for the abolition of surcharges for international calls within the EU. This will involve both legal and regulatory risks as well as financial risks in the future. The A1 Telekom Austria Group and its subsidiaries are party to a number of legal proceedings both in and out of court with public authorities, competitors and other parties. An ongoing dialogue with the stakeholders involved and a regular exchange of information on controversial issues that could pose a threat to the company enable the Group to identify problems at an early stage and develop measures to counteract them in a targeted manner if need be.

For the full year 2018, most of the market dynamics mentioned above are expected to remain. Both in Austria and in the CEE markets, the competitive environment in mobile markets is anticipated to continue, while the demand for fixed-line services is expected to remain a positive driver across all markets. In the CEE segments, operational results are expected to benefit increasingly from measures taken in the past as well as from the macroeconomic improvements with GDP growth forecasted in all markets (see page 46). The negative roaming impact is anticipated to amount to approximately 1.0 % to 1.5 % of Group EBITDA for the full year 2018. Contrary to the supportive FX development in 2017, the operational performance in Belarus is expected to be negatively affected by a devaluation of the Belarusian Rouble. In this business environment, the Management of A1 Telekom Austria Group remains committed to its growth strategy and is concentrating on the following focus areas: exceling in the core business, expansion of products and services as well as value-accretive mergers and acquisitions. As in the previous year, results should gain support from ongoing efforts to continuously increase operating efficiency. For the year 2018, the Management of A1 Telekom Austria Group expects to achieve modest growth in total revenues on a reported basis.

The Management Board of A1 Telekom Austria Group, which regularly meets in Management Board meetings, acts as the chief operating decision maker. Members of the Management Board are the Group CEO, the Group COO and the Group CFO (see Note (35)). The Management Board focuses on revenue, EBITDA and capital expenditure (CAPEX). The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those of A1 Telekom Austria Group (see Note (3)). The segments offer the following services and products (for brand names, see Note (15)): Austria: voice telephony (mobile and fixed-line telephone services), convergent products, internet access, data and IT solutions, valueadded services, wholesale services, IP television, sale of end-user terminal equipment as well as mobile business and payment solutions Bulgaria: voice telephony (mobile and fixed-line telephone services), convergent products, internet access, data and IT solutions, valueadded services, wholesale services, IP and satellite television, sale of end-user terminal equipment as well as mobile business solutions Croatia: voice telephony (mobile and fixed-line telephone services), convergent products, internet access, value-added services, wholesale services, IP and satellite television, sale of end-user terminal equipment as well as mobile business solutions Belarus: mobile telephone services, internet access, value-added services, wholesale services, sale of end-user terminal equipment, convergent products as well as IP television. From 2011 to 2014, hyperinflation accounting according to IAS 29 was applied to the subsidiary in Belarus. All non-monetary items of the statement of financial position as well as all items of stockholders’ equity were restated for changes in the general price index from the date of initial recognition. These amounts were treated as the basis for the carrying amounts in 2015. Slovenia: voice telephony (mobile and fixed-line telephone services), convergent products, sale of end-user terminal equipment, internet access, value-added services, wholesale services as well as IP television Serbia: mobile telephone services, internet access, sale of end-user terminal equipment, value-added services as well as wholesale services Macedonia: voice telephony (mobile and fixed-line telephone services), convergent products, sale of end-user terminal equipment, DVBT, IP television, internet access, value-added services as well as wholesale services Segment revenues, segment expenses and segment results include deliveries and services between operating segments. Such deliveries and services are accounted for at transfer prices corresponding to competitive market prices charged to unaffiliated customers for similar products. These intersegmental transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The column Corporate & Other comprises mainly holding companies, the group financing company as well as, starting 2017, A1 Digital. In the first quarter 2017, the Austrian subsidiary Telekom Austria Group M2m GmbH (M2M) was renamed A1 Digital International GmbH (A1 Digital). A1 Digital offers innovative digital products, cloud and IoT services as well as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) business. Business activities focus on the CEE region and Germany and will be further expanded internationally. In 2016, M2M was presented in the Segment Austria. Comparative figures were adjusted accordingly. Other financial income reported in the column Corporate & Other mainly relates to dividend income from fully consolidated subsidiaries which is eliminated in consolidation, thus having no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The column Corporate & Other is reported in addition to the column Eliminations for improved transparency. The elimination column contains intersegment consolidation entries and the reconciliation of segment assets and liabilities to consolidated total assets and liabilities. Capital expenditures, as well as depreciation and amortisation, relate to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. None of the segments records revenues from transactions with a single external customer amounting to at least 10% or more of A1 Telekom Austria Group’s revenues. The item other financial result in the segment reporting includes interest on employee benefits and restructuring and other financial items as well as foreign exchange differences. 10 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 84 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 (2) The Company Telekom Austria Aktiengesellschaft (Telekom Austria AG) is incorporated as a joint stock corporation under the laws of the Republic of Austria and is located in Austria, Lassallestrasse 9, 1020 Vienna. Telekom Austria AG and its subsidiaries (A1 Telekom Austria Group, previously Telekom Austria Group) provide the services and products listed in the Segment Reporting (see Note (1)) in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Belarus, Slovenia and Macedonia. In September 2017, it was decided to use the brand A1 on a group-wide basis, see Note (15). As part of the consistent implementation of the brand strategy, Telekom Austria AG also operates under the group brand “A1 Telekom Austria Group”. The ultimate parent company of A1 Telekom Austria Group is América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (América Móvil), which is located in Mexico. The Federal Republic of Austria, through Österreichische Bundesund Industriebeteiligungen GmbH (ÖBIB), is the second significant shareholder of A1 Telekom Austria Group. América Móvil’s and ÖBIB’s stakes in A1 Telekom Austria Group are disclosed in Note (27). In addition to the related party transactions described in Note (11), the Federal Republic of Austria regulates certain activities of A1 Telekom Austria Group in Austria via the Rundfunk und Telekom Regulierungs-GmbH (RTR). In addition, the government holds the taxing authority for the Austrian operations of A1 Telekom Austria Group and imposes taxes such as corporate income tax and value-added taxes. (3) Basis of Presentation Functional currency The Consolidated Financial Statements of A1 Telekom Austria Group are prepared in Euro. Unless indicated otherwise, all amounts are reported in thousand Euros (TEUR). The use of automated calculation systems may give rise to rounding differences. Financial statements of subsidiaries where the functional currency is a currency other than the Euro are translated using the functional currency principle. For these entities, assets and liabilities are translated using the year-end exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation is recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI) and until the disposal of the respective subsidiary presented in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations between the recognition of the transaction and payment date or translation at year-end are recognised in the financial result.

Significant accounting policies The general accounting policies are presented in the respective Notes to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Statement of Financial Position. Changes in accounting policies The following amendments to existing and new IFRS are effective as of 1 January 2017. IAS 12 Income Taxes Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 7) All IFRSs Annual Improvements 2014 – 2016 The initial application of the standards (IAS, IFRS) mentioned above had an insignificant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements since the amendments were not fully applicable. The following standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB, but were not effective at the reporting date. A1 Telekom Austria Group has not early adopted these standards and interpretations and will apply them as of their effective date.

A1 Telekom Austria Group is evaluating the impact of these standards and interpretations on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2014, the IASB issued the new standard IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The new standard for revenue recognition aims at standardising the multitude of regulations previously included in various standards. The amount of revenue recognised and its timing is determined based on a five-step model. The type of transaction or the sector of the entity is not relevant. IFRS 15 contains additional qualitative and quantitative disclosure obligations. These are aimed at enabling users of the financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and the uncertainties of revenue and the resulting cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In April 2016, the IASB issued clarifications to IFRS 15 relating to identifying performance obligations, principal versus agent considerations, as well as licensing. As the standard itself, the European Union has endorsed these clarifications. 12 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 86 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 In 2016, Telekom Austria Group initiated a group-wide two-phase project for the implementation of IFRS 15. In phase I, employees were first trained and the main changes resulting from the initial application of IFRS 15 were analysed. In phase II, the analyses of contracts were continued with a special focus on the adaption of IT and system processes. A software allowing for IT-based mass data processing in the portfolios according to the accounting and disclosure requirements of IFRS 15 was implemented. The project for the introduction of IFRS 15 is substantially completed. As of 1 January 2018, A1 Telekom Austria Group initially applies IFRS 15, electing the modified retrospective approach for the initial application in accordance with the transition guidance. The following table presents the expected quantitative effects of the initial application of IFRS 15 on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of 1 January 2018 including detailed explanations (see columns a) to f)): in TEUR at 1 January 2018 Total a) b) c) d) e) f) Accounts receivable: Subscribers, distributors and other, net (10) 29,015 155,852 – 17,550 – 109,288 Inventories (12) 14,959 14,959 0 Contract assets 145,639 145,639 Contract cost 42,316 42,316 0 Prepaid expenses (13) – 35,562 – 35,562 0 Other assets (13) – 17,565 – 17,565 Instalment sales (13)(19) – 149,802 – 149,802 0 Contract liabilities – 166,412 – 155,238 – 11,174 Accrued liabilities (22) 19,688 18,483 1,205 Deferred revenues (23)(25) 171,184 136,755 34,428 Deferred taxes – 11,108 0 – 11,108 Stockholders' equity – 42,352 – 6,050 38,152 0 – 42,316 – 43,246 11,108 For references relating to the Notes, see brackets. Actual effects at 1 January 2018 may differ from expectations as the functionality of controls assuring that the amounts recognised, which are calculated by IT systems, are in conformity with IFRS 15 has not been completely examined yet and the requirements of revenue recognition according to IFRS 15 might change in the year of initial application. a) According to IAS 18, instalment sales receivables were recognised at the present value of the instalments. Based on the current status, financing components are considered insignificant according to IFRS 15 on an individual contract level. Thus instalment sales receivables will not be discounted anymore as long as the discounting effect continues to be insignificant. Instalment sales receivables discounted at 31 December 2017 will be re-measured at their nominal value at 1 January 2018 and the relating accretion effect will be recognised directly in equity. Starting 2018, this leads to an improvement in EBITDA, as instalment sales revenues that have been recognised previously at the present value with the interest component reported in the financial result shall now be recognised at their full amount in revenues. In addition, starting 2018, the total amount of instalment sales receivables is reported in accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other, net. b) According to IAS 18, dealers reselling mobile devices acquired from A1 Telekom Austria Group to end customers have been considered principals. Due to the regulations of IFRS 15, hardware sales to dealers will no longer be recognised as revenue as the dealers are now considered agents. Revenue will be recognised only once the mobile devices are sold to end customers. The effect expected from the derecognition of accounts receivable and revenue relating to mobile devices in dealers’ stock at 31 December 2017 as well as the effect of the recognition of these mobile devices in inventory at 1 January 2018 is reported directly in equity. According to IAS 18, subsidies to dealers have been recognised in prepaid expenses at the date of sale of mobile devices and expensed over the minimum contractual term. According to IFRS 15, these subsidies are treated as a reduction in revenue. Thus the prepaid expenses are derecognised and the effect expected at 1 January 2018 is recognised directly in equity. Starting 2018, the classification of dealers as agents leads to a later recognition of equipment revenues effected via dealers. At the same time, the fact that subsidies are recognised as a reduction in revenue in 2018 will lead to a shift from expenses to equipment revenues. 13 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 87 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIALStatements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 c) Provisions for customer rebates and deferred income are qualified as contract liabilities according to IFRS 15 and are reclassified accordingly. d) According to IAS 18, discounts and provisions granted to third parties and to employees have been fully expensed. If these discounts and provisions are incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract, they are recognised as deferrals (contracts costs) according to IFRS 15 and are expensed according to the expected duration of the underlying contract. The effect expected from the initial recognition of contract costs at 1 January 2018 is reported directly in equity. Starting 2018, this results in a later recognition of expense, yet no further significant impact on EBITDA is expected. e) As described in Note (5), A1 Telekom Austria Group has previously allocated the majority of transaction prices of multiple-element arrangements to goods and services based on a determination of a separable value to the customer for each deliverable on a standalone basis. IFRS 15 requires the identification of separate performance obligations in multiple-elements arrangements based on certain criteria as well as the allocation of transaction prices to the performance obligations in proportion to the fair values of the underlying goods and services (stand-alone selling prices). The application of the criteria for identifying performance obligations according to IFRS 15 resulted in a re-evaluation of performance obligations for fixed-line services. For mobile communication services, the allocation according to IFRS 15 results in a higher transaction price for mobile equipment and a lower transaction price for mobile services. The adjusted allocation of the transaction price has also insignificant effects on the amount of deferrals for customer loyalty programmes. The effect of the re-evaluation of performance obligations for fixed-line services as well as, in accordance with IFRS 15, the effect of the allocation of the transaction price for multipleelements arrangements for mobile services and on deferrals for customer loyalty programmes are recognised directly in equity at 1 January 2018. Certain major business customers are granted, in addition to standardised multiple-element subsidies, further volume discounts on hardware and partly on services during the term of the service contract. According to IFRS 15, these are included in the multiple-element calculation as well. For the majority of the contracts, A1 Telekom Austria Group applies the practical expedient according to IFRS 15 to pool similar contracts into portfolios, based on contract characteristics and duration. Only a small number of complex contracts with major clients is calculated on individual contract basis. Starting 2018, the change in the allocation of transaction prices leads to a shift from service revenues to equipment revenues; the relating effect on EBITDA is not significant. For fixed-line telephone services, the application of the criteria of IFRS 15 for identifying performance obligations results in a later revenue recognition in 2018, which is not expected to be significant. f) The effects on equity of the changes described above are only temporary shifts of results. Thus deferred taxes were recognised for the effects relating to the initial application of IFRS 15. In July 2014 the IASB issued IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and replacing IAS 39 “Financial Instruments”. IFRS 9 introduces changes regarding the classification and measurement of financial instruments, the impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. 14 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 88 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 A1 Telekom Austria Group initially applies IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018, electing the modified retrospective approach for initial application in accordance with the transition guidance. The initial application of IFRS 9 in A1 Telekom Austria Group has effects on the classification and measurement of financial assets which are not significant overall. The business model of A1 Telekom Austria Group is ‘hold to collect’ and ‘hold to collect and sell’, respectively, and no derivative financial instruments are held. The contractual cash flows of non-derivative financial instruments mainly consist of principal and interest. A1 Telekom Austria Group elected to measure all equity instruments held as of 31 December 2017 at fair value. Financial investments carried at cost are now recognised at their fair value, which leads to an increase in equity of TEUR 493 at 1 January 2018. The loss allowance of accounts receivable trade is measured in accordance with the simplified approach of IFRS 9 at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses. Due to the good credit quality of the customers, the current measurement of accounts receivable according to the method of incurred loss only differs insignificantly from the required method of lifetime-expected credit losses, thus the adoption of IFRS 9 does not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note (32)). The application of lifetime-expected credit loss on contractual assets according to IFRS 15 leads to a reduction in equity of TEUR 2,275 at 1 January 2018 (this effect is included in column (e) of the table on IFRS 15). As at 31 December 2017, A1 Telekom Austria Group only invests short-term with counterparties with investment grade rating, the requirement of IFRS 9 to recognise expected credit losses has only an insignificant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements for all other financial assets (see Note (32)). The new requirements of IFRS 9 regarding hedge accounting do not have an effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements of A1 Telekom Austria Group, as hedge accounting is not applied. IFRS 16 introduces fundamental innovations that affect especially the lessees’ recognition of leases in the financial statements. Generally, all leases have to be recognised based on the “right of use approach”. For lessors, the classification of IAS 17 into operating lease and financing lease remains unchanged. The application of IFRS 16 will affect net assets, financial position and results of operations of A1 Telekom Austria Group: While, up to now, current payments have been recognised in rental and lease expense and future payment obligations for operating leases only have to be disclosed in the Notes, the majority of the resulting rights and obligations will have to be recognised as rights of use and lease obligations. At the initial application, A1 Telekom Austria Group expects a significant increase of the balance sheet total due to the increase in leasing obligations and a similarly high increase in rights of use. In the Statement of Comprehensive Income there will be a shift from rental and lease expenses, which is reported in EBITDA, to depreciation and interest expense. For future minimum lease payments for non-cancellable operating lease contracts according to IAS 17, see Note (29). The overall impact will be analysed in a group-wide project for the implementation of IFRS 16. Quantitative effects cannot be reliably estimated prior to the completion of the project. In the course of the project, a software allowing for IT-based mass data processing is introduced and workflow processes are adapted. A1 Telekom Austria Group plans to apply the modified retrospective approach for the initial application of IFRS 16. (4) Use of Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities reported at the end of any given period, and revenues and expenses for that reported period. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 15 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 89 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 Management has made judgments in the process of applying A1 Telekom Austria Group’s accounting policies. Additionally, at the reporting date, Management has made the following key assumptions concerning the future and has identified other key sources of estimation uncertainty which bear a significant risk of necessitating a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. For all sensitivity analyses, the remaining parameters of the original calculation remain unchanged, thus no possible correlation effects are taken into account. a) Employee benefit plans: The measurement of the various pension and other post-employment benefit plans as well as service awards is based on a method that uses various parameters, such as the expected discount rate, rate of compensation increase, rate of employee turnover and pension and salary increase. Changes in these parameters could result in higher or lower expenses (see Note (26)). b) Impairments: The impairment test for goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is generally based upon discounted estimated future net cash flows from the continuing use and ultimate disposal of the assets. Changes in the discount rates used, in the development of revenues, in cost drivers as well as in capital expenditures could lead to impairments or, to the extent permitted, to reversals of impairments (see Note (16)). For more information on the carrying amounts of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, see Notes (16), (15) and (14). c) The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to depreciation and amortisation represent the estimated periods during which the assets will be in use. With respect to changes in depreciation and amortisation resulting from changes in the useful lives, see Note (14). d) Share-based compensation: Obligations under the long-term incentive programme are measured based on the fair value, which depends on expected target achievement and the expected share price at vesting date. Compensation expense and liabilities could differ from the estimated amount as of the reporting date if the underlying parameters were to change (see Note (30)). e) Deferred taxes: In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, Management considers whether it is probable that all deferred tax assets will be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences will become deductible. If A1 Telekom Austria Group does not generate sufficient taxable income, deferred tax assets cannot be realised and therefore will not be recognised (see Note (28)). f) Restructuring (includes provisions for onerous contracts according to IAS 37 as well as provisions for social plans according to IAS 19): The provision is based on various parameters such as discount rate, salary increase, employee turnover and the probability of the acceptance of termination offers. Changes in these parameters could result in higher or lower expenses (see Note (22)). g) Allowances for doubtful accounts receivables are based on the estimated probability of default of receivables: Deviation of actual from the estimated payment behaviour of customers may result in higher or lower expenses (see Note (32)). h) Asset retirement obligation: The calculation of the provision is based on parameters such as estimated decommissioning costs, discount rate and inflation rate. Changes in these parameters may result in higher or lower provisions (see Note (22)). 16 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 90 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 (5) Revenues The following table sets out revenues from external customers for each product line: in TEUR 2017 2016 Service revenues 2,138,992 2,146,301 Equipment revenues 467,229 419,519 Other operating income 102,755 86,629 Wireless revenues 2,708,975 2,652,449 Service revenues 1,636,304 1,528,183 Equipment revenues 37,203 30,830 Fixed-line and other revenues 1,673,507 1,559,013 Total revenues (incl. other operating income) 4,382,483 4,211,463 Operating revenues include all revenue resulting from the ordinary operations of A1 Telekom Austria Group. Operating revenues are stated net of value-added tax and any other taxes and fees, collected from the customer on behalf of tax and other relevant authorities. A1 Telekom Austria Group generates revenues from fixed-line services and mobile communication services to individuals, commercial and non-commercial organisations and other national and foreign carriers. Fixed-line services include access fees, domestic and long distance services including internet, fixed-to-mobile calls, international traffic, voice value-added services, interconnection, call centre services, data and ICT solutions, television services and public payphone services. Mobile communications services comprise digital mobile communications services including value-added services, text and multimedia messaging, m-commerce and information services. Certain arrangements that A1 Telekom Austria Group enters into provide for the delivery of multiple deliverables by A1 Telekom Austria Group. For the mobile communication services, these multiple-element arrangements typically include the sale of a handset, the activation fee, the yearly SIM card fee and the phone service contract. For fixed-line services, these arrangements typically include internet and fixedline and optional TV and mobile communication services. In general, A1 Telekom Austria Group determines that such arrangements are divided into separate ‘units of accounting’ based on a determination of a separable value to the customer for each deliverable on a standalone basis. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to the units of accounting based on the relative fair value and after taking into consideration any uncertainty of future revenues. A1 Telekom Austria Group recognises long distance and local service revenue based on minutes of use processed or based on contracted fixed fee schedules at the time the services are rendered. Revenues due from other national and foreign carriers for incoming calls from outside A1 Telekom Austria Group’s network are recognised in the period the call occurs. Access fees, monthly base fees, maintenance fees, service fees and lines leased to business customers are partly billed in advance, resulting in deferred revenues. These fees are recognised over the period the service is provided. Cash discounts and rebates are accounted for as reductions in revenues when granted. Revenues from the sale of merchandise and revenues generated from other services are recognised upon delivery and acceptance by the customers or when the services are provided in accordance with contract terms. Setting up customer lines is a separate service, offered by A1 Telekom Austria Group independently from other services. Revenue on such installation work is recognised when the setup is completed. A1 Telekom Austria Group has entered into a limited number of agreements with other telecommunication operators outside of Austria whereby A1 Telekom Austria Group has granted contractually agreed access to existing capacity within its physical network in return for similar access to the physical network of the counterparty. A1 Telekom Austria Group does not recognise revenue or liabilities to the counterparty under such agreements apart from the trade revenue arising from subscriber transactions under normal tariff plans if the services transacted under such agreements are equivalent. The benefits and costs of such swap agreements are reflected in A1 Telekom 17 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 91 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 Austria Group’s results of operations in the periods in which they are realised through reduced interconnection revenues and expenses, respectively. A1 Telekom Austria Group recognises mobile and roaming service revenue based upon minutes of traffic processed or contracted fee schedules when the services are rendered. Revenues due from foreign carriers for international roaming calls are included in revenues in the period in which the call occurs. Certain prepaid services are billed in advance, resulting in deferred revenues. These fees are deferred and recognised over the period the service is provided. Cash discounts and rebates are accounted for as a reduction in revenues when granted. Customer acquisition costs are recognised pro-rata over the contract period as marketing expenses when a service contract exists. In the case of customer loyalty programmes, under which the customers can redeem mobile handsets or accessories against bonus points (award credits) granted to them as part of the sales transactions, revenue is deferred at the time of the granting of the award credits until the goods are redeemed or the awards expire. Activation revenues and related expenses are generally recognised over the minimum contract term. Activation fees do not have a standalone value to customers and are therefore allocated to the other components of the contract. Other operating income includes mainly bad debt recovery, collection fees, penalties, revenues from sale of electricity and rental income. In 2017 and 2016, other operating income includes research and educational tax credits amounting to TEUR 1,649 and TEUR 1,515, respectively. (6) Cost and Expenses The following table presents cost and expenses according to their nature: in TEUR 2017 2016 Cost of equipment 584,243 521,873 Employee expenses, including benefits and taxes 793,851 787,065 Other operating expenses 1,607,041 1,548,273 Total costs and expenses 2,985,135 2,857,211 The cost of equipment corresponds to material expense. Employee expenses, including benefits and taxes comprise all benefits to employees excluding own work capitalised, which is reported on a net basis. in TEUR 2017 2016 Own work capitalised 56,684 72,003 Own work capitalised represents the work performed for own purposes consisting mainly of employee costs and direct overheads capitalised primarily as part of property, plant and equipment. For the capitalisation of internally developed software, see Note (15). The following table provides an allocation of the depreciation and amortisation to the items of the Statement of Comprehensive Income: in TEUR 2017 2016 Cost of service 683,038 698,208 Cost of equipment 27,346 27,137 Selling, general & administrative expenses 243,052 139,925 Depreciation and amortisation 953,436 865,271 18 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 92 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 The increase in selling, general & administrative expenses is basically due to the amortisation of the local brands because of the roll-out of the brand A1 (see Note (15)). At the Annual General Meeting, Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. (EY) was appointed as group auditor for Telekom Austria AG. Expenses related to the group auditor amount to: in TEUR 2017 2016 Audit fees 1,298 854 Other reviews 184 284 Other services 142 0 Fees EY 1,623 1,138 The expenses in 2017 also include charges for 2016. In 2017 and 2016, other reviews relate to expenses incurred for the issuance of bonds (see Note (24)). (7) Financial Result in TEUR 2017 2016 Interest income on loans and receivables 13,811 13,044 Interest income on bank deposits 387 604 Interest income on available – for-sale financial assets 130 193 Interest income 14,329 13,841 in TEUR 2017 2016 Interest expense on financial liabilities 88,053 132,946 Interest capitalised – 5,833 – 6,801 Interest expense on asset retirement obligations 4,720 4,702 Interest expense on deferred considerations 8,333 11,667 Interest expense 95,274 142,514 Interest is recognised using the effective interest method in accordance with IAS 39. The decrease in interest expense on financial liabilities is mainly due to the favourable refinancing for the redemption of a bond in January 2017 as well as the premature redemption of bank debt in 2016 (see Note (24)). Interest expense on deferred considerations relates primarily to one.Vip in Macedonia (see Note (33)). Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use. In 2017 and 2016, interest capitalised on internally developed software as well as on qualifying assets of property, plant and equipment (see Notes (14) and (15)) was based on an interest rate of 3.3% and 4.0%, respectively. In 2017 and 2016, the calculation of interest capitalised for licenses was based on an interest rate of 3.125%, which is derived from a specific financing facility. 19 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 93 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 in TEUR 2017 2016 Interest expense on employee benefit obligations 3,117 3,694 Interest expense on restructuring provision 4,824 8,293 Fees for unused credit lines 2,312 2,165 Dividends received – 471 – 563 Gain on disposal of available-for-sale securities transferred from other comprehensive income – 44 – 24 Loss on disposal of available-for-sale securities transferred from other comprehensive income 103 Result from other investments – 32 – 3,931 Interest on taxes 1,514 0 Interest on employee benefits and restructuring and other financial items, net 11,220 9,739 Restructuring provisions contain onerous contracts in accordance with IAS 37 as well as provisions for social plans in accordance with IAS 19. For information on the interest rate for restructuring provisions and employee benefit obligations, see Notes (22) and (26). The amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI) and subsequently recognised in profit or loss are disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. In 2017, the result from other investments mainly relates to paybox Bank as, in June 2016, VISA Inc. acquired 100% of the shares in VISA Europe Limited from the member banks. Up to that date, paybox Bank, as a member of VISA Europe Limited, held one share which was exchanged for a consideration of TEUR 2,920 and 1,060 preferred shares in VISA Inc. amounting to TEUR 1,011. in TEUR 2017 2016 Foreign exchange gains 10,359 20,986 Foreign exchange losses – 12,953 – 10,973 Foreign exchange differences – 2,594 10,013 The foreign exchange losses 2017 mainly result from currency fluctuations of the Belarusian Rouble, which were to a large extent compensated by foreign exchange gains relating to the Serbian Dinar and the Croatian Kuna. (8) Earnings per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year: 2017 2016 Net result attributable to owners of the parent in TEUR 319,151 387,518 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding 664,084,841 664,084,841 Basic and diluted earnings per share in Euro 0.48 0.58 For the number of shares see Note (27) According to IAS 33.12, the after-tax dividend on the hybrid capital is deducted from the net result attributable to owners of the parent, since the hybrid capital represents equity but does not constitute net result attributable to owners of the parent (see Note (27)). Due to Management’s decision to settle all share-based compensation plans in cash, no related dilutive effect occurred as of 31 December 2017 and 2016. (9) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in banks and financial investments with remaining maturities of up to three months from the date of acquisition. The financial resource fund in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is equal to cash and cash equivalents reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 20 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 94 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 (10) Accounts Receivable: Subscribers, Distributors and Other, Net in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Accounts receivable, gross 898,399 848,722 Allowances – 219,106 – 212,247 Accounts receivable, net 679,292 636,474 At 31 December 2016, accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other in an amount of TEUR 382 had a maturity of more than twelve months and were non-interest bearing. The roll-forward of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other as well as their ageing is presented in “credit risk” in Note (32). (11) Related Party Transactions The significant shareholders América Móvil and ÖBIB are considered related parties due to their stake in Telekom Austria AG allowing them to control and to exercise significant influence, respectively. Through América Móvil, A1 Telekom Austria Group is also related to its subsidiaries. Through ÖBIB, A1 Telekom Austria Group is related to the Republic of Austria and its subsidiaries, which are mainly ÖBB Group, ASFINAG Group and Post Group as well as Rundfunk und Telekom Regulierungs-GmbH (RTR), all of which qualify as related parties. A1 Telekom Austria Group has determined the kind and amount of the transactions concluded with these related parties. In 2017 and 2016, revenues generated with these related parties were approximately 3% of the total revenues in the segment Austria. In 2017 and 2016, services received from the related parties mentioned above mainly relate to postage fees, transportation, commissions, roaming and fees to RTR and amount to approximately 6% and 7%, respectively, of total cost and expenses (excluding employee expenses) in the segment Austria. A1 Telekom Austria Group is obligated to provide communication services for disadvantaged individuals at reduced tariffs for which it is entitled to appropriate compensation from the government on a contractual basis. The contract with the government concluded in July 2016 specifies the reimbursement of Euro 10.00 per customer per month for customers having a valid official notice. The total reimbursement recorded as revenue in the service period was TEUR 13,419 and TEUR 14,532 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Regarding the transfer of civil servants to the government and the related expenses, provisions and liabilities, see Note (22). The revenues from and expenses charged to associated companies are set forth in the following table: in TEUR 2017 2016 Revenues (incl. other operating income) 1,591 1,817 Expenses 10,759 25,517 In 2017 and 2016, the expenses relate mainly to advertising and marketing services provided by media.at-Group, which was sold on 18 July 2017 (see Note (17)). At 31 December 2017 and 2016, accounts receivable due from related parties and accounts payable due to related parties, as recognised in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, relate primarily to Telecom Liechtenstein and subsidiaries of América Móvil. At 31 December 2016, accounts payable due to related parties also relate to media.at-Group (see Note (17)). All transactions with related parties are monitored and documented to ensure that pricing is at arm’s length. 21 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 95 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial Statements FINANCIAL 2017 STATEMENTS 2017 The following table shows the compensation of key management personnel as well as the expenses for pensions and severance for other employees. Key management personnel is defined as the members of the management boards and the managing directors of all significant operating companies of A1 Telekom Austria Group registered in the Company Register as well as the members of the Management Board of Telekom Austria AG. in TEUR 2017 2016 Short-term employee benefits 7,393 7,544 Pensions 538 487 Other long-term benefits 229 1,887 Termination benefits 685 142 Share-based payments 1,752 630 Compensation of key management 10,599 12,705 Expenses for pensions and severance for other employees 21,142 21,116 Expenses for pensions and severance for Management Board 235 233 For members of the Management Board of Telekom Austria AG, see Note (35). Expenses for pensions and severance consist of voluntary and legal severance expenses, contributions to pension plans and other pension payments. (12) Inventories Inventories consist of merchandise sold in the shops of A1 Telekom Austria Group or by retailers and are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value, with cost being determined on the basis of weighted average cost less allowance based on the turnover rate of the last twelve months. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated selling expense. As of 31 December 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount of merchandise measured at fair value less cost to sell amounted to TEUR 47,482 and TEUR 43,002, respectively.

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method. If an event or circumstance indicates that the assets may be impaired, they are tested for impairment (see impairment test in Note (15)). Property, plant and equipment under finance lease and leasehold improvements are amortised using the straight-line method over the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The useful lives are: Years Transmission equipment 3-20 Cables and wires 2-20 Communications equipment 2-20 Buildings and leasehold improvements 3-50 Furniture, fixtures and other 2-25 Other assets 2-17 24 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 98 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements20172017 Spare parts, cables and supplies are primarily used for A1 Telekom Austria Group’s network expansion. In accordance with IAS 16.8, they are reported in property, plant and equipment as A1 Telekom Austria Group expects to use these items during more than one period. As of 31 December 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount of land amounted to TEUR 59,347 and TEUR 57,534, respectively. In 2016, the estimated useful lives of certain communications networks and other equipment of the merged company “ONE” in the segment Macedonia were reduced due to technological harmonisation, which led to an increase in depreciation of TEUR 15,655. Government grants for assets totalling TEUR 10,727 and TEUR 4,226 were deducted from acquisition cost in 2017 and 2016, respectively. At 31 December 2017 and 2016, purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment amount to TEUR 153,005 and TEUR 150,233, respectively. Sensitivity analysis The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and of intangible assets represent the periods in which the assets are estimated to be used by A1 Telekom Austria Group. A change in the useful lives by one year would lead to the following changes in depreciation and amortisation. in TEUR 2017 2016 Decrease due to extension by one year 243,924 187,017 Increase due to reduction by one year 356,251 220,507 Due to the amortisation of local brands (see Note (15)), the reduction of useful life by one year results in a significant increase, as brands may be completely amortised within a year.

Brand names are classified as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life based on an analysis of product life cycles, contractual and legal control of the asset and other pertinent factors. In the course of business combinations, brand names are recognised at fair value based on the “relief of royalty method”. If Management intends to discontinue the use of a brand name in the foreseeable future, its carrying amount is amortised over the remaining estimated useful life. In September 2017, Management decided to harmonise the brands in A1 Telekom Austria Group. Depending on the respective markets, the Austrian brand “A1” will be rolled out to all segments until the third quarter 2019 at the latest, and the local brands are amortised accordingly in the relevant segments (see amortisation in the table changes in the carrying values of brand names by segment). 27 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 101 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 The following table provides a detail of the brand names recognised: in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 A1 Telekom Austria 144,910 144,910 Cable Runner 491 491 YESSS! 12,950 12,950 Total Austria 158,351 158,351 Mobiltel 144,007 243,704 Total Bulgaria 144,007 243,704 Vipnet 18,576 25,301 Metronet 855 0 Total Croatia 19,431 25,301 velcom 54,673 73,125 Atlant Telecom 0 3,059 Total Belarus 54,673 76,184 Si.mobil 0 1,049 AMIS Slovenia 0 341 Total Slovenia 0 1,391 one 3,609 5,276 Total Macedonia 3,609 5,276 Exoscale 1,907 0 Total Corporate & Other 1,907 0 Total Brand Names 381,978 510,207 Thereof with indefinite useful live 160,258 500,481 Thereof with definite useful live 221,720 9,726 Certain direct and indirect development costs associated with internally developed software, are capitalised once the project has reached the application development stage. The development costs are generally amortised using the straight-line method over a period not exceeding four years, beginning when the asset is substantially ready for use. Development costs requiring capitalisation include direct costs of materials and services as well as payroll costs. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, maintenance and training costs as well as research and development costs (with the exception of the abovementioned capitalisable development costs) are expensed as incurred.

Impairment test In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that A1 Telekom Austria Group’s property, plant and equipment or intangible assets with finite useful lives may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed, regardless of whether they are to be held and used or to be disposed of. In accordance with IAS 36, an impairment loss is recognised when an asset’s carrying amount exceeds the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use. Fair value is the amount obtainable from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction. Value in use is based on the discounted cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Impairment charges are recorded separately in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. If there is any indication that the impairment recognised in prior periods no longer exists, A1 Telekom Austria Group considers the need to reverse all or a portion of the impairment charge. Brand names classified as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year in accordance with IAS 36, as described in Note (16). If an event or circumstance indicates that an asset may be impaired, impairment tests are carried out. Due to the fact that brand names do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets, the value in use can be determined only for the asset’s cash-generating unit. The second step according to IAS 36.107 is to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognised based on the total cash-generating unit. In 2016, the impairment test of the cash-generating unit paybox Bank led to an impairment in the segment Austria amounting to TEUR 2,319 as the carrying amount exceeded the discounted estimated future net cash flows approved by Management in the business plans. Brand name, customer base and software were written off completely (see table of intangible assets). In 2016, the value in use of paybox Bank amounts to TEUR 6,797. The pre-tax interest rate on which the calculation of the value in use is based amounts 7.0% in 2016. (16) Goodwill Goodwill is recognised in the course of business combinations and is measured as the difference between the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred as of the acquisition date and the amount of any non-controlling interest less the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The following table illustrates the changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination: in TEUR Austria Bulgaria Croatia Belarus Slovenia Macedonia A1 Digital Total At 1 January 2016 708,211 242,691 100,745 0 147,632 30,433 0 1,229,712 Translation adjustment 0 0 1,048 250 0 56 0 1,354 Acquisitions 0 0 410 10,768 0 – 421 0 10,757 At 31 December 2016 708,211 242,691 102,203 11,018 147,632 30,068 0 1,241,823 Translation adjustment 0 0 515 – 1,533 0 –8 – 138 – 1,164 Acquisitions 0 0 23,322 4,662 0 0 7,698 35,682 At 31 December 2017 708,211 242,691 126,041 14,146 147,632 30,060 7,560 1,276,342 For details of acquisitions, see Note (33). 29 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 103 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 The acquisition cost of goodwill was as follows: in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Segment Austria 712,231 712,231 Segment Bulgaria 642,691 642,691 Segment Croatia 131,078 107,210 Segment Belarus 459,386 523,817 Segment Slovenia 175,556 175,556 Segment Macedonia 35,171 35,180 A1 Digital 7,560 0 Total cost 2,163,673 2,196,684 Accumulated impairment charges of goodwill amount to: in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Segment Austria 4,020 4,020 Segment Bulgaria 400,000 400,000 Segment Croatia 5,037 5,007 Segment Belarus 445,240 512,799 Segment Slovenia 27,924 27,924 Segment Macedonia 5,111 5,112 Accumulated impairment 887,332 954,861 Impairment test Goodwill, other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and other intangible assets, which are not yet available for use, are not amortised, but are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 at least once a year, in the fourth quarter, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, by comparing their carrying amounts with their recoverable amounts. If an event or circumstance indicates that an asset may be impaired, impairment tests are also carried out. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are summarised in cash-generating units, which are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated shall: (a) represent the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and (b) not be larger than an operating segment. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated shall be tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of the unit, including its goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. A1 Telekom Austria Group performs these impairment tests by calculating the value in use based on capital-market-oriented valuation methodology. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) applied corresponds to the weighted average interest on equity and debt. Value in use is determined by estimating the future net cash flows of the cash-generating unit based on the business plans, which were prepared for a detailed planning period of five years. Significant assumptions to determine the value in use comprise the development of revenues, cost drivers, working capital changes, capital expenditure, growth rate and discount rate. Assumptions used in business plans are based on actuals, industry forecasts and external economic parameters such as the development of gross domestic product (GDP), inflation rates, currency rates, population and other. 30 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 104 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 Costs and capital expenditure are based on past experience and internal expectations. The growth rates applied to the perpetual annuity consider the general growth rates and the company-specific revenue growth rates of prior periods and those used in detailed planning, respectively. The discount rate applied for discounting future cash flows is determined for each cash-generating unit separately based on market data and taking into account specific risks associated with the cash-generating unit. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the investors. The cost of debt as well as beta factors and capital structure are derived from the peer group based on publicly available market data. The following parameters were used to calculate the value in use: Growth rates perpetual annuity Pre-tax interest rates* 2017 2016 2017 2016 Segment Austria 1.1% 0.6% 6.8% 7.0% Segment Bulgaria 1.6% 0.8% 7.4% 7.8% Segment Croatia 2.9% 2.2% 9.2% 9.6% Segment Belarus 9.7% 10.8% 20.0% 24.3% Segment Slovenia 1.2% 0.6% 8.2% 8.4% Segment Macedonia 0.3% – 0.3% 9.5% 10.1% A1 Digital 1.1% n.a. 6.5% n.a. * Based on a risk-free interest rate, adjusted for market, country and industry-specific risks. A standard discount rate is used for all planning periods. At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the value in use in the segment Austria amounts to TEUR 6,743,288 and TEUR 4,300,514, respectively, in the segment Bulgaria to TEUR 1,182,835 and TEUR 858,913, respectively, in the segment Croatia to TEUR 389,824 and TEUR 273,314, respectively, in the segment Belarus to TEUR 1,110,626 and TEUR 662,083, respectively, in the segment Slovenia to TEUR 411,851 and TEUR 418,159, respectively, in the segment Macedonia to TEUR 202,172 and TEUR 192,491, respectively, and in the cash generating unit A1 Digital the value in use amounts to TEUR 467,318. The value in use is compared with the carrying amount of the cash-generating units (including goodwill). Impairment charges are recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the cash-generating units exceeds the value in use. The impairment loss shall first be allocated to the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit, and then to the other assets of the cash-generating unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the cash-generating unit, provided that the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit. These reductions in the carrying amounts represent impairment losses on individual assets. If the value in use of the cash-generating unit exceeds its carrying amount, the cash-generating unit and the goodwill allocated to that cashgenerating unit shall be regarded as not impaired. Rather, A1 Telekom Austria Group examines if impairment losses recognised in the past (with the exception of goodwill) have to be reversed.

Unrealised gains and losses resulting from the change in their fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI), net of income tax. Other investments carried at cost include investments in unquoted equity instruments (investments) which are not carried at fair value because their fair value cannot be reliably determined. These relate mainly to CEESEG AG. As the stake in CEESEG AG can only be disposed of at the initial indexed purchase price and due to the absence of an active market, this equity instrument is carried at acquisition cost.

In establishing provisions, Management assesses if there is a present obligation to a third party, the payment is probable and the amount can be estimated reliably. A1 Telekom Austria Group records provisions based on the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation. A1 Telekom Austria Group expects that approximately 60% of the provisions and accrued liabilities, with the exception of the asset retirement obligation and the provision for restructuring, will be utilised during the following financial year. Even if A1 Telekom Austria Group does not expect an outflow of funds in the following financial year, provisions and accrued liabilities are reported as short-term as the timing of such outflows cannot be controlled by A1 Telekom Austria Group. Restructuring In 2008, a comprehensive restructuring programme was initiated in the segment Austria. The provision for restructuring includes future compensation of employees who will no longer provide services for A1 Telekom Austria Group but who cannot be laid off due to their status as civil servants. These employment contracts are onerous contracts under IAS 37, as the unavoidable cost related to the contractual obligation exceeds the future economic benefit. The restructuring programme also includes social plans for employees whose employments will be terminated in a socially responsible way. In 2009 and every year from 2011 to 2017, new social plans were initiated which provide for early retirement, special severance packages and golden handshake options. Due to their nature as termination benefits, these social plans are accounted for according to IAS 19. At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the corresponding liability amounts to TEUR 482,858 and TEUR 589,468 and includes 1,879 and 2,021 employees, respectively. Provisions for restructuring are recorded at their net present value. In 2017 and 2016, the rates of compensation increase used to measure the provisions are the same as those used for employee benefit obligations (see Note (26)). The following table provides the discount rates used, which are determined based on the Mercer Yield Curve Approach taking into account the respective maturities, as well as the fluctuation rate, which is only applied to provisions for onerous contracts according to IAS 37. 35 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 109 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 2017 2016 Employees permanently leaving the service process 1.25% 1.25% Social plans 0.75% 0.75% Civil servants transferred to the government 1.25% 1.25% Employee turnover rate 27.4% 34.3% Changes in the provision are recognised in employee expense and reported in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses, while the accretion expense is reported in the financial result in the line item interest expense on restructuring provision (see Note (7)). A part of the provision was released since a number of employees returned to regular operations, were transferred to the government or opted for schemes such as golden handshakes, special severance packages and early retirement to an extent not foreseeable at the time of the measurement of the provision in the previous year. The change in estimates is due to adjustments of the rate of compensation for civil servants released from work (see Note (26)) as well as an adjustment of the employee turnover rate. The employee turnover rate takes into consideration employees leaving in the future as well as temporary re-employment within A1 Telekom Austria Group and is only applicable to the provision for employees permanently leaving the service process and not to provisions for social plans. Based on the general agreement for the transfer of personnel, which was concluded with the Austrian government in 2013, employees transferring voluntarily to the government can apply for a permanent transfer after a probation period of six months. During this probation period, A1 Telekom Austria Group bears the salary expense. In case of a permanent transfer, A1 Telekom Austria Group has to compensate the government for any excess expense arising due to differing professional classifications of work places. Furthermore, compensation payments have to be effected to civil servants up to the age of 62 (optionally also one-off payments). As of 31 December 2017 and 2016, the provision for the transfer of civil servants to the government amounts to TEUR 18,099 and TEUR 24,073 and comprises 176 and 193 employees, respectively. For information on the liability for employees transferred to the government, see Note (21). Weighted average duration The weighted average duration of the restructuring obligations is as follows: in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Employees permanently leaving the service process 7.6 8.3 Social plans 3.4 3.6 Civil servants transferred to the government 6.7 7.1 Sensitivity analysis A change of one percentage point in the discount rate or in the rate of compensation would lead to the following changes in provisions (negative values indicate a reduction in provisions): in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 1 percentage point increase 1 percentage point decrease Change in discount rate – 20,334 19,268 Change in rate of compensation 17,998 – 16,987 in TEUR, at 31 December 2016 Change in discount rate – 27,965 26,584 Change in rate of compensation 25,258 – 23,719 A change in the fluctuation rate applied to the provision for onerous contracts would lead to the following changes in provisions (negative values indicate a reduction in provisions): in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 5 percentage points increase – 7,595 – 9,536 5 percentage points decrease 7,593 9,426 36 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 110 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 Employees The provisions for employees mainly contain bonuses and the short-term portion of employee benefit obligations for severance, service awards and pensions (see also Note (26)). At 31 December 2016, unused vacation days amounting to TEUR 20,560, which were used in 2017, were reported in provisions for employees. In 2017, the addition to unused vacation days is included in liabilities due to employees (see Note (21)). In its judgement of 11 November 2014, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) decided that the Austrian law determining the reference date for salary increments for Austrian civil servants (this date determines the length of service and thus the date for being advanced into the next salary level) is not in conformity with European Union law. Thus, at 31 December 2017 and 2016, A1 Telekom Austria Group recognised a provision for back payments in its financial statements of TEUR 50,487 and TEUR 49,069, respectively. Customer rebates The provision contains rebates earned by customers but not paid as of the reporting date. Asset retirement obligation Liabilities for asset retirement obligations are measured at their net present value in accordance with IAS 37, the increase in the liability that reflects the passage of time is recognised in profit or loss (see Note (7)). The effects of changes in the measurement of existing decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of IFRIC 1. Changes in the measurement of these liabilities resulting from changes in the estimated timing or amount of the outflow of resources or changes in the parameters shall be added to or deducted from the cost of the assets in the current period. The amount deducted from the asset shall not exceed its carrying amount. A possible exceeding amount is reported in profit or loss. If the adjustment results in an addition to the asset, it shall be considered whether there is an indication that the new carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. If there is such an indication, the asset shall be tested for impairment and any impairment losses shall be recorded. A1 Telekom Austria Group records asset retirement obligations for the retirement and decommissioning of wooden masts impregnated with tar or salt, base stations, land and buildings including rented premises. The asset retirement obligation for masts impregnated with tar or salt is based on estimated settlement dates and expected cash flows. A1 Telekom Austria Group operates base stations on land, rooftops and on other premises under various types of rental contracts. In estimating the fair value of the retirement obligation for its base stations, A1 Telekom Austria Group has made a range of assumptions such as retirement dates, timing and percentage of early cancellations, development of technology and the cost of removing network equipment and remediating the sites. Additionally, A1 Telekom Austria Group records asset retirement obligations for buildings concerning obligations for the disposal of hazardous substances and warfare material as well as the decontamination of land when decommissioning a building. A1 Telekom Austria Group records asset retirement obligations for buildings and rented premises under operating leases in accordance with the obligation to refurbish the sites at the expiration of the lease contracts. Furthermore, based on the Universal Service Ordinance (Universaldienstverordnung) an asset retirement obligation for the decommissioning of payphones was recorded in 2016. 37 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 111 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 The following table provides the parameters used for the measurement of the obligation: 2017 2016 Discount rate 1.5%– 10.9% 1.5%– 13.3% Inflation rate 2.0%– 6.7% 1.0%– 9.9% The discount rate applied to the calculation of asset retirement obligations reflects current market expectations with regard to interest effects as well as specific risks of the obligation. In 2017, the discount rate in the non-eurozone is based on the risk-free interest rate of German federal bonds with a maturity of 30 years , adapted for country-specific risk by the Damodaran Rating based default spread. For those countries whose currencies are not tied to the Euro, the respective inflation differential according to the OECD is taken into account as well. In the eurozone, the discount rate is based on government bonds with matching maturities. In 2016, the discount rates were based on the risk-free interest rates of Austrian government bonds with a maturity of 30 years or the comparable applicable interest rate in the case of Belarus. The inflation rates are adapted quarterly to reflect the general development in the individual countries. Basically the change in these parameters as well as changes in the estimated outflow of resources resulted in an increase of the asset retirement obligation and an increase in the related item of property, plant and equipment (see change in estimates in the table of provisions). TEUR 4,626 were recognised in other operating income as the related tangible asset is already fully depreciated. Sensitivity analysis A change of one percentage point in the discount rate or in the inflation rate would lead to the following changes in provisions (negative values indicate a reduction in provisions): 1 percentage point 1 percentage point in TEUR at 31 December 2017 increase decrease Change in discount rate – 23,603 29,810 Change in inflation rate 29,643 – 23,994 in TEUR at 31 December 2016 Change in discount rate – 22,538 27,237 Change in inflation rate 26,953 – 22,696 Legal Provisions mainly relate to expenses incurred in respect of legal advice and litigation. Other provisions Other provisions mainly relate to taxes (excluding income taxes), guarantees, rents and penalties.

These fees are recognised over the period the service is provided. According to IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’, the award credits granted are recognised as deferred income until redeemed or forfeited. 38 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 112 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 (24) Long-term Debt The terms and conditions of long-term debt and its current portion are summarised in the following table: At 31 December 2017 At 31 December 2016 Carrying Nominal interest Carrying Currency Maturity Nominal interest rate Face value amount rate Face value amount Bonds TEUR 2017 0 0 fixed 4,250% 500,000 499,953 TEUR 2021 fixed 3,125% 750,000 745,913 fixed 3,125% 750,000 744,872 TEUR 2022 fixed 4,000% 750,000 745,077 fixed 4,000% 750,000 743,922 TEUR 2023 fixed 3,500% 300,000 298,601 fixed 3,500% 300,000 298,347 TEUR 2026 fixed 1,500% 750,000 743,670 fixed 1,500% 500,000 494,287 Total Bonds 2,550,000 2,533,262 2,800,000 2,781,382 Bank debt TEUR 2018 0 0 fixed 3.53% 22,000 22,000 Leases (Note (29)) 894 894 144 144 Financial debt 2,550,894 2,534,156 2,822,144 2,803,526 Current portion of long-term debt – 549 – 549 – 500,030 – 500,030 Long-term debt 2,550,346 2,533,607 2,322,114 2,303,496 Bonds Bonds are recognised at the actual amount received.

All other employee benefit obligations are unfunded defined benefit plans for which A1 Telekom Austria Group records provisions which are calculated using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19. in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Service awards 62,477 67,294 Severance 129,277 132,964 Pensions 5,088 5,994 Long-term employee benefit obligations 196,842 206,251 According to IAS 19.133, A1 Telekom Austria Group chooses to distinguish between current and non-current liabilities arising from employee benefit obligations (see also Note (22)). For severance and pensions, A1 Telekom Austria Group recognises actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income (OCI), whereas re-measurement gains and losses for service awards are immediately recognised in profit or loss. The re-measurement of defined benefit plans relates to actuarial gains and losses only, as A1 Telekom Austria Group holds no plan assets. Interest expense related to employee benefit obligations is reported in the financial result, while service cost is reported in employee expenses in the respective functional area. 40 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 114 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 Actuarial assumptions The actuarial assumptions used to measure the obligations for service awards, severance payments and pensions are as follows: 2017 2016 Discount rate service awards 1.00% 1.00% Discount rate severance 2.00% 1.75% Discount rate pensions 1.50% 1.50% Rate of compensation increase – civil servants 4.40% 4.40% Rate of compensation increase – other employees 3.00% 3.00% Rate of compensation increase – civil servants released from work 3.50% 3.90% Rate of increase of pensions 1.60% 1.60% Employee turnover rate* 0.0%– 1.72% 0.0%– 1.88% * Depending on years of service. As in the prior year, the determination of the discount rate is based on the Mercer Yield Curve Approach, taking into account the respective maturities. Life expectancy in Austria is based on ‘AVÖ 2008-P – Rechnungsgrundlagen für die Pensionsversicherung – Pagler & Pagler’. The obligation relating to the international subsidiaries was measured on the same actuarial basis due to their insignificant amount. Weighted average duration The weighted average duration of the obligations is as follows: in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Service awards 5.9 6.4 Severance 15.0 15.8 Pensions 11.7 9.4 Service awards Civil servants and certain employees (together ‘employees’) are eligible to receive service awards. Under these plans, eligible employees receive a cash bonus of two months’ salary after 25 years of service and four months’ salary after 40 years of service. Employees with at least 35 years of service when retiring (at the age of 65) or who are retiring based on specific legal regulations are eligible to receive four monthly salaries. The compensation is accrued as earned over the period of service, taking into account the employee turnover rate. The risk A1 Telekom Austria Group is exposed to is mainly the risk of development of salary increases and changes of interest rates. 41 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 115 Consolidated CONSOLIDATEDFinancial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 The following table provides the components and a reconciliation of the changes in the provisions for service awards: in TEUR 2017 2016 At 1 January 72,816 76,176 Service cost 2,193 2,351 Interest cost 707 923 Actuarial gain/loss based on experience adjustment – 1,645 – 1,324 Actuarial gain/loss from changes in demographic assumptions –4 –0 Actuarial gain/loss from changes in financial assumptions – 201 357 Recognised in profit or loss 1,050 2,306 Benefits paid – 5,410 – 5,665 Change in reporting entities 0 –1 Other – 5,410 – 5,666 Obligation at 31 December 68,456 72,816 Less short-term portion – 5,979 – 5,522 Non-current obligation 62,477 67,294 Of the defined benefit obligations for service awards, less than 1% relate to foreign subsidiaries as of 31 December 2017 and 2016, respectively. Severance Defined contribution plans Employees starting to work for A1 Telekom Austria Group in Austria on or after 1 January 2003 are covered by a defined contribution plan. A1 Telekom Austria Group paid TEUR 2,157 and TEUR 2,028 (1.53% of the salary) into this defined contribution plan (BAWAG Allianz Mitarbeitervorsorgekasse AG) in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Defined benefit plans Severance benefit obligations for employees hired before 1 January 2003, excluding civil servants, are covered by defined benefit plans. Upon termination by A1 Telekom Austria Group or retirement, eligible employees receive severance payments equal to a multiple of their monthly compensation which comprises fixed compensation plus variable elements such as overtime or bonuses. Maximum severance is equal to a multiple of twelve times the eligible monthly compensation. In case of death, the heirs of eligible employees receive 50% of the severance benefits. A1 Telekom Austria Group is exposed to the risk of development of salary increases and changes of interest rates. The following table provides a detailed reconciliation of the changes in severance benefit obligations: in TEUR 2017 2016 At 1 January 134,433 119,886 Service cost 5,230 5,209 Interest cost 2,316 2,681 Recognised in profit or loss 7,546 7,890 Actuarial gain/loss based on experience adjustment – 4,295 – 185 Actuarial gain/loss from changes in demographic assumptions – 1,034 – 556 Actuarial gain/loss from changes in financial assumptions – 4,795 9,836 Recognised in other comprehensive income – 10,125 9,095 Benefits paid – 1,321 – 2,439 Change in reporting entities 0 7 Foreign currency adjustments 22 –6 Other – 1,299 – 2,438 Obligation at 31 December 130,555 134,433 Less short-term portion – 1,279 – 1,469 Non-current obligation 129,277 132,964 Approximately 2% of the defined benefit obligations for severance relate to foreign subsidiaries as of 31 December 2017 and 2016. 42 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 116 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 Pensions Defined contribution pension plans In Austria, pension benefits generally are provided by the social security system, for employees, and by the government, for civil servants. A1 Telekom Austria Group contributed for its employees 12.55% to social security amounting to TEUR 31,223 and TEUR 30,159 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Contributions for active civil servants amount to 12.55% and 15.75%. In 2017 and 2016, these contributions to the government amounted to TEUR 30,053 and TEUR 38,373, respectively. Additionally, A1 Telekom Austria Group sponsors a defined contribution plan for employees of some of its Austrian subsidiaries. A1 Telekom Austria Group’s contributions to this plan are based on a percentage of the compensation not exceeding 5%. The annual expenses for this plan amounted to TEUR 12,006 and TEUR 11,874 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Defined benefit pension plans A1 Telekom Austria Group provides defined benefits for certain former employees in Austria. All such employees are retired and were employed prior to 1 January 1975. This unfunded plan provides benefits based on a percentage of salary and years employed, not exceeding 80% of the salary before retirement, and taking into consideration the pension provided by the social security system. A1 Telekom Austria Group is exposed to the risk of development of life expectancy and inflation because the benefits from pension plans are lifetime benefits.

The calculation of a 0.5% decrease is limited to a maximum of 0.0% of the employee turnover rate. (27) Stockholders’ Equity Capital management The capital structure of A1 Telekom Austria Group consists of financial liabilities and equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent company, comprising common stock, treasury shares, additional paid-in capital, hybrid capital, retained earnings, remeasurement of defined benefit plans, available-for-sale reserve, hedging reserve and translation reserve. A1 Telekom Austria Group manages its capital structure to safeguard its strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence as well as to provide sustainable support to the future operational development of A1 Telekom Austria Group. Maintaining its investment grade rating of Baa2 by Moody’s and BBB by Standard & Poor’s is the number one priority of A1 Telekom Austria Group’s finance strategy. This will allow A1 Telekom Austria Group to obtain the financial flexibility required for strategically important projects. A transparent dividend policy ensures the balance between shareholder remuneration and the utilisation of cash to redeem outstanding debt. Share capital As of 31 December 2017 and 2016, the common stock of Telekom Austria AG amounts to TEUR 1,449,275, and is divided into 664.5 million bearer shares. As of 31 December 2017 and 2016, América Móvil indirectly holds a stake of 51.00% through its 100% subsidiary América 44 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 118 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 Móvil B.V., Netherlands (América Móvil B.V., formerly Carso Telecom B.V.), ÖBIB holds a stake of 28.42% and free floated shares including treasury shares amount to 20.58%. The shares have no par value.

Furthermore, the syndicate agreement contains rules on the uniform exercise of voting rights in the corporate bodies of Telekom Austria AG, nomination rights for members of the Supervisory and Management Boards and share transfer restrictions. The Supervisory Board of Telekom Austria AG consists of ten shareholder representatives, eight of which are nominated by América Móvil B.V. and two are nominated by ÖBIB. ÖBIB has the right to nominate the chairman of the Supervisory Board. América Móvil B.V. has the right nominate the deputy chairman. On 24 July 2015, the function of the Chief Executive Officer of Telekom Austria AG was transferred to a management board member nominated by América Móvil B.V., namely Alejandro Plater, based on the proposal of the parties of the syndicate contract. Since 1 August 2015, the Management Board of Telekom Austria AG therefore consists of two members. In the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of 14 August 2014, the Articles of Association of Telekom Austria were amended: As long as the Republic of Austria directly or indirectly holds at least 25% plus one share in the registered share capital, resolutions on capital increases and on the issuance of instruments which contain a conversion right or a conversion obligation into shares of Telekom Austria AG as well as changes to this provision of the Articles of Association shall require a majority of at least three quarters of the share capital present at the vote. According to the Austrian Banking Act and the Capital Requirements Regulation, a regulation for banks by the European Union, the subsidiary paybox Bank AG has to fulfil regulatory minimum equity requirements regarding bank-related risks, notably credit risk and operational risks as well as liquidity coverage requirements.

The Management Board plans to propose to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to distribute a dividend of Euro 0.20 per share from unappropriated retained earnings. Treasury shares At the Annual General Meeting of Telekom Austria AG held on 29 May 2013, the Management Board was empowered to: (a) use these treasury shares to settle obligations under the share-based compensation plans described in Note (30) and/or to transfer them for or without a consideration to employees, managers and members of the Management Board/management of Telekom Austria AG and of its affiliated companies; (b) use them as consideration for acquisitions, or (c) sell treasury shares at any time via the stock exchange or by public offer for a period of five years from the day of the resolution in any manner permitted by law, also other than via the stock exchange, whereby the Management Board is entitled to exclude the general purchase opportunity.

Furthermore, effects relating to the employee participation plan and the retirement of treasury shares are reported in additional paidin capital. Hybrid capital On 24 January 2013, A1 Telekom Austria Group issued a hybrid bond with a volume of TEUR 600,000. The hybrid bond is a subordinated bond with indefinite maturity which, based on its conditions, is classified as stockholders’ equity according to IFRS. Accordingly, related discount and issue cost in the amount of TEUR 11,752 were recorded net of a tax benefit of TEUR 2,938 in stockholders’ equity. Therefore, stockholders’ equity was increased by TEUR 591,186. The bond can be redeemed at par at the earliest after a period of five years. Additionally, Telekom Austria AG has an early termination right subject to certain conditions. The annual coupon amounts to 5.625% until the first reset date, 1 February 2018. Subsequently, there will be a reset date every five years. The coupon is established two days prior to the respective reset dates. Coupon payments of TEUR 33,750 each effected in February 2017 and 2016 are recognised as distribution of dividends in stockholders’ equity. See also Note (37). In the local financial statements, coupon payments are recognised as interest expense in profit or loss according to Austrian GAAP. While the tax benefit resulting from the accrued interest is recognised in profit or loss according to local GAAP, it is recognised in stockholders’ equity as ‘distribution of dividend’ in the Consolidated Financial Statements according to IAS 12. The net result attributable to hybrid capital holders is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the allocation of the net result and equals interest recognised in profit or loss according to local GAAP in both years reported, amounting to TEUR 33,750, net of the relating tax benefit of TEUR 8,438, which is recognised in stockholders’ equity in 2017 and 2016. Other comprehensive income (loss) items (OCI) The other comprehensive income (loss) contains the remeasurement of severance and pension obligations, the available-for-sale reserve, the hedging reserve as well as the translation reserve. Their development is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity. The foreign currency translation adjustment mainly relates to the consolidation of velcom in Belarus and Vip mobile in the Republic of Serbia. (28) Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated for each taxable entity based on the expected actual income tax rate applicable. For the purpose of calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities, A1 Telekom Austria Group uses the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognised in the period the tax rate is effectively enacted. The distribution of dividends by Telekom Austria AG has no effect on the tax rate. Investment tax credits are recognised as a reduction in income taxes in the period in which these credits are granted. 46 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 120 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 Income tax attributable to income before income taxes consists of the following (negative values indicate an income tax benefit): in TEUR 2017 2016 Current income tax 61,098 27,790 Deferred income tax – 58,092 – 81,305 Income tax 3,006 – 53,515 The table below provides information about the allocation of total income tax in the Consolidated Financial Statements: in TEUR 2017 2016 Continuing operations 3,006 – 53,515 Income tax on realised result on hedging activities* 1,460 1,460 Income tax on unrealised result on securities available-for-sale* 58 47 Income tax on realised result on securities available-for-sale* – 11 20 Income tax on remeasurement of defined benefit obligations* 2,664 – 2,154 Tax benefit relating to hybrid capital** – 8,438 – 8,438 Total income tax – 1,260 – 62,580 * Recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI) **See Note (27). The following table shows the major reconciling items between the reported income taxes and the amount of income taxes that would have resulted by applying the Austrian statutory income tax rate of 25% to pre-tax income: in TEUR 2017 2016 Income tax expense at statutory rate 87,119 89,922 Foreign tax rate differential 5,610 – 3,692 Tax-non-deductible expenses 10,288 4,183 Tax incentives and tax-exempted income – 6,281 – 7,190 Tax-free income (loss) from investments 216 – 496 Change in tax rate 0 – 576 Tax benefit/expense previous years – 3,352 – 8,268 Changes in deferred tax assets not recognised – 185,221 – 89,307 Impairments (reversals of impairments) of investments in subsidiaries and other intragroup transactions 94,500 – 38,060 Other 128 – 31 Income tax 3,006 – 53,515 Effective income tax rate 0.86% – 14.88% In 2017 and 2016, non-deductible expenses mainly consist of withholding taxes on dividends and representation expenses as well as nondeductible remuneration of managers in Austria. Tax incentives and tax-exempted income relate mainly to investment incentives in Slovenia and to tax incentives within the group taxation regime in Austria. Additionally, they relate mainly to a tax incentive in Belarus, which allows for the tax-neutral revaluation of carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment for tax purposes in order to increase the future basis of depreciation, as well as to research, education and investment incentives and other government grants. In 2016, the change in tax rate relates mainly to an increase of the corporate tax rate from 17% to 19% in Slovenia, starting 2017, partly compensated by the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 20% to 18% in Croatia, starting 2017. The tax benefit for prior periods recognised in 2016 results mainly from the final tax calculation 2015 in Austria. 47 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 121 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIALStatements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 Impairments (reversals of impairments) of investments relate to write-downs and reversals of write-downs of investments in affiliated companies in Austria, which are recognised over a period of seven years for tax purposes and for which deferred tax is calculated (according to the respective guidance in ‘Effects of tax write-downs according to Section 12 (3) No 2 of the Austrian Corporate Tax Act on the accounting of income taxes according to IAS 12 in consolidated or single IFRS financial statements’ issued by the Austrian Financial Reporting and Auditing Committee). In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and their tax bases, for current-year tax losses and tax losses carried forward as well as certain impairment losses on investments for which recognition for tax purposes is deferred over a specified period. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities are set out below: in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Deferred tax assets Deferred deduction for impairments of investments in subsidiaries 62,946 135,612 Loss carry-forwards 270,839 149,888 Accounts receivable: Subscribers, distributors and other 8,423 7,510 Deferred income and other liabilities 839 658 Other current assets and prepaid expenses 1,501 1,480 Provisions, long-term 58,730 61,945 Employee benefit obligations 25,737 28,480 Property, plant and equipment 5,903 2,838 Other 11,860 8,635 Deferred tax assets 446,778 397,047 Deferred tax liabilities Property, plant and equipment – 39,040 – 37,371 Other intangible assets – 118,256 – 133,644 Write down of treasury shares for tax purposes – 1,427 – 1,427 Other – 2,597 – 1,246 Deferred tax liabilities – 161,320 – 173,689 in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Deferred tax assets 327,077 286,431 Deferred tax liabilities – 41,619 – 63,073 Deferred taxes, net 285,458 223,358 Impairments of investments in subsidiaries relate to impairments for which the recognition of expense is deferred over seven years according to Austrian tax law. Deferred tax assets on long-term provisions basically relate to the provision for the asset retirement obligation, which is only partly recognised for tax purposes, as well as to differences in the IFRS and tax value of the restructuring provision in Austria (see Note (22)). Deferred tax assets on employee benefit obligations result from the difference between the amount recognised in accordance with Section 14 of the Austrian Income Tax Act (EStG) and the amount of the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19 (see Note (26)). Deferred tax liabilities on other intangible assets are due to purchase price allocations according to IFRS in the course of acquisitions. Deferred tax liabilities on property, plant and equipment are basically due to differences in the carrying value of assets with retirement obligations, which are not recognised for tax purposes. 48 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 122 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 In Austria, A1 Telekom Austria Group established a tax group according to Section 9 of the Austrian Corporate Tax Act (KStG), with Telekom Austria AG as the head of the tax group. Deferred tax assets and liabilities for the members of the tax group (currently all significant Austrian subsidiaries) are reported on a net basis since the tax group is treated as one taxable entity. Amortisation of tax goodwill according to Section 9 (7) KStG is treated as a temporary difference on investments in subsidiaries for tax purposes. According to IAS 12.39, no deferred tax liabilities are recorded in that case, thus there are no differences in deferred tax liabilities in 2017 and 2016. The following deferred tax assets were not recognised as the realisation in the near future is not probable according to tax planning. in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Net operating loss carry-forwards 329,875 463,469 Temporary differences related to impairments of investments in consolidated subsidiaries 87,157 139,443 Deferred tax assets not recognised 417,032 602,911 In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, Management considers whether it is probable that all deferred tax assets will be realised. The realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible. These are based on business plans with a detailed planning period of five years. Management considers the scheduled release of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income when making this assessment. At 31 December 2017, the loss carry-forwards and the years these will expire are the following: Year in TEUR 2018 107,056 2019 120,771 2021 9,319 2022 146 2023 1,224 2024 1,242 2027 519 Carry forward indefinitely 2,383,848 Total 2,624,125 The loss carry-forwards expiring in the years listed above mainly relate to the Republic of Serbia. Due to tax relief according to Article 50a of the Serbian Corporate Tax Act, the tax rate applicable at 31 December 2017 amounts to 1.6%. The remaining net operating loss carry-forwards mainly relate to companies located in Austria and can be carried forward indefinitely. In Austria, the annual usage is generally limited to 75% of the taxable income for a year. No deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences relating to shares in subsidiaries, as it is not probable that these temporary deferred taxes will be reversed in the foreseeable future. in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Temporary differences 52,218 42,278 (29) Leases Lessee Lease agreements in which A1 Telekom Austria Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership as a lessee are classified as finance leases; otherwise, they are classified as operating leases. 49 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 123 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance leasing is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The operating lease contracts will expire on various dates through 2028 and mainly comprise leases of base stations, property and vehicles. Future minimum lease payments for non-cancellable operating lease contracts as well as finance lease contracts as of 31 December 2017 are: Other Operating in TEUR finance leases leases 2018 549 83,135 2019 144 59,806 2020 98 38,391 2021 81 30,070 2022 61 24,024 after 2022 0 71,161 Total minimum lease payments 933 306,588 Less amount representing interest – 39 Present value of lease payments 894 Less current portion – 549 Non-current lease obligations 346 In 2017 and 2016, the rental and leasing expenses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income amount to TEUR 162,026 and TEUR 165,318, respectively. Assets under finance leases relate to automobiles and indefeasible rights of use. At 31 December 2017 and 2016, respectively, the carrying value amounts to TEUR 569 and TEUR 233 and is included in other assets and rights of use (see Notes (14) and (15)). Lessor If, substantially, all risks and rewards are attributable to A1 Telekom Austria Group as a lessor, the leased asset is recognised by A1 Telekom Austria Group. Measurement of the leased asset is then based on the accounting policies applicable to that asset in accordance with IAS 16. A1 Telekom Austria Group receives minimum lease payments for non-cancellable operating lease contracts that mainly relate to indefeasible right of use contracts, private automatic branch exchange equipment (PABX) as well as set-top boxes. These payments are recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the terms of the contracts and, at 31 December 2017, they amount to: in TEUR Operating leases 2018 6,350 2019 3,535 2020 2,242 2021 1,683 2022 1,515 after 2022 1,402 Total minimum lease payments 16,728 50 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 124 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 (30) Share-based Compensation Long-term incentive (LTI) programme A1 Telekom Austria Group introduced a long-term incentive programme (LTI) in 2010. In accordance with IFRS 2, share-based payments are measured at fair value at the grant date. The expense is recognised over the vesting period. Due to the Management Board’s decision to settle bonus shares granted in the course of the long-term incentive programme in cash (subsequently called fictitious bonus shares), the share-based payments are recorded as a liability. Participants of this programme are required to invest an amount depending on the annual gross basic salaries and the management level of the entitled employee in Telekom Austria shares and to hold these shares until the end of the holding period (at least three years). For each tranche, the number of fictitious bonus shares granted is calculated based on the average Telekom Austria stock price for a defined period. The performance period for meeting the performance targets was determined to be three years. On 1 July 2014, the fifth tranche (LTI 2014) was granted. Net income, relative total shareholder return and EBITDA were defined as key performance indicators. The relative total shareholder return is determined based on a balanced peer group of nine European telecommunications providers. The target values for these key indicators were determined by the Supervisory Board. The actual performance and the bonus shares allocated are summarised in the subsequent table, settlement will be in cash. On 1 September 2015, the sixth tranche (LTI 2015) was granted. EBITDA comparable, free cash flow and a revenue-based key figure were defined as key performance indicators. The target values for these key indicators were determined by the Supervisory Board. At the vesting date (at the earliest three years after the grant date), fictitious bonus shares will be allocated to the participants and will be settled in cash. If the targets are fully met, fictitious bonus shares equal to the double personal investment will be allocated to the participants. If the targets are exceeded, proportionally additional fictitious bonus shares will be allocated up to a maximum of 350% of the shares on a pro rata basis. This maximum amount of fictitious bonus shares is allocated if the targets are overachieved by 175% or more. In case of a significant underperformance, no bonus shares will be allocated. On 1 September 2016, the seventh tranche (LTI 2016) was granted. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and the market revenue share of A1 Telekom Austria Group (weighted with 50% each) were defined as key performance indicators. The target values for these key indicators were determined by the Supervisory Board. At the vesting date (at the earliest three years after the grant date), fictitious bonus shares will be allocated to the participants and will be settled in cash. If the targets are fully met, fictitious bonus shares equal to the double personal investment will be allocated to the participants. If the targets are exceeded, proportionally additional fictitious bonus shares will be allocated up to a maximum of 350% of the shares on a pro rata basis. This maximum amount of fictitious bonus shares is allocated if the targets are overachieved by 175% or more. In case of a significant underperformance, no bonus shares will be allocated. On 1 June 2017, the eight tranche (LTI 2017) was granted. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and the market revenue share of A1 Telekom Austria Group (weighted with 50% each) were defined as key performance indicators. The target values for these key indicators were determined by the Supervisory Board. The LTI 2017 was only granted to the members of the Management Board of Telekom Austria AG, Alejandro Plater and Siegfried Mayrhofer. At the vesting date (at the earliest three years after the grant date) and if targets are fully met, fictitious bonus shares equal to the double personal investment will be allocated to the participants and will be settled in cash. If the targets are exceeded, proportionally additional fictitious bonus shares will be allocated up to a maximum of 350% of the shares on a pro rata basis. This maximum amount of fictitious bonus shares is allocated if the targets are overachieved by 175% or more. In case of a significant underperformance, no bonus shares will be allocated. 51 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 125 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 The following table summarises the significant terms and conditions for each tranche not yet settled: LTI 2017 LTI 2016 LTI 2015 LTI 2014 Start of the programme 1 January 2017 1 January 2016 1 January 2015 1 January 2014 Grant date 1 June 2017 1 September 2016 1 September 2015 1 July 2014 End of vesting period 31 December 2019 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 Vesting date 1 June 2020 1 September 2019 1 September 2018 1 July 2017 Personal investment at grant date 54,271 204,334 240,835 299,239 Personal investment at reporting date* 54,271 183,390 168,945 192,817 Expected performance** 121.90% 129.00% 104.30% 60.20% Expected bonus shares*** 132,311 456,912 352,420 0 Maximum bonus shares*** 189,947 641,865 591,309 0 Fair value of programme in TEUR 987 3,435 2,778 0 Allocated bonus shares 0 0 0 222,154 Average stock price at end of vesting period in Euro 0 0 0 5.23 Share-based compensation in TEUR 0 0 0 1,162 * For LTI 2014, personal investment at the end of the vesting period. ** For LTI 2014, actual performance at the end of the vesting period. *** Taking into account the allocation of fictitious bonus shares equal to the double personal investment.

Management determines the classification of its financial assets and financial liabilities at initial recognition. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when A1 Telekom Austria Group becomes a party to a financial instrument. A1 Telekom Austria Group uses the settlement date for recording regular purchases and sales of financial assets. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at the trade date and derecognised when settled. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given or received. Transaction costs are included in the initial measurement, except for financial instruments, which are recognised at their fair value through profit or loss. 53 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 127 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 Financial assets include, in particular, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other, net as well as other receivables, receivables due from related parties and available-for-sale investments. Financial liabilities include, in particular, accounts payable trade, issued bonds, other financial liabilities and payables due to related parties and are recognised initially in the amount corresponding to the financial inflow. Differences between the amount received and the amount to be repaid are recognised over the term of the liability in the financial result (amortised cost) using the effective interest rate method. For financial liabilities carried at amortised cost, gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss when the financial liability is derecognised. Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the Statements of Financial Position only when A1 Telekom Austria Group has a contractual right to offset the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis. Concentration of risks At the reporting dates, A1 Telekom Austria Group does not have any significant concentration of business transacted with a particular supplier or creditor or customer. Furthermore, A1 Telekom Austria Group does not have any concentration of risk with respect to contractors, other services, franchises or other rights which could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact operations. A1 Telekom Austria Group invests its cash with various institutions with appropriate credit standings. A1 Telekom Austria Group operates in markets in the Central Eastern European (CEE) region. Operations in the CEE region involve uncertainties, including transfer, currency and tax uncertainties that may affect business activities. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the Management Board’s assessment of the impact of the CEE business environment on the operations and the financial position of A1 Telekom Austria Group. The actual development of the future business environment may differ from Management’s assessment. Financial risk management Overview A1 Telekom Austria Group is exposed to market risks, including liquidity risk, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk associated with underlying financial assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions. The financial risk management is centrally organised. The guideline establishing policies, responsibilities and competences is valid for both the Group Treasury and the financial departments of the subsidiaries. The existing risks are regularly monitored and, if necessary, A1 Telekom Austria Group responds to changes in market conditions. A1 Telekom Austria Group neither holds nor issues derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that A1 Telekom Austria Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. A1 Telekom Austria Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that A1 Telekom Austria Group will always have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions. For this purpose a monthly rolling consolidated liquidity planning is drawn up, which serves as the basis for determining the liquidity requirement. Furthermore there is a liquidity reserve in the form of committed credit lines. Funding sources A1 Telekom Austria Group’s treasury department acts as an internal financial services provider, realising potential synergies in financing the operations of A1 Telekom Austria Group’s subsidiaries. Its primary goal is to assure liquidity in a cost-effective manner by applying the pooling of cash flows and the clearing of A1 Telekom Austria Group’s accounts to enable the management of short-term investments and borrowings at optimal interest rates with minimal administrative effort. 54 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 128 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 Cash flow from operations is the basis for securing sufficient liquidity of A1 Telekom Austria Group. Principal sources of external funding are bank loans and capital markets. For details of outstanding long-term debt and a description of the different classes of the debt as of the reporting date, see Note (24). In order to diversify its short-term funding sources, A1 Telekom Austria Group implemented a multi-currency short-term treasury notes programme (multi-currency notes) with a maximum volume of TEUR 300,000 in 2007. The programme was concluded for an indefinite period. As of 31 December 2017 and 2016, no multi-currency notes were issued. As of 31 December 2017 and 2016, A1 Telekom Austria Group had total credit lines of TEUR 1,265,000 and TEUR 1,000,000, respectively. These credit lines were not utilised. The credit line commitment of TEUR 250,000 has a term until January 2018, the remaining credit lines commitments have a maximum term until November 2019. Exposure to liquidity risk The following table sets forth the contractual (undiscounted) interest and redemption payments of financial liabilities. At 31 December 2017 and 2016, no variable interest-rate liabilities existed. Foreign currencies were translated at the rates valid on the reporting date. Contractual 6 months 6 to 12 1 to 2 2 to 5 more than in TEUR cash flow or less months years years 5 years At 31 December 2017 Bonds 2,958,000 30,000 45,188 75,188 1,702,125 1,105,500 Bank debt 17 17 0 0 0 0 Accounts payable trade 592,032 562,527 8,718 6,997 13,403 388 Lease obligations 933 532 17 144 240 0 Other financial liabilities 71,453 50,294 2,971 2,749 5,668 9,772 At 31 December 2016 Bonds 3,266,917 551,250 41,438 71,438 964,313 1,638,479 Bank debt 23,724 608 198 22,918 0 0 Accounts payable trade 553,806 533,449 12,080 3,586 4,181 510 Lease obligations 147 53 34 47 13 0 Other financial liabilities 172,006 46,489 124,089 593 0 836 It is not expected that the cash flows of the financial liabilities included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts. Market risks Market risk is the risk of changes in market prices. A1 Telekom Austria Group faces the risk of market price changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk Since all of A1 Telekom Austria Group’s long-term debt has fixed interest rates, no cash flow exposure due to fluctuating interest rates exists (see Note (24)). However, the fair value of fixed rate debt increases when market rates are below the rates fixed on these loans. Exposure to interest rate risk The risk of changes in interest rates related to investment activities is considered low due to the short-term nature of financial assets. Fair value sensitivity analysis for financial instruments One measure used to express the potential change in the value of a portfolio of financial liabilities in response to a change in interest rates is the modified duration. Modified duration (sensitivity measure) follows the concept that interest rates and the price of fixed-rate financial instruments move in opposite directions. The sensitivity is based on the assumption of a one-percentage-point parallel shift in market interest rates for all terms occurring at the reporting date. The methods and assumptions used remained unchanged to those used in prior years. The modified duration (sensitivity) is set forth in the following table (negative amounts represent decreases in financial liabilities): 55 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 129 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 Change in financial portfolio in TEUR, at 31 December Capital amounts Increase Decrease 2017 Fixed rate financial liabilities 2,550,000 Sensitivity at a modified duration of 4.344% – 110,761 110,761 2016 Fixed rate financial liabilities 2,822,000 Sensitivity at a modified duration of 4.478% – 126,369 126,369 Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate financial instruments Since all of A1 Telekom Austria Group’s long-term debt have fixed interest rates at 31 December 2017 and 2016, no sensitivity analysis is provided. Information with respect to hedging reserve The hedging reserve results from the three forward-starting interest rate swap contracts (pre-hedges) concluded in 2011 with a face value of TEUR 100,000 each. The relating hedging reserve is released in profit or loss in accordance with the recognition of interest expense on the bond, which was issued on 4 July 2013, as the interest rate risk on that bond was hedged. In the years reported, the release of the hedging reserve through other comprehensive income resulted in interest expense amounting to TEUR 5,840 and a tax benefit amounting to TEUR 1,460, respectively. Exchange rate risk As of 31 December 2017 and 2016, of all accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other, net as well as accounts payable trade, only the following are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entities (for foreign exchange rates, see Note (3)): in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Denominated in EUR USD Other EUR USD Other Accounts receivable: Subscribers, distributors and other 2,095 9,587 37,647 1,867 7,617 6,312 Accounts payable trade 70,486 15,832 4,878 62,945 12,204 3,754 In 2017 and 2016, a change of 10% in the exchange rate of the Euro to the currencies listed below (see Note (3)) would increase/decrease foreign exchange rate differences as follows: in TEUR 2017 2016 Croatian Kuna (HRK) 2,282 2,739 Serbian Dinar (CSD) 1,792 1,655 Belarusian Rouble (BYN) 400 577 No sensitivity analysis was performed for other accounts receivable or for accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, as there is no significant risk due to diversification. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from accounts receivable trade and investment activities. Due to internal guidelines and counterparty limits there is neither significant credit risk nor concentration. Financial investments and cash and cash equivalents A1 Telekom Austria Group’s investments are generally of a short-term nature and only concluded with counterparties holding investment grade ratings. If no such external rating is available, an internal rating based on quantitative ratios is carried out. Therefore, there is no exposure of financial investments and cash and cash equivalents to any significant credit risk. 56 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 130 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 The carrying amount of financial assets and cash and cash equivalents represents the maximum credit risk exposure (see Notes (9) and (18)): in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Available-for-sale investments 11,345 13,647 Financial investments valued at cost 1,546 1,468 Cash and cash equivalents 202,390 457,460 Carrying amount 215,281 472,575 Loans and receivables A1 Telekom Austria Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer or group of customers. The demographics of A1 Telekom Austria Group’s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, have less of an influence on credit risk. Within the framework of the applicable legal regulations, each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness. Credit risk or the risk of default in payment by contractual partners is monitored via credit checks, credit limits and verification routines. Due to the large number of customers and the high level of diversification of the portfolios, the default of any single debtor would not entail grave consequences (low concentration risk) in respect of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Within A1 Telekom Austria Group, operative credit risk management functions are performed at the operating company level. The following table sets forth the maximum exposure to credit risk for other financial assets and accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other, net, which equals the carrying amount (see Notes (10), (13) and (19)): in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Accounts receivable: Subscribers, distributors and other 679,292 636,474 Financial assets 161,022 139,264 Carrying amount 840,314 775,738 Accounts receivable from related parties are not included. As a result of the low concentration of credit risk described above, A1 Telekom Austria Group has no insurance for its accounts receivable. However, based on the credit assessment of retail and wholesale customers, A1 Telekom Austria Group requires bank guarantees, comfort letters and cash deposits (see Notes (21) and (25)). in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Cash deposits 10,666 9,520 Guarantees 9,165 9,284 The following table sets forth the ageing of other financial assets and accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other: Gross Allowance Gross Allowance in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2017 2016 2016 unbilled & not yet due 733,633 21,137 675,065 12,181 Past due 0-30 days 52,166 5,249 52,286 3,384 Past due 31-60 days 26,504 6,537 22,986 4,751 Past due 61-90 days 16,798 5,700 12,119 3,997 More than 90 days 247,321 197,485 238,935 201,342 Total 1,076,422 236,108 1,001,392 225,654 57 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 131 Consolidated CONSOLIDATEDFinancial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Financial assets past due gross 342,789 326,327 Allowance financial assets – 214,971 – 213,473 Financial assets past due net 127,818 112,854 The following table shows the development of the allowance for other financial assets and accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other, net: in TEUR 2017 2016 At 1 January 225,654 212,190 Foreign currency adjustment – 763 498 Change in reporting entities 1,035 110 Reversed – 6,353 – 3,639 Charged to expenses 60,419 47,356 Amounts written-off – 43,883 – 30,861 At 31 December 236,108 225,654 Accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other as well as other financial receivables are measured at amortised cost or the lower recoverable amount. A1 Telekom Austria Group has grouped accounts receivable according to their exposure to different risks. Corresponding to the risk involved and based on historic experience, a certain percentage of valuation allowance is determined for each category of accounts receivable (general allowance for groups of similar assets). All accounts receivable past due are therefore impaired by a certain percentage. The accounts receivable not past due and not impaired mainly relate to deferred marketing expenses related to customer loyalty programmes, roaming credits and access fees invoiced in advance. If there is objective evidence that A1 Telekom Austria Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms, an impairment is recorded (specific allowance). Serious financial difficulties of the debtor, the probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered to be indicators that the receivable is impaired. Impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses for trade and other receivables classified as loans and receivables are recognised in bad debt expenses in selling, general and administrative expenses. Bad debt expenses mainly relate to accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other. When a receivable is considered to be irrecoverable, the amount is written off against the receivable. The maximum credit risk of accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other, net by geographic region as well as the split of the allowance are: in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Domestic 818,399 758,242 Foreign 80,000 90,479 Allowances – 219,106 – 212,247 Accounts receivable: Subscribers, distributors and other 679,292 636,474 Thereof Specific allowance 6,799 7,537 General allowance 212,307 204,710 Accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other from A1 Telekom Austria Group’s most significant customer amount to TEUR 1,749 and TEUR 2,979 as of 31 December 2017 and 2016, respectively. Thus, no major concentration of credit risk exists. 58 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 132 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 Fair value of financial instruments According to IFRS 13, the fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. The hierarchy categorises the inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. Level 1 contains financial assets and liabilities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 contains financial assets and liabilities based on inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 contains financial assets and liabilities based on inputs that are unobservable. When determining the fair value, the risk of non-fulfilment is taken into account as well. The following table shows the carrying amounts and the fair values of the financial instruments per class of financial assets: Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 202,390 202,390 457,460 457,460 Accounts receivable: Subscribers, distributors and other 679,292 679,292 636,474 636,474 Receivables due from related parties 944 944 925 925 Other current financial assets 111,631 111,631 93,068 93,068 Other non-current financial assets 49,390 49,390 46,195 46,195 Loans and receivables 841,258 841,258 776,663 776,663 Long-term investments 11,345 11,345 6,914 6,914 Short-term investments 0 0 6,733 6,733 Available-for-sale investments 11,345 11,345 13,647 13,647 Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable: subscribers, distributors and other as well as receivables due from related parties have maturities shorter than one year. As their carrying amounts reported approximate their fair values, no further information on the classification in the fair value hierarchy is provided. Other financial assets essentially relate to instalment sales receivables (see Notes (13) and (19)), the fair values correspond to the present values of the payments related to the assets, taking into account the current interest rates that reflect market and partner-based changes to terms, conditions and expectations and are thus classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of available-for-sale investments are based on market prices. The following table shows the carrying amounts and the fair values of the financial instruments per class of financial liabilities: Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value in TEUR, at 31 December 2017 2016 Financial liabilities Liabilities to financial institutions 17 17 35 35 Bonds 2,533,262 2,818,434 2,781,382 3,093,835 Other current financial liabilities 51,309 51,309 162,838 162,846 Non-current liabilities to financial institutions 0 0 22,000 23,573 Lease obligations 894 894 144 144 Other non-current liabilities 19,942 19,942 829 829 Accounts payable trade 592,032 592,032 553,747 553,747 Payables due to related parties 554 554 6,418 6,418 Accrued interest 29,990 29,990 49,624 49,624 Financial liabilities at amortised cost 3,228,000 3,513,172 3,577,017 3,891,052 Non-current liabilities to financial institutions include their short-term portion. 59 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 133 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 Accounts payable trade and other liabilities have predominantly maturities below one year. Thus their carrying amounts approximate their fair values and no further information on the classification in the fair value hierarchy is provided. The fair values of the quoted bonds (EMTN bonds and Eurobonds) equal the face value multiplied by the price quotations at the reporting date and are thus classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of bank and leasing liabilities and of other financial liabilities are measured at the present values of the cash flows associated with the debt, based on the applicable yield curve and credit spread curve for specific currencies, and are thus classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value hierarchy of financial instruments The following table shows the fair value hierarchy (per class of financial instrument) of financial instruments measured at fair value that reflects the market proximity of the inputs in such fair value measurements: in TEUR Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2017 Available-for-sale & other investments 10,765 580 0 11,345 Financial assets measured at fair value 10,765 580 0 11,345 At 31 December 2016 Available-for-sale & other investments 12,725 923 0 13,647 Financial assets measured at fair value 12,725 923 0 13,647 (33) Companies and Business Combinations Share in capital as of Method of Share in capital as of Method of Name and company domicile 31 December 2017 in % consolidation* 31 December 2016 in % consolidation* Segment Austria A1 Telekom Austria Aktiengesellschaft, Vienna 100.00 FC 100.00 FC Telekom Austria Personalmanagement GmbH, Vienna 100.00 FC 100.00 FC Telekom Austria Beteiligungen GmbH, Vienna 100.00 FC 100.00 FC CableRunner GmbH, Vienna 76.00 FC 76.00 FC CableRunner Austria GmbH & Co.

Goodwill is measured as the difference between the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred as of the acquisition date, the amount of any non-controlling interest, and, in a business combination achieved in stages, the fair value of the acquirer’s previously-held equity interest in the acquiree less the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Non-controlling interests are not measured at fair value but at their share of the fair value of identified net assets of the acquiree. In accordance with IFRS 3.45, goodwill may be adjusted for subsequent changes in the estimated purchase price. If the fair value of the assets acquired exceeds the consideration transferred, the resulting gain is recognised in profit or loss. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. In case of an acquisition achieved in stages, the previously held interest is restated at fair value and any resulting difference is recognised in profit or loss. All transactions with non-controlling interest holders are directly recognised in stockholder’s equity. In the course 61 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 135 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS 2017 2017 of purchase price allocations, fair values of assets and liabilities acquired are determined based on state-of-the-art discounted cash flow methods. The input factors used are categorised as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy defined by IFRS 13. On 15 February 2017, A1 Telekom Austria Group acquired 97.68% of Metronet telekomunikacije via the Croatian subsidiary Vipnet. Metronet is one of the leading alternative fixed business solutions provider in Croatia and offers a wide range of products, focussed on delivering services to the business segment. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date are reported in the segment Croatia: Acquisition of Metronet Fair values on acquisition in TEUR date Property, plant and equipment 28,906 Intangible assets 28,673 Other assets and receivables 9,617 Cash and cash equivalents 130 Bank debt and Leases – 1,993 Deferred tax liabilities – 2,700 Accounts payable – 11,014 Debt due to related parties – 34,147 Net assets acquired 17,471 Non-controlling interests – 405 Goodwill 23,322 Debt paid on behalf of Metronet 34,147 Total purchase consideration 74,536 Purchase price not yet paid – 2,454 Cash and cash equivalents acquired – 130 Net cash outflow 71,951 The factors contributing to goodwill are expectations of positive returns due to a favourable development of the market share in Croatia and cost synergies. Since the acquisition date, Metronet has contributed revenues of TEUR 26,515 and a net income of TEUR 2,201. The gross contractual amounts of acquired receivables are TEUR 5,896. Management’s best estimate at the acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not expected to be collected is TEUR 724, thus the fair value amounts to TEUR 5,172. In the second quarter 2017, the non-controlling interest of Metronet of 2.32% amounting to TEUR 405 was acquired for a consideration of TEUR 972. The excess of the purchase price over the book value of the non-controlling interest is recorded in retained earnings. In the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity, the disposal of the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest is netted with the original addition to non-controlling interest from the business combination. On 1 August 2017, A1 Telekom Austria Group acquired 96.50% of Gomelsky OTTC Garant, Gomel (Garant) via the Belarusian subsidiary velcom. Gomel is the third largest broadband operator in Belarus providing services mainly for residential customers in Gomel, the second largest city in Belarus, and other six cities in the region. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date are reported in the segment Belarus: 62 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 136 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 Acquisition of Garant Fair values on acquisition in TEUR date Property, plant and equipment 5,136 Intangible assets 1,976 Other assets and receivables 316 Cash and cash equivalents 407 Deferred tax liabilities – 100 Accounts payable – 2,755 Net assets acquired 4,980 Non-controlling interests – 174 Goodwill 3,707 Total purchase consideration 8,512 Cash and cash equivalents acquired – 407 Net cash outflow 8,106 The factors contributing to goodwill are expectations of positive returns due to regional synergies, upselling of cable TV customers and further cost synergies. Since the acquisition date, Garant has contributed revenues of TEUR 4,837 and a net loss of TEUR 142. In the fourth quarter 2017, the non-controlling interest in Garant of 2.20% amounting to TEUR 108 was acquired for a consideration of TEUR 263. The excess of the purchase price over the book value of the non-controlling interest is recorded in retained earnings. In the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity, the disposal of the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest is netted with the original addition to non-controlling interest from the business combination. On 30 November 2016, A1 Telekom Austria Group acquired 100% of the Belarusian fixed-line operator Atlant Telecom, renamed velcom ACS after the acquisition, and its subsidiary TeleSet. In 2017, the final purchase consideration was determined. As a result of the final allocation of the purchase consideration, goodwill increased by TEUR 954, other assets were reduced by TEUR 492 and a payment in cash of TEUR 462 was effected. On 30 November 2017, the Belarusian subsidiaries velcom ADC and TeleSet were merged into velcom. Furthermore, Garant was split into Garant Telecom South, containing the core business, and into Gomel Regional Technological Trade Center “Garant”, containing the noncore business. Subsequently, Garant Telecom South was merged into velcom. These transactions do not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. On 4 August 2017, A1 Telekom Austria Group acquired 88.83 % of Akenes S.A. (Akenes), Lausanne, via the subsidiary A1 Digital International GmbH. Akenes offers pure-play Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) open cloud with clear customer focus on Software as a Service (SaaS) providers and Big Data operators. The share purchase agreement includes a put and call option for the exit of the remaining shareholders. The total purchase consideration includes the fair value of the option. Based on the put option and other terms of the contract no non-controlling interest is recorded. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date are reported in Corporate, Other & Eliminations: 63 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 137 Consolidated CONSOLIDATED Financial FINANCIAL Statements STATEMENTS2017 2017 Acquisition of Akenes Fair values on acquisition in TEUR date Property, plant and equipment 739 Intangible assets 1,942 Deferred tax assets 152 Other assets and receivables 107 Cash and cash equivalents 87 Accounts payable – 1,316 Net assets acquired 1,712 Goodwill 7,698 Consideration transferred 9,410 Purchase price not yet paid – 3,111 Cash and cash equivalents acquired – 87 Net cash outflow 6,212 The factors contributing to goodwill are expectations of positive returns due to a favourable development of the market share and cost synergies. The goodwill was allocated to the cash-generating unit A1 Digital. Since the acquisition date, Akenes has contributed revenues of TEUR 972 and a net loss of TEUR 241. Since the effect of the acquired entities on the Consolidated Financial Statements of A1 Telekom Austria Group is not considered significant, no pro-forma information is presented. Acquisition-related costs totalling TEUR 683 are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses. On 1 October 2015, Vip operator, a Macedonian subsidiary of A1 Telekom Austria Group, was merged with Telekom Slovenije’s subsidiary ONE, both operating in Macedonia. A1 Telekom Austria Group held 55% and had sole control over the newly created entity one.Vip, whereas Telekom Slovenije Group held 45%. Based on call and put options of the share purchase agreement and Telekom Slovenije’s exclusion from dividend rights, no non-controlling interest was recognised. On 9 November 2017, the call and put options for the exit of Telekom Slovenije Group were exercised at the amount of TEUR 120,000. A1 Telekom Austria Group now holds 100% of one.Vip. At 31 December 2016, the fair value of the option was reported in short-term financial liabilities (see Note (21)). (34) Commitments and Contingent Assets and Liabilities In June 2014, Mobiltel EAD (Mobiltel) received the tax assessment act related to the taxation treatment of amortisation of brand name and customer base in 2007. Mobiltel appealed to the highest tax authority in Sofia. In December 2014, this appeal was rejected. Mobiltel appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court in Sofia. On 22 February 2017, the Supreme Administrative Court decided in favour of Mobiltel regarding the amortisation of customer base of TEUR 15,060 including interest and rejected the appeal of Mobiltel in the amount of TEUR 7,801 relating to the amortisation of brand name including interest for the year 2007. Furthermore Mobiltel received tax assessments in 2017 for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, which once again included brand name and customer base not to be tax deductible totalling TEUR 62,391 including interest calculated as per 31 December 2017. On 14 July 2017, Mobiltel filed an appeal at the Administrative Court in Sofia concerning the tax assessments for 2008 and 2009 and will appeal subsequently at the Supreme Administrative Court, if necessary. On 26 September 2017, Mobiltel filed an appeal at the competent administrative authority regarding the tax assessment for the year 2010. The decision of the administrative authority was received on 27 November 2017, the decision being negative, thus Mobiltel filed its appeal at the Administrative Court in Sofia on 7 December 2017. A negative decision will be appealed at the Supreme Administrative Court, if necessary. As of 31 December 2017, Mobiltel has issued bank guarantees covering up to TEUR 62,988 covering the tax assessment acts for the financial years 2008, 2009 and 2010 to secure the possible tax claims and interest. The subsequent tax audit covering the years 2011 to 2013 was finalised with tax audit reports received on 29 December 2017. The decision of the Supreme Administrative Court for the year 2007 was not taken into consideration and additional corporate income tax due to nondeductible tax amortisations on both brand name and customer base until 2012 was imposed by the tax authorities as follows: TEUR 15,916 covering corporate income tax 2011 including interest and TEUR 11,936 covering corporate income tax 2012 to 2013 including interest. Tax and interest for brand name for the years 2008 to 2012 is provided for. 64 A1 TELEKOM AUSTRIA GROUP — COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT 2017 138 ConsolidatedFINANCIAL CONSOLIDATED FinancialSTATEMENTS Statements2017 2017 In the normal course of business, A1 Telekom Austria Group is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims, including proceedings under laws and regulations related to network access. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and the outcomes are not predictable with certainty. Consequently, Management is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of the monetary liability or the impact on the financial position of A1 Telekom Austria Group with respect to these matters at 31 December 2017. These matters could materially affect the operating results or cash flows of any quarter when resolved in future periods. However, Management believes that, after final settlement, any monetary liability or financial impact on A1 Telekom Austria Group, beyond such provided for at year-end, would not be material to its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Indirect Scope 2 includes indirect emissions from electric energy and district heating. Scope 3 takes into account the following emissions, which are not included in Scope 2: The costs associated with the upstream emissions from heating energy, electricity and fuels (fleet) and business travel (taxi, plane, train). These upstream emissions have been calculated according to ecoinvent. Emissions from the downstream use of customers’ mobile phones: For the three best-selling devices per subsidiary, a battery voltage of 3.7 volts (V) was assumed and multiplied by the battery capacity [mAh] according to the manufacturer (mAh*V/1,000) = Wh). This is equivalent to the electricity demand per charge cycle per mobile phone. Assuming that a mobile phone is charged once a day, the electricity demand has then been extrapolated for the whole year and subsequently the average electricity demand for the three best-selling devices per subsidiary was determined. These values were multiplied with the number of SIM cards in circulation for each subsidiary. 1) Due to increased data quality key figure “Scope 3” was corrected.
