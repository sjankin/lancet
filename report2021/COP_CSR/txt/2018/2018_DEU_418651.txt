In addition, renewable energies and energy from cogeneration systems will be used to meet heating requirements. Philipp Müller Chairman of the Managing Board I am delighted that the coalition pact of the new German federal government is committed to “the consistent implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) for the economy and human rights”. What is particularly welcome is that the government is itself setting a good example by stating that the NAP should, most importantly, also be used for procurements by public bodies. The international impact of the National Action Plan will be greatly boosted by the fact that companies are obliged to integrate their suppliers in business policies that are focused 6 | UN Global Compact 2018 | VS Vereinigte Spezialmöbelfabriken The 10 principles of the UN Global Compact Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, within the scope of their inﬂuence. Principle 2 Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Principle 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Principle 4 Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. Principle 5 Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour. Principle 6 Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8 Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Principle 9 Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. The United Global Compact is based on ten universally-recognized principles. These principles pertain to four areas: human rights, working standards, environmental protection and the ﬁght against corruption.
