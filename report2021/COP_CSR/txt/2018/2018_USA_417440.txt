2017 Sustainability Report Executive Letter GRI 102-14, 102-18 The Greif Way—which de nes our guiding principles—compels us to use nancial, natural and human resources wisely without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. In 2017, we took steps to further operationalize sustainability throughout our business to create sustainable value for our customers, the environment and Greif stakeholders. Our sustainability agenda, commitments and advancements fully support our vision of, in industrial packaging, be the best performing customer service company in the world. We have three strategic priorities to achieve this vision, which also directly correlate to our sustainability e orts: 1. Invest in our people and teams to foster a strong culture of employee engagement and accountability. 2. Deliver industry leading customer service excellence to achieve superior customer satisfaction and loyalty. 3. Strive for and realize performance excellence and value creation. Peter G. Watson Ole G. Rosgaard We made signi cant progress toward our sustainability agenda this past year: We achieved the best safety record in the history of Greif for the second consecutive year. While we are proud of this progress, our aspiration is to achieve a zerorisk environment which concludes with zero accidents, allowing all of our colleagues to go home both safe and healthy. Our teams enhanced customer service levels across the global enterprise with marked improvement in our Customer Satisfaction Index scores and our Net Promotor Scores. Greif’s long-term success will be de ned by how we earn our customers’ trust and loyalty to pro tably grow our enterprise. We conducted a materiality assessment to identify our highest-priority sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities. This process validated our ongoing sustainability agenda and revealed opportunities. We established and expanded global teams to set 2025 sustainability goals and strategies and to operationalize our aspirations. We emerged from our three-year transformation plan at the end of our scal year. Our 2017 nancial results included increasing operating pro t year-over-year by 20.7 percent and generating in excess of $200 million in Free Cash Flow, which allowed us the nancial exibility to return more than $98 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. Our e orts toward our sustainability goals and agenda recently were recognized by EcoVadis, which awarded Greif the ‘Gold Recognition Level’ in sustainability performance. This achievement places Greif among the top ve percent of all companies evaluated by EcoVadis. While there is more work to do, we are proud of how far we have come, and our progress is a true testament to our commitment to creating shared value through The Greif Way. Ultimately, our goal is to have sustainability embedded into everything we do at Greif. To that end, and in alignment with our three strategic priorities, we will continue to engage and collaborate with our key stakeholders to incorporate sustainable activities. These activities include gauging our company culture by leveraging the Gallup Q12 Employee Engagement Survey, collaborating with our customers and suppliers to continue advancing circular economy principles and introducing a disciplined growth strategy. We will also begin tracking progress and reporting against our 2025 sustainability goals. We are pleased to report on our sustainability progress in this ninth annual sustainability report, which is in full accordance with the GRI Standards Core guidelines and serves as our annual Communication on Progress to the United Nations Global Compact. Our vision, focus and progress are exciting for us and would not be possible without the dedication, hard work and support of our Greif colleagues around the world. Looking forward, our commitments are clear. We have important work to do, and we look forward to continuing our progress and sharing our results in future reports. Best Regards, Peter G.

The board receives annual updates from the Senior Vice President and Group President, Rigid Industrial Packaging & Services, Americas and Global Sustainability on behalf of our 11-member Sustainability Steering Committee. The Committee, which includes representatives from Greif’s Executive Leadership Team, is tasked with further integrating sustainability into our strategy and operations, reviewing our sustainability progress and priorities biannually and ensuring accountability at all levels of our organization. The Board of Directors holds the Sustainability Committee accountable for reaching annual goals, which impacts the remuneration of Committee members and determines the level of funding for Greif’s sustainability programs. The Steering Committee guides the activities of our six-member Sustainability Management Team, which works with topic teams consisting of representatives from each region and business unit to drive facility level projects and priorities. SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE Corporate Policies GRI 102-16 We believe that behavior in uences culture and culture determines performance. Our culture—and ethics and compliance expectations—are based on the principles set forth in The Greif Way. We practice these principles every day through the policies that govern our organization. Anti-bribery and Sanctions Policy Environmental Health and Safety Policy Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policy Equal Employment Opportunity & Diversity Policy Antitrust/Competition Compliance Policy Fair Treatment of Others Policy Child Labor Policy Human Rights Policy Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Insider Trading Policy Contractor Safety Policy Records Management & Retention Policy Corporate Governance Guidelines Talent Management Policy Economic and Trade Sanctions Policy Tobacco-Free Workplace Policy Partnerships GRI 102-12 Greif seeks to actively engage with organizations to increase the reach of our sustainability e orts. Some of our key partnerships include: Operation Clean Sweep To expand our commitment to reducing waste, in 2017, Greif became a signatory to Operation Clean Sweep (OCS), an international program originally designed by the plastics industry and supported by The British Plastics Federation and PlasticsEurope to prevent pellet, ake and powder loss and the potential introduction of pellets to the marine environment where they create both a litter problem and a threat to sea life and wildlife. The essence of OCS is to help each segment of the plastics industry, including resin producers, transporters, bulk terminal operators and plastics processors, to implement good housekeeping and pellet, ake and powder containment practices towards achieving zero pellet, ake and powder loss. Greif plastics production facilities in Europe and North America will start auditing their operations in 2018 and implement solutions that t best their sites and processes to prevent pellet loss. Pollinator Partnership In 2009, our Soterra operations embarked on a multi-year study with the Pollinator Partnership and NAPCC, the world's foremost experts on pollination issues, to learn how pollinators impact wildlife food availability on timber landscapes, the added value of hosting honey bees and beekeepers on the landscape and to discover the best management practice for ecosystem services on forest landscapes.

SmartWay The SmartWay Transport Partnership is an innovative collaboration between the freight industry and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). It is a market-driven partnership aimed at helping businesses move goods in the cleanest, most e cient way possible. Its purpose is to accelerate the availability, adoption and market penetration of advanced fuel-e cient technologies and operational practices in the freight supply chain, while helping companies save fuel, lower costs and reduce adverse environmental impacts. To improve e ciency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our vehicle eet, Greif joined the SmartWay Transport Partnership in 2009. For more information about our partnership, please see our Climate Strategy, Energy & Emissions page. UN Global Compact Integrity and respect for people are Core Values for Greif, and we believe that social and environmental responsibility are aligned and essential for long-term sustainability. The United Nations Global Compact is a voluntary strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally-accepted Principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. We consider these principles to be a natural extension of our Business Code of Conduct and Ethics, which outlines our commitment to be open, honest and trustworthy in all of our dealings with all stakeholders. Our policies and procedures incorporate our commitment to human rights, freedom of association, excellence in environment and health and safety. In April 2016, Greif became a signatory to the UN Global Compact, con rming our commitment to these Principles. Each year, we publish our Communication on Progress on the Ten Principles of the compact. World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greif is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a CEO-led global association of approximately 200 of the most environmentally-responsible companies in the world. Member companies are committed to providing business leadership as a catalyst for change toward sustainable development. Members are drawn from more than 30 countries and 20 major industrial sectors. We signed on to the organization's Manifesto for Energy E ciency in Buildings (EEB).

All Rights Reserved. Stakeholder Engagement & Materiality GRI 102-49 Since publishing our rst sustainability report in 2007, our sustainability e orts have evolved considerably. In 2017, we took a signi cant step forward by completing our rst materiality assessment and publishing a GRI Core report. We talked with stakeholders along our value chain and conducted industry research to determine signi cant impacts, risks, and opportunities that are most relevant to Greif and its stakeholders. With this in mind, we are expanding our report to include a broader set of topics. Based on the outcomes of this process, Greif also set new 2025 goals, which are discussed in this report. Value Chain GRI 102-9 Greif’s value chain consists of raw material suppliers, transportation and distribution partners, customers, end-of-life services and external stakeholders that in uence our activities. Stakeholder Engagement Process GRI 102-40, 102-42, 102-43 Stakeholders were selected by reviewing Greif’s value chain and identifying representatives from various stakeholder groups that can speak to our impacts, risks, and opportunities. We engaged cross-functional leaders across Greif, Greif’s Board of Directors, customers, investors, community members, community partners, suppliers and sustainability experts through interviews and surveys. We supplemented our direct engagement with a review of stakeholders’ publicly available information (e.g., peer sustainability reports, ESG analyst reports, industry association websites, peer benchmarking) and validated our ndings with leadership to determine the most material topics to our business. Material Topics GRI 102-44, 102-46, 102-47 During the stakeholder engagement process, we narrowed 32 environmental, social, product, governance and economic topics down to the 16 topics that were the highest priorities for our stakeholders. We plan to refresh our materiality assessment every 3–4 years to understand how our stakeholder’s priorities and expectations evolve.

DELIVERING SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE Product Quality Establishing quality control standards to meet customer expectations with every order and every delivery. Why Product Quality Matters GRI 416: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 Product quality is non-negotiable for our customers. Our nancial success depends on our ability to consistently supply high-quality, defect-free products that meet applicable speci cations from all Greif manufacturing facilities. Governance We evaluate product quality based on the structure and integrity of our product and compliance with applicable speci cations for each item we manufacture. Currently, 1.3 84 percent of Greif’s 152 global production sites are ISO 9001 certi ed—a quality management designation. We manage product quality centrally through our quality standards and communicate them to our production network through our integrated quality system called Greif QS, a suite of applications that set consistent processes at our facilities. Some of these applications include: Corrective Action Rate Complaint Response/Corrective Action Systems Internal Corrective and Preventive Action Systems Reduced by 32 percent since 2015 in our RIPS North America business. Audit Management System Calibration Systems Supplier Management Systems Management Review System Document and Training Management Systems Greif leverages critical control points throughout the manufacturing process to identify and correct deviations from product speci cations before a potential defect signi cantly impacts production and reaches the customer. When a potential quality issue is detected, it is reported into our ERP system and corrective procedures are documented and communicated throughout our network. When recurring quality problems are identi ed, we initiate a Product/Process Audit which is executed by an internal team of quality, engineering and product representatives. During the audit, the team assesses a facility against process, standards, equipment and tools used during production to resolve the quality issue and identify process improvements. We track Corrective Action Rate (CAR) and Order Reliability Rate as indicators of product quality. Performance is tracked monthly and reported to regional Presidents, Vice Presidents and General Managers. In 2018, we will advance our use of control applications, tools and systems and engrain quality control at the cultural level through behavioral-based quality observations. We will continue to standardize our manufacturing processes in support of our business continuity e orts. We will implement severity ratings to customer complaints, allowing us to better prioritize product quality improvements and increase our focus on achieving food safety standards throughout our manufacturing base. Four additional productions sites are planned to achieve ISO 9001 certi cation by the end of 2018.

In response, we initiated a Zero-Leak Program to eliminate leaks from our products. When a leak complaint was received, it was escalated to the Regional Vice President and General Manager and our engineering team was tasked with developing a concrete resolution to the problem and disseminate it to all facilities. Our focus on reducing leaks led to a 56 percent reduction in leak complaints. © Copyright 2018 Greif. All Rights Reserved. DELIVERING SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE Customer Service Excellence Leading through service, reliability and creating a customer-centric culture. Why Customer Service Excellence Matters Customer Service Excellence 2016: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 For more than 140 years, the world’s most important products have traveled safely around the world in Greif industrial packaging. Customers rely on our understanding of their business and our ability to provide reliable, quality packaging at a good value, with just-in-time delivery and technical expertise. Delivering on these expectations is central to our vision of, in industrial packaging, be the best performing customer service company in the world. Our highest priority is continuing to nd ways to serve our customers better. Governance Customer service is managed by all Greif businesses on a daily basis. Greif manages customer service through our Customer Service Excellence Team led by our Chief 24 Administrative O cer. Comprised of 10 representatives from various business units and corporate departments, the team meets monthly to advance customer service initiatives and track progress on Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) and Net Promoter Score (NPS)—our measures of customer satisfaction and likelihood to recommend Greif to others. The team collaborates with all global business units to drive processes, engage cross-functional leaders, share best practices, advance Customer Service Excellence communications and develop curriculum and training to equip our employees with Award Winners the skills and behaviors needed to provide a best-in-class service experience to our internal and external customers each and every day. Honoring our facilities that demonstrated best-in-class customer service performance throughout 2017. In 2017, we piloted a Customer Service Excellence training workshop with our entire customer service representative team in North America and completed three Selling in Greif Workshops with 91 Greif sales employees. We realized continued improvement in our NPS score, outperforming the all company average of 44, as reported by NPS Benchmarks*. In 2018, we will build on our customer service culture, expand our customer service training globally and to departments serving internal customers and integrate best practices from other industries into our training.

Why Environmental Management Systems Matter GRI 307: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 Adherence to environmental laws and regulations is foundational to Greif’s ongoing operations. A proactive, e ective and uniform environmental management system demonstrates to our stakeholders that we have a comprehensive understanding of our regulatory obligations and consistent ability to meet them. Governance In 2011, Greif launched our proprietary online Compliance Management System (CMS) to track and monitor compliance with certain laws and regulations, including 17 environmental compliance related to energy, emissions, water and waste in our facilities. The CMS is administered by our Environment, Health and Safety team (EHS), led by our Vice President of EHS and Operations for North America, and is active in 50 of our 55 North American facilities.* Management at each facility completes site speci c compliance tasks and monitors deadlines within the system. If a task deadline is missed, it is escalated through management, ultimately reaching ISO14001 Certiﬁed Facilities our CEO if not resolved in a timely manner. In addition to our CMS in North America, our global FPS, PPS and RIPS production facilities maintain a variety of quality, safety We take our responsibility towards environmental standards and environmental certi cations, including ISO, FSSC, OHSAS, and SQF.

Emission data is assured through Bureau Veritas. *To standardize emissions and inform year-over-year progress toward our 2025 goal, our 2014 emissions data has been restated to correct several facilities’ eGRID regions. Total does not include 246,000 metric tons of CO2e from biogenic sources. **Our percent reduction in emissions per unit of production dropped from FY 2015 to FY 2016 due to increased fugitive emissions from our Riverville, Virginia, paper mill and total emissions from our Massillon, Ohio, paper mill. Updated emissions and global warming potential factors also contributed to this change. Highlight Stories Advancing Renewable Energy Renewables, such as solar and wind energy, will play a major role in addressing the challenges of climate change over the long term. We are committed to testing and expanding the use of renewable energy technologies across our global operations when doing so is economically viable and in the best interest of our stakeholders. We have installed more than 2,000 solar panels in seven North American facilities, delivering 2.7 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of energy and saving more than $100,000 annually. In 2016, three of our largest Brazilian plants began sourcing their energy partly through renewable resources. In 2017, we expanded the program to three additional plants in Brazil, reducing emissions by 70 percent and saving $1.4 million USD annually. In April 2017, Greif’s Shanghai RIPS facility completed installation of solar panels, converting 15.4 percent of the facility’s electricity to a renewable © Copyright 2018 Greif.

We include SmartWay certi cation during our new carrier certi cation process. Greif’s SmartWay-approved carrier base accounts for 74.7 percent of miles traveled. From 2014 to 2016, we have saved over 187,000 tons of CO2 mass emissions through the use of SmartWay carriers. Global Energy Projects In 2017, Greif completed over 30 energy e ciency projects estimated to generate more than $1.9 million in savings and reduce energy consumption by greater than 7.2 million kWh, annually. Projects included installation of LED lighting, equipment upgrades and improved waste recovery systems. Greif also works to reduce energy use in our corporate operations. Greif’s IT team has virtualized servers and retired legacy equipment leading to 10 percent savings since 2015. REDUCING OUR FOOTPRINT Water Optimizing the use and improving the quality of water in our operations. GRI 303: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; GRI 306: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; 306-1 Why Water Matters As global concerns over water scarcity rise, Greif is at risk of higher water supply costs and potential shortages in water-stressed regions. Ensuring water consumption is responsibly managed, and water is properly treated and returned to its sources, leads to operational e ciencies, lowers operating costs and minimizes the impacts of regulations, water supply shortages and any community-related concerns. Governance GRI 303-2, 306-1 Greif’s Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Policy provides global guidelines for water conservation to improve water e ciencies in existing operations and 12.2% incorporate water management in planning for future projects and technology investments. Each Greif facility is expected to manage water locally in accordance with our EHS policy. Through analyses of Greif’s water use, we determined that 90 percent of Greif’s water use and impact is from our two Paper Packaging and Services (PPS) Reduction in Biochemical containerboard mills in Riverville, Virginia, and Massillon, Ohio, drawing water from Oxygen Demand the James and Tuscarawas Rivers, respectively. Total withdrawal from these sources is less than two percent of water ow. Our e orts in water quality have allowed us to already meet our 10% reduction by 2025 goal. Riverville is equipped with a water treatment facility, and Massillon returns water to a publicly owned treatment works daily. In total, Greif returns 90 percent of water to local sources. Water is reused numerous times through the facilities before being treated and returned to sources. While Greif’s water impact is predominately in our PPS operations, we do operate in some water-stressed regions in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. In these regions, local e orts to curb water use are underway. In 2018, we will continue our e orts to recycle and reuse water through our PPS operations and spread best practices on consumption in water-stressed regions. Goals & Progress In 2017, Greif announced a 2020 goal of 10 percent reduction in kilograms of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) per metric ton of production, from a 2014 baseline of 1.47, in our PPS operations. Our 2017 materiality process led to the creation of new 2025 goals. We have restated our BOD goal as a 2025 goal. 2025 Goal: Reduce Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) discharged in kilograms by 10 percent per metric ton of production from Riverville and Massillon mills using a 2014 baseline by the end of scal year 2025. Progress: Since 2014, we have reduced BOD per metric ton of production by 12.2 percent. Highlight Stories Improving Our Wastewater In 2017, Greif’s Massillon mill completed construction of a water treatment facility to signi cantly reduce the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the plant’s discharge water before being returned to municipal treatment plants. High BOD levels promote bacteria growth, release odors and must be controlled using chemicals. Since installing the treatment facility, we reduced BOD discharged to the municipal system by 96 percent, contributing to our 2025 BOD goal. This also eliminated several chemicals that were previously needed to control bacteria from our operations, improving water quality in the community. © Copyright 2018 Greif. All Rights Reserved. REDUCING OUR FOOTPRINT Waste Working towards a zero waste to landﬁll organization. Why Waste Matters GRI 301: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; GRI 306: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 Greif views reducing operational waste, packaging waste and waste to land ll as a core component of operating an e cient business. Our waste reduction mindset results in reduced material use and transportation costs, and provides an opportunity to better serve our customers with lighter weight and more cost-e ective products. Since 2012, we have saved more than $560,000 in our RIPS North American operations through reduced waste disposal and materials costs, and transportation and logistics e ciencies. We also take seriously the reduction, management and proper handling of hazardous materials. Governance 47 In 2016, Greif established our North American Waste Team, comprised of representatives from each business unit, and set a waste baseline for each facility. In 2017, Greif expanded this team globally to include 22 representatives from all regions, set global waste baselines, established global trackable waste steam data and identi ed plant-level waste streams. Members of the waste team hold Facilities Achieving Zero Waste individual facility management accountable for reducing and managing waste at each facility in their region. Waste reduction is factored into facility management’s to Landﬁll annual performance reviews, and employees are engaged in waste-reduction programs.

REDUCING OUR FOOTPRINT Supply Chain Management Working with our suppliers to create shared value. Why Supply Chain Management Matters GRI 301: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; Supply Chain Management: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 Greif’s commitment to sustainability extends beyond our own operations. We expect our suppliers to operate with the same integrity, responsibility and commitment to sustainability that we do. Carefully managing our supply chain allows us to minimize potential environmental and social risks and provides an opportunity to optimize material use and develop solutions that our customers value. Governance Greif’s supply chain includes direct materials such as steel, resins and paint, and indirect materials such as services, consumables and transportation. Each month, $1.2M Greif’s Global Sourcing and Supply Chain team tracks improvements in material costs, deal terms, working capital and inventory in the Greif Business System (GBS). Expectations of our suppliers are outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct. We score each of our top 20 suppliers on a supplier scorecard that considers cost, quality, delivery, value-added services, technical support and environmental and social criteria. We track supplier scorecard performance in Greif’s Quality Control Savings from Gauge System, allowing us to tie quality issues to speci c suppliers.

To assess con ict risk throughout our supply chain, we requirements resulted in signi cant savings in 2017. validate our Con ict Minerals Policy and publish our Con ict Minerals Report annually. In accordance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, Greif takes measures to prevent and eliminate forced labor in our direct supply chain, outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct and Transparency in Supply Chain Disclosure. In accordance with our Environmental Health and Safety Policy, Greif works to identify and implement chemical substitutions to remove hazardous waste, including VOCs, from our operations. Since 2015, we have replaced ve percent of potentially hazardous paint and steel coil material volume used in our operations with safer alternatives, such as our Tri-Sure Vreeland linings and our water-based acrylic paints. In 2017, Greif formed the Sustainability Procurement team—comprised of representatives from each region—to globally evaluate the potential for reducing material use and identifying more sustainable raw materials alternatives. In 2017, 100 percent of new suppliers were provided access, and expected to adhere to, our Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2018, we will incorporate sustainability into the GBS, allowing us to identify any project with positive sustainability impacts. We will better integrate environmental and social criteria into our supplier audits globally and benchmark industry best practices to improve our supplier scorecards. We will place an increased emphasis on combining shipments coming in and out of our facilities and more e ectively identifying opportunities to backhaul shipments. Goals & Progress In 2017, we set 2025 goals to: Using a scal year 2017 baseline, reduce raw materials/logistical costs used to produce current product o ering by one percent. Move from non-green (oil-based, more energy intensive) to green material sourcing if it is economically feasible and doing so provides high quality products to our customers. We will begin reporting progress against these goals in 2018. Highlight Stories EcoVadis In 2017, Greif earned Gold Recognition level from EcoVadis for superior Corporate Social Responsibility performance.

Our culture—and ethics and compliance expectations—are based on the principles set forth in The Greif Way. We practice these principles every day and formalize them in the policies that govern our organization. Governance Greif maintains a broad set of ethicsand compliance-related policies: Anti-Bribery Compliance Policy Corporate Governance Guidelines Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policy Economic and Trade Sanctions Policy Antitrust/Competition Compliance Policy Fair Treatment of Others Policy Child Labor Policy Human Rights Policy Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Insider Trading Policy Our policies are managed, reviewed and enforced by a team comprised of human resources, legal and nance representatives. We review our policies regularly and update them as necessary to strengthen language and address emerging areas of risk for the organization. We implement our policies through training and audits. We require Greif’s 2,200 manager-level and above employees to complete policy training. All of Greif’s facilities that are material to its nancial statements receive annual SOX audits and all of Greif’s facilities are subjected to risk-based audits at least once every ve years. Greif maintains an Alert Line, posted at every Greif facility, allowing any employee to anonymously report ethics and compliance violations. Audit results and Alert Line reports are prepared in conjunction with a third party and provided to Greif’s Audit Committee quarterly. In 2017, we updated our Antitrust Policy, introduced our Human Rights Policy, and launched training on our Anti-Bribery policy. We completed 145 audits and internal control tests of our 180 auditable entities. In 2018, we will begin expanding our Anti-Bribery, Code of Conduct and Fair Treatment of Others trainings to reach 100 percent of employees with access to computers by the end of FY2025, introduce our Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policies and update our Fair Treatment of Others and Insider Trading Policies.

Governance 200 In 2017, Greif established the We Got Chu program, administered by representatives from sales, marketing, customer service, operations and logistics in conjunction with business unit leadership. The program manages risk and business continuity through inventory and production redundancy capabilities, facility risk assessments and proactive labor relations. Sites in 40+ Countries Greif ensures continuity with our suppliers by multi-sourcing raw materials. We Our global reach is near you. have a robust Sales and Operations Planning process (S&OP) and centralized inventory management, allowing for visibility into raw and nished good materials across our facilities. Greif’s global network with approximately 200 locations allows us to manufacture identical products at multiple sites, giving us the exibility to shift production based on inventory, customer needs or in the unlikely event a shutdown would occur. Every two years Greif’s highest risk facilities are third-party audited to assess natural disaster and safety risks. Based on audit ndings, Greif makes capital investments to address those risks, such as the completed upgrades to the re protection system in our Alsip, Illinois facility in 2017. To ensure positive labor relations and business continuity, senior leadership proactively establishes relationships with union leadership and members in each plant. Collective bargaining agreements are managed on a two-to-three-year horizon, not just when a negotiation must occur. Despite our e orts for positive relations, in 2014 Greif experienced a labor strike and an illegal occupation at an FPS facility in Turkey. In response, Greif conducted extensive focus groups with management and workers to understand the core issues, then implemented hiring practices, compensation and bene t plans, safety processes and training in response to the concerns. Greif enabled the workers to unionize and hired them as direct Greif employees, a signi cant departure from common practices in the Turkish manufacturing industry, where most workers are employed as sub-contractors. From May 2014 to June 2015, Greif directly hired and unionized 1,300 workers, the largest non-government direct hiring in Turkey. Greif added a Compliance Manager at the facility, enabling us to maintain a daily working relationship with the workforce. During the occupation, we shifted production to other facilities, allowing us to maintain our customer commitments during this di cult time. Greif is now seen as a model employer in Turkey, as evidenced by turnover reducing from 36 percent in 2014 to 12 percent in 2017. Our Turkey operations have participated in our global employee engagement e orts since 2016. In 2018, we will implement the Gallup Q12 Employee Engagement Survey, providing a more formalized forum to collect feedback from our Global operations, including Turkey. To learn more, please visit Talent Attraction, Development & Retention. In 2018, we will upgrade our S&OP globally with enhanced forecasting and inventory management capabilities, standardize our formal business continuity protocol, We Got Chu, and continue our third-party audits and capital investments, including completion of ventilation, receiving dock and dust collection system improvements. Highlight Stories Maintaining Our Commitments Through Harvey and Irma In 2017, Greif’s North American operations were hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, resulting in $5.3 million of impact to our business. Despite the impact, our risk management and business continuity practices allowed us to meet our customer commitments during recovery without declaring force majeure. Greif supported our directly impacted employees by continuing to pay wages during the week production was down, paying for hotels and rental cars and setting up a Wish List for employees in North America to purchase items for their peers.

From recruitment to succession planning, our talent management programs span our global operations. Since 2014, 214 employees have participated in LEAP, our three-week leadership development program. Governance Talent attraction, development and retention is governed by Greif’s Talent Management Policy, which sets global standards for recruitment, performance management, career planning and training and development activities. Each region is responsible for implementing the policy in accordance with country-speci c laws and regulations. We view performance management as a process for communicating employee performance expectations, maintaining ongoing performance dialogue and conducting annual performance appraisals. Competency frameworks are in place to enable the assessment and development of the knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviors of all Greif employees. All professional, clerical and administrative employees—approximately 20 percent of Greif’s workforce—participate in an annual Performance Development Review consisting of a self and manager evaluation of their performance against relevant competencies. In 2017, we achieved 100 percent participation of eligible employees in the program. Greif completes a formal succession planning process annually for all Director-level and above roles. We view training and development as a critical aspect of our commitment to continuous improvement set forth in The Greif Way. Greif’s global Leadership Development and Training catalogue contains over 220 courses on topics ranging from computer literacy to job-speci c technical training. The courses are available to any employee with computer access through the Greif Learning Network, Skillport. Mandatory training is tracked through the network, ensuring compliance to internal policies and applicable regulatory requirements. Global training is supplemented with regional programs required to address locally relevant needs. Since 2014, Greif has measured organizational wellness and engagement through our Organizational Health Index (OHI) scores, which are a component of our CEO scorecard. In 2017, Greif established a Global Talent Management Strategy and philosophy. We launched an internship program—hiring nine interns into corporate and professional functional roles—and implemented an onboarding program in North America—including 3060and 90day touchpoints and new hire focus groups—to better understand our new employee experience. In 2018, we will establish a team led by a corporate director with regional representatives in each region to oversee our talent management strategy, 100% philosophy and policy. We will expand our internship program to over 20 participants. We will begin using the Gallup Q12 Employee Engagement Survey, replacing the OHI, expand our onboarding program globally and modify our Performance Review Process to occur quarterly rather than annually.

Why Health & Safety Matters GRI 403: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; 403-1, 403-4 Employees deserve to work in an environment that promotes their health and safety, which makes it a top priority for Greif. Since 2007, our commitment to employee safety and lowering Medical Case Rate (MCR) not only signi cantly reduced workplace injuries, it also created approximately $53 million in business value, through the avoidance of injury claims. Governance To promote a culture of safety, we follow a global Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Policy reinforced by regional EHS policies for all facilities. The policy is managed by our Safety Leadership Team. In 2017, this team was expanded to include representatives from each region and business unit and reports into group and division presidents. Safety committees comprised of management and laborers are in place at every Greif facility, ensuring our policies represent the entirety of Greif’s workforce. Every facility is third-party audited every two years to ensure compliance with all policies, laws and regulations. Health and safety tasks and incidents are tracked in our Compliance Management System (CMS) at the facility level. Greif has over 20 policies to manage occupational safety, applicable to all union and non-union employees in our workforce. Our Contractor Safety Policy ensures safety of our contractors. In 2017, we enhanced our ability to record and track safety observations and close calls by integrating tracking of these events into our CMS. In 2016, Greif formed a Serious Injury and Fatality (SIF) global workgroup to investigate industry research surrounding SIF events and ways to advance our own program for addressing them. In 2017, we introduced our Life Changing Injury and Fatality Elimination (LIFE) program globally, aimed at better understanding and tracking potentially life-threatening close-call safety events. The group uncovered that pedestrian and powered truck events pose the greatest risk of life-threatening injury in our facilities. As a result, we introduced our PIT-Pedestrian Policy to protect against the risks of lift truck operations. Our commitment to safety training continued in 2017. We delivered 16.34 hours of safety training per production employee, an increase from 14.4 in 2015 and 16.2 in 16.3 2016. Our GROW Safety Leadership and Development Academy expanded, training 239 managers in North America. In RIPS North America, we reinforce safety training daily through our Commitment-Based Safety program, where employees identify personal risks associated with their role, verbally evaluate their safety performance, rank their safety performance and make personal commitments to take responsibility for their actions. Average Safety Training Hours In 2018, we will continue our focus on providing training, instilling proper employee Each production employee in our business receives safety behaviors and improving our close-call observations and reporting. Our LIFE training, ensuring our safety culture is understood and program will address load-related safety risks and allow users to identify the practiced every day. severity of an incident when reporting in CMS. Each region will be expected to conduct localized LIFE studies and report priority risks to the Safety Leadership Team. Each production employee in our business receives safety training, ensuring our safety culture is understood and practiced every day. Goals & Progress Greif has two Health & Safety goals: Reduce Medical Case Rate by 10 percent annually to achieve 100 percent safety—Medical Case Rate Zero—in the long term. Every plant will have a collaborative environmental health and safety committee consisting of both management and workers by the end of scal year 2025. We established our environmental health and safety committee goal in 2017 and will report progress in our 2018 report. Performance GRI 403-2 Since 2007, MCR has improved from 3.51 to 0.95, a 73 percent reduction. From 2016 to 2017, we achieved 1 percent reduction in MCR. Since 2011, LWCR has improved from 1.3 to 0.55 a 58 percent reduction. From 2016 to 2017, we achieved a 3.5 percent reduction in LWCR. EMPLOYEE HEALTH & SAFETY MCR LWCR *MCR, or Medical Case Rate, measures the number of recordable injuries or illnesses per 100 full-time employees in a 12-month period. **LWCR, or Lost Workday Case Rate, measures the number of recordable injuries or illnesses resulting in lost workdays per 100 full-time employees in a 12-month period. Highlight Stories Employee Assistance Program (EAP) All Greif employees in Canada and the United States have access to an employee assistance program (EAP). Greif’s EAP is a con dential work-based intervention program o ering employees and their families informational services designed to enhance emotional, mental and general psychological well-being. The program provides preventive and proactive interventions for the early detection, identi cation and/or resolution of both work and personal problems that may adversely a ect performance and well-being. These problems and issues may include but are not limited to, relationships, health, trauma, substance abuse, gambling and other addictions, nancial problems, depression, anxiety disorders, psychiatric disorders, communication problems and coping with change. Chairman’s Safety Excellence Award Each facility that achieves an MCR of less than one and third-party EHS audit score of 90 percent* or greater wins the Chairman’s Safety Excellence Award. Globally, 64 of our 152 production facilities received the award, an increase of 28 percent from 2016. *Sites receiving rst time audits are only required to achieve a score of 80 percent to qualify Medical Case Rate We proudly announce that in 2017 we once again achieved our lowest MCR in the history of the company. Eighty-two percent of facilities achieved an MCR less than one and 59 percent of facilities achieved an MCR of zero. Our continued improvement in MCR and LWCR is proof that our preventative programs, hazard elimination and training and behavior programs are having signi cant impact on occupational safety. © Copyright 2018 Greif.

Why Human Rights & Fair Labor Practices Matters GRI 102-41; 405: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; 406: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; 407: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; 407-1; 408: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; 409: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; 412: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 Greif participates in a labor-intensive industry. Our commitment to upholding international human rights and fair labor practice standards is inseparable from our commitments to the health and safety of our employees. Ensuring these rights are maintained throughout our supply chain ensures we are working with responsible supply partners and provides our customers with con dence in our responsible sourcing practices. Governance Gold Greif upholds human rights and fair labor practices in accordance with the UN Global Compact Principles and International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We manage our commitment to these Principles internally and in our supply chain through our Anti-harassment, Child Labor, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Equal Employment Opportunity and Recognition from EcoVadis Diversity, Fair Treatment of Others, Human Rights and Supplier Code of Conduct policies. Received for our commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility, placing us in the top ve percent of all We enforce these policies in our operations through risk assessments, awareness assessed suppliers. training, age and legal working status veri cations, localized gender equality procedures and whistleblower procedures. Greif’s global Alert Line is publicly posted in all facilities for employees to anonymously report potential human rights violations. Complaints are immediately routed to a regional vice president for resolution. We set expectations of our suppliers through our Supplier Code of Conduct, and assess supplier performance through our EcoVadis assessment. Within Greif's workforce, 56 percent of employees participate in collective bargaining agreements (CBA). CBA’s are managed individually in each region with oversight by Greif’s Human Resources and Legal teams. For more information on Greif’s approach to labor relations, please see Risk Management & Business Continuity. In 2017, Greif received 69 human rights and fair labor practice complaints through our Alert Line. We investigated and resolved 88 percent of complaints. We released our Human Rights Policy formalizing our human rights expectations internally and for each of our stakeholders. We updated all global policies to increase our global perspective and strengthen our position on anti-harassment, equal opportunity and fair treatment of others. In 2018, we will formalize a human rights impact assessment to identify actual and potential impacts across the supply chain and release our policies in 12 languages. Goals & Progress In 2017, Greif established three Human Rights & Fair Labor Practice goals: 100 percent of our operations will be subject to internal human rights reviews, measured on a rolling cycle, by the end of scal year 2025. 100 percent of employees will be trained in human rights policies and procedures by the end of scal year 2025. Using scal year 2017 baseline, increase the proportion of women in management positions by 25 percent by the end of scal year 2025. We will measure these goals via a quarterly scorecard and report our progress in our 2018 report. © Copyright 2018 Greif. All Rights Reserved.

Why Innovation Matters Innovation 2016: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; GRI 301: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 We view innovation as an opportunity to advance sustainable packaging and circular economy principles, which reduces our footprint and meets the desires of our customers—safer, lighter weight products and less freight costs. We look across the value chain—from the extraction of raw materials to our products’ end-of-life—to nd product and process improvement opportunities. This is not only the right thing to do, it also provides a competitive advantage. Governance Our innovation e orts focus on transforming our product portfolio by developing sustainable packaging solutions based on a set of eight environmental, social, and nancial sustainability criteria. Through internally-initiated solutions and collaboration with customers, our innovation e orts focus on dematerialization—producing products that are lighter weight, utilize less virgin raw materials and more recycled content—and green material substitution—identifying safer materials to produce our products, including bio-based materials—while continuing to meet performance requirements. In 2017, Greif formed a Global Innovation Team which includes members from around the world to discuss our approach and share e orts. We also formed our Sustainable Innovation Team to drive innovation through new product development, quality and process improvements, commercializing previous Greif innovations and collaborating with customers to meet their needs. Led by our Vice President of Integration and Product Integrity, the Sustainable Innovation Team consists of 22 members and represents each region and business unit. The team meets quarterly to track progress on performance metrics, discuss key innovation initiatives and strategies and share best practices and highlight stories. In 2018, we will create closer working relationships with our customers to address innovation and align the e orts of our Global Innovation Team and Sustainable $1.2M Innovation Team to this work. Through the combined e orts of these teams, we will continue to increase the number of sustainable products in our portfolio.

In 2018, we will report progress on these goals, begin reporting the number of sustainable packaging products in our portfolio and formalize additional innovation goals. Highlight Stories Innovating Food Safety In 2014, Greif’s Flexible Product & Services segment was approached by multiple leading producers within the infant food and formula industry to develop solutions to meet changing requirements for product handling in the industry. Greif worked with milk powder producers and stakeholders throughout the supply chain to understand the developing industry regulations. In partnership with our key customers and suppliers, we implemented solutions to meet their requirements. In 2017, Greif opened a food safety center of excellence in Belgium featuring an ISO Class 7 clean room. The facility set the highest hygiene and food safety standards in the industry and has made Greif the supplier of choice for exible packaging in the infant food and formula market. Agribusiness Virtuous Cycle © Copyright 2018 Greif. All Rights Reserved. Greif’s Cimplast operations in Brazil developed a process that uses DuPontTM Fusabond®, a polymer compatibilizer, to turn waste into automotive lubricant bottles, rigid pipes and other products. The “Agribusiness Virtuous Cycle” is a full-cycle recycling system that diverts multilayer plastic agrochemical bottle waste from land lls and remakes it into high-value products. Through this process, over 457,000 tons of agrochemical plastic bottles have been collected*, saving 1.3 million barrels of crude oil and 572,000 tons of CO2 equivalents. This innovation was honored as a Gold winner in the 23rd DuPont Awards for Packaging Innovation. *2017 gures estimated by INPEV Customizing Caps and Closures Greif’s Tri-Sure business works closely with our customers to ensure our caps and closures meet their industry-speci c needs. After working with our agricultural customers, we launched the Plasticap Agro, which features a child-resistant closure system and tamper evident ring, Micro-Porous Venting and fully customizable design options, catering to the speci c needs of their market. Life Cycle Assessments Life cycle assessments (LCAs) are key to Greif’s innovation process. LCA is a technique that evaluates the environmental impact of products over their entire lifetime including raw material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, use and disposal or recycling. This information helps us understand the overall environmental pro le of our existing products, where and how our impacts occur, target improvements in materials and products and to prioritize analysis of processes, components, and materials that have the greatest environmental impact. In the mid-2000s, we began using LCA to evaluate our entire product portfolio to assess our products’ overall environmental impact and identify steps in the cycle where a sustainable improvement can have the most positive impact. We learned that material mass is strongly linked to the environmental performance of most industrial packaging. This nding led us to focus on lightweighting our products, including the NexDRUM®, contributing to reduced emission and environmental impact in our supply chain. LCAs also showed that extending product life has a greater impact on the environmental pro le of our businesses than transportation of our products. Based on this knowledge, we launched EarthMinded Life Cycle Services, to recondition, refurbish and recycle used drums, extending the life of our products and ful lling a critical need for our customers. Please visit End-OfLife Reconditioning, Reuse & Recycling for more information. Innovating Injection and Welding Production with NexDRUM® Greif’s NexDRUM® plastic drum is produced with 15 percent less material than our standard blow molded plastic drum. The NexDRUM® design was created through an innovative injection and welding production process that works with reduced material inputs, without negatively a ecting the performance and stability of the drum. The unique production method also results in a 12 percent CO2 emissions reduction compared with conventional drums. Increasing the Use of PCR in Our Products At the end of 2017, Greif launched its new EcoBalance™ product line in North America. The line includes drums and other shipping containers made using approximately 75 percent recycled plastic obtained from post-consumer shipping containers, while still meeting competitive performance standards. One of the initial o erings from the EcoBalance product line is the tight head GP55 drum made in Bradley, Illinois. Containers made from post-consumer resin (PCR) signi cantly reduce the need to use virgin resin—in some cases eliminating it completely—require less energy to manufacture and divert materials headed to land lls by repurposing them into new products. Our line of PCR containers reduces CO2 emissions by 30-53 percent. In 2017, Greif’s Italy operations processed 7,500 metric tons of PCR to produce almost one million drums, pallets and drum accessories. By the end of 2018, three North America facilities will be able to manufacture UN-certi ed PCR drums, helping us increase the percentage of PCR in our product portfolio. © Copyright 2018 Greif.

Why End-of-Life Reconditioning, Reuse & Recycling Matters End-of-Life Reconditioning, Reuse & Recycling 2016: 103-1, 103-2, 103-3; 307-1 Greif is actively pursuing ways to advance circular economy principles and make a positive impact. We are bringing new packages into the world every day and we want to work with our customers and our customers’ customers on where these packages go at the end of their life. Our reconditioning, reuse and recycling solutions not only divert products from land ll, they also strengthen our customer relationships, by helping them reach their sustainability goals. Governance Greif’s end-of-life services are provided in conjunction with the EarthMinded Life Cycle Services (LCS) network—a network of reconditioning facilities including Container Life Cycle Management LLC (CLCM), a joint venture partially owned by Greif and other third-party owned and operated facilities in North America and Greif’s EarthMinded LCS-branded facilities—along with other third-party owned and operated facilities in EMEA. Through the network’s approximately 35 participating facilities, EarthMinded LCS participants collect used, empty, plastic, steel and IBC containers, recondition them to be suitable for reuse, and reintroduce them into commerce. Reconditioning reduces the demand for new containers and the number of containers that are sent to land ll. When containers are no longer suitable for reconditioning, the materials are recycled for use in other products. Each year, the reconditioning industry recycles more than 34 million containers. In 2017, EarthMinded LCS network participants reconditioned over 3.2 million containers and recycled an additional 900,000 containers. Greif’s end-of-life services are provided in conjunction with the EarthMinded LCS network, a network of reconditioning facilities including Container Life Cycle Management LLC (CLCM). Greif, Greif’s EarthMinded LCS-branded facilities, and third-party owned and operated facilities in North America and EMEA are responsible for this joint venture. Six of Greif’s eight largest customers are using EarthMinded LCS to recondition their containers. EarthMinded LCS customers are provided with reports through EcoTrack and the Greif Green Tool, which allows those customers to determine the environmental performance of their packaging solutions, including carbon impact and weight of reused and recycled materials. CLCM operations, which exist only in the United States, are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Department of 63.1 Transportation (USDOT) and the United States Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), along with numerous other federal, state and local regulators in the communities where it operates. Greif proactively and cooperatively works with regulators to understand and meet compliance requirements. If violations are found in our facilities, we are committed Metric Tons of Virgin Materials to working with regulators to resolve the issues and prevent them from Saved reoccurring. Our reconditioning and reuse operations helped us remove We are also sensitive to the concerns of the communities in which we operate. In over 60 metric tons of virgin steel, high-density polyethylene 2013, CLCM acquired three facilities in Wisconsin—in Oak Creek, St. Francis and and wood from our supply chain in 2017. Milwaukee—that operate under the trade name “Mid America.” These sites have been subject to recent environmental and safety regulatory violations, many of which CLCM disputes, and to odor complaints related to the operation of the St. Francis facility. CLCM immediately began working with the regulators to identify and address issues of concern. In 2017, CLCM representatives visited with neighbors and established a hotline to better understand the concerns of the community. We engaged leaders in emission and conservation control equipment to identify solutions to address the odor issue. We conducted tours of the facility for local elected o cials and community residents and cooperated with numerous inspections by several di erent governmental agencies. CLCM has made and is continuing to make tangible changes to those operations. CLCM addressed a wastewater discharge matter in St. Francis and the company is currently operating within permitted pretreatment limits and is no longer accepting certain drums to help maintain that standard. CLCM also raised the height of the primary stack coming out of the St. Francis plant and adjusted production in an attempt to address the odor complaints. In 2018, CLCM will install a regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO) at the St. Francis facility that will reduce air emissions and odors emanating from the site’s operations. Thermal oxidation is recognized as the most e ective way to destroy odor-causing compounds and is commonly used throughout the United States for a wide variety of processes. CLCM is one of the rst industrial packaging reconditioners in the United States to implement this technology. The health and safety of our employees and communities in which we operate has always been, and will continue to be, our highest priority. We will continue to work with regulators and the community in Wisconsin to identify areas for improvement to ensure our operations are safe, compliant and a valued by our stakeholders.

Internal Awards Michael J. Gasser Global Sustainability Award In 2010, we introduced the Michael J. Gasser Global Sustainability Award to encourage all Greif employees to consider the sustainability of their decisions at work. The award recognizes the environmentally-focused activities of Greif employees and superior e ort in creating sustainable value across our supply chain. 2017 – Greif RIPS and Tri-Sure Businesses in Brazil Greif’s Rigid Industrial Packaging and Services (RIPS) and Tri-Sure businesses in Brazil were awarded the 2017 Michael J. Gasser Sustainability Award for their successful e orts to reduce energy costs and environmental impact by migrating to renewable energy. In 2016, a multifunctional team representing engineering, supply chain and operations from multiple plants collaborated with the objective to transition the plants’ energy contracts from a captive to free market energy platform, improve the e ciency and pro tability of operations and reduce their environmental footprint. The team leveraged new legislation encouraging renewable energy sources, o ering lower energy transmission costs and lower tax rates. By implementing biomass, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy sources, the team far surpassed their goal to reduce energy costs by 10 percent annually. After one year, the team achieved: A 30 percent reduction of energy costs A cost savings of more than $1.4 million USD A 70 percent reduction in CO2 emissions In addition to the environmental and nancial bene ts for Greif, the changes help us create shared value with our customers. We congratulate our employees in Brazil for their success in demonstrating how we can take care of our facilities, bene t the environment, realize costs savings and improve operating results at the same time. 2016 – Greif RIPS Castenedolo Plant in Italy The Greif Rigid Industrial Packaging and Services (RIPS) division's Castenedolo plant employees in Italy won the 2016 Michael J. Gasser Sustainability Award by fully embracing sustainable innovation principles to manufacture products that utilize methods, such as the use of recycled materials and dematerialization, that have a reduced negative impact on the environment while maintaining Greif’s commitment to only produce products of the highest quality. The Castenedolo plant employees worked on two separate sustainable innovation projects. The rst project involved the reduction of the weight of our GCube bottles from 14kg to 13kg while maintaining product integrity. This resulted in a seven percent reduction in natural resources consumed to manufacture the product in addition to a reduction of 312 tons of carbon emissions and 432 MWh of electricity consumption per year. The second project was the development of new manufacturing techniques over a six-month period to increase the percentage of Post-Consumer Resin (PCR) content in the production of plastic drums that can now be made with 75 percent PCR. PCR is produced from recollected plastics packaging products through a process of crashing, aking, washing, melting and granulation. Through this development, the Castenedolo team replaced 500 tons of virgin raw materials with recycled plastic and reduced their carbon emissions by 750 tons per year. The RIPS Italy employees from di erent departments came together and worked as one team to utilize sustainability as a catalyst to drive and inspire innovation beyond the usual parameters and boundaries. In doing so, they saved precious natural resources that not only improve Greif’s overall environmental performance but also create value for our customers. 2015 – Greif Tri-Sure Business Unit Greif’s global packaging accessories business unit, Tri-Sure, won the 2015 Michael Gasser Sustainability Award. Tri-Sure has been investing in many aspects of sustainability including resource consumption reduction, employee health and safety, waste reduction and innovation for the last ve years. Tri-Sure led all the Greif business units by reducing their energy consumption by 37 percent, saving over four million dollars over the past ve years and far exceeding the global corporate target of a 15 percent reduction in energy consumption. Tri-Sure also invested in innovation to create a safer work environment, ahead of government regulations, by developing a passivation method called Chromium-3 Passivation that eliminated the risk of employee exposure to toxic materials while also decreasing toxicity of wastewater. This innovation made Tri-Sure the rst in the market with such a product. Moreover, Tri-Sure invested in sustainable product development to create a new venting screw cap system, Plasticap 60™ MPV3 Screwcap, that not only meets customer requirements but also requires fewer raw materials to make and reduces production waste. With this innovation, Tri-Sure grew the business of the screw caps market by 220 percent. By collaborating with their customers and integrating sustainability criteria to their innovation process, Tri-Sure grew their business, pro tability and market reach. The total economic bene t achieved from all 2015 nominations, including cost savings and increases in revenue, was approximately $21 million. The total energy saved was close to two million kilowatt-hours, equivalent to carbon sequestered from 1,038 acres of U.S. forests in one year. Carbon emissions reduction equaled 20,501 tons, equivalent to 4,316 passenger vehicles driven for one year and the total reduction in waste equaled 6,067 tons. 2014 – President of RIPS EMEA and APAC; Green Tool Team Ivan Signorelli, Group President for Greif Rigid Industrial Packaging and Services (RIPS) in EMEA and APAC, and the Green Tool team received the 2014 Michael J. Gasser Sustainability Award for their visionary work with life cycle assessments (LCA) and the practical application of this science at Greif with The Greif Green Tool. Under the leadership of Ivan Signorelli, a team of Greif employees and Prof. Dr. Holger Buxel from the University of Applied Sciences Münster, worked with independent life cycle assessment specialists from the IFEU institute, located in Germany, to conduct life cycle assessments on Greif’s industrial packaging products with the aim of discovering sustainability-related opportunities and threats in the market. This information was used to develop the proprietary “Greif Green Tool”, which helps companies of all sizes to reduce their carbon footprint by understanding the environmental impact of di erent containers and shipping solutions. The Greif Green Tool is a exible calculator that uses independent life cycle data of Greif products. It allows Greif’s customers to see their carbon footprint data, review and compare the e ects of di erent packaging application decisions and see possible reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This enables them to choose the right packaging products that will keep their products safe while helping them meet their sustainability goals. The team members were also recognized for their commercial leadership in utilizing this powerful tool with Greif’s customers. More than 50 Greif customers have requested Green Tool demonstrations and analysis since the tool’s development. The Green Tool has been recognized by the Harvard Business Review in the article Making the Consensus Sale. The article highlights Greif's Green Tool as a method for building consensus across an organization while showing the sustainability bene ts of Greif products. The Greif Green Tool was also featured in other publications such as the MITSloan Management Review and case studies published by the WBCSD and The Corporate Executive Board Company. 2013 – Greif PPS Riverville Mill Team The Paper Packaging and Services (PPS) Riverville Mill team won the 2013 Michael J. Gasser Global Sustainability Award for their energy reduction project that began approximately ve years ago. The team succeeded in reducing Riverville Mill’s energy consumption by more than 7 percent while increasing throughput by almost 5 percent compared to FY 2008. They accomplished this through continuous improvement projects to modify operating strategies through process optimization and employee education and engagement; through a series of capital investments to utilize technology to improve controls; and through the involvement of all employees. In addition to reducing the plant’s speci c energy consumption and cost, the team’s work has also directly resulted in a reduction in carbon emissions through their e orts to reducing reliance on fossil fuel. The team has applied technologies including Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) in 40 applications since 2009 and seven in 2013 that were identi ed by internal auditing to be candidates for signi cant energy reduction. The team’s work has reduced site energy consumption by 300 million KWh/year since 2009. 2012 – Greif Subsidiary CorrChoice Greif subsidiary CorrChoice won the 2012 Michael J. Gasser Global Sustainability Award for developing the game-changing product LeaderCorr™. LeaderCorr replaces foam board used by the retail industry and others for printed signs and in-store displays. LeaderCorr is a double-walled corrugated sheet that, unlike foam board, is completely recyclable. This means it can be put into the OCC (old corrugated containers, i.e., used cardboard) waste stream, which is an income source for the retailer. The production of LeaderCorr is also environmentally responsible and, because it is an income source, sustainable. In its manufacture, the product uses less energy, less water and less starch than traditional paper-based corrugated materials. Because of the technology that uses less water, the LeaderCorr sheets are atter than other corrugated sheets, and when overlaid with a high quality white liner, provide an ideal surface for high-impact printing. Its thickness can also be tailored for speci c applications. In 2012, the total energy saved from all nominations of the Michael J. Gasser Sustainability Award equaled to 66 million KWH and a carbon emissions reduction of 12,000 metric tons, which is equivalent to greenhouse gas emissions from 9,595 passenger vehicles or the electricity use of 6,967 homes for one year. 2011 – Greif Subsidiary Delta Companies Group For their work in developing more sustainable engine lubricants and automotive uids for the future, Greif subsidiary Delta Companies Group won Greif's 2011 Michael J. Gasser Global Sustainability Award. The team collaborated to create high performing yet sustainable oil, lube and automotive uid products for consumers. By using alternative renewable resources, packaging and recycled materials, and then conducting a life cycle assessment on the products, Delta was able to: Achieve a carbon footprint reduction of 29 to 50 percent in improved bar and chain, automotive and small engine oils, and a 38 to 51 percent lower abiotic resource depletion than conventional alternatives. The cumulative environmental impact demonstrated a 10 to 28 percent improvement over conventional products Realize a 71 percent reduction in land ll waste with alternative packaging Reduce land ll waste by 977,000 gallons, energy consumption of oil products by 90 percent and CO2 emissions by 64 percent with the use of re-re ned base oils, methanol and glycols The total economic bene t achieved from all nominations in 2011, including cost savings and increases in revenue, was over $14 million dollars. 2010 – Greif’s Latin America Business Unit The rst recipient of the Michael J. Gasser Global Sustainability Award was Greif's entire Latin America strategic business unit. The organization tackled the reduction of their energy use, embracing energy excellence to the extent of taking their commitment home with them. They developed training and delivered it to all workers, and in the process e ected a cultural change and generated a passion for conservation. Consistent with their commitment, this award is not the capstone of their e orts. They have continued to reduce their energy consumption, began to work on reducing their water consumption and institutionalized Greif's zero waste initiative. The total economic bene t achieved from all nominations in 2010, including cost savings and increases in revenue, was over $17 million. We also documented an environmental impact of: 118 million pounds of CO2 averted 6 million pounds of waste eliminated 5 million gallons of water saved B CDP Score Gold Recognition from 91% Average Together for EcoVadis Sustainability Score Demonstrating excellence in carbon management, governance, strategy and best Received for our commitment to Corporate Our audited facilities are contributing to practices, and outperforming the container Social Responsibility, placing us in the top ve developing industry-wide sustainability and packaging industry average score of C. percent of all assessed suppliers. standards for suppliers to chemical manufacturers. © Copyright 2018 Greif.
