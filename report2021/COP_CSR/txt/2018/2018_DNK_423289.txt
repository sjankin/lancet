During the past few years, we have invested heavily in our other business units, in terms of both assets and technical manpower, to be able to offset a decrease in income from Copenhagen Contractors, which until 2013 accounted for 30% of our overall group turnover. Despite gloomy prospects at the end of 2016, with the closure of our last facility in Afghanistan, I am satisfied with our efforts in Copenhagen Group for 2017, since we achieved the highest revenue in the company’s history despite a smaller workforce. Looking into the future and 2018 in particular, I expect our investments in, especially, the maritime sector to bear fruit. By end of 2018, we should have concluded our first sale and delivery of high-speed performance boats and related equipment to customers in Denmark and/or Europe. Our business model for both Copenhagen Global and Copenhagen Contractors is and always will be that of a facilitator and broker – bridging the gap between reputable manufacturers and customers. By being able and skilled to work in remote and hostile locations, we add value to both our business partners and customers. We go anywhere and see opportunities in the difficult. Supporting international organisations and national governmental bodies worldwide with products and services from cradle to grave remains our core business focus.
