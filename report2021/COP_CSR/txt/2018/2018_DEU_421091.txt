Our company trainers also work as voluntary examiners on examination committees. The quality of the vocational education available from Wieland can also be seen: this does not involve subject-specific qualification opportunities as enjoyed by our industrial workers. Employees working within all areas of the company can book attractive seminars on the basis of the Wieland educational program in order to continue their education in languages, IT, soft skills and management tools, for example, through to leadership techniques. For young junior managers and aspiring specialists there is the option of completing a personalized sponsorship program through Wieland‘s own talent management scheme.

We provide training and information to motivate staff to behave in an eco-friendly manner. 3 Compliance with official and legal requirements as well as our company guidelines underpins our environmental protection measures. 4 We conduct regular reviews to improve our management system continuously and to document our achievements. The defined environmental and energy targets are our benchmark. 5 In the event of deviations from our environmental policy, we intervene with appropriate corrective measures. 6 We plan, set up, operate, and develop our plant technology according to the latest technological advancements with a view to “improving energy efficiency”. 7 We fully utilize technical and economic possibilities in order to avoid waste and emissions and to reduce energy consumption. Where waste is nevertheless produced, we examine recycling and recovery options for these substances. Non-recyclable waste is disposed of in an eco-friendly way. 8 We select, transport, store, use, and dispose of operating and auxiliary materials in line with environmental considerations. If we employ third parties for these purposes, we validate their technical know-how and reliability. 9 We use raw materials and energy in a manner that is as economical and as eco-friendly as possible. We pursue this goal from the development to the disposal of our products. 10 In all matters of environmental protection we cooperate with the public authorities, associations, and other technical institutions. We provide open and objective information on matters of internal environmental protection. 11 We provide our customers with appropriate information on environmental aspects relating to our products. 12 We pursue the target of involving our contract partners in improving our environmental performance. 15 Environmental management Sustainable technologies – wind power plants Our products are widely used in the ➲ Wind power plants context of “green”, sustainable forms Spaces inside wind power plants have to be fully illuminated in compliance with standards in order to of energy (solar and wind power). ensure that service personnel can climb up the tower safely, including in an emergency. With its pluggable energy bus solution podis® Wieland Electric offers a system that is not only cheaper and quicker to install, but can be adapted very flexibly to individual tower models because of its modular structure. The components have international approval and are particularly suitable for use in the industrial environment worldwide. The energy bus system is installed using a flat cable system that has already been partly pre-assembled at the factory. This is delivered to the tower builder as required for the project and then assembled and pre-installed in segments. Upon the erection of the tower, the system is simply connected using connectors. 16 Environmental management Sustainable technologies – Heating, air conditioning, ventilation ➲ Technology for the environment & future The start of the 21st century heralded a change of thinking. The challenge of countering global warming is becoming huge. One of the main tasks that must be fulfilled is to counteract the global increase in energy requirements. Energy generation from fossil fuels is currently the main pillar of energy production. Given that the combustion of fossil fuels releases CO2 which is harmful to the environment, it is important that the energy produced is used more efficiently and conserved. What is more, the fossil fuels available in the future will not be sufficient to cover the increasing energy requirements. For this reason, measures aimed at regenerative energy production are being promoted and extended worldwide. No other industry already works with such an efficient mix of different energies as the heating industry. In ventilation and air conditioning, buildings are air conditioned using holistic approaches that avoid the loss of valuable heat to the outside. Wieland has been one of the main suppliers in these sectors for decades. Offering a large number of specific solutions and innovative product developments, as well as intensive support, e.g. with changing requirements due to new equipment concepts or industryspecific standards, Wieland Electric is a strong parter. To the benefit of all of us. For a green future. 17 Environmental management smart installation – building installation The environmental aspect of the Wieland ➲ Example: Who is certified, and how? product range is most visible when it Green building certification is voluntary, unlike comes to the certification of buildings by compliance with the EnEV and issue of the energy different companies.

Generally, construction and renovation especially the systems, contribute to projects are already monitored by the organization, which ensures that the targeted certification level is many of the ratings. reached. The actual certification is then performed using point systems with checklists. The smart installation concept excels here. From simple electrical connection to room automation with presence detectors and room thermostats, Wieland helps to create sustainable buildings. The pluggable electrical installation scores well in all areas, from planning, execution, and operation all the way through to renovation and demolition. Flat cable systems and distributed automation reduce wiring expenses considerably. Besides being pluggable, the electrical installation also remains flexible during operation. The use of room automation devices, especially presence detectors and room thermostats, plays an active role in helping to save energy. The most recent studies by Biberach Technical University produced potential savings in electrical energy of over 30% and in thermal energy of over 50% thanks to room automation. These values were calculated using seminar rooms at the university over two years during ongoing operation – without any structural measures!

Luminaire manufacturers benefit from a smaller inventory, quick response time for variants, and simplified assembly. Colored markings and mechanical codings enable clear assignments and prevent mismating. With gesis® system plugs, the electrical connection meets the requirements for a permanent connection in fixed installations as specified in the newly revised DIN EN 61535. From the flexible distribution of power to the luminaire through to effective DALI control solutions for both indoors and outdoors, Wieland offers cohesive concepts and pluggable solutions that are optimized for the application in question. At the heart of the system lie our plug connectors and device connectors, supplemented by distribution elements, preassembled cables, and accessories. 20 2018 Environmental management Sustainable technologies – Mechanical engineering New harmonized standards, such as ➲ Efficiency and safety EN ISO 13849, are placing new demands Globalization and the competition this has generated continue to place increasing demands on cost on mechanical engineers. efficiency and time savings. At the same time, They are also creating opportunities. statutory health protection requirements have to be met. Wieland Electric can help you here. Wieland Electric is not just one of the leading suppliers of safety engineering and connection technology, but also a trend-setting innovator and industry expert. With its in-house mechanical engineering operation and production lines at home and abroad, Wieland has accumulated know-how and a high degree of industry expertise over many decades. Wieland has identified and resolved typical problems in the market. These include the many technical details that significantly improve the availability of a machine. Aside from this, the fulfilment of logistical needs and wholly individual customer requirements also makes Wieland Electric a strong and proficient partner in mechanical engineering. ➲ From advice to component Safety is becoming more and more of an issue for the mechanical engineer, partly driven by an increasing sense of responsibility in all of us. Legal regulations, such as machinery directives and the Ordinance on Industrial Safety and Health, have to be fulfilled. 21 Environmental management Eco-friendly manufacturing processes All aspects of environmental protection ➲ Metalworking and health & safety are considered right We manufacture our metal components in very close proximity to residential areas, nature, and water, from the start with the selection of the so we bear special responsibility for providing copper, steel, and aluminum alloys used. protection against noise as well as for keeping water, air, and soil clean. The cutting and non-cutting production technologies we use, such as stamping, stamp-bending, drilling, milling, and turning, are reviewed and optimized continuously to minimize their impact on the environment and on health & safety. Electricity and compressed air are used efficiently; oil-based coolants are treated and recycled. The filings and punching scrap accrued are all sorted, de-oiled, and recycled as raw materials. 22 2018 ➲ Plastics production The sprue material accrued is recycled and Thermoplastics are processed on fully automated integrated into the production process injection molding machines. again in compliance with regulations. Mechanical, electrical, and fire-protection properties are taken into account when selecting the plastics used, as are all environmental aspects. The priority is given to halogen-free flame-retardant plastics that exhibit an extremely low smoke density and toxicity during a fire. This aspect is becoming increasingly important. The heat generated while processing plastics is extracted via plate heat exchangers and cooling towers. Energy input is minimized by using closed cooling systems to cool both the tools and the machines. This measure means that refrigerating units to cool the machines can be dispensed with all year round. 23 Environmental management Eco-friendly manufacturing processes ➲ Electro-plating Our electro plating process meets the state-of-the art The waste water treatment facility processes all the production and environmental technology.

We have therefore put a halt to the consumption of water for cooling purposes by switching to closed circulation cooling systems. As a consequence of this measure, water consumption has been in decline for years now at Wieland. The process water needed in electro-plating is processed in separate streams in the waste water treatment facility commissioned in 2004 using the very latest waste water technology and fed into the sewer system, but only once the contents have been analyzed. 31 Indicators Land use Areal Data 2017 Wieland Wieland Plant I Plant II Plant III Total s.r.o. s.r.o.
