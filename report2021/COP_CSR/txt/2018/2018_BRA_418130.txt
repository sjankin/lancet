Reported data in the environmental tables are rounded to three significant digits or, for small values, presented as no less than one-tenth the indicator reporting unit. This approach enhances data usability while providing sufficient detail without becoming numerically cumbersome. Energy and greenhouse gas (GHG ) emissions data for Company Vehicles ( 2,260,000 gigajoules and 154,000 metric tons for fiscal year 2017 ) are included in Company Total. GHG emissions increased in fiscal year 2017 due to increased production and increased USEPA eGRID emission factors in the U.S. Northwest subregion. GHG emissions are calculated using various standardized emissions calculation methodology and factors, including the World Resources Institute and World Business Council on Sustainable Development. Greenhouse Gas Protocol, USEPA GHG Reporting Program and Emission Factors, and location-based factors: USEPA eGRID, IEA Country Specific factors, and other site or case specific factors and calculations as reviewed by our third-party assurance auditors. “Market Based” values based on residual emission factors from the 2016 Reliable Disclosure Systems for Europe – Phase II for European sites, plus location-based values for all other sites. Starting with fiscal year 2016 in reporting for Scope 2 (Indirect) GHG Emissions, both “Location Based” and “Market Based” reporting are provided per the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. A location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs, while a market-based method reflects emissions from electricity that sites have purposefully chosen (or their lack of choice). Please see GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance for additional details. Waste Shipped Off-Site: The increase from fiscal year 2016 was mainly driven by increased production and construction related disposal. Non-Hazardous Waste Energy Recovery was revised to include Biomass Fuels Shipped Off-Site for Energy Generation. Landfill Diversion Rate represents the percentage of total waste not using landfill as disposal method. On-site treatment, storage, and recycling of waste not included in totals. Hazardous waste was not exported or imported by Monsanto across country borders.

PROGRESS AGAINST COMMITMENTS FOOTNOTES, Page 10 ¹ Monsanto made a commitment in 2008 to develop improved seeds and agronomic practices that by 2030 would help farmers use one-third fewer key resources than in 2000 per unit of output to grow corn, soybeans and cotton. We recognize these improvements will be made by farmers who utilize new technologies and better management practices provided from a diverse set of collaborators, one of which is Monsanto. Progress against these goals are impacted by weather conditions and revised calculations and data from the USDA’s Agricultural Resource Management survey and Natural Resources Inventory. Source: Monsanto internal estimates. Reflects U.S. results only due to limitations on reliable data elsewhere. Key resources include land use, irrigation water, energy, soil loss and greenhouse gas emissions. For more information on this goal, see Our Commitments to Sustainable Agriculture white paper. ² Based on population growth predictions, Monsanto made a commitment in 2008 to develop improved seeds and agronomic practices to help farmers double yields by 2030 from 2000 levels for canola, corn, cotton and soybeans in countries where farmers have access to the full complement of tools for these crops, including plant breeding, biotechnology and agronomic management. According to the United States Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service, significant progress has been made against these aggressive goals, especially in countries of high technology adoption. Yield-gain percentages are based on a three-year rolling average. Data source: USDA Production, Supply and Distribution View and analysis by Monsanto.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY GROWING BETTER TOGETHER BETTER PLANET BETTER LIVES BET TER PARTNER 67 INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT Introduction and objectives of work Bureau Veritas North America, Inc. (BVNA) has been engaged by Monsanto to conduct an independent assurance of selected environmental disclosures for Monsanto’s Fiscal Year 2017 (September 1, 2016 to August 31, 2017) to be presented in Monsanto’s 2017 Sustainability Report. This Assurance Statement applies to the environmental disclosures listed within the scope of work described below. The determination of the environmental disclosures and other information presented in Monsanto’s 2017 Sustainability Report is the sole responsibility of the management of Monsanto. BVNA was not involved in the determination of environmental disclosures included in the Report. Our sole responsibility was to provide independent verification of the accuracy of selected information as described below. Scope of work Monsanto requested BVNA to verify the accuracy of the following environmental metrics associated with GRI Standards for the Fiscal Year 2017 reporting period: 302-1: Energy consumption within the organization 302-2: Energy consumption outside of the organization associated with business travel and logistics 302-3: Energy Intensity 303-1: Water withdrawal by source 303-3: Water recycled and reused 305-1: Direct (Scope 1) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions 305-2: Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions 305-3: Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions associated with business travel and logistics 305-4: GHG emissions intensity ratio 305-7: Nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur oxides (SOX), and other significant air emissions 306-1: Water discharge by quality and destination 306-2: Waste by type and disposal method 306-3: Significant spills 306-4: Transport of hazardous waste under the terms of Basel Convention Annex I, II, III and VII 307-1: Significant fines for non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations (fines >$100,000) Landfill Diversion (%) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY GROWING BETTER TOGETHER BETTER PLANET BETTER LIVES BET TER PARTNER 68 Monsanto Assurance Statement Page 2 Excluded from the scope of our work is any verification of information relating to:  Other information (e.g., text and data) associated with Monsanto’s 2017 Environmental Sustainability Report that is outside the scope of work described above  Activities outside the defined verification period of Fiscal Year 2017 Methodology As part of its independent verification, BVNA undertook the following activities: 1. Interviews with relevant personnel of Monsanto regarding data collection and reporting systems; 2. Review of Monsanto’s data and information systems and methodology for collection, aggregation, analysis and internal audit of information used to determine the environmental data; 3. Review of documentary evidence produced by Monsanto; 4. Audit of environmental and energy data traced back to the source for Monsanto facilities located in Centralia, Illinois; Muscatine, Iowa; St. Louis, Missouri (Creve Coeur and Chesterfield sites); Kearney, Nebraska; and Waco, Nebraska, USA during site visits; 5. Audit of select environmental and energy data traced back to the source for Monsanto facilities located in Chiapas, Mexico; Soda Springs Mine, Idaho; Trebes, France; and Zarate, Argentina, based on information provided remotely during web meetings; and 6. Review of the centralized data, methods for consolidation of site data and site data available in the centralized data management system during a visit to Monsanto’s headquarters location in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. Our assurance work was conducted in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 and ISO Standard 14064-3 Greenhouse Gases Part 3: Specification with Guidance for the Validation and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Assertions. In accordance with our internal procedures for limited assurance, we use these as our reference standards. The work was planned and carried out to provide data verification to a limited assurance level using a materiality threshold of ±5% and we believe it provides an appropriate basis for our conclusions. Our findings On the basis of our methodology and the activities described above:  Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the reviewed information within the scope of our verification as detailed above is not materially correct.  Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the reviewed information is not a fair representation of the actual environmental and energy data for Fiscal Year 2017. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY GROWING BETTER TOGETHER BETTER PLANET BETTER LIVES BET TER PARTNER 69 Monsanto Assurance Statement Page 3  It is our opinion that Monsanto has established appropriate systems for the collection, aggregation and analysis of quantitative data within the scope of work specified herein. A summary of data within the scope of assurance for Fiscal Year 2017 is attached. Statement of independence, impartiality and competence BVNA is part of The Bureau Veritas Group, an independent professional services company that specializes in Quality, Health, Safety, Social and Environmental management with almost 180 years of history in providing independent assurance services, and an annual 2016 revenue of 4.5 Billion Euros.
