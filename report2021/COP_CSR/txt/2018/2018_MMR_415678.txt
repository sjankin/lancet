Since the beginning of 2014, we have been introducing thinner plastic bottles (1-Liter, 0.3-Liters, and 0.5-Liter) to the Myanmar market. By reducing the grams of plastic for both the water bottles as well as the cap, we are using fewer raw materials thereby reducing the environment impact of our business both in sourcing as well as in waste. Even though we incur the risks associated with introducing thinner bottles in a market that is used to thick, sturdy bottles, we stick to our commitment of reducing environment impact of our business. We take upon the responsibility of educating the public over time. In the middle of 2015, we introduced 5-Liter bottles that also use less plastic than our competitors. At the end of 2016, we introduced the new 1-Liter bottle. Best quality technology is being used by reducing the use of crude petroleum oil which is the raw material for plastic and prevention of the natural resources which is a support for conservation of the environment. We produced the 1Liter thinner bottles not only distribution to market to get profit but also giving knowledge of reducing plastic to save the environment. We arrange factory visit as a one day tour for the new employees and our customers then we explain how we produce the bottle drinking water and share knowledge of reducing plastic in making water bottle to save environment.
