Other amounts of a one-off nature are also included in • CPH is in the process of investigating the consequences of implementing IFRS 16 but, this line item, including gains on the divestment of operations. based on the initial analysis, CPH does not expect the implementation of the new financial reporting standard to have a material impact on CPH’s financial reporting. The hotel operation conprises a specific operation, which changed in 2017 from a management contract with Hilton to a minimum-based lease with Nordic Choice Hotels. Under IASB has issued the following new interpretation, which could be relevant to CPH, but which the old agreement, both revenue and costs related to the hotel activity were recognised in has not yet been adopted by the EU: the respective financial items. Under the new agreement, the hotel operation is no longer recognised in the CPH Group, but is included in rental income. • IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments: The interpretation clarifies that it must be determined whether each tax position is to be treated individually or collectively The figures for 2016 and 2017 have been adjusted for one-off items and the hotel activity with other uncertain tax positions. The assessment should be based on the assumption to make the years comparable. that the tax authorities have the same knowledge of the enterprise’s circumstances and, therefore, the assessment should disregard any detection risk. This determination may be based on e.g. how tax statements are prepared or how the enterprise expects the tax authorities to treat the uncertain tax positions. The uncertain tax position must be recognised if it is probable that the enterprise will have to pay or receive refunds. The uncertain tax position must be measured so as to better reflect the receivable/liability and the related uncertainty. The amendment will be effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. CPH expects to implement this interpretation when it becomes effective. CPH has not conducted an in-depth analysis of the interpretation but does not expect the interpretation to have a material impact on CPH’s financial reporting at present. 96 C O N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N C I A L P E R F O R M A N C E A N D S TAT E M E N T S > F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S Notes General Note 1.3 ONE-OFF ITEMS (continued) 2017 2016 Including One-off Excluding Hotel Excluding Including One-off Excluding Hotel Excluding one-off items one-off operation* one-off one-off items one-off operation* one-off DKK million items items items and items items items and the hotel the hotel operation ­operation 2.1, 2.2 Revenue 4,439.4 4,439.4 (100.2) 4,339.2 4,421.9 4,421.9 (227.6) 4,194.3 Other income 2.9 2.9 2.9 6.2 6.2 6.2 2.3 External costs 496.7 (13.9) 482.8 (37.5) 445.3 614.6 (5.1) 609.5 (153.4) 456.1 2.4 Staff costs 1,334.7 (12.3) 1,322.4 (0.5) 1,321.9 1,309.0 (10.3) 1,298.7 1,298.7 EBITDA 2,610.9 26.2 2,637.1 (62.2) 2,574.9 2,504.5 15.4 2,519.9 (74.2) 2,445.7 3.1 Amortisation and depreciation 788.0 788.0 788.0 705.6 705.6 705.6 Operating profit 1,822.9 26.2 1,849.1 (62.2) 1,786.9 1,798.9 15.4 1,814.3 (74.2) 1,740.1 4.1 Net financing costs 187.3 187.3 187.3 178.8 178.8 178.8 Profit before tax 1,635.6 26.2 1,661.8 (62.2) 1,599.6 1,620.1 15.4 1,635.5 (74.2) 1,561.3 2.5 Tax on profit for the year 350.1 5.8 355.9 355.9 361.1 3.4 364.5 364.5 Profit after tax 1,285.5 20.4 1,305.9 (62.2) 1,243.7 1,259.0 12.0 1,271.0 (74.2) 1,196.8 * An adjustment for the hotel operation has been made only down to EBITDA level. 97 C O N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N C I A L P E R F O R M A N C E A N D S TAT E M E N T S > F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S Notes Results for the year Note 2.1 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION Accounting policies Aeronautical The accounting policies for recognition and measurement of segmental information are the This segment comprises the operations and functions that the airports at Kastrup and same as for the income statement and balance sheet.

In estimating the runways' useful lives, CPH has chosen to divide the system into three elements: foundations, surfaces and technical installations. CPH's assessment is that each element has a different useful life. The runway surfaces have shorter lives than the foundations due to immediate wear; their useful life expectancy is 10 years. This assessment is supported by historical replacement of runway surfaces and planning for future replacement. Technical installations related to the runways are estimated to have a useful life of 15 years. It is assessed that these technical installations do not have the same useful life as other technical installations, taking into account security measures. 110 C O N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N C I A L P E R F O R M A N C E A N D S TAT E M E N T S > F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S Notes Investments Note 3.3 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (continued) 2017 Land and Plant and Other fixtures Property, plant and Total buildings* machinery and fittings, tools and equipment under DKK million equipment construction Cost Accumulated cost at 1 January 7,605.0 7,552.5 1,729.1 795.3 17.681.9 Additions 1,442.5 1,442.5 Disposals (9.3) (12.3) (6.9) (28.5) Transferred 578.7 470.1 263.8 (1,312.6) Accumulated cost at 31 December 8,174.4 8,010.3 1,986.0 925.2 19.095.9 Depreciation Accumulated depreciation at 1 January 2,984.5 3,728.9 1,168.2 7,881.6 Depreciation 243.3 272.2 143.2 658.7 Depreciation on disposals (9.0) (12.3) (6.6) (27.9) Accumulated depreciation at 31 December 3,218.8 3,988.8 1,304.8 8,512.4 Carrying amount at 31 December 4,955.6 4,021.5 681.2 925.2 10.583.5 * CPH properties have been mortgaged for a total of DKK 514.9 million (2016: DKK 507.5 million).

Exchange rate adjustments of loans as well as currency swaps (for loan principals) are re­ cognised in Financial income/expenses in the income statement at a net amount of zero, as the exchange rate adjustment of the loans is fully offset by an opposite exchange rate adjustment of the currency swaps. 114 C O N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N C I A L P E R F O R M A N C E A N D S TAT E M E N T S > F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S Notes Funding and financial risks Note Note 4.1 FINANCIAL INCOME AND EXPENSES (continued) 4.2 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER LOANS The net value of the exchange loss recognised in 2017 includes an unrealised exchange Accounting policies gain of DKK 436.6 million (2016: unrealised exchange loss of DKK 81.5 million) related Mortgage loans, loans from financial institutions and other loans are recognised when taken to long-term loans denominated in USD and GBP offset by an unrealised exchange loss out at the amount received less transaction costs incurred.

Fluctuations in the interest rate level would therefore have only a limited impact on CPH’s income statement. As the exchange rate and interest rate risk of debt denominated in USD, GBP and DKK is hedged by USD/DKK, GBP/DKK and DKK interest rate swaps, a change in interest rate levels would affect equity. 121 C O N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N C I A L P E R F O R M A N C E A N D S TAT E M E N T S > F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S Notes Funding and financing risks Note 4.3 FINANCIAL RISKS (continued) Exchange rate risks Exchange rate fluctuations would have only a low impact on CPH’s operating results because most of its revenues and costs are settled in DKK. Currency swaps Currency swaps have been used to hedge fixed-rate bond loans denominated in USD and GBP by swapping the exchange rate exposure on both interest and principal from fixed payments in USD and GBP to fixed payments in DKK throughout the terms of the respective loans. The total notional amount of these outstanding cross-currency swaps at 31 December 2017 was USD 507 million and GBP 23 million (2016: USD 507 million and GBP 23 million). The carrying amount of the currency swap contracts amounted to DKK (83.8) million (2016: DKK 340.0 million). Hedging transactions The net fair value stated will be transferred from Reserve for hedging to the income statement as and when the hedged interest payments are made. The terms to maturity of the cross-currency swaps match the terms to maturity of the related loans. The term to maturity of one of the interest rate swaps is shorter than the underlying mortgage loan, but the hedges match the interest payments on the loans for the full terms of the hedges. 122 C O N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N C I A L P E R F O R M A N C E A N D S TAT E M E N T S > F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S Notes Other notes Note 5.1 TRADE RECEIVABLES Accounting policies The year's movements are recognised in the income statement under External costs.

If the parties cannot agree on the terms and conditions through negotiation, the regulatory period is four years. BL 9-15, 3rd edition, includes various rules on determining charges by negotiation and in the event of a fall-back situation. In a fall-back situation, the revenue caps will be determined to cover the operating costs, depreciation and cost of capital for efficient operation of the airport. Based on the revenue cap, CPH is then required to prepare a proposal for charges during the regulatory period, for approval by the DTCA. BL 9-15, 3rd edition, includes various rules on how to calculate these revenue caps. 126 C O N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N C I A L P E R F O R M A N C E A N D S TAT E M E N T S > F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S Notes Other notes Note Note 5.6  CONCESSION FOR AIRPORT OPERATION AND CHARGES ­REGULATION 5.7 FEES TO AUDITORS APPOINTED AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (continued) During the period 1 March to 1 September 2014, the airlines and CPH (under the supervision of the DTCA) negotiated and concluded a charges agreement that is valid from 1 April 2015 DKK million 2017 2016 to 31 March 2019.

In 2017, the results of the analysis formed the basis of the updated CR strategy in which CPH has Since 2011, CPH has supported the ten principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights, maintained the three strategic focus areas of People, Planet and Position and selected 11 priority labour, environment and anti-corruption. As a Global Compact signatory, CPH reports on its areas for the coming years. Thus, the 2016 analysis contributed significantly to formulating and activities to incorporate the ten principles into its strategy, operations and corporate culture. As developing the updated CR strategy and also provided input to the selection of content and data part of these efforts, CPH also strives to communicate the ten principles to suppliers and business in this Group Annual Report. partners. For more details on CPH’s work to implement the ten principles, see the table on page 15. In 2017, CPH also focused on the global UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As part The selection of data included in the non-financial reporting is based on statutory requirements of its updated CR strategy, CPH has initiated a process to clarify which of the 17 SDGs and 169 and Management's annual evaluation of what is considered to be material to report to CPH's targets to select as focus areas for the future and which goals would make sense and add value stakeholders.

For example, there have been some technical challenges involving passenger bridges in previous years. Over the last few years, CPH has sharpened focus on maintaining bridges. Despite this, there have been a few near-misses involving bridges but, fortunately, no actual aircraft damage. In the last few years, CPH has undergone a certification process in compliance with EU legislation. This imposed a number of stringent requirements regarding both design and maintenance of the airport’s infrastructure and equipment as well as operational performance, for example competence requirements for airport staff. Compliance with these requirements has also contributed to a general improvement in flight safety on CPH’s part. * The 2023 target is expected to be finally approved in Q1 2018 by the CPH Safety Board. 137 C O N S O L I DAT E D N O N F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S (S U P P L E M E N TA RY I N F O R M AT I O N – N O T AU D I T E D) Notes People Note 3 RATE OF EMPLOYEE REPORTING TO CPH Accounting policy SAFETY AND SECURITY WOR Our goal is continuously to be one of We kn The target is based on whether safety episodes that come under the employee reporting obligation are actually reported by the persons involved. the best airports at managing flight workin Employee reports are compared to information from other sources, which may be pilot reports, marshal reports, security reports, air traffic safety.

The share of renewable energy is calculated as the quantity of power produced by solar panel systems located at Copenhagen Airport as a percentage of CPH's total power consumption in the relevant year. In June 2014, CPH received an airport carbon accreditation at level 3 – “optimisation – from Airports Council International (ACI). “Optimisation” is the highest level achievable without buying CO2 quotas or similar, and requires an airport to calculate its CO2 emissions and specify carbon reduction targets. It further requires the airport to engage with third parties in calculating the airport's total carbon footprint. The annual effect of energy efficiency measures is calculated. The annual energy saving is calculated in MWh and is distributed between electricity and heat savings (natural gas and district heating), respectively.

In order to secure a strong domestic product, CPH has focused particularly on improving passenger experience at security, as this has long been requested by domestic commuters. The aim has been to provide travellers with effective and reliable flight access. In Q1 2016, CPH launched a domestic package, among other things allocating extra resources to security in the form of more staff, and since Q4 2016 domestic travellers have had permanent access to the CPH security fast track, which has further improved passenger experience and reliability at CPH. As a consequence, satisfaction with security* has increased from 74% in 2015 to 80% in 2016 and 85% in 2017, which is a primary reason for the improved satisfaction with the domestic product in general. * Average satisfaction with staff courtesy, thoroughness of inspection, waiting time, feeling of being safe. 153 C O N S O L I DAT E D N O N F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S (S U P P L E M E N TA RY I N F O R M AT I O N – N O T AU D I T E D) Notes Roskilde Airport, 1 January – 31 December Note 17 ROSKILDE AIRPORT Accounting policy CO2 emissions, scopes 1 + 2 Indirect energy consumption, scope 2 CO2 emissions (scopes 1 and 2) is calculated based on the consumption of power, natural gas, CPH is responsible for purchasing energy for Roskilde Airport.
