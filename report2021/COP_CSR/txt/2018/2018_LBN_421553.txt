MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES In the box below, please include the most relevant indicators to measure outcomes. Examples include: Based EuroMena’s manual for anti-money laundering and funding terrorism prevention, riskmanagement procedures should be introduced to control and mitigate higher risk situations. These procedures should, as a minimum, provide for the following measures: (a) the implementation of a program which sets out the additional measures to be applied by the subject person in higher risk situations; (b) requiring a higher standard in relation to the quality of documents obtained; and (c) monitoring transactions/activities to a higher degree where the risk warrants such additional measures.  Team members are required to monitor transactions to determine if any particular transaction is suspicious in nature and may be related to money laundering or funding terrorism activities. Monitoring does not require looking at every transaction.  The extent of the monitoring will be determined on a risk based approach. Ongoing monitoring is an important part of the Fund's money laundering and funding terrorism prevention procedure. On-going monitoring is required to be carried out in relation to all portfolio companies. The team's knowledge of the business activities and experience of the portfolio company is extremely important in order to ensure that the transactions being carried out by the portfolio company fall within the business rationale underlying the portfolio company business activities.
