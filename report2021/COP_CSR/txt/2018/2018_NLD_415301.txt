(the ‘Company’) is domiciled in the Netherlands. The Company’s registered office is at Utrechtseweg 33, 3704 HA Zeist. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together also referred to as the ‘Group’). The Group is involved in the design, manufacture and sale of high-quality electromagnetic systems and components. Basis of preparation (a) Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2017 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations of the standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union (hereinafter referred to as EU-IFRS). The Company financial statements are part of the 2017 financial statements of Kendrion N.V. The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Executive Board on 20 February 2018. (b) Basis of measurement The financial statements are presented in millions of euros, the euro also being the Group’s functional currency. The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except that: ■■ derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value; ■■ liabilities arising from cash-settled share-based payments arrangements are stated at fair value; ■■ the defined benefit liability is recognised as net total of plan assets and present value of the defined benefit obligations; ■■ the contingent consideration is stated at fair value. The methods used to measure the fair values are disclosed in note q. The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS requires the Executive Board to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgements about carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which an estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Changes in estimation methods and the impact of such changes are outlined in the notes to the relevant item. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 84 The Executive Board discussed the selection and disclosure of the critical accounting policies for financial reporting and estimates, as well as the application of these policies and estimates, with the Supervisory Board. In preparing the financial statements, the management is required under IFRS to make various judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the implementation of policy and the amounts disclosed in relation to assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions are based on experience and factors deemed reasonable in the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions are constantly reappraised. Changes in the accounting estimates used are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed if the change affects only that period, or in the period in which the estimate is changed and in future periods if the change affects both the reporting period and future periods. Executive Board made critical judgements in the process of applying Group's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements, see notes: ■■ note 4 – tax losses not recognised ■■ note 11 – measurement of defined benefit obligations ■■ note 18 – contingent assets and liabilities ■■ note 19 – applying aggregation criteria with reference to operating segments Executive Board made estimations concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. ■■ note 1 – assessment of useful life and residual value of assets with a definite useful life ■■ note 2 – assessment of useful life and residual value of assets with a definite useful life ■■ note 2 – management forecast and growth rate of each cash-generating unit to determine whether goodwill is impaired ■■ note 4 – utilisation of tax losses ■■ note 5 – valuation of inventories ■■ note 11 – salary and pension growth of defined benefit obligations ■■ note 13 – provisions ■■ note 15 – valuation of financial instruments Reference is made to those notes for steps taken by the Executive Board to make judgements, estimates and assumptions. Significant accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and by the Group entities. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 85 (a) Basis of consolidation (i) Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Control refers to the authority to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity to obtain benefits from its activities. When assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: ■■ the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus ■■ the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus ■■ if the business combination is realised in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree; less ■■ the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in comprehensive income (hereafter also referred to as ‘profit or loss’). The consideration transferred does not include amounts relating to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Transactions costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. When share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards) and relate to past services, then all or part of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included when measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards as compared to the market-based value of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and/or future service. (ii) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company controls an entity if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences, until the date that control ceases. The shares of third parties in shareholders’ equity and results are stated separately. The accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed, where necessary, to align them with the policies adopted by the Company. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 86 (iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and transactions, as well as any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial statements. (b) Foreign currency (i) Foreign currency transactions Transactions expressed in non-euro zone currencies are translated into euros at exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-euro zone currencies at the reporting date are translated into euros at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-euro zone currencies that are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-euro zone currencies that are measured at fair value are translated in euros at the exchange rates when the fair value was determined. Currency differences on foreign currency transactions are recognised in profit or loss, except loans considered to be part of the net investment, or qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent the hedges are effective. (ii) Translation of foreign currency financial statements Translation of foreign currency financial statements depends on the functional currency of the company concerned. The closing rate method is applied if the functional currency of the company is other than the euro. With this method, assets and liabilities of non-euro zone operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising at the time of acquisition, are translated into euros at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of non-euro zone operations are translated into euros at rates approximating the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve, which is a component of equity. On the partial or complete sale of a foreign operation, the related amount is transferred from the translation reserve to profit or loss. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a non-euro zone operation, of which the settlement is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a non-euro zone operation and are recognised directly in equity, in the translation reserve. (c) Property, plant and equipment (i) Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost or assumed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (see accounting policy g). The cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of selfconstructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, the initial estimate, where relevant, of the costs of dismantling and removing the items and reinstating the site on which they are located, a reasonable proportion of production overheads, and capitalised borrowing costs. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 87 Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. (ii) Leased assets Leases under which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Owner-occupied property acquired by way of a finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy g). (iii) Subsequent costs The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group, and its cost can be reliably measured. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised as an incurred charge in profit or loss. (iv) Depreciation Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each component of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of their respective lease terms and useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually. (v) Recognition of transaction results Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are accounted for in other operating income/other expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. (d) Intangible assets (i) Goodwill Goodwill that arises upon acquisition of a subsidiary is included in intangible assets. For the measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, see note a. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment (see note g). 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 88 Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in profit or loss. (ii) Research and development Research and development expenses comprise expenditure on research and development and expenses for customer-specific applications, prototypes and testing. Reimbursements from customers are offset against expenses. In addition, the expenses are reduced by the amount relating to the application of research results in the development of new or substantially improved products if the related activity meets the recognition criteria for internally generated intangible assets as laid down in IAS 38. Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalised only if the development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour, overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use, and capitalised borrowing costs. Other development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss when incurred. Research and development expenses incurred by the Industrial activities primarily relate to pre-production prototypes or tests for products already being marketed (application engineering). These expenses do not qualify as development expenditure, but may be recognised as an intangible asset. Research and development expenses incurred by the Automotive activities are not recognised as marketable until Kendrion has been nominated as the supplier for the particular vehicle platform or model and has also successfully completed the pre-production release stages. These release stages also serve as the prerequisite for the demonstration of the technical feasibility of the product, especially in view of the stringent demands imposed on comfort and safety technology. For this reason, development costs are recognised as an asset solely on the date of Kendrion’s nomination as the supplier and the completion of a specific pre-production release stage. The development is deemed to have been completed once final approval for series production has been granted. As a result, only a very few of the Automotive research and development projects meet the recognition criteria. Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. (iii) Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and accumulated impairment losses (see note g). Based on the purchase price allocation of acquisitions, intangible assets that are part of the other intangible assets and relate to, for example, valued customer relations, trade names and technologies are also recognised. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 89 (iv) Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only if it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed when incurred. (v) Amortisation Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each reporting date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. (e) Financial instruments and other investments Financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, recognised interest bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, cash and cash equivalents, and other non-derivative financial instruments. They are recognised as at the respective dates on which they originate. Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, less any directly attributable transaction costs. The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or if it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows as part of a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in such transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position if, and only if, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below. Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost, less impairment losses (see note g). Recognised interest-bearing loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are carried at amortised cost with any difference between the initial carrying amount and the redemption amount, based on the effective interest method, taken to profit or loss over the respective terms of the loans. Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 90 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances and other call deposits payable on demand. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand, and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management, are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. They are measured at fair value. Other non-derivative financial instruments Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Derivatives are initially measured at fair value, with attributable transaction costs recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when they are incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are carried at fair value. Any changes are taken to profit or loss, unless the instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. Embedded derivatives are accounted for separately from the host contract. If the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value in profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of separated embedded derivatives are recognised immediately in profit or loss. At 31 December 2017, no embedded derivatives existed. Changes in the fair value of a derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve, a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes are recognised immediately in profit or loss. On initial designation of a derivative as a cash flow hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument, the hedged item and the hedged risk, including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, together with the methods that are used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting of the changes in the cash flows for the hedged risks attributable to the respective hedged items, and whether the actual results of each hedge are within a range of 80-125%. Regarding a cash flow hedge for a forecasted transaction, the Group determines whether the hedged transactions are highly likely to occur and present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss. If a hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for a cash flow hedge, expires or is sold, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative result previously included in equity is recognised in profit or loss unless it is expected that the original hedged transaction will still take place. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 91 (f) Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs to sell. The cost of inventories of the Group is based on the weighted average cost, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their current location and condition. The cost of inventories includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. (g) Impairment (i) Financial assets A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. An impairment loss, in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. Significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups of assets that have similar credit risk characteristics. All impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss. (ii) Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 92 or groups of assets (the ‘cash-generating unit’). For the purpose of impairment testing, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis. (iii) Reversal of impairment losses An impairment in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed, if the subsequent increase in the recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed. Impairment losses in respect of other assets are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Reversals of impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. (iv) Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed on initial recognition of these financial assets). Receivables with a short remaining term are not discounted. The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In determining value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. (h) Share capital (i) Ordinary shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effect. (ii) Repurchase, disposal and reissue of share capital (treasury shares) When own shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs and net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity. If treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred respectively to or from other reserves. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 93 (iii) Dividends The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as determined from time to time by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The Executive Board has the authority to decide, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, what portion of the profit will be allocated to the reserves. If applicable, the declared but unpaid dividends are recognised as a liability. (i) Employee benefits (i) Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when incurred. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or reduction in future payments will occur. (ii) Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability (asset). The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan in the Group. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities. Remeasurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest). The Group recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income, and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans as employee benefit expenses in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit relating to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The gain or loss on a settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled as determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 94 (iii) Other long-term service benefits The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits other than pension plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method, discounted to its present value and net of the fair value of any related assets. The discount rate is the yield at the financial position date on AA-credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. (iv) Share-based payment transactions The fair value on the grant date of share-based payment awards made to employees and the Executive Board is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, so that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non vesting conditions, the fair value on the grant date of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions, with no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. (v) Short-term employee benefits A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. (vi) Termination benefits Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recongised costs for a restructuring. If benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date, then they are discounted. (j) Provisions A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be measured reliably and it is probable that settlement of the obligation will involve an outflow of funds. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. (k) Revenue (i) Goods sold and services rendered Revenue reflects the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in ordinary course of business, net of discounts, rebates, returns and excluding VAT. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 95 have been transferred to the customer, collectability of the consideration is probable for the Group, costs incurred can be estimated reliable by the Group, the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree normally associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold to the customer and amount of revenue can be measured reliably by the Group. The transfer of risks and rewards varies depending on the terms of the individual sales contract. Transfer of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale. These criteria are met at the time the product is shipped and delivered to the customer and title and risk have passed to the customer (depending on the delivery conditions) and acceptance of the product has been obtained. For products for which a right of return exists during a defined period, revenue recognition is determined based on the historical pattern of actual returns, or in cases where such information is not available, revenue recognition is postponed until the return period has lapsed. Revenue from services is recognized when the Group can reliably measure the amount of revenue and the associated cost related to the stage of completion of a contract or transaction, and the recovery of the consideration is considered probable. Royalty income from intellectual property rights is recognized on an accrual basis based on actual or reliably estimated sales made by a licensees. Royalty income from an agreement with lump-sum consideration is recognized on accrual basis based on the contractual terms and substance of the relevant agreement with a licensee. (ii) Government grants Grants are initially recognised at fair value in statement of financial position as deferred income. Once there is a reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the applicable conditions the grant is recognised in proift or loss as operating income. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised asother income in profit or loss in the periods in which the expenses are incurred. Grants related to the acquisition of fixed assets are recognised in profit or loss as other operating income over the useful life of the asset. (l) Expenses (i) Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. (ii) Financial lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction in the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. (iii) Net finance costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, and financial assets held to maturity. Interest income is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 96 Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, commitment fees, accrued interest on provisions, interest on pension liabilities, impairment losses recognised on financial assets and losses on interest rate hedge instruments to the extent they are recognised in profit or loss. All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. Realised and unrealised foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities, including changes in fair value of currency hedge instruments that are not qualified as cash flow hedges, are reported on a net basis. (m) Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax, payable or receivable, on the taxable income for the year, using applicable tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the financial position date, and any adjustment to tax calculated in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: ■■ the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; ■■ relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not be reversed in the foreseeable future; ■■ arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they are reversed, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity; or on different tax entities, but the intention is to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be applied. Deferred tax assets are reduced if it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of a dividend are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend is recognised. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 97 (n) Earnings per share The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. (o) Segment reporting The Group defines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Executive Board, the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. This is in conformity with IFRS 8 – Operating segments. On the basis of the criteria of IFRS 8, Kendrion’s business units are the Group’s operating segments. An operating segment is a part of the Group engaging in business activities that may result in revenue and expenses, including the revenue and expenses relating to transactions with any of the Group’s other segments. The Executive Board conducts regular reviews of the operating segment’s results to reach decisions on the resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, whereby separate financial information for each operating segment is available. However, and on the basis of the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8.12, these operating segments have been aggregated into two reportable segments: Automotive and Industrial. In accordance with IFRS 8, the Company also discloses general and entity-wide information, including information about geographical areas and major customers of the Group as a whole. More information on the reportable segments is provided in note 19. (p) New standards and interpretations A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective, and have been endorsed by the European Union, for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and therefore apply to the year ended 31 December 2017: ■■ Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative. Amendments to this standard are part of IASB's Disclosure Initiative and will help users of the financial statements better understand changes in entity's debt. This amendment has no material impact on the consolidated financial statements. ■■ Amendment to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses. Amendments to this standard do have the purpose to clarify the accounting for deferred tax assets for unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair value. An entity needs to consider whether tax law restricts the sources of taxable profits against which it may make deductions on the reversal of that deductible temporary difference. In addition, amendments provide guidance on how an entity should determine future taxable profits and explain circumstances in which taxable profits may include the recovery of some assets for more than their carrying amount. This amendment has no material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 98 The standards or interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) that are not effective at 31 December 2017 but may be relevant are as follows: ■■ IFRS 9: Financial instruments. IFRS 9, endorsed by the European Union on 22 November 2016, replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 contains new guidance on: – Classification and measurement of financial instruments. For financial liabilities designated as accounted for at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) using the fair value option (FVO), the amount of the change in the fair value of such financial liabilities that is attributable to changes in credit risk must be presented in other comprehensive income (OCI). The remainder of the change in fair value is presented in profit or loss, unless presentation in OCI of the fair value change in respect of the liability’s credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. All other IAS 39 requirements for financial liabilities have been carried forward into IFRS 9; – Key change in terms of recognition and measurement of impairment losses on financial assets. IAS 39 only allows impairment losses based on losses already incurred. Whereas the IFRS 9 model is based on an expected credit loss model for calculating impairments. For certain financial instruments such as trade accounts receivable, simplifications for recognising impairment losses apply; and – New general hedge accounting requirements aiming for a closer alignment of hedge accounting with entity’s risk management strategy. IFRS 9 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 (early application is permitted). In 2017 we completed our survey and concluded that this standard has no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 2018 of the Group. ■■ IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with Customers. The new standard does not differentiate between different types of contracts and services, but rather introduces uniform criteria for the timing of revenue recognition. According to IFRS 15, an entity can recognise revenue at any time so that it reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The transfer of major risks and rewards of ownership of the goods is no longer the deciding factor. The new model involves five steps for recognition of revenue with the first steps being the identification of the contract with the customer (I) and the separate performance obligations it contains (II). The transaction price is then determined (III) and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract (IV). Finally (V), sales are recognised for each performance obligation in the amount of the allocated portion of the transaction price as soon as the agreed-upon good or service has been provided or the customer receives control over it. Principles are set out for determining whether the good or service has been provided over time or at one point in time. The rules and definitions of IFRS 15 supersede the content of IAS 11, IAS 18, IFRIC 13, IFRIC 15, IFRIC 18 and SIC 31. Consequently, it also amends IAS 16, IAS 38 and IAS 40 requiring entities to use the requirements of IFRS 15 for the recognition and measurement of gains and losses on disposal of non-financial assets that are not an output of an entity’s ordinary activities. European Union has endorsed this standard for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted. The standard will be adopted for the fiscal year beginning 1 January 2018 applying the modified retrospective approach meaning that the impact on the profit for the period 2017 will be adjusted in equity on 1 January 2018. The timing and amount of revenue that the Group 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 99 recognises under IFRS 15 may be effected compared to Kendrion's current accounting policy. Certain type of contracts with customers contain variable considerations. These variable considerations will have an impact on the transaction price to be allocated to the performance obligation(s). However the majority of our contracts with customers will be accounted for at a 'point in time'. IFRS 15 also gives more guidance on how to account for contract modifications than current revenue standard IAS 18. For contract modifications it needs to be assessed whether the change must be accounted for either as a retrospective change, prospectively with a reallocation of revenues amongst identified performance obligations, or prospectively as separate contracts. The Statement of Financial Position will change accordingly (e.g. receivables from contracts with customer, contract assets and contract liabilities (if any)) and disclosures will be amended. In 2017 we completed our survey and concluded that this standard has no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 2018 of the Group. ■■ IFRS 16 Leases: The European Union has endorsed on 31 October 2017 a new accounting standard, IFRS 16 Leases. This standard eliminates the current accounting model for lessees under IAS 17: on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases. IFRS 16 introduces a single on-balance sheet accounting model similar to current finance lease accounting, unless the lease terms is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. Lessor accounting remains similar to current accounting practice, which means that lessors continue to classify leases as finance and operating leases. Under IFRS 16 the balance sheet of lessees will be impacted by recognising the corresponding asset (‘right to use the asset’) of the lease arrangement. On the other hand, a liability is recognised with regard to the obligation to make lease payments. This new standard will bring off balance leases on the balance sheet. The statement of comprehensive income is impacted by depreciation of the lease asset and corresponding interest component, which is not necessarily similar to the cash rental previously recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. The new standard is expected to impact financial metrics such as solvency, EBIT(DA), earnings per share and return on equity. This standard applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. Transition options to apply are either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. The Group decided to adopt full retrospective IFRS 16 as per 1 January 2018. The impact on EBITA of the Group in 2018 is assessed on EUR 0.6 million positive. As per 1 January 2018 total assets will increase by EUR 15.5 million, total liabilities will increase by EUR 16.2 million and total equity will decrease by 0.7 million compared to yearend 2017. (q) Fair values (i) Measurement of fair value Several of the Group’s accounting policies, as well as the information supplied by the Group, require the fair value of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities to be determined. For valuation and information supplied, the fair value is measured using the methods below. Where applicable, more detailed information on the basis of the fair value measurement is disclosed in the specific notes on the asset or liability in question. The principal methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments included in the summary are given below. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 100 (ii) Property, plant and equipment The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is based on market value in use. The market value of property is the estimated amount for which the property in question could be exchanged on the valuation date between a buyer and seller in an arm’s length transaction, in which both parties have acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion. The market value of other items of property, plant and equipment is based on the quoted market prices of comparable assets and goods. (iii) Intangible assets The fair value of patents and trademarks acquired as part of a business combination is measured on the basis of the discounted estimated royalties that have been avoided through ownership of the patent or trademark. The fair value of customer relationships acquired in a business combination is based on the excess earnings method over multiple periods, valuing the asset in question by deducting a real return on all other assets which in total create the related cash flows. The fair value of other intangible assets is based on the expected discounted value of the cash flows from the use and ultimate sale of these assets. (iv) Financial lease liabilities The fair value is estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the interest rate for lease contracts of a similar nature. The estimated fair value reflects movements in interest rates. (v) Inventories The fair value of inventories acquired as part of a business combination is determined on the basis of the estimated selling price as part of normal business operations, less the estimated costs of completion and the selling costs, plus a reasonable profit margin that reflects the completion and sales effort. (vi) Trade and other receivables/trade and other payables The face value of receivables and liabilities falling due within one year is regarded as a reflection of their fair value. The fair value of all other receivables and liabilities is measured on the basis of present value. The discount factor is based on the risk-free interest rate of the same duration as the receivable and/or payable, plus a credit mark up reflecting the credit worthiness of the Group. (vii) Interest-bearing loans The fair value is calculated on the basis of the present value of future repayments of principal and interest at the prevailing market rate of interest, supplemented by a credit mark-up reflecting the credit worthiness of the Group. (viii) Derivatives The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on the present value of the contractual cash flows for the remaining term based on a risk-free interest rate. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 101 (ix) Non-derivative financial liabilities The fair value of non-derivative financial liabilities is determined from information supplied and is based on the present value of future repayments of principal and interest, discounted at a risk-free rate, and a margin based on the credit worthiness of the Group on the reporting date. (x) Contingent consideration The fair value of contingent considerations arising in a business combination is calculated using the income approach based on the expected payment amounts and their associated probabilities. If appropriate, it is discounted to present value. (r) Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: ■■ credit risk; ■■ liquidity risk; ■■ market risk. This section provides general information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks in the course of its normal business operations, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included in the financial instrument section in these consolidated financial statements. The Executive Board bears the ultimate responsibility for the organisation and control of the Group’s risk management framework. The Group’s risk policy is designed to identify and analyse the risks confronting the Group, implement appropriate risk limits and control measures, and monitor the risks and compliance with the limits. The risk management policy and systems are evaluated at regular intervals and, if necessary, adapted to accommodate changes in market conditions and the Group’s operations. The Company’s Supervisory Board supervises compliance with the Group’s risk management policy and procedures. For a more detailed description of risk management and the position of financial risk management in the Group’s framework, see Report of the Executive Board. (i) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group in the event that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risks arise primarily from accounts receivable, derivative transactions concluded with banks, and cash positions and deposits held with banks. The Group continually monitors the credit risk within the Group. The Group does not normally require collateral for trade and other receivables or financial assets. The credit policy includes an assessment of the creditworthiness of every new major customer before offering payment and delivery terms. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 102 This assessment includes external credit ratings or reports if they are available. The creditworthiness of major customers is actively monitored on an ongoing basis. The Group recognises impairment provisions of an amount equal to the estimated losses on trade and other receivables and other investments. The main component of this provision comprises specific provisions for losses on individual accounts of material significance. (ii) Credit risk concentration The customer with the largest receivable outstanding accounted for 6% of the trade and other receivables at 31 December 2017. In 2016, the largest customer outstanding at 31 December 2016 accounted for 7% of total trade and other receivables. Other customers individually accounted for 5% or less of the trade and other receivables at 31 December 2017. The geographical credit risk from the Group’s direct customers is largely concentrated in Germany. However, as the Group’s most important customers in the various segments of the German market are multinational or global players, this reduces the Group’s dependency on the German market. (iii) Investments and financial instruments The Group currently does not invest in debt securities. Cash positions and exposure to the financial instruments of financial counterparties are monitored actively. The Group’s main financial counterparties are well-established banks with good creditworthiness. The cash in bank accounts at other than the core-relationship banks is maintained at the minimum level required for the operations of the Group’s companies. (iv) Liquidity risk The liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations at the required time. Liquidity risk management is based on the maintenance of sufficient liquidity in the form of unused (committed) credit facilities or cash to meet present and future financial obligations in normal and adverse circumstances. A summary of the credit lines available to the Group is disclosed in note 10 of these consolidated financial statements. The majority of the available facilities are provided by a syndicate of lenders consisting of BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and ING Bank on an equal basis. The Group had approximately EUR 91 million available within its existing revolving credit facility on the financial position date. (v) Market risk The market risk is the risk of the deterioration of the Group’s income due to movements in market prices, such as those relating to exchange rates and interest rates. The management of market risk exposure is intended to keep the market risk position within acceptable limits. Derivatives are used to manage specific market risks. These transactions are carried out within the treasury framework adopted by the Executive Board. If necessary, the Group uses hedge accounting to manage volatility in the statement of comprehensive income. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 103 (vi) Interest rate risk Pursuant to the Group’s policy more than 50% of the exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is maintained on a fixed rate basis, taking into account any assets with exposure to changes in interest rates and expected short-term free cash flows. The policy is implemented by making use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate options. The Group has currently outstanding interest swap contracts with a total underlying notional value of EUR 50 million in order to reduce interest rate risk exposure to increasing market rates. EUR 15 million matures in first quarter of 2018, EUR 15 million in third quarter 2018 and EUR 20 million matures in 2020. (vii) Currency risk The Group is exposed to exchange rate risks on sales, purchases, equity positions and loans expressed in currencies other than the euro. The Group companies are primarily financed in their own currency. The majority of the revenues and costs of the Group companies are realised in the euro zone. Approximately 75% of the cost base and revenues are realised in euros. Sales outside the euro zone are partly generated locally and partly through exports from the euro zone. Most of these exports are realised in euros. The Group’s activities in the Czech Republic have the most significant currency exposure, since the majority of revenue is generated in euros and part of the costs are in Czech korunas. Pursuant to the Group’s policy this currency exposure is hedged to a level of at least 70% for the next four quarters and at least 35% for the next four quarters thereafter. Exchange rate risks are hedged with derivatives. The Group also actively hedges intercompany loans in foreign currencies with currency forwards, swaps or back-to-back loans in the same foreign currency. Pursuant to the Group’s policy for other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, net exposure is maintained at an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates as required to correct short-term imbalances. The Group’s policy stipulates that, in principle, equity investments and other translation exposures are not hedged. (viii) Other price risks Steel, copper and rare earth metals used in permanent magnets are the most important commodities for the Group. Copper constitutes the Group’s main direct exposure to raw material price risks, since copper wire is an important component of electromagnets. Pursuant to the Group’s policy, the sensitivity to copper prices is actively reduced both by concluding fixed-price purchase contracts in the normal course of business with copper wire suppliers and by including raw material clauses in sales contracts. As the need arises the Group can also conclude derivative financial instrument contracts with financial counterparties to hedge the copper risk. No financial derivative contracts for raw materials were outstanding at the balance sheet date. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 104 The Group is also exposed to risks associated with rare earth metals such as neodymium, a component of permanent magnets, which are used in some of the Group’s products. Prices of these commodities have shown significant volatility in the past. The Group closely monitors developments in this market and has increased stock levels and the number of supply sources for these permanent magnets. Furthermore, agreements have been made with customers representing the majority of the sales volume in this context, to link sales prices to movements in permanent magnet prices. The Group is mainly indirectly exposed to raw material price risks relating to oil and steel, primarily as part of the purchase prices of machined components. This exposure is monitored and, if feasible, reduced by means of raw material clauses with customers and by concluding fixedprice agreements with suppliers for periods of between six and twelve months. The Kendrion steel contracts also partly govern the purchasing from component suppliers. Raw materials are purchased separately by each business unit, but in accordance with the group policy reviewed periodically with the objective of further increasing and sharing knowledge on commodities and commodity markets between business units, reducing risks and/or prices. (ix) Capital management The Executive Board’s policy is designed to maintain a strong capital gearing to retain the confidence of investors, creditors and the markets, and to safeguard the future development of the business activities. The Executive Board monitors the return on equity, which the Group defines as the net operating result divided by shareholders’ equity, excluding minority interests. The Executive Board also monitors the level of dividend distributed to ordinary shareholders. The Executive Board seeks to strike a balance between a higher return that would be achievable with a higher level of borrowed capital and the benefits and security of sound capital gearing. Kendrion carried out an evaluation of its dividend policy during the course of 2011. The results of this evaluation were discussed at the General Meeting of Shareholders on 16 April 2012. Kendrion intends to distribute an annual dividend of between 35% and 50% of the net profit, taking into consideration the amount of net profit to be retained to support the medium and long-term strategic plans of the company and to maintain a minimum solvency of 35%. Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are subject to any externally imposed capital requirements beyond those stipulated by law. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 105 1 Property, plant and equipment Land and Plant and Other fixed Under EUR million buildings equipment assets construction Total Cost Balance as at 1 January 2016 48.2 100.1 41.8 11.1 201.2 Acquired, other 1.9 16.5 5.4 7.1 30.9 Disposals (0.4) (0.5) (0.3) (10.0) (11.2) Currency translation differences 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.2 Balance as at 31 December 2016 49.8 116.2 46.9 8.2 221.1 Balance as at 1 January 2017 49.8 116.2 46.9 8.2 221.1 Acquired, other 3.1 11.2 5.9 11.1 31.3 Disposals (0.6) (3.3) (2.1) (6.7) (12.7) Currency translation differences (0.4) (0.6) (0.1) (0.2) (1.3) Balance as at 31 December 2017 51.9 123.5 50.6 12.4 238.4 Depreciation and impairment losses Balance as at 1 January 2016 21.3 66.3 30.8 0.1 118.5 Depreciation for the year 2.0 10.8 4.4 – 17.2 Impairment – 0.2 0.3 – 0.5 Disposals – (0.4) (0.2) – (0.6) Balance as at 31 December 2016 23.3 76.9 35.3 0.1 135.6 Balance as at 1 January 2017 23.3 76.9 35.3 0.1 135.6 Depreciation for the year 1.9 10.4 4.5 0.0 16.8 Impairment 0.1 0.9 0.0 0.0 1.0 Disposals (0.5) (2.9) (2.0) – (5.4) Balance as at 31 December 2017 24.8 85.3 37.8 0.1 148.0 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 106 Land and Plant and Other fixed Under EUR million buildings equipment assets construction Total Carrying amounts As at 1 January 2016 26.9 33.8 11.0 11.0 82.7 As at 31 December 2016 26.5 39.3 11.6 8.1 85.5 As at 1 January 2017 26.5 39.3 11.6 8.1 85.5 As at 31 December 2017 27.1 38.2 12.8 12.3 90.4 Translation differences are calculated on the carrying amount and reflected in the related item in the cost.

The investments in software during 2017 of EUR 2.9 million (2016: EUR 2.0 million) mainly relate to an upgrade of the ERP system. The other intangible assets comprise the carrying amount of customer relationships amounting to EUR 15.2 million (2016: EUR 18.4 million). These customer relationships were acquired through business combinations. Depreciation and amortisation Depreciation and amortisation are recognised in the following items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income: EUR million 2017 2016 Depreciation and amortisation 23.5 24.0 The estimated useful life of software is between three and eight years. The estimated useful life of other intangible assets is approximately between eight and fifteen years. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 108 The Executive Board reviews at each reporting period the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset with a definite useful life. As per the upgrade of the ERP system in 2017 the useful life of the ERP system is reassessed and revised. The revision of the usefull life of the ERP sytem had a favorable impact of EUR 0.5 million on amortization in 2017. Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill As part of the strategy announced on 3 May 2016 'Simplify, Focus, Grow' Kendrion eliminated the divisional management layer and reduced the number of business units from seven to five. Managements' approach to manage the company from a business unit perspective has been further enforced and became fully effective as from 1 January 2017. Goodwill as recognised on the balance sheet as on 1 January 2017 is reallocated to the five business units applying the relative value approach (IAS 36.87). Goodwill EUR million 2017 Business Unit Industrial Magnetic Systems 6.4 Business Unit Industrial Control Systems 17.7 Business Unit Industrial Drive Systems 7.1 Business Unit Passenger Cars 24.5 Business Unit Commercial Vehicles 35.2 90.9 The consolidated financial statements 2016, pages 110-112, show the required goodwill disclosures with regard to the cash-generating units identified as per 31 December 2016. Key assumptions and method of quantification The Group recognises its intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38 and IFRS 3. Pursuant to IAS 36, the Group has performed an impairment test with reference to the goodwill allocated to each individual cash-generating unit. This test was carried out by discounting future cash flows (‘value in use’) to be generated from the continuing use of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill applies and on the assumption of an indefinite life. The cash flows for the next five years were based on mid-term plans and budgets drawn up by the local management and approved by the Executive Board. The Group did not recognise any impairment of goodwill in this reporting period. For the subsequent years, the residual value was calculated on the basis of the results in the last year of relevant forecasts, with a terminal growth rate of 2% taken into account. The forecasts took no account of tax considerations, i.e. were based on pre-tax cash flow. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model was also pre-tax. Expansion investments were excluded from the calculations in the residual value. The expected growth in cash flows as a result of these expansion investments was also excluded. Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts concern discount rates, terminal value growth rates and EBITA growth. Key assumptions are based on past experience and source from external sources. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 109 These assumptions are as follows: Discounted cash flow projections Discount rate Terminal value growth rate 2017 2017 Business Unit Industrial Magnetic Systems 7.4% 2.0% Business Unit Industrial Control Systems 7.1% 2.0% Business Unit Industrial Drive Systems 7.0% 2.0% Business Unit Passenger Cars 7.3% 2.0% Business Unit Commercial Vehicles 8.1% 2.0% Discount rate In determining the pre-tax discount rate, first the post-tax average costs of capital were calculated for all cash generating units containing goodwill. The post-tax rate is based on debt leveraging compared to the market value of equity of 22%. All the post-tax weighted average cost of capital rates of cash generating units approximated 5.6% to 6.2%, and these rates were used for calculating the post-tax cash flows. Terminal value growth rate All cash generating units with goodwill have five years of cash flows included in their discounted cash flow models. A long-term growth rate in perpetuity has been determined on the basis of a growth rate of 2%. Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The recoverable amounts of all cash-generating units with goodwill exceed their carrying amounts. Management has carried out an analysis of sensitivity to changes in the key assumptions. The following table shows the percentage by which either discount rate (post tax) or forecasted EBITA would need to change for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying amount: Change required for recoverable amount to equal carrying amount Discount rate (post tax) Forecasted EBITA 2017 2017 Business Unit Industrial Magnetic Systems 24.7% (83%) Business Unit Industrial Control Systems 17.6% (82%) Business Unit Industrial Drive Systems 19.1% (80%) Business Unit Passenger Cars 21.3% (87%) Business Unit Commercial Vehicles 6.7% (60%) This table shows that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions would not cause the value in use to fall to the level of the carrying value. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 110 3 Other investments, including derivatives Other investments in 2017 include financial derivatives and recognised upfront and legal fees related to the facility agreement (see note 10). Kendrion amortises these costs over the remaining maturity of the facility. As these costs relate to the facility agreement as a whole and not to individual loans, these costs are not part of the effective interest rate of outstanding loans. 4 Deferred tax assets and liabilities The Group has recognised deferred tax assets for tax loss carry-forwards in the following jurisdictions: Germany Tax assessments have been submitted for the German companies up to and including 2015. In 2017 tax audits started with regard to the assessment periods 2012-2014 with reference to our Northern Germany operating companies (years up to and 2011 are final) and assessment periods 2010-2014 with respect to our Southern Germany operating companies (years up to and 2009 are final). Only the tax audit of the assessment period 2010-2014 at Kendrion Markdorf is closed. Our operating company in Central Germany, Kendrion Aerzen, has been audited up to and including 2008 and the tax audit started in 2017 relates to assessment periods 2009-2014. At 31 December 2017 tax loss carry forwards amounted to EUR 7.0 million (‘Gewerbesteuer’) and EUR 19.5 million (‘Körperschaftsteuer’). These are recognised in full, resulting in deferred tax assets of EUR 3.5 million (2016: EUR 4.6 million). United States of America Tax assessments have been submitted up to and including 2016. The years 2013 up to 2015 are open for tax audits. At 31 December 2017 the tax loss carry forwards amounted to EUR 2.7 million (2016: EUR 3.7 million). These are recognised in full, resulting in deferred tax assets of EUR 0.6 million (2016: EUR 1.3 million). As per the USA ‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’ (dated 22 December 2017) the corporate income tax rate decreased from 35% to 21% as per 1 January 2018. This new legislation means that deferred tax positons as per 31 December 2017 are revalued and had a postive impact of EUR 0.3 million on net deferred taxes. The Netherlands Tax assessments have been submitted up to and including 2015. The years 2011 up to 2017 are still open for potential tax audits. At 31 December 2017 the tax loss carry-forwards amounted to EUR 3.4 million (2016: EUR 4.5 million). These are recognised in full, resulting in deferred tax assets of EUR 0.8 million (2016: EUR 1.1 million). These tax loss carry-forwards originated in 2012. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 111 Deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the financial position The deferred tax assets and liabilities can be specified as follows: EUR million Assets Liabilities Net 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Property, plant and equipment 0.1 0.1 3.1 3.6 (3.0) (3.5) Intangible assets 3.6 4.3 5.2 6.8 (1.6) (2.5) Inventories 0.2 0.4 0.2 0.2 (0.0) 0.2 Employee benefits 1.6 2.2 – 0.0 1.6 2.2 Provisions 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.2 (0.0) (0.1) Other items 1.7 1.9 0.1 0.1 1.6 1.8 Tax value of recognised loss carry-forwards 4.9 7.0 – – 4.9 7.0 Deferred tax assets/liabilities 12.3 16.0 8.8 10.9 3.5 5.1 The deferred tax liabilities relate almost entirely to temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax base of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. These are of a relatively long-term nature, mostly longer than five years. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be set off. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed if the probability of future taxable profits improves. Tax loss carry forward limitation rules apply in certain jurisdictions in which Kendrion has carry forward tax losses. These rules might under certain circumstances lead to a (proportional) forfeiture of recognised and unrecognised carry forward tax losses in case of a direct or indirect change in ownership. The tax losses carry forward for which no deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position are reviewed each reporting date. These tax losses carry forward for which no deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position amount to EUR 0.9 million (expire in 2020). 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 112 Movement in temporary differences during the financial year Net, EUR million 2017 Recognised in other Recognised comprehensive At 31 At 1 January in profit or loss income December Property, plant and equipment (3.5) 0.5 – (3.0) Intangible assets (2.5) 0.9 – (1.6) Inventories 0.2 (0.2) – (0.0) Employee benefits 2.2 (0.4) (0.2) 1.6 Provisions (0.1) 0.1 – (0.0) Other items 1.8 (0.2) – 1.6 Tax value of loss carry-forwards used 7.0 (2.1) – 4.9 5.1 (1.4) (0.2) 3.5 Net, EUR million 2016 Recognised in other Recognised comprehensive At 31 At 1 January in profit or loss income December Property, plant and equipment (3.4) (0.1) – (3.5) Intangible assets (6.6) 4.1 – (2.5) Inventories (0.1) 0.3 – 0.2 Employee benefits 1.6 (0.1) 0.7 2.2 Provisions 0.2 (0.3) – (0.1) Other items 2.2 (0.4) – 1.8 Tax value of loss carry-forwards used 10.6 (3.6) – 7.0 4.5 (0.1) 0.7 5.1 In 2017, the net amount from the movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities, presented as tax in the statement of comprehensive income, is negative EUR 1.4 million (2016: negative EUR 0.1 million). 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 113 5 Inventories EUR million 2017 2016 Raw materials, consumables, technical materials and packing materials 31.3 25.9 Work in progress 11.4 11.5 Finished goods 12.2 11.7 Goods for resale 2.4 3.5 57.3 52.6 The inventories are presented after accounting for a provision of EUR 8.2 million (2016: EUR 9.0 million) for obsolescence.

Gains and losses relating to the translation risk are recognised in equity. The build-up of the cumulative figure commenced on 1 January 2004. Hedge reserve The hedge reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net movement in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments relating to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, net of tax. The net movement was EUR 0.6 million positive (2016: EUR 0.2 million, negative). The hedge reserve increased by EUR 0.4 million due to the realisation of hedged transactions (2016: EUR 0.0 million). The hedge reserve increased by EUR 0.2 million due to valuation effects (2016: negative EUR 0.2 million). There was no hedge ineffectiveness in 2017 (2016: EUR 0.0 million). Reserve for own shares (treasury shares) The reserve for the Company’s own shares comprises the shares held by the Company for issueance of share dividend and the remuneration packages for the Executive Board. At 31 December 2017, the Company held 121,586 of its own shares (2016: none). Other reserves Other reserves are all the reserves other than those shown separately and primarily represent the accumulated, undistributed profits from previous financial years. Retained earnings In 2017, the result for 2016 was fully transferred to other reserves. Retained earnings in the 2017 financial statements consequently consist solely of the result for 2017. 9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share The calculation of the basic earnings per share at 31 December 2017 is based on the profit for the period of EUR 19.5 million (2016: EUR 14.9 million) attributable to the holders of ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year 2017: 13,446,000 (2016: 13,327,000).

The Credit Facility is committed until 15 August 2019 and includes an option (accordion option) to increase the facility by a maximum of EUR 75.0 million; ■■ EUR 3.7 million mortgage loan for the premises of the Kuhnke facilities in Malente, Germany. The loan ultimately matures in 2022; ■■ EUR 0.6 million in subsidised term loans with final maturity in 2019; ■■ EUR 0.1 million in financial leases for various equipment in Germany; ■■ EUR 1.0 million in other overdraft facilities. At 31 December 2017, the total unutilised amount of the facilities was approximately EUR 91 million. Banking syndicate credit facility Pursuant to the terms of the credit facility with the banking syndicate, the Group has agreed to financial covenants relating to the leverage ratio (interest bearing debt / EBITDA) and interest coverage (EBITDA / interest costs). In accordance with these covenants, the leverage ratio should remain below 3.0, which can under certain circumstances be temporarily increased to a maximum of 3.5. The interest coverage should always exceed 4.0. Both covenants are tested quarterly on a 12-month rolling basis. The actual leverage ratio at year-end was 1.0 (2016: 1.1) and the actual interest coverage at year-end was 34.0 (2016: 24.5). 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 118 Security provided The Group has provided a mortgage on its premises in Malente, Germany for a EUR 3.7 million loan. No security is provided in relation to the EUR 150 million revolving Credit Facility. Interest-rate sensitivity Interest on the EUR 4.4 million other loans is based on fixed-term interest rates. Interest amounts payable on the EUR 150 million revolving Credit Facility are based on short-term interest rate (mainly three months). See note 15 and accounting policy r for further details.

In the case of defined contribution plans, the contribution is charged to the year to which it relates. With defined benefit plans, benefit obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. Calculations are made by qualified actuaries. The pension liability shown in the statement of financial position represents the present value 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 121 of the defined benefit obligation at the financial position date minus the fair value of the plan assets at this date. The discount rate methodology for accounting long-term employee benefits in accordance with IAS 19 is determined by the Executive Board. Significant judgement is required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived. The most significant criteria considered for the selection of bonds include the issue size of the corporate bonds, quality of the bonds and the identification of outliers which are excluded. The discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation is based on the yield on AA-rated high-quality corporate bonds issued in Euros. Since the pension arrangements involve long-term obligations and uncertainties, it is necessary to make assumptions in order to estimate the amount that the Group needs to invest to fund its pension obligations. External actuaries calculate the obligation for defined benefit plans partly on the basis of information provided by the Executive Board, such as future pay rises, the return on plan assets, mortality tables and the probable extent to which pension scheme members will leave the scheme because they have reached retirement age, become incapacitated or left the Group. The greater part of the defined benefit obligation at year-end 2017 relates to post employment arrangements in Germany. The group companies account individually for the pension schemes. The individual group company is fully liable for its benefit obligation. A portion for the German group companies is reinsured. All pension arrangements accounted for as defined benefit obligations are not open for new participants (< 15% active participants) except for the pension arrangement of Kendrion Switzerland. This pension arrangement is a contribution-based plan and pension premiums paid to the multi-employer fund are vested rights for plan participants. Under EU-IFRS the pension arrangement of Kendrion Switzerland is qualifed as a defined benefit plan as Kendrion Switzerland is liable for any shortfall (if any) of the multi-employer fund in which Kendrion Switzerland participates. In 2016 the Group decided to close the manufacturing facility in Switzerland. Closure of the manufacturing facility and corresponding termination of employment contracts qualified as a curtailment in 2016. The curtailment gain amounted to EUR 1.2 million and is recognised as past service credit in 2016, see also note 21. In 2017 the pension arrangement of Kendrion Switzerland is settled and resulted in a settlement gain of EUR 1.4 million. This settlement gain is recognised as service cost credit in 2017, see also note 21. Liabilities arising from employee benefits also include liabilities relating to long-service, early retirement and service anniversaries of EUR 3.9 million (2016: EUR 3.2 million) in Germany and Austria. 12 Share-based payments At 31 December 2017, the Group had the following share-based payment arrangements. Share plan for the Executive Board (equity settled) Details of the remuneration of the Executive Board are provided in note 26. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 122 Loyalty bonus (equity settled) The Group had a share incentive programme, which entitled certain managers to purchase shares in the Company for an amount up to 50% of their respective net cash bonuses. Employees who retain these shares for three years and remain in service for three years become entitled to a number of shares equal to the number of shares they individually purchased. Pursuant to this incentive programme, a total of 2,479 shares was issued in 2017, resulting from shares granted in 2014. Expenses recognised in profit or loss for the shares amount to EUR 0.2 million.

The maximum credit risk on the reporting date was as follows: EUR million 2017 2016 Cash and cash equivalents 7.6 12.4 Other long term investments 0.2 0.4 Current income tax 1.0 1.2 Trade and other receivables 58.1 54.5 Total 66.9 68.5 Impairment losses Aging analysis of the trade and other receivables EUR million 2017 2016 Gross Provision Gross Provision Within the term of payment 45.8 – 47.3 – 0 – 30 days due 8.9 – 5.7 – 31 – 60 days due 1.5 – 0.7 – > 60 days due 2.2 (0.3) 0.9 (0.1) Total trade and other receivables 58.4 (0.3) 54.6 (0.1) The provision for trade receivables is used to absorb impairment losses, unless the Group is certain that collection of the amount owed is impossible, in which case the amount is treated as a bad debt and written off against the financial asset in question. At 31 December 2017 the provision for impairment losses on trade and other receivables relates to several customer invoices that the Group believes to be non-collectible, in whole or in part. Based on historic payment behaviour and financial information currently known all receivables that are not impaired at 31 December 2017 are collectible. EUR 3.7 million of trade receivables are 30 days overdue, of which EUR 0.3 million is provided for. The Group has written off less than EUR 0.1 million receivables in 2017 (2016: less than EUR 0.1 million), which are recognised under other operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. The customer with the largest trade receivables outstanding accounted for 6% of the trade and other receivables at 31 December 2017. At 31 December 2016 the largest customer accounted for 7% of total receivables. The geographical credit risk from the Group’s direct customers is largely concentrated in Germany. However, as the Group’s most important customers in the various segments of the German market are multinational or global players this reduces the Group’s dependency on the German market. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 124 Liquidity risk The contractual terms of the financial obligations, including the estimated interest payments and repayment obligations, are set out below. 31 December 2017 Contractual EUR million Carrying amount cash flows 0 – 6 months 6 – 12 months 1 – 2 years 2 – 5 years › 5 years Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank syndicate loans 46.0 (47.2) (0.3) (0.3) (46.6) – – Finance lease liabilities 0.1 (0.1) (0.1) (0.0) – – – Bank overdrafts 11.7 (11.7) (11.7) – – – – Other loans and borrowings 4.3 (4.9) (0.6) (0.6) (1.2) (2.5) – Trade and other payables 72.3 (72.3) (72.3) – – – – Tax liabilities 1.4 (1.4) (1.4) – – – – Derivative financial liabilities Interest rate swap contracts 0.1 (0.1) (0.0) (0.0) (0.1) (0.0) – Forward exchange contracts – – – – – – – Total 135.9 (137.7) (86.4) (0.9) (47.9) (2.5) – 31 December 2016 Contractual EUR million Carrying amount cash flows 0 – 6 months 6 – 12 months 1 – 2 years 2 – 5 years › 5 years Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank syndicate loans 58.0 (60.1) (0.4) (0.4) (0.8) (58.5) – Finance lease liabilities 0.3 (0.3) (0.2) (0.1) – – – Bank overdrafts 2.7 (2.7) (2.7) – – – – Other loans and borrowings 5.4 (6.1) (0.6) (0.6) (1.2) (2.9) (0.8) Trade and other payables 68.4 (68.4) (68.4) – – – – Tax liabilities 0.7 (0.7) (0.7) – – – – Derivative financial liabilities Interest rate swap contracts 0.2 (0.2) (0.0) (0.1) (0.1) – – Forward exchange contracts 0.3 (0.3) (0.2) (0.1) – – – Total 136.0 (138.8) (73.2) (1.3) (2.1) (61.4) (0.8) It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis should occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 125 Within the scope of the Group’s risk management the Group has hedged the currency and interest risks with derivatives, whereby the hedges have been designated as cash flow hedges.

In view of the Treasury Policy, the Group hedges at least 50% of the floating interest rate exposure. To this extent the Group has outstanding interest rate swaps with a notional amount of in total EUR 50 million. The aggregate fair value of the outstanding interest rate swaps at 31 December 2017 was negative EUR 0.1 million (2016: negative EUR 0.2 million). The following table shows the interest rates prevailing at the financial position date for interest-bearing financial liabilities. The majority of all interest 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 127 expenses relate to senior bank loans. The effective interest rate of these loans equalise the nominal interest rate. The EUR 3.7 million mortgage loan was acquired through business combinations in 2013 and initially recorded at fair value. The effective interest rate of the loan is 3.7%. Other loans are not provided at an upcount or discount and no incremental transaction costs were incurred when the loans were drawn. 2017 2016 Nominal Year of Carrying Carrying Currency interest redemption Fair value amount Fair value amount Banking syndicate loans EUR IBOR + 1.35% 2019 46.0 46.0 58.0 58.0 Mortgage loan EUR 6.4% 2022 3.9 3.7 4.7 4.4 Other loans EUR 3.5% 2019 0.6 0.6 1.0 1.0 Bank overdrafts Various IBOR + 1.35% 2018 11.7 11.7 2.7 2.7 Finance lease liabilities EUR 3.0% 6.5% 2018 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 Total interest-bearing debt 62.3 62.1 66.7 66.4 Sensitivity analysis interest Financial assets and liabilities with a fixed interest rate are not recognised at fair value by processing the value changes in profit or loss. For this reason a movement in interest rates across the yield curve at 1 January 2017 would not have had a material effect on the 2017 profit for the period. The Group has hedged a considerable part of the floating interest rate exposure by means of interest rate swaps. When taking into account these swaps and the loans with a fixed rate, in total EUR 54.4 million of the EUR 62.1 million long-term and short-term loans at financial year-end have an interest rate which is fixed for one year or longer. Based on the interest bearing debt levels at year-end and expected cash flow development, a 1% point increase in the interest rate across the yield curve as from 1 January 2018, will have an increasing effect on interest expenses in 2018 of maximum EUR 0.1 million. Exchange rate risk The aggregate fair value of the outstanding forward exchange rate contracts concluded to hedge anticipated transactions was positive EUR 0.4 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: negative EUR 0.3 million). 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 128 A 10% point appreciation of the currencies listed hereafter against the euro would increase shareholders’ equity at 31 December 2017 and the result for 2017 by the amounts shown in the following table. A 10% point depreciation of the listed currencies against the euro would have had the opposite effect. The same analysis was performed for 2016. The same test was done for the profit or loss, where the sensitivities for a 10% appreciation or depreciation on 31 December would have had an impact as is shown below. 31 December 2017 Equity Result US dollar 4.7 (0.0) Czech koruna 0.2 (0.2) Chinese yuan 0.4 0.1 Rumanian lei 1.2 0.5 31 December 2016 Equity Result US dollar 5.1 0.0 Czech koruna 0.2 (0.1) Chinese yuan 1.2 0.1 Rumanian lei 0.7 0.1 Principal exchange rates during the reporting period were as follows: Applicable currency rates Value of EUR At 31 December 2017 At 31 December 2016 Average over 2017 Pound sterling 0.8872 0.8562 0.8734 Swiss franc 1.1702 1.0739 1.1115 Czech koruna 25.5350 27.0212 26.3331 Chinese yuan 7.8044 7.3202 7.6218 US dollar 1.1993 1.0541 1.1277 Mexican peso 23.6614 21.7718 21.4523 Romanian lei 4.6585 4.5390 4.5703 Swedish krona 9.8438 9.5525 9.6296 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 129 Fair values of financial instruments The following table shows the fair values and carrying amounts of the financial instruments: EUR million 2017 2016 Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value Assets carried at amortised costs Receivables (including current tax assets) 59.1 59.1 55.7 55.7 Cash and cash equivalents 7.6 7.6 12.4 12.4 Held to maturity investments 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.4 66.9 66.9 68.5 68.5 Liabilities carried at amortised costs Banking syndicate loans (46.0) (46.0) (58.0) (58.0) Mortgage loan (3.7) (3.9) (4.4) (4.7) Other loans (0.6) (0.6) (1.0) (1.0) Finance lease liabilities (0.1) (0.1) (0.3) (0.3) Bank overdraft (11.7) (11.7) (2.7) (2.7) Trade and other payables (including current tax liabilities) (73.7) (73.7) (69.1) (69.1) (135.8) (136.0) (135.5) (135.8) Assets and liabilities carried at fair value Interest derivatives (0.1) (0.1) (0.2) (0.2) Forward exchange contracts 0.4 0.4 (0.3) (0.3) 0.3 0.3 (0.5) (0.5) The Group has no available-for-sale financial assets and all liabilities at fair value were designated as such upon initial recognition.

The interest derivatives and forward exchange contracts are included in the trade and other payables in the statement of financial position. 16 17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2017 130 Interest rate used in measuring fair value The interest rate used for discounting estimated cash flows, where applicable, is based on the swap curve at 31 December 2017, augmented by the prevailing credit mark-up, and is as follows: 2017 2016 Derivatives 0.0% 0.0% Leases 1.4% 1.5% Banking syndicate loans 1.4% 1.5% Mortgage loans 1.8% 1.8% Other loans 1.8% 1.8% Fair value hierarchy In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. The fair value calculation method of all assets and liabilities carried at amortised costs is categorised in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows: level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities); level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The operating lease agreements mostly relate to buildings. 17 Capital commitments As at 31 December 2017 the Group had capital commitments totalling to EUR 7.4 million (2016: EUR 3.9 million). 18 Contingent assets and liabilities Contingent assets Kendrion started a court case against the European Union to claim compensation for damages suffered by Kendrion as a result of a breach by the court in the so-called Fardem case of the requirements concerning reasonable time limits for court cases. An amount of EUR 2.3 million was claimed for material damages and an amount of EUR 11 million (being 10% of the penalty for each year of unreasonable delay). Secondary an amount of EUR 1.7 million (being 5% of penalty, in line with another case) was claimed for non-pecuniary damages. On 1 February 2017 the court ruled that the Union must compensate Kendrion in an amount of EUR 588,769 for material damages and an amount of EUR 6,000 for nonpecuniary damages. The Union, represented by the Court of Justice of the European Union, appealed against this decision. Kendrion submitted its defence and also appealed as a response. The Union responded to Kendrion’s appeal. In accordance with the procedural requirements, Kendrion requested a court hearing to substantiate its position. The request for a court hearing is still pending. Contingent liabilties The Group had guarantees in particular with regard to rentals, financing facilties and post employee benefits totalling to EUR 1.5 million (2016: EUR 1.5 million).

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ section of our report. We are independent of Kendrion N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the Verordening gedragsen beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). 16 17 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2017 149 We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion Materiality Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material, if individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extend of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. Based on our professional judgement we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a whole at EUR 1.4 million (2016: EUR 1.4 million). The materiality is based on 7.5 percent of 2016 profit before taxation. We reassessed the group materiality level based on the 2017 actual profit before tax and alternative benchmarks. We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons. Audits of group entities (components) were performed using materiality levels determined by the judgement of the group audit team, having regard to the materiality of the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Component materiality did not exceed 60% of group materiality and for most components, materiality is significantly less than this. We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR 70 thousand, which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that, in our view, must be reported on qualitative grounds. Scope of the group audit Kendrion N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Kendrion N.V. Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for the group entities (components). Decisive were size and/or risk profile of the components. On this basis, we selected components for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. Kendrion N.V. is divided into two reportable segments, as disclosed in note 19 of the consolidated financial statements. These two reportable segments encompass 36 reporting entities (‘components’). The most significant components are Kendrion (Eibiswald) GmbH, Kendrion (Villingen) GmbH, Kendrion (Donaueschingen/Engelswies) GmbH, Kendrion Kuhnke Automotive GmbH and Kendrion (Shelby) Inc. which on a combined basis contribute approximately 65% of the consolidated revenue. 16 17 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2017 150 Our group audit mainly concentrated on significant components in terms of size and financial interest or where significant risks or complex activities were present, leading to full scope audits performed for 13 components. We have performed audit procedures ourselves at corporate entities and we have carried out full scope audit procedures on Kendrion (Shelby) Inc. Furthermore, we performed audit procedures at group level on areas such as consolidation, reporting, goodwill and taxation. Specialists were involved amongst others in the areas of information technology, tax, pensions and valuation. For all relevant foreign components, the group audit team provided detailed written instructions, which, in addition to communicating the requirements of component audit teams, detailed significant audit areas and information obtained centrally relevant to the audit of individual components including awareness for risk related to management override. Furthermore, we developed a plan for overseeing each component audit team based on its relative significance to the Company and certain other risk characteristics. This included procedures such as visiting components and/or component teams in Germany and the United States, performing file reviews, holding conference calls, attending meetings and reviewing component audit team deliverables to gain sufficient understanding of the work performed. For smaller components we have performed review procedures or specific audit procedures. Considering their share in consolidated revenue, 95% of the components is subject to audit procedures. Desk-top review procedures have been performed in respect of the components that have not been audited. By performing the procedures mentioned above we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the group’s financial information to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Our key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 16 17 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2017 151 Key audit matter – decentralized operations How the key audit matter was addressed in the audit Kendrion is a group with all operating activities taking place outside We have evaluated the group’s internal controls, including centralized The Netherlands. These decentralized operations require adequate monitoring controls that exist at both group and segment level. monitoring activities from an internal control perspective. Also in our The group has developed an internal control framework with control role as group auditor it is essential that we obtain an appropriate level activities that are required to be implemented by the components. of understanding of the components and the component audit work. Compliance with this framework is monitored through Kendrion In Control (KIC) procedures, performed by experienced staff from the finance and control team, notably at head office level. As explained in the ‘Risk and risk management’ paragraph of the Executive Board report, KIC procedures were performed at several locations with limited control deficiencies revealed. In our audit approach we have specifically focused on risks in relation to decentralized structure and we have been closely involved in the audits performed at the most significant components. Members of the group team performed the audit of Kendrion (Shelby) Inc. and also reviewed reporting deliverables and selected files from the component audit teams. We also performed tests on consolidation adjustments and manual journal entries, both at group and component level to obtain an understanding of significant entries made. We believe that the scope of our procedures was appropriate and sufficient to address the key audit matter. 16 17 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2017 152 Key audit matter – reallocation of goodwill and valuation How the key audit matter was addressed in the audit of goodwill We have reviewed the impairment model and involved valuation The Simplify, Focus, Grow strategy, announced on May 2016, resulted experts in understanding the models used and the key assumptions in a further integration of Kendrion's business units.

Finally we have assessed the adequacy of disclosure notes including those relating to the sensitivity of management’s assumptions. Reference is made to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit procedures are deemed appropriate and sufficient to address the risks of material misstatements. 16 17 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2017 153 Report on the other information included in the Annual Report In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report, the annual report contains other information that consists of: ■■ Report of the Executive Board; ■■ Report of the Supervisory Board; ■■ Other Information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and ■■ Other information included in the Annual Report. Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information: ■■ Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; and ■■ Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements. Management is responsible for the preparation of other information, including the Report of the Executive Board in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Engagement We were appointed by the Annual General Meeting as auditor of Kendrion N.V. on 13 April 2015 for the audit of the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 and have operated as statutory auditor since that financial year. No prohibited non-audit services We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the Financial Statements The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and for the preparation of the Report of the Executive Board in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as the Executive Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Executive Board is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the Executive Board should prepare the financial statements using 16 17 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2017 154 the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Executive Board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all errors and fraud. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

Savert 16 17 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2017 155 To: the Shareholders and Supervisory Board of Kendrion N.V. Assurance report of the independent auditor with respect to the 2017 Sustainability Information of Kendrion N.V. Our conclusion We have reviewed the Sustainability Information in the 2017 Annual Report of Kendrion N.V. at Zeist. A review is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance. Based on our procedures performed nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information does not present, in all material respects, a reliable and adequate view of: ■■ the policy and business operations with regard to sustainability; and ■■ the thereto related events and achievements for the year 2017 in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G4 Core option) and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in the chapter ‘About the CSR review’ of the 2017 Annual Report. The sustainability information consists of performance information regarding Energy consumption, Absoluteand Relative CO2-emissions, Accidents and Lost Time Injuries, Acceptance of Supplier Code of Conduct and Number of Supplier audits in the section ‘Facts and Figures’ on page 11 and the section ‘Corporate Responsibility Review’ on page 41 of the 2017 Annual Report (hereafter: ‘the KPIs’). Basis of our conclusion We have performed our review on the sustainability information in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3810N ‘Assuranceopdrachten inzake maatschappelijke verslagen’ (Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports) which is a specified Dutch Standard that is based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’. This assurance engagement is aimed at obtaining limited assurance. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section ‘Our responsibilities for the review of the sustainability information’. We are independent of Kendrion N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the ‘Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties’ (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedragsen beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). We believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. 16 17 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2017 156 Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the sustainability information The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of the sustainability information in accordance with the GRI guidelines (G4 Core option) and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in the chapter ‘About the CSR review’ of the 2017 Annual Report, including the identification of stakeholders and the definition of material matters. The choices made by the Executive Board regarding the scope of the sustainability information and the reporting policy are summarised in the chapter ‘About the CSR review’ of the 2017 Annual Report. The Executive Board is also responsible for such internal controls as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the sustainability information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company’s reporting process. Our responsibilities for the review of the sustainability information Our responsibility is to plan and perform the assurance engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusion. Procedures performed in an assurance engagement to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed to determining the plausibility of information and are less extensive than a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance obtained in assurance engagements with a limited level of assurance is therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained in audit engagements. Misstatements can arise from fraud or errors and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of users taken on the basis of this Report. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our review procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusion. We apply the ‘Nadere voorschriften accountantskantoren ter zake van assurance opdrachten (RA/AA)’ (Regulations for professional accountants practices on assurance engagements) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the review, in accordance with the Dutch Standard 3810N, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our review engagement included: ■■ Performing an external analysis and obtaining insight into relevant environmental and social themes and issues, and the characteristics of the organisation. ■■ Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting policy and its consistent application, including the evaluation of the results of the stakeholders’ dialog and the reasonableness of management’s estimates. 16 17 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2017 157 ■■ Evaluating the design and implementation of the reporting systems and processes related to the information in the Report. ■■ Reviewing internal and external documentation to determine whether the information as included in the KPIs, including the presentation and assertions made in the report, is adequately supported. ■■ Interviewing management and relevant staff at group level responsible for the sustainability strategy and policy. ■■ Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information in the Report, carrying out internal control procedures on the data and consolidating the data in the Report. ■■ An analytical review of the data and trends submitted for consolidation at corporate level. ■■ Assessing whether the Report has been prepared in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (GRI G4 Core option) of the Global Reporting Initiative. We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope, timing and outcome of the review. Amsterdam, 20 February 2018 Deloitte Accountants B.V. B. E.

Kendrion evaluated the definition of the LTI rate to enable better benchmarking. For reporting on the number of signed Supplier Code of Conduct documents and the number of supplier audits, Kendrion makes use of GRI indicator G4-SO9 in conjunction with the number of suppliers that signed the Supplier Code of Conduct and underwent a supplier audit. The supplier audits are internal audits by Kendrion employees based on standardised interview questionnaires. For more information about the Supplier Code of Conduct, Kendrion refers to its website (Supplier Code of Conduct). The ‘percentage of top 30 suppliers that signed the Supplier Code of Conduct’ in 2017 is based on the 30 biggest suppliers in terms of procurement value (in euros) in the respective calendar year. During 2016, the internal management information system and internal controls for CSR reporting were further improved. They are designed to facilitate the collection and consolidation of relevant CSR information from all Kendrion’s operating facilities. This is required for the preparation of reliable periodic internal and external reports about the KPIs. Kendrion realises that the figures and data presented in this CSR Review are not always fully comparable with those of other companies. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly, companies do not always select the same targets or apply different definitions. Secondly, due to the nature and spread of Kendrion’s activities it is not easy to make one-on-one comparisons with other industrial companies. Other information used in this CSR Review was collected from the existing management and reporting systems. Any estimates or forecasts included are explicitly referred to as such. 16 17 GRI INDEX Annual Report 2017 164 GENERAL STANDARD DISCLOSURES Page number (or link) External Assurance Information related to Standard Disclosures required by the ‘in accordance’ options may already be included in other Indicate if the Standard Disclosure has been externally assured. reports prepared by the organization.
