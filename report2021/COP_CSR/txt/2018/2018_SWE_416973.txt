Net sales increased by 11.6 per cent to SEK 10.0 billion on the back of robust growth in all three business areas. Organic growth was 2.1 per cent while acquisitions accounted for 8.6 per cent of the increase in net sales. The market situation was generally good in all business areas. Profitability improved in 2017 as EBITA* increased by 25.8 per cent to SEK 1,732 million. The EBITA margin* increased by 2.0 percentage points to 17.3 per cent. Market-leading niche companies Our businesses in Dental are leading suppliers of consumables, equipment and technical service for dentists across Europe, and also have operations in the US. Lifco sells dental technology to dentists in the Nordic countries and Germany, and develops and sells medical record systems in Denmark and Sweden. Dental also includes a number of manufacturing companies which produce disinfectants, consumables and other products that are sold to dentists around the world through distributors. Net sales in Dental increased by 6.3 per cent and the EBITA margin* edged higher by 0.2 percentage points to 18.4 per cent. Two acquisitions were made during the year. Lifco’s Demolition & Tools business area is a world leader in the markets for demolition robots and crane attachments. Lifco is also one of the leading global manufacturers of excavator attachments. Net sales grew by 31.0 per cent on the back of a robust performance in most markets. The EBITA margin* improved by 3.5 percentage points to 26.5 per cent. Three acquisitions were made in 2017. The Systems Solutions business area consists of five divisions that are leading players in their geographic markets: Construction Materials, Interiors for Service Vehicles, Contract Manufacturing, Environmental Technology and Forest. Net sales in the business area increased by 7.7 per cent in 2017 and the EBITA margin* improved by 2.1 percentage points to of 13.6 per cent. All divisions apart from Forest expanded at a steady pace in 2017. Eight acquisitions were made in Systems Solutions during the year. Financially strong Cash flow was strong in 2017 and Lifco’s financial position remains good. Net interestbearing debt increased by SEK 518 million to SEK 3,536 (3,018) million while we acquired businesses for a total consideration of SEK 1,378 million and paid dividends of SEK 337 million. This means that Lifco at year-end had the capacity to make further acquisitions for around SEK 2.5 billion without exceeding the target of a debt of three times EBITDA. Lifco’s financial position enables us to continue to pursue our strategy of growth through acquisitions, but any potential takeover candidates face tough requirements. The company needs to be stable and a leading player in its niche. We want it to have an attractive position in the value chain and not be dependent on specific suppliers or customers. And it needs to be able to demonstrate well documented profitability and limited or no exposure to technological risk. A decentralised governance model Lifco is a highly decentralised organisation in which our subsidiary companies enjoy a high degree of autonomy. We want the companies we acquire to continue to operate as previously, simply because they know best what works in their market. We do not want to push central processes onto our subsidiaries. Our governance model allows 6 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 COMMENTS FROM THE CEO the subsidiaries to retain their entrepreneurial spirit and short lines of command. This is a key argument for entrepreneurs that are looking for a new ownership structure and it is also a key reason why our companies retain and strengthen their market positions in their respective niches. We offer a safe haven One of our greatest competitive advantages is that we offer small and medium-sized businesses a safe haven. Lifco is a long-term owner and essentially never sells a company that it owns. Under our decentralised governance model, all decisions are made by the local management team. We do not force our companies into integration projects and synergies – all such initiatives must come from the companies themselves. The coordination Fredrik Karlsson, CEO that takes place among our subsidiaries has been initiated by the companies themselves after they identified the synergies. We are particularly proud of the fact that we have never relocated a business. The reason is that we do not believe in big, dramatic restructurings and changes. Our view is that businesses need to develop gradually, generating a steady improvement in profitability. Our managers and employees share our view on a long-term approach, and this is a strength. Our employees are happy to remain in our companies throughout their lives and appreciate Lifco’s corporate culture, which is based on simplicity, common sense and minimal bureaucracy. We believe our decentralised governance model with a high degree of autonomy for our subsidiaries is a key factor when in negotiations with potential takeover candidates. It is also of importance to us that the entrepreneur who built the company wants to remain, because these individuals are often important for customer relations and they have a strong influence on the company culture and the way the company operates. sustainable business In the Lifco Group, it goes without saying that our business operations are to be sustainable. Our subsidiaries are, with just a few exceptions, the leading actors delivering the highest quality and level of service in the niches in which they operate. This implies that we are required to offer our employees good terms and conditions, use sustainable suppliers and, in general, undertake sustainable operations. We have compiled our ethical principles in our Code of Conduct. All managers of subsidiaries to ensure that they comply with the Code of Conduct. Group management regularly monitors compliance with the Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct addresses our relationship with our personnel, clients, suppliers, society and the environment, and with our shareholders. Lifco has signed Global Compact To further underline our support for internationally recognised business ethical standards and our long-term commitment to sustainability issues, Lifco joined and signed the UN’s sustainability initiative, Global Compact, in December 2016. As a member, we undertake actively to implement the Global Compact’s ten principles for sustainable development in the areas of human rights, labour standards, environment and anti-corruption. Going into 2018 The most important factor for Lifco is our employees. Today we have 4,758 employees in 29 countries. I would like to say a big thank you to each of you for your hard word in 2017. Our focus remains on acquiring and developing profitable, market-leading niche businesses with the potential to deliver sustainable earnings growth and robust cash flows. LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 7 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Directors’ Report Business concept and goals Lifco’s business concept is to acquire and develop market-leading niche businesses with the potential to deliver sustainable earnings growth and robust cash flows. Lifco’s strength is that the company is able to offer a safe haven for small and medium-sized businesses. Lifco is guided by a clear philosophy centred on long-term growth, a focus on profitability and a strongly decentralised organisation. The goal is sustainable earnings growth Lifco’s primary goal is to generate sustainable earnings growth. The Group and subsidiaries’ goal is to ensure that organic EBITA* growth exceeds GDP growth in the relevant geographic markets over the course of a business cycle. Additional growth should be achieved through acquisitions. Efficient use of capital is another important objective for Lifco. Return on capital employed after deduction for goodwill and other intangible assets should therefore exceed 50 per cent for the last twelve-month period. A decentralised organisation Lifco consists of 138 operational subsidiaries, which are organised in about 30 operating units. The heads of the operating units report directly to Lifco’s Chief Executive Officer or the head of the Dental business area. The operating units operate in eight divisions, which in turn form part of the three business areas Dental, Demolition & Tools and Systems Solutions. This decentralised organisation is one of the cornerstones of Lifco’s governance philosophy. The individual subsidiaries are given a large degree of freedom, which encourages a strong entrepreneurial spirit. As the subsidiaries are managed independently, each company is able to retain its specific culture. They can also continue to employ the methods that are used in the industries and markets in which they operate. A strong entrepreneurial spirit is one explanation for Lifco Group’s ability to retain key individuals in the companies which it acquires. In many cases, the key individuals are attracted by Lifco’s decentralised structure, which allows them to maintain a high degree of independence also after the acquisition. Minimal bureaucracy Lifco has developed a model for developing its subsidiaries. The model is based on Lifco’s philosophy centred on earnings, decentralisation and a long-term approach. It is the fruit of many years’ experience of building businesses. In simplified terms, the model can be described as follows: • Motivated and dedicated heads of subsidiaries • Minimal bureaucracy and simple processes • A focus on customers with the potential to generate sustainable earnings growth • An efficient cost structure with a focus on value-creating functions • Monthly monitoring of the subsidiaries’ income statements and balance sheets with a focus on EBITA*, changes in capital employed and cash flow A clear strategy for acquisitions Expansion through acquisitions is a central element of Lifco’s business concept. The Group’s acquisitions include the acquisition of new companies that can constitute a separate division as well as acquisitions of additional businesses for the existing divisions. An acquisition must either generate profitable growth and good cash flows or meet a strategic objective. The risk taken must also be limited for Lifco. 8 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT EMPLOYEES 4,758 COUNTRIES 29 COMPANIES 138 The map shows the countries where Lifco has employees.

A high ethical standard A fundamental requirement for Lifco’s decentralised structure is that the subsidiaries operate in accordance with Lifco’s ethical principles. The ethical principles are set forth in the Code of Conduct, which all subsidiaries are required to follow. Compliance with the code is monitored regularly by senior management. The Code of Conduct also includes Lifco’s core values: respect for others, openness and pragmatism. LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 9 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Financial results 2017 was another year of solid growth for Lifco. Net sales and earnings improved mainly through acquisitions and organic growth. Thirteen acquired businesses were consolidated during the year. Net sales increased by 11.6 per cent to SEK 10,030 (8,987) million on the back of acquisitions, foreign exchange gains and organic growth. Acquisitions accounted for 8.6 per cent of the increase and foreign exchange gains for 0.9 per cent while organic growth was 2.1 per cent. EBITA* increased by 25.8 per cent to SEK 1,732 (1,377) million and the EBITA margin* expanded by 2.0 percentage points to 17.3 (15.3) per cent. Organic growth, acquisitions and foreign exchange gains had a positive impact on EBITA*. Foreign exchange gains accounted for 0.8 percentage points of the increase in EBITA*. Investments in intangible and tangible fixed assets totalled SEK 153 (123) million. The net financial expense was SEK -46 (-33) million, the increase being due mainly to a higher interest expense. Earnings before tax grew by 20.8 per cent to SEK 1,473 (1,219) million. Costs related to the acquired businesses that were consolidated during the year had a negative impact of SEK 18 (18) million on earnings for 2017. Net profit for the year grew by 19.4 per cent to SEK 1,107 (927) million and earnings per share increased by 19.5 per cent to SEK 11.94 (9.99). The Group’s tax expense was SEK 366 (292) million, which represents 24.8 (24.0) per cent of earnings before tax. Tax paid was SEK 368 (295) million, which equates to 25.0 (24.2) per cent of earnings before tax. Inventories were SEK 1,391 (1,155) million and accounts receivable were SEK 1,274 (1,046) million. Average capital employed excluding goodwill increased over the year to SEK 980 (974) million. EBITA* in relation to average capital employed excluding goodwill was 177 (141) per cent at year-end. The improvement was due chiefly to stronger earnings and good control of capital employed. Goodwill and other intangible assets totalled SEK 8,288 (6,824) million at year-end. The Group’s net interest-bearing debt increased by SEK 518 million in 2017 to SEK 3,536 (3,018) million. The net debt ratio was 0.6 (0.6) at year-end. At year-end equity was SEK 5,546 (4,758) million and the equity/assets ratio 45.5 (47.0) per cent. Cash flow from operating activities improved by 22.3 per cent to SEK 1,326 (1,084) million compared with 2016. The continued strong cash flow was due to stronger earnings and good control of capital employed. Cash flow from investing activities was SEK -1,524 (-1,721) million, which was mainly attributable to acquisitions. Cash flow was also affected by a total dividend payment of SEK 337 (285) million. Dividend The Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer propose that the Annual General Meeting authorise the payment of a dividend of SEK 4.00 per share for the financial year 2017, representing a total distribution of SEK 363 million. This is equal to 33.5 per cent of the net profit for the year attributable to shareholders of Lifco AB, which is consistent with Lifco’s dividend policy. Under the dividend policy, the long-term objective is to ensure stable dividend growth while maintaining a payout ratio of 30-50 per cent of after-tax earnings. Dividends should be based on the company’s earnings performance having regard to future development opportunities and the company’s financial position. 10 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Net sales by business area Product development Innovation and product development are key success factors, especially in Demolition & 39% 38% Tools and Systems Solutions as well as the manufacturing companies in Dental.

LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 13 XXXXXXX 14 LIFCO ÅRSREDOVISNING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 2015 XXXXXXX LIFCO LIFCOÅRSREDOVISNING ANNUAL REPORT 2017 2015 15 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Business area Dental The companies in Lifco’s Dental business area are leading suppliers of consumables, equipment and technical service to dentists across Europe, and the business area also has operations in the US. Lifco sells dental technology to dentists in the Nordic countries and Germany, and develops and sells medical record systems in Denmark and Sweden. The business area also includes a number of manufacturers which produce disinfectants, saliva ejectors, bite registration and dental impression materials, bonding agents and other consumables that are sold to dentists through distributors around the world. A stable, non-cyclical market Dental care is a significant market, accounting for around 0.5 per cent of GDP in Lifco’s main markets. Demand for dental care in Europe has remained stable and relatively non-cyclical. During the period 2007-2012 expenditure on dental care in Lifco’s main markets (excluding Norway) grew by an average of 1.6 per cent annually. The market has grown modestly also in the last few years. A dental clinic needs a large number of products, ranging from consumables such as tissues and gloves to advanced technical equipment such as X-ray machines and dental chairs. Lifco fills an important role in the dental market by bringing together a large number of suppliers in what is otherwise a fragmented market. The market for dental care products can be divided into consumables, equipment and technical service, and dental technology. Consumables account for around 70 per cent of total sales. Demand for consumables is non-cyclical and is characterised by small but frequent orders, which requires a high level of delivery reliability and a broad product range. Demand for equipment is relatively stable and depends mainly on the age of the installed equipment, the length of the replacement cycle and the number of new dental clinics. Shared warehouses Although Lifco’s subsidiaries mostly operate independently of each other they collaborate to some extent on goods purchases. Lifco has three central warehouses for consumable goods, located in Enköping in Sweden, outside Aarhus in Denmark and in Büdingen, Germany. The Enköping warehouse offers around 44,000 products, the Danish warehouse around 18,000 and the German warehouse around 58,000. Lifco as a whole offers products from about 500 suppliers. A part of the range consists of own brands, which focus mainly on less complex products. Own brands account for around ten per cent of net sales in the subsidiaries. Lifco is working actively to increase the share of own brands. In dental technology Lifco operates mainly in Germany but also in the Nordic countries. Lifco provides most of the products, including crowns and bridges, which are made in China, the Philippines and Turkey. This enables Lifco to achieve cost advantages over local dental laboratories. Lifco handles the central parts of the process, such as dental prosthesis design and contacts with dentists. This ensures a high level of quality and proximity to the customers. Online sales Consumables are sold through three main channels: the subsidiaries’ sales forces, catalogue sales and online. Between 25 and 75 per cent of sales are made online depending on the market and subsidiary. The remaining orders are mainly placed by telephone. 16 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT NO se FI UK ee DK de lt US lv CH CZ AT HU SI CN PH The map shows countries with employees in the Dental business area.

The second acquisition was the purchase of the 6% 15% German dental laboratories City Dentallabor and Hohenstücken-Zahntechnik. In December Lifco announced that it had acquired a majority stake in Computer konkret 10% of Germany, which develops and sells software to dentists in Germany.

Lifco is the world’s leading supplier of demolition robots and crane attachments. The company is also one of the leading global suppliers of excavator attachments. The operations are divided into two divisions: Demolition Robots and Crane & Excavator Attachments. Demolition Robots accounts for 44 per cent of the business area’s net sales and Crane & Excavator Attachments for 56 per cent. Demolition Robots The remote-controlled demolition robots are sold under the Brokk brand. The machines are easy to manoeuvre and can be deployed without time-consuming preparations. They can also handle hot and stressful environments. The arms have a long reach and a wide range of attachments increase the machines’ flexibility and applications. In addition to demolition, Brokk’s machines are also used for renovation of cement kilns and removal of linings. As the machines can be remote-controlled, they are suitable for use in elevated-risk environments such as nuclear power plants and for handling contaminated materials. The company’s main market is the global construction and demolition industry. Its sales follow the trend in the global market for construction machinery. The demolition robots are sold directly to the end customers or to selected distributors and agents. The components are produced by contract manufacturers and the products are assembled in Sweden. The company also has some production in Germany. Crane and Excavator Attachments Lifco’s crane and excavator attachments are sold under the Kinshofer, Demarec, Hultdins, Solesbee´s, Doherty, RF-System och Auger Torque brands. The attachments make it possible to use the same crane or excavator for different purposes. Typical applications include construction and earthworks, snow clearing, demolition, pipe and cable laying, forestry work, scrap handling and railway works. Sales of crane and excavator attachments largely follow global machinery sales. As purchasing an attachment from Lifco is a smaller investment for the customer than buying a new machine, the market is less cyclical than construction machinery. Crane attachments are sold directly to the crane manufacturers while excavator attachments are sold mainly through resellers. The products are sold under Lifco’s brand or under the crane and excavator manufacturers’ own brands. In 2017 Lifco acquired three businesses in the Crane and Excavator Attachments division. The first acquisition of the year was Sweden-based Hultdins, a leading manufacturer of tools and attachments for forestry and construction machinery. In spring 2017 Lifco also acquired US-based Solesbee’s, a leading provider of attachments for excavators and wheel loaders in the North American market. At the end of the year Lifco acquired Doherty, which has operations in New Zealand and Australia. Doherty is a supplier of quick couplers, buckets and other excavator attachments. 18 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT NO SE CA GB FI NL dk US CH FR AE CN AT IT CZ SG au NZ The map shows countries with employees in the Demolition & Tools business area.

The Group controls a company when it is exposed to or has the right to a variable return on its interest in the company and is able to influence the return through its interest in the company. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements as of the date at which the controlling interest is transferred to the Group. They are excluded from the consolidated financial statements as of the date on which the controlling interest ceases to exist. 48 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The purchase method is applied in accounting for the Group’s business combieffects in the exposed currency to meet the net assets which exist in the foreign nations.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives Each year the Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment in accordance with the accounting principle described in Note 2. Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units have been determined by calculating value in use. For these calculations certain estimates need to be made (see Note 14). Reporting of acquisitions In conjunction with undertaking acquisitions, the Group prepares acquisition analyses for accounting purposes in accordance with the accounting principle described in Note 2. The reporting of acquisitions involves a high level of judgment and estimations which refer, primarily, to the allocation of surplus and under values in the acquisition analyses as regards assets and liabilities (net assets), as well as referring to adjustment items for adaptation to the Group’s accounting principles. The adjustment to fair value and goodwill are specified in Note 31.

Management has defined the operating segments based on the information that is handled by the CEO and used as a basis for decisions on the allocation of resources and evaluation of results. The results for the presented segments are assessed based on a measure called EBITA (earnings before amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, acquisition costs, interest and tax).

Remuneration of senior executives Principles: The Chairman and other members of the Board of Directors receive Directors’ fees in accordance with the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting. Employee representatives do not receive Directors’ fees. The remuneration paid to the CEO and other senior executives consists of a basic salary, variable remuneration, other benefits and pension contributions. Other senior executives refer to the three individuals who, together with the CEO, make up the senior management team. For the composition of the senior management team, see page 37. The balance between basic salary and variable remuneration must be proportionate to the executive’s responsibilities and authority. Variable remuneration: For the CEO variable remuneration is capped at 70 per cent of the fixed salary and based on achieved results. For other senior executives variable remuneration is based on the outcome in relation to individually defined targets. Pensions: The retirement age for the CEO is 60 years at the earliest. Lifco sets aside an amount equal to 60 per cent (excluding payroll costs) of the CEO’s fixed salary to pension and capital redemption pension plans, and life and health insurance policies. Other senior executives are entitled to pension benefits of up to 35 per cent of their fixed salary and the earliest retirement age is 60. All pension benefits are vested, i.e. they are not conditional on future employment with Lifco. 56 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Termination salary: The employment contract of the CEO is terminable on twelve months’ notice in case of termination by the company and six months’ notice in case of termination by the CEO. The employment contracts of other senior executives are terminable on 12 months’ notice in case of termination by the company. The right to a salary and other benefits are retained during the notice period. Drafting and decision-making process: During the year the Remuneration Committee submitted recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning principles for remuneration of senior executives. The recommendations covered the proportion between fixed and variable remuneration, and the size of any salary increases. The Remuneration Committee has also proposed criteria for assessing bonus outcomes. The Board has discussed the Remuneration Committee’s proposal and made decisions on the basis of the committee’s recommendations. The remuneration payable to the CEO for the financial year 2017 was approved by the Board based on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. The remuneration paid to other senior executives was approved by the CEO in consultation with the Chairman of the Board. In 2017 the Remuneration Committee convened on two occasions.

The assumptions used in estimating value in use are the same for goodwill and trademarks. The recoverable amount for a cash-generating unit is determined based on calculations of value in use. These calculations are made on the basis of estimated future cash flows before tax based on five-year financial budgets that have been approved by senior management. Cash flows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using an estimated growth rate. The estimated growth rate is assumed to represent the growth rate in the fifth year, which is expected to be around 2 per cent for all operating segments in both 2016 and 2017. Assumptions have also been made for gross margin, overheads, working capital requirements and investment requirements. The parameters have been set to represent an annual growth rate of 2 (2) per cent for all operating segments. The pre-tax discount rate used is 9.6 (10.5) per cent for Dental and 10.8 (11.5) per cent for other the operating segments. The calculation as at 31 December 2017 shows that value in use exceeds the carrying amount for all cash-generating units. There is thus no impairment. Nor was any impairment identified as at 31 December 2016. LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 59 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis shows that the remaining goodwill value for all cash-generating units would remain warranted if the discount rate were raised by 1 percentage point or the growth rate, terminal growth or gross margin were reduced by 1 percentage point. Lifco’s reportable operating segments are Dental, Demolition & Tools and Systems Solutions. For the purpose of performing impairment tests, goodwill is allocated, with the exception of the reportable segments Dental and Demolition & Tools, to the five cash-generating units: Construction Materials, Interiors for Service Vehicles, Contract Manufacturing, Environmental Technology and Forest.

The carrying amount of defined benefit obligations is SEK 36 (37) million. For salaried employees in Sweden defined benefit pension obligations for retirement and family pensions under the ITP 2 plan are secured through an insurance policy with Alecta. According to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 3 Classification of ITP Plans Funded through Insurance with Alecta, this is a defined benefit plan covering several employers. For the financial year 2017 the company has not had access to information that would enable it to account for its proportionate share of the plan’s obligations, assets and expenses. It has therefore not been possible to report the plan as a defined benefit plan. The ITP 2 pension plan secured through an insurance policy with Alecta is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution plan. The premium for defined benefit retirement and family pensions is calculated individually and depends on factors such as salary, previously earned pension and expected remaining period of service. Expected fees in the next reporting period for ITP 2 insurance policies with Alecta are SEK 11 (9) million. The collective funding ratio is defined as the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of its commitments to policyholders calculated using Alecta’s actuarial methods and assumptions, which do not comply with IAS 19. The collective funding ratio may normally vary within a range of 125 and 155 per cent. If Alecta’s collective funding ratio were to fall below 125 per cent or exceed 155 per cent it would be necessary to take measures that will enable the ratio return to the normal range. In case of a low collective funding ratio one measure that can be taken is to raise the agreed price for new subscriptions and expansion of the existing benefits. A high collective funding ratio can be addressed by introducing premium reductions. At the end of 2017 Alecta’s surplus, as defined by the collective funding ratio, was 154 per cent (2016: 149 per cent). Lifco has made pension promises to two persons and in connection therewith purchased endowment policies which have been posted as collateral for the pensions of these employees. Under the arrangement, the individuals concerned will receive the value of the endowment policies less payroll tax. As there are no guaranteed remuneration levels, the Group’s net obligation will always be zero. These endowment policies are considered to be plan assets and are recognised on a net basis after deducting the obligation. 64 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 26 Provisions Restructuring SEK million Guarantee reserve reserve Premises costs Other provisions Total 1 January 2016 46 2 3 14 65 Additional provisions 22 4 26 Acquisition of companies 3 3 Utilised during the year -10 -1 -1 -7 -19 Reversal of unused provisions -17 -17 Reclassifications 2 -1 1 Translation differences 2 1 3 31 December 2016 48 1 1 12 62 of which, short-term provisions 30 1 1 9 41 of which, long-term provisions 18 3 21 Anticipated outflow date Within 1 years 30 1 1 9 41 Within 3 years 6 1 7 Within 5 years 9 2 11 After more than 5 years 3 3 31 December 2016 48 1 1 12 62 1 January 2017 48 1 1 12 62 Additional provisions 19 1 2 4 26 Acquisition of companies 1 7 8 Utilised during the year -10 -1 -2 -6 -19 Reversal of unused provisions -12 -12 Reclassifications 3 -3 Translation differences 1 1 31 December 2017 47 1 4 14 66 of which, short-term provisions 27 1 4 4 36 of which, long-term provisions 20 10 30 Anticipated outflow date Within 1 years 27 1 4 4 36 Within 3 years 8 8 Within 5 years 11 9 20 After more than 5 years 1 1 2 31 December 2017 47 1 4 14 66 The warranty provision is based on outstanding commitments at the balance sheet date and the calculation is based on previous experience. Other provisions refer mainly to commissions to agents in the Dental business area. In addition, the Group has other contingent liabilities of SEK 107 (134) million. As it has been deemed that no outflow of funds will take place for these commitments, no provisions have been made (see also the information in Note 30). Note 27 Related party transactions Transactions between Lifco AB and its subsidiaries, which are associated companies of Lifco AB, have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Sales of products and services between Group companies are subject to commercial terms and conditions and made at market prices. Intercompany sales were SEK 2,511 (2,138) million during the year. Carl Bennet AB owns 50.1 per cent of the shares of Lifco and is deemed to control the Group. Other related parties include all subsidiaries in the Group as well as senior executives in the Group, i.e. the Board of Directors and senior management. Lifco AB, the parent company of the Lifco Group, has purchased administrative services from Carl Bennet AB worth SEK 1 (1) million.

Note 31 Business combinations Thirteen new businesses were consolidated in 2017. The acquisitions comprised all shares of Doherty, Elit, Haglöf Sweden, Hultdin System, Perfect Ceramic Dental and the German dental laboratories City Dentallabor and Hohenstücken-Zahntechnik as well as majority stakes in Blinken, Fiberworks, Hydal, Pro Optix, Silvent, Solesbee’s and Wachtel. The purchase price allocation includes all acquisitions made during the year. Purchase price allocations are preliminary until one year after the acquisition date. Out of the resultant goodwill, SEK 47 million is tax-deductible. Acquisition-related expenses of SEK 18 million are included in administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year. Since the respective consolidation dates, the acquired companies have added SEK 523 million to consolidated net sales and SEK 130 million to EBITA. If the businesses had been consolidated as at 1 January 2017 net sales for the year would have increased by a further SEK 502 million and EBITA would have increased by a further SEK 93 million.

No repurchases of shares held as treasury shares by the parent company were made during the period. SEK million 2017 2016 Profit attributable to parent company shareholders 1,084 908 Weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares 90,843,260 90,843,260 Earnings per share (SEK) 11.94 9.99 After dilution: Earnings per share after dilution are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for the dilutive effect of all potential ordinary shares. There were no potential dilutive ordinary shares in 2017 or 2016. Earnings per share were thus the same before and after dilution. Note 33 Dividend per share Dividend payments made in 2017 and 2016 totalled SEK 318 million (SEK 3.50 per share) and SEK 273 million (SEK 3.00 per share), respectively. At the Annual General Meeting on 24.04.18 the Board will propose a dividend for the financial year 2017 of SEK 4.00 per share, for a total dividend payment of SEK 363 million. The proposed dividend has not been recognised as a liability in these financial statements. NOTe 34 Sale of subsidiaries No sales were made in the financial year 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2016 AriVislanda and Renholmen were sold. The sales had no significant impact on the Group’s results or financial position. NOTe 35 Events after the end of the reporting period In January 2018 Lifco completed the acquisition of a majority stake in Computer konkret of Germany, which had sales of around EUR 3.8 million in 2016. The company develops and sells software for dentists in Germany. The company has around 50 employees and will be consolidated in the Dental business area. The acquisition of a majority stake in Dental Direct of Norway and its Danish subsidiary 3D Dental was announced on 28 December 2017. The companies, which generated net sales of around NOK 95 million and DKK 25 million, respectively, in 2016, are distributors of dental products and have a combined workforce of around 20 employees. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018 and the companies will be consolidated in Lifco’s Dental business area. On 1 March Lifco announced the acquisition of Spocs of Sweden. Spocs is making the final assembly and testing of electronic products. In 2017, Spocs reported external net sales of 61 MSEK and the company has 23 employees. The company will be consolidated in Business Area Systems Solutions, division Contract Manufacturing. The acquisitions will not have a significant impact on Lifco’s results and financial position in the current year. Preliminary purchase price allocations will be presented in the interim report for the first and second quarters of 2018.

The parent company applies other accounting principles than the Group in those cases which are indicated below. Format The format prescribed in the Swedish Annual Accounts Act is used for the income statements and balance sheets. The income statement is divided into two statements: one for profit or loss and one for comprehensive income. The parent company has no items which are accounted for as other comprehensive income. Total comprehensive income is therefore the same as net profit for the year. The statement of changes in equity follows the format used in the Group but contains the columns specified in the Annual Accounts Act. The formats for the parent company have different names compared with the consolidated financial statements, primarily with regard to financial income and expense, provisions, and items in equity. Holdings in subsidiaries Holdings in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any impairment. Cost includes acquisition-related costs and any additional considerations. When there is an indication that holdings in a subsidiary are impaired, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses are recognised in the items “Profit/loss from holdings in Group companies”. Financial instruments The parent company does not apply IAS 39 for financial instruments. All financial assets are classified in the category “Loans and receivables”. Leases All leases, both finance leases and operating leases, are classified as operating leases. Revenue Other operating revenue in the parent company includes costs billed to subsidiaries. Group contributions Group contributions paid and received are both accounted for as appropriations in the income statement. Note 38 The parent company’s sales to and purchases from Group companies During the year the parent company invoiced the subsidiaries SEK 89 (90) million for Group-wide services. The parent company has not purchased services from subsidiaries.
