As a result, the target will be reassessed going forward. Most sites are showing increased waste recycling percentages. This progress is driven by the global initiative “waste to resource”, which has resulted in improved waste handling and reporting at the sites. Several plastic fractions have been taken out of the waste stream for individual recycling purposes. Another example is from Milwaukee where disposable lab coats are sent to a business partner for reuse, rather than being thrown out. During the year the amount of wastewater generated increased due to increased water usage and cleaning of equipment. CHR.

Hansen A/S to the UN Global Goals. TO THE STAKEHOLDERS OF CHR. HANSEN A/S We have been engaged by Chr. Hansen A/S to obtain limited assurance on the Company’s 2017/18 revenue contribution to the UN Global Goals (Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs no. 2, 3 and 12)) as stated on page 17 in the 2017/18 Chr. Hansen A/S Sustainability Report. The impact on the SDGs of Chr. Hansen A/S products is consolidated in terms of percentage of gross revenue in support of the selected SDGs. Chr. Hansen A/S has mapped its entire product portfolio and concluded that 82% of its gross revenue has a positive impact on one or more of UN SDGs number 2, 3 and 12. MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY Management is responsible for the defined methodology and applied criteria including reporting scope, assumptions and estimations made when defining and consolidating gross revenue for sold products with positive impact on one or more of the UN SDGs number 2, 3 and 12. The methodology and criteria applied appear from the Sustainability Accounting Principles on the Company’s website www.chr-hansen.com/en/sustainability/reporting-and-disclosure.The Management of Chr. Hansen A/S is responsible for deciding on these suitable criteria, assumptions and estimations applied in the calculation and consolidation. Furthermore, Management is responsible for ensuring that the preparation of the statement is in accordance with the stated criteria and defined methodology. This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation such that the information is free of material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. OUR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL We have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior. PwC applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. OUR RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Company’s 2017/18 revenue contribution to the UN Global Goals (SDGs no. 2, 3 and 12) as stated on page 17 in the 2017/18 Chr. Hansen A/S Sustainability Report. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standards on Assurance Engagements 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000). The standard is issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, and requires that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance whether the subject matter is free from material misstatement. A multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, an engineer and a Ph.D. in international development studies conducted this engagement. A limited assurance engagement undertaken in accordance with ISAE 3000 involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of Chr. Hansen A/S and the use of defined criteria and methodology as the basis for the preparation of the the Company’s 2017/18 revenue contribution to the UN Global Goals (SDGs no. 2, 3 and 12). In addition, it involves assessing the risks of material misstatement whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation. CHR. HANSEN SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017/18 21 APPENDIX The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and comprised inquiries regarding preparation of product data sheets, assessment of calculations, assumptions and estimations, and assessment of underlying documentation. During our work, we have conducted interviews and show me meetings with key individuals at Chr. Hansen A/S responsible for sales and for preparation of product data sheets, product-specific data as well as for consolidation and calculations. We have assessed that consolidated gross revenue per product, taking into consideration customer discounts, align with the audited net revenue in the 2017/18 Annual Report. In addition, during the interviews, we have assessed whether principles for selection and inclusion of products in the calculations are conservative in nature when considering impacts during use. LIMITED REVIEW CONCLUSION Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention causing us to believe that the Chr. Hansen A/S 2017/18 revenue contribution to the UN Global Goals (SDGs no. 2, 3 and 12) as stated on page 17 in the 2017/18 Chr. Hansen A/S Sustainability Report has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applied criteria and methodology as described in the Sustainability Accounting Principles at www.chr-hansen.com/en/sustainability/reporting-and-disclosure.
