significant and dramatic changes to the political landscape in relation to the responsibility of businesses to build a more sustainable future. In June 2017, President Trump abandoned the Paris Agreement, reversing decades of environmental progress, and denying the devastating effects of climate change. Since April 2017, the fate of section of the US 1502 Dodd-Frank Act has been thrown into doubt. Meanwhile, Europe has made excellent progress with the introduction of the EU Regulation on responsible supply chains for companies importing tungsten, tantalum, tin, and gold. Within this environmental divergence, more than ever, we, employees, customers, business partners, governments, NGOs and the international community need to continue joining forces to progress the sustainable agenda. At Valcambi, we are proud to play our part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and we advocate for US companies to continue tracing the origins of the minerals in their supply chains. Responsible behaviour is integral to the way we conduct our business. We refine a natural resource that stands the test of time. Surely, we owe it to the natural world, which provides our precious material, to nurture it. For this reason, we have an unshakeable commitment to operating a rigorously controlled, transparent and ethical supply chain that lives up to that responsibility. It goes beyond the most thorough internal sourcing processes we have in place. It is also about supporting those who have the greatest needs at the very beginning of the value chain. Over the last two years, we have been actively involved in supporting responsible gold mining and sourcing, with a special focus on the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector that plays a crucial role in offering a way out of poverty for millions of miners and their families around the world. Using our sectoral weight and working with committed organisations and associations, we have taken a leadership role to pull the ASM sector forward on responsible business practices (see page 25), creating positive impact in mining communities and increasing the mines’ access to market. This has taken the form of supporting projects on the ground to assist miners in adopting best practices, engaging with multi stakeholders to join more forces, and developing a specific ASM sourcing model (see page 23) I was particularly pleased when our sourcing approach attracted the interest of participants in the gold and other minerals sectors looking to learn from us. We would like our systems to benefit the entire industry and that, in turn, we can learn from others, introducing or improving responsible practices that will further contribute to sustainable development. It has been a most fascinating journey, the details of which I am pleased to share in this report and which culminated recently in Valcambi starting to source from a small mine in Peru. I know that this is only the beginning, and I also know that with you, partners and stakeholders, we can create a more sustainable gold industry. Michael Mesaric, CEO & Board Member 5 6 Introduction G4-14 Our contribution to sustainable development is integral to the way we manage our business. We are continuously seeking long-term, mutually beneficial outcomes for our business and stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of creating a better gold industry for all. We cannot achieve this ambitious vision on our own. It is undeniable that the gold sector faces many complex issues. Working in partnership with our stakeholders is the only way we can, together, improve the gold industry for the benefit of all. We are continuing to advance, in close collaboration with our partners, a number of initiatives to pursue our own sustainability agenda alongside the industry’s as a whole. G4-29 Our previous sustainability report was issued in 2016, covering 2014 and 2015. This 2017 report G4-28, G4-30 covers the 2016-2017 period. The next issue will be published in 2019, and will cover the year 2018. G4-32 Our 2017 Sustainability Report prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 “Core” option, and aligned with the United Nations Global Compact reporting framework details the progress we have made on our programme, and outlines how we adapt what we do for greater impact. We are proud of our achievements to date, but know that we can always do more. As part of our commitment to continuous improvement, we will continue developing our responsible business practices and further contribute to a sustainable future. G4-33 Since most of the information contained in this report is based on data that has already been externally verified, and that meets some of the strictest reporting standards, it was not necessary to ask for an external review of this report. G4-31 For further information on this report, please contact our Corporate Affairs and Communications department: sustainability@valcambi.com.

Through this strategic partnership Valcambi helped Fairphone to become a pioneer in the transition to sustainability and environmental compatibility in the industry. In August 2016, Valcambi joined the Global Mercury Partnership, the UNEP’s multi-stakeholder initiative on mercury. Its overall goal is to support the ratification and effective implementation of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from the adverse effects of mercury, agreed in 2013. By joining the partnership Valcambi is eager to support the ASM sector in improving mercury use practices and to implement mercury management and mitigation actions. In November 2016 Valcambi became a founding member and strategic partner of the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM), a multi-stakeholder partnership aiming to increase the proportion of responsiblyproduced tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG) from conflictaffected and high-risk areas (CAHRAS) and to support the responsible extraction of minerals in a way that contributes to local development. Fully aligned with Valcambi’s strategy to support the ASM sector and drive responsible sourcing, this partnership of public and private actors, including governments, institutions, companies, industry associations and NGOs brings together the network, knowledge and financial resources to move the responsible minerals agenda forward globally. G4-13 In July 2015, the Global Gold Refineries (GGR) bought 100% of the shares of European Gold Refineries (EGR). At that time, EGR owned 100% of the Valcambi shares. In order to reduce and simplify the corporate structure, in 2017 the Board of Directors decided to merge EGR into GGR by an upstream merger. Today GGR owns 100% of Valcamibi’s shares. In 2017, Valcambi got a Fairmined Licensee, becoming a Fairmined Authorised Supplier to transform and trade Fairmined Gold. The collaboration between Valcambi and Alliance for Responsible Mining (ARM) – the NGO behind Fairmined – is another step to support ASM operations and to drive further transparency. 11 In April 2017, Valcambi joined Global Compact’s goal to align the United Nations Global strategies and operations with Compact, the world's largest universal principles on human corporate sustainability initiative. rights, labour, environment and In joining Global Compact, anti-corruption, and take Valcambi commits to driving the actions that advance societal sustainability agenda beyond goals. Valcambi is keen that its the gold sector by supporting, responsible practices approach across industries and globally, benefits multiple sectors In May 2017, Valcambi joined the World Bank and OECD roundtables to discuss the development of a World Centre of Excellence, focusing on ASM. The initiative aims to develop a Global Community of Practice on ASM to collect and disseminate data in support of ASM development and to establish a donor-supported Global ASM Support Hub. This will help improve identification and coordination of all relevant cooperation projects in relation to ASM formalization, globally. Throughout 2017, Valcambi chaired the Standard Committee on the development of CRAFT (“The Code of Risk-mitigation for ASM engaging in Formal Trade” previously known as the Market Entry Standard) developed by the Alliance for Responsible Mining (ARM) and RESOLVE. Fully aligned with Valcambi’s strategy to support ASM and based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance, CRAFT aims to serve as a tool for all actors in the gold supply chain to collaborate in the mitigation of mining-associated risks and promotion of the continuous improvement of environmental, social and economic practices in the ASM sector. 12 Our governance and sustainability G4-34, G4-46 Board of Directors Valcambi’s Board of Directors is responsible for setting and overseeing the strategy, organization, and sustainability of the company.

Minted Bars (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd) Cast Bars (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd) CombiBar TM (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd) Grain (Au, Ag) Round Bars Valcambi GreenGold™ Coins & Medals Semi-Finished Products Sbead Coin Armillary Coins Cast bars traditionally have a lower quality finish than minted bars and are produced by pouring molten precious metal directly into carefully prepared moulds. Minted bars (sometimes called wafers) are cut from specially prepared rolled metal sheets. Our bars have a very high-quality finish, guaranteed purity and are produced in the same facility as our minted coins. Our standard minted bars show Valcambi's Hallmark (logo, weight, metal name, fineness, essayeur fondeur and bar number). The reverse is stamped with “Valcambi Suisse”. The first gold Valcambi CombiBar™ was issued in April 2011, in an innovative style of a 50g gold investment bar, comprising 50 detachable 1g bars. It offers the possibility of breaking the bar into groups of 1g gold bars or into 50 separate 1g pieces. Each bar is certified by Valcambi and will be accepted at any time and place for its gold value. The Valcambi gold CombiBar™ is available in different sizes (100g, 50g, 1oz, 20g and 5g star form) and different metals (gold, silver, platinum and palladium). 18 All metals and bars produced in our foundry and minting facilities are certified by our laboratory, carefully inspected by our operators, and individually packed and controlled before shipment. Reacting to the demands of investors in different markets around the globe, Valcambi has carefully developed a range of bar standards, forms and new designs to ensure we deliver precisely what the market needs. The Hallmark is not only a guarantee of the quality of Swiss workmanship, it also guarantees the fineness of our bars. Valcambi’s ability to adapt our production processes quickly and smoothly within the shortest possible timeframes enables us to produce a number of different products simultaneously. Whenever you see Valcambi’s Assay Mark (Assay stamp of refiner) on a bar or ingot, you will know that it has been refined, assayed and cast by Valcambi. Valcambi manages and controls the entire production process. Traceability is maintained, guaranteed and documented through a track and trace system that controls the metal journey from mine to Valcambi and to product, for Valcambi GreenGoldTM, Fairtrade-certified and Fairmined-certified gold. Only gold which comes directly from the selected Fairtrade-certified, Fairmined-certified or GreenGoldTM mines is used and is kept separated at all times in dedicated production lines throughout the entire process. Full documentation and independent validation by third-party supervisory and audit processes provide complete assurance. Already in 2008 Valcambi introduced GreenGoldTM, a fully traceable gold, to the market. Valcambi Green Gold is a premium-quality precious metal product, the origins of which are fully documented and independently validated. Valcambi Green Gold is sourced only from mines which adhere to the highest standards of environmental stewardship, health & safety and the human rights of their labour force.

The precious metal supply chain is complex and multi-layered. Valcambi supplies services in precious metal refinery and finished or semi-finished products. Primary feeds Secondary feeds Mined Track and trace Recycled Track and trace (Green Gold, Fairmined, Mined Recycled (RJC CoC) Fairtrade) KYP Processing Incoming Inspection Valcambi’s Client on-boarding Statement KYC Refining Alloys / Casting / Minting Due Diligence Finished products Alloys / Coins Medals Investment products Semi-finished watch products Global Market Precious metals origin can be divided into two groups: Primary feeds: precious metal coming directly from mines Secondary feeds: precious metals that have already undergone at least one refining cycle. Investment products (such as coins, cast bars or minted ingots, greater or equal to 995 ‰), jewellery and industrial recoveries from other sectors fall in this category. Mined gold refined at Valcambi is traceable from the mine up to the statement process (weighing, melting and assaying). After the statement process, the materials coming from different sources are commingled and refined in a continuous process. 21 Valcambi processes the following products with enhanced traceability standards: • Products realised according to the RJC Chain of Custody standard, originate from recycled or grandfathered sources. Thanks to our traceability procedures and related records, we are able to trace back from the finished products up to the incoming material used. • Valcambi GreenGoldTM is sourced from mines that operate in accordance with some of the highest social and environmental standards and regulations (OECD Guidelines for MNEs, LBMA’s Responsible Gold Guidance, World Gold Council “Conflict-Free Gold Standard”, Dodd-Frank Act requirements, ISO 14001, and the International Cyanide Management Code). Traceability of Valcambi GreenGoldTM is maintained through the refining process until the final product, and origin is guaranteed through full documentation and independent validation by third-party supervisory and auditing processes. • Fairtrade and Fairmined gold originates exclusively from Fairtradeand Fairmined-certified mines. Traceability of the supply chain is assured, and gold is kept separate throughout the whole refining and bar manufacturing process.

RJC CoC products are accompanied by the RJC CoC Transfer Document. 22 The supply chain, sourcing and due diligence practices G4-12 Precious metals refineries play a vital role in the precious metal supply chain and act on two sides: as a service provider for incoming material and as a semi-finished or finished product provider to the global precious metals market. Mines Good Delivery Scrap Track and Trace Supply – offered to Valcambi Service provider Supply – offered to Watch and Jewelry Bullion Banks & Other industrial sectors Track and Trace sectors Central Banks Metal flow Track and Trace= Green Gold / Fairtrade / Fairmined / RJC Having a responsible supply chain is vital to the sustainable success of our business and of our sector, and the sustainable development of the countries from which the raw materials originate. At Valcambi we give the highest priority to transparency, and meet and go beyond the most stringent industry standards of traceability in compliance with and conformance to all the principle responsible sourcing frameworks. These include international regulations and voluntary standards and guidance such as the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from ConflictAffected and High-Risk Areas, the LBMA Responsible Guidances on precious metals, the Responsible Jewellery Council Code of Practice and Chain of Custody Standards, World Gold Council “ConflictFree Gold Standard” and the Dodd-Frank Act Section 1502. To ensure those standards are respected and upheld, we conduct extensive due diligence practices to identify and select our business partners. These include risk assessments covering white collar-related crimes and risks including money laundering, and crimes and risks relating to human rights, working conditions and child labour. Our due diligence practices are not restricted to our first counterparty and cover, where needed, multiple levels along the supply chain up to the origin of the precious metals for mined materials. 23 The “client on-boarding” phase aims to identify those counterparties who could become a client of Valcambi. The Sales and Compliance Officers identify the applicant and the risk connected to the entity, its operations and operating environment, its due diligence practices and mining and sourcing practices, making sure the origin of precious metal is legitimate. It is only after the positive outcomes of these verification processes that Valcambi will enter into a commercial relationship with the counterparty. Approved counterparties are periodically reviewed against Valcambi’s requirements and established international standards. Counterparties who do not continuously meet the requested requirements cannot pursue a commercial relationship with Valcambi. We aim to go beyond compliance-based due diligence where necessary; we review our compliance systems and procedures and our counterparties assessment on an ongoing basis and as part of our continuous improvement processes. Focus on artisanal and small-scale mining We play an active role in driving responsible supply chain best practices in our sector. As part of this commitment, we have been actively involved in supporting responsible gold mining and sourcing, with a special focus on the ASM sector that plays a crucial role in offering a way out of poverty for millions of miners and their families around the world. To this end, we have created best practice procedures to ensure responsible engagement with the ASM sources that allow us to source with confidence from ASM suppliers. It is our ambition that this benefits the ASM sector and producer nations while being feasible for the industry, by improving access to markets for ASM miners and being an ally to support their gradual legitimization and formalization. In parallel, we have been supporting ASM projects on the ground working in collaboration with organisations such as Fairmined, Fairtrade, the ARM, the SBGA, the BGI, and the EPRM, among others. Please read ‘Valcambi’s journey on ASM’ that tells the fascinating story of our involvement in the ASM sector since 2015. 24 Valcambi’s journey on Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining For Valcambi, responsible sourcing is not just a licence to operate. It is embedded into our company’s culture of being a responsible business, and it is reflected in the company’s values of conformity, integrity, responsibility, confidentiality and respect. We play an active role in driving best practices in our sector, working in collaboration with the various stakeholders along the value chain. As part of this commitment, we are extensively involved in supporting responsible gold mining and sourcing and have a special focus on the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector. Artisanal and small-scale gold mining employs 90% of the workforce involved in global gold extraction, and is responsible for 17 to 20% of global gold production. There are 10 to 15 million artisanal gold miners worldwide, collectively mining around 400 tons of gold per annum and creating more than $10 billion in value for rural economies in over 70 countries. The ASM sector overall plays a crucial role in offering a way out of poverty for over 100 million people, including miners and their families, around the world. Using our sectorial weight, we want to take a leadership role to pull the ASM sector forward on responsible business practices, creating positive impact in mining communities and increasing the mines’ access to global market. Our ASM journey started in 2015, when we decided to engage directly with the ASM sector. Our approach had to be from ‘within’ and working with ‘the source’. Developing ASM sourcing model To develop the ASM supply chain, we had to establish and/or adapt various internal processes. Firstly, sourcing responsibly from ASM required us to develop a specific ASM sourcing model. Working with industry experts, we created best practice procedures, including comprehensive supply chain risk assessment, to ensure responsible engagement with, and sourcing from ASM. To ensure these were most adapted to the reality and needs of our sector and the field, we consulted extensively with stakeholders, including clients, NGOs, ASM experts and industry associations, who provided their feedback. Crucially, we piloted these procedures on the ground with ASMs and, finally, we asked an independent academic institute to review. “The piloting on the ground of our procedures was incredibly eye opening,” comments Michael Mesaric, CEO of Valcambi. “This allowed us to understand what ASM looks like. We saw ‘good practice scenarios’ and spoke directly with miners and their stakeholders to learn from their experiences. We also gained greater understanding of the needs and wishes of the different actors involved in this process and how Valcambi’s work on responsible sourcing from ASM could, in turn, benefit the artisanal mining sector.” Our procedures enable us to not only comply with all the principle frameworks for responsible gold sourcing, such as the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas; the LBMA Responsible Gold Guidance, and the Responsible Jewellery Council Chain of Custody Standard, but also to go beyond these, wherever needed. It is important to understand that disengagement with mines not conforming with our due diligence criteria is not a solution for Valcambi. When we developed our due diligence procedures, our intention was not only to protect our business but to drive best practices within the ASM sector. We have developed tools to appropriately communicate non-conformity situations and outline corrective measures, including remediation, in order to support the mines that are willing to improve the way they operate. This approach allows them to address the gaps in their practices so that, ultimately, we can work together. We do this with the help of entities such as civil society organisations, associations and governments that can provide the appropriate support and competence on the ground to manage a comprehensive remediation plan. This looks at technical aspects for operational improvements, and social and environmental aspects. It is our ambition that our responsible sourcing approach benefits the ASM sector and producer nations, while improving access to markets for ASM miners. 25 Tuning up our operations Secondly, we needed to solve very practical questions such as the dimensions of our refining units. “When we started, our equipment was scaled for quantities much higher than those produced by an artisanal mine,” says Simone Knobloch, COO of Valcambi. “Now our refining units are capable of batch refining very small amounts of doré, satisfying the needs of both the supply chains where ASM gold is requested and where ASM gold must be segregated.” We also looked at the transportation costs and were able to set up favourable agreements for small volume deliveries comparable with the refining batch of our units. Supporting ASM responsible mining on the ground In parallel, we started engagement on the ground to assess the situation, identifying potential countries and mines from which we could source, and what support these mines needed to adopt the responsible mining practices that would allow us to work together. We soon learnt that ensuring responsible mining and harnessing ASM's potential for sustainable development demands a collaborative approach that starts with dialogue and engagement with multiple stakeholders including governments, NGOs, civil society, upstream and downstream sector associations and, of course, ASMs themselves. We started working on a number of initiatives and projects on the ground in collaboration with a number of organisations and associations. These included Fairtrade, the Swiss Better Gold Association (SBGA) (of which Valcambi is a member) and the Better Gold Initiative (BGI); the Alliance for Responsible Mining and Fairmined; the European partnership for Responsible Minerals (founding member and strategic partner), among others. We passed an important milestone in 2015. After obtaining the licence to process Fairtrade-certified gold, Valcambi became a strategic partner for Fairphone on its very outset. Processing gold coming from Minera Sotrami, a mine in Peru that at the time was Fairtrade certified, we helped Fairphone to become a pioneer in the transition to sustainability and environmental compatibility in the industry. It was through our collaboration that Fairtrade introduced us to the Minera Limata co-operative, a small-scale mine near Puno, South Peru. As concession AFC12 (LIMATA AFC12) was working on improving its practices, we received the visit of the miners from the cooperative along with the Fairtrade project leads. “It was a real privilege to welcome the miners at Valcambi,” explains Mesaric. “We opened our ‘books’ to each other. Valcambi introduced the miners to the world of refining and we outlined our ASM sourcing approach, emphasizing the importance of due diligence processes and traceability, not only at the mine but throughout the entire value chain.” In turn, the miners presented their mining operations and discussions progressed on the various options a business relations could take. LIMATA AFC12 came on stream a couple of months later as the culmination of this great collaboration. It is a very important milestone for Valcambi and our sector,” comments Knobloch. “This project validates and puts into practice our ASM sourcing processes and, most importantly, demonstrates that responsible artisanal mining and sourcing are possible, and that ASM can access the international gold market.” Some exciting perspectives At the moment, Valcambi’s focus is on bringing benefits to the ASM sector, supporting its formalisation of responsible practices that will allow the mines to access global market. “Given the small volumes that ASMs can currently provide, and factoring in the transport, refining, segregation and traceability costs, ASM sourcing is not commercially viable,” Mesaric acknowledges. “But we have to start somewhere and, as ASM sourcing increases, it will become more commercially viable for us and the industry, and will benefit ASMs.” The many ongoing initiatives and projects led by various organisations are testament to the degree of interest that responsible ASM mining and sourcing has attracted from the many actors along the value chain. “Less than five years ago, only very few organisations would have considered sourcing from ASM, owing to both risk and commercial reasons,” concludes Mesaric. “Today, supply cannot meet the demand. This is a turning point for these mining communities as, with the right support and if they are willing to address the gaps in their practices, they will find buyers for their gold.” Valcambi is supporting other mining projects that will come on stream in the near future. 26 Stakeholders and Materiality Stakeholder engagement G4-24, G4-25, We actively engage with diverse individuals or organisations including our employees, business G4-26 partners, suppliers, governments, industry associations and NGOs, gathering and valuing their opinions and expectations to inform our offer and our practices. We work with them to look for solutions to the challenges facing the industry, and for improvements that can benefit our sector and the world at large. Our relationship and engagement with each individual and organisation is unique and outlined in this section. 27 G4-24 Stakeholder Type of involvement Actions G4-27 Shareholders Periodical meetings Periodical reports Board Periodical meetings Compliance with laws Monthly reporting on business progress Adoption of sector best Monthly conference calls practices Management Periodical meetings Objectives & strategies sharing KPI definition Employees Quarterly report (newsletter) Professional training Important communications updated on Compensations and bonuses notice boards Meetings with union representatives Code of Conduct Coordination meetings Corporate website Company events Work climate survey Sustainability Report Customers Periodical customer satisfaction surveys Satisfaction of their requests On-going communication and expectations Interactions through industry associations Corporate visits Client on boarding process (Due Diligence) KYC (Know Your Client Process) Web site Sustainability Report Suppliers Client on-boarding process (Due Diligence) Clear and detailed contracts KYC (Know Your Client Process) Updated and precise KYP (Know Your Product Process) information Website, e-mail, telephone Suppliers evaluation process Code of Conduct Competitors Meetings organized by industry associations Joining mutual projects Website Meetings Local & National Monthly communication Compliance with laws and Institutions, Information meetings regulations Authorities On-going dialogue Local Communities Website Sponsorship Sustainability Report Public services Regular communication Security training exercises Website Trade & Industry Periodical meetings Joining proactive monitoring Associations programmes Joining fairs and events NGO’s national & Website Communication activities international Sustainability Report Mass media Website (area news) Press release Sustainability Report Media relation 28 Materiality analysis G4-18 The materiality analysis is a stakeholder engagement process aimed at identifying the topics that have a direct or indirect impact on our company’s ability to create economic, environmental and social value and maintain it over time. The insights are central to inform sustainability reporting, but are also valuable to strategic planning. To identify the issues that matter most to our business and our stakeholders, we used a formal materiality process, engaging a broad set of stakeholders. The process has been structured along the following phases: • Identification of a preliminary list of key environmental, social and governance issues of concern • Consultation of internal and external stakeholders on the identified issues • Prioritization of issues to determine associated risks and opportunities • Systematization of the issues by placing on the materiality matrix displaying their position relative to the degree of stakeholder concern and potential business impact • Validation of the matrix by the top management. G4-23 With respect to our 2017 Sustainability Report, we update the materiality assessment process that helped us to focus on the supply chain traceability and ASM sourcing as our new most relevant objectives. Environmental performance remains on the target list, but is ranking behind the two others. G4-22 Compared to the previous Sustainability Report contents, there are no major modifications regarding the information included. 29 Materiality Assessment G4-19, G4-20, Aspects Relevance Boundary of impacts Materiality G4-21, G4-27 Importance Impact on for Level of Internal External Valcambi stakeholder relevance Economic performance Economic value generated & distributed yes      Salaries vs. regional average in comparable industries yes      Spending on local Suppliers yes      Environmental aspects Materials yes      Energy yes     Water yes      Biodiversity yes     Greenhouse gas emissions yes     Waste and discharges yes     Transport of products yes     Environmental expenses yes     Suppliers’ evaluation yes      Social aspects Labour practices and decent work Work conditions yes      Health and safety yes      Employees involvement yes      Training and education yes      Equal opportunities yes      Equal remuneration yes      Suppliers’ evaluation yes      Management of grievances yes      Human rights Activities involving human right screening yes      Freedom of association yes     Child labour yes     Force labour yes     Rights of local population yes     Suppliers’ evaluation yes      Society Local communities yes      Corruption control yes      Anti-competitive behaviour yes      Non-compliance with local laws yes      Suppliers’ evaluation yes      Product responsibility Safety of products yes      Information and labelling yes     Customer surveys yes      Sale of banned or disputed products yes       high  medium 30 Materiality Matrix The findings of the materiality analysis have been placed on a materiality matrix that displays issues of concern for our stakeholders and potential business impacts. The vertical axis of the materiality matrix demonstrates the degree of importance stakeholders assign to the various topics. The horizontal axis mirrors the relevance from the perspective of the company and what may affect our business success. In the upper part, in the middle and on the right side of the matrix are therefore the issues on which, as part of our strategic objectives, a high level of commitment is planned for coming years such as: • Trustworthiness, ethical and professional behaviour • Our People, Health & Security • Our Clients and their satisfaction • Supply chain and traceability control • Economic performance • Water consumption We are aware that priorities can change over time. Our aim is to continue to fine-tune this materiality process to best capture the evolving concerns of our stakeholders. 31 32 Our performance Our economic performance G4-DMA Over the last two years, and despite the global slowdown in the precious metals market, Valcambi had a positive economic performance development. Our contribution to the economic progress of the region in which we operate is represented by the salaries and benefits paid, the direct and indirect taxes contributed and the purchase of goods and services: • The total direct taxes paid by Valcambi at the communal, cantonal and federal level amounted to 28.7 per cent of the Net Profit in 2016, and 27.6 per cent in 2017 G4-EC9 • Total labour expenses amount to 31.2 per cent of our total turnover for 2016 and 28.3 per cent for 2017 • For the purchase of products and services, whenever possible, Valcambi favours local suppliers. Suppliers outside of Switzerland are only chosen when a comparable product or service is not locally available. In 2016 and 2017 Valcambi sourced more than 50 per cent of products and services from local suppliers (based in Ticino). 58.0% 58.4% 32.5% 25.4% 16.6% 9.1% Ticino Rest of Switzerland Abroad Proportion of spending on local suppliers 2016 2017 G4-EC3 Our pension plan is managed by an external third party based on Valcambi’s advises in regards to investment strategy, asset classes and risk profile. The risk profile chosen is in line with our overall risk approach culture. Risk must be measurable and manageable, considering that these assets belong to our employees and have the purpose of guaranteeing financial security during retirement. We have the obligation to find a healthy mix between capital preservation and a return on assets. Over the last two years we have maintained a coverage ratio of approx. 122 per cent and return of 4.3% in 2017 . The benefits we offer are superior to those required by the Swiss Law on Occupational Pensions (2nd pillar), since a generous pension plan is part of our incentives to attract and retain qualified staff. G4-EC4 We did not receive any financial assistance from the Government in 2016 or 2017. 33 G4-EC5 Valcambi adheres to the Swissmem Collective Agreement that supports: G4-LA13 • Equal opportunity and remuneration for women and men and no discrimination regarding sex, age, nationality, religion and sexual orientation; • Guaranteed minimum wage. G4-EC6 The majority of Valcambi’s employees are Swiss or Italian; all four members of our top management are local residents. Our environmental performance G4-DMA Switzerland has some of the strictest environmental protection regulations in the world. As part of our compliance obligations, we are periodically monitored by the local authorities and we carry out internal controls on a regular basis. The results are systematically reported to the authorities. We continuously strive to exceed the requirements of the laws and regulations with which we must comply, by minimizing our environmental footprint through operational efficiency and the use of new technologies. Precious metals refining and manufacturing requires a significant amount of water and energy and leads to GHG emissions and waste. According to the environmental impact analysis operated to achieve ISO140001 and OPIR certification, the environmental risks related to Valcambi’s production are considered moderate to low. We work hard to improve our energy efficiency and reduce the use of chemical products, monitor our emissions, water consumption and waste disposal. In 2016 we implemented a management system (AMBOX) that allows us to monitor closely all the environmental aspects detected. G4-EN31 During the two-year period 2016 to 2017 we spent over three million Swiss Francs on environmental protection measures, mostly devoted to reduce water consumption and treating wastewater. G4-EN32 We expect our suppliers to actively contribute to reducing the environmental impact their products or services have and we work with them to seek optimised solutions in the areas of shipping, transportation and processing. Materials G4-DMA We continuously look to reduce the quantities of chemical products we use, by taking advantage of technical developments and by seeking better solutions for production such as using less environmentally-impactful reagents and sourcing precious metals from secondary feeds. G4-EN1 During 2016 we consumed approximately 1,164 tons of chemicals and materials (excluding precious metals). This compares to 1,206 tons in 2015. In both 2016 and 2017 (as in 2015) more than 50 per cent of total consumption of materials utilised was made up of the top three chemicals used in the refining process, all acid and alkaline solutions. G4-EN2 In 2016, 83.4 per cent of precious metals refined were sourced from secondary feeds and 16.6 per cent from primary feeds, while in 2017 72.2 per cent were sourced from secondary feeds and 27.8 per cent from primary feeds. 34 Energy G4-DMA The electricity consumed is supplied by the local distributor AGE SA and originates mainly, albeit not exclusively, from renewable sources, such as hydropower and biomass. G4-EN3 The total 2016 energy utilisation amounted to 51,432 GJ, an increase of 12.7 per cent versus 2015. In 2017 the consumption was 55,421 GJ, an increase of 7.7 per cent versus 2016. G4-EN6 The increase in energy consumption in 2016 versus 2015 is due to Valcambi starting operating its new Electro Silver Refining (ESR) building. The further increase in 2017 related to the consumption of electricity by the Water Saving System and by the full use of the new ESR. 55,421.0 51,432.0 33,449.0 31,220.0 20,212.0 21,972.0 Electricity Natural Gas Total Energy consumption (in Gigajoule) 2016 2017 Water G4-DMA The water we use is sourced from the public water supply, managed by the Municipality of Balerna G4-EN8 through its subsidiary Azienda Acqua Potabile. The totality comes from a groundwater source located in the immediate vicinity of our premises. In the two-year period 2016 and 2017, we conducted and completed a water saving project aimed at reducing our water consumption by 70 per cent. The balance of the last four months of 2017 showed a 71.8 per cent reduction compared to the same period in 2016. At the end of 2018, we will be able to fully evaluate the benefits of the intervention carried out. For production, cleaning, human consumption and hygienic purposes we purchased 207,151 cubic meters of water in 2016, which represents a decrease of around 5 per cent versus 2015. In 2017 we purchased 146,462 cubic meters, representing a reduction of 29.3 per cent in comparison to 2016. The reduction in water consumption is a direct result of the new Water Saving System and at the end of 2018 we will be able to fully evaluate the effects of the Water Saving Project. 35 243,200 217,860 207,151 146,462 2014 2015 2016 2017 Water consumption (in m3) G4-EN22 In 2016, we released 195,140 cubic meters of waste water, a reduction of 4.8 per cent compared to 2015. In 2017, we further reduced water waste by 27.6 per cent versus 2016, releasing 141,250 cubic meters as a result of the Water Saving Project. The waste water is pre-treated in our on-site Waste Water Treatment Plant before being sent to the Sewage Treatment Plant. Waste G4-DMA The efficient management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste is at the heart of Valcambi's practices. At the beginning of 2017 we implemented a new waste management system, consisting of procedures and instructions aimed at managing the entire waste process, from waste production through to packaging, collection, storage and transport carried out by specialized and authorized companies. G4-EN23 Valcambi generates three types of waste: Domestic non-recyclable wastes generated by Valcambi canteen activity are collected by the local garbage collection company (not tracked). Recyclable waste that can be transformed into reusable materials, reducing the consumption of raw materials, is collected by specialised, legally-recognised recycling companies. Special wastes with environmentally friendly disposal require a set of specific technical and organisational measures and are collected by specialised companies legally recognised for disposal. In 2016 we produced 4.8 tons of special waste, and 6.1 tons in 2017. More than 50 per cent of these special wastes were mineral and synthetic waste oils, about 20 per cent emulsions and aqueous solutions, and 10 per cent waste solvents. Fully 100 per cent of recyclable waste is collected by specialised and legally authorised recycling companies. 36 The recyclable waste collected was divided as follows: 2015 2016 2017 Wood & Paper 28.3 t 34.3 t 30.8 t Metals (Al, Cu, Ferrous) 24.3 t 28.6 t 23.2 t Plastics 17.6 t 29.5 t 19.4 t Other recycling materials 70.7 t 57.6 t 56.6 t Total 140.9 t 150.0 t 130.0 t Greenhouse Gas – (GHG) Emissions G4-DMA According to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GGP), direct and indirect emissions can be categorized as follows: Scope 1: greenhouse gas emissions from sources owned or controlled by the organisation. Scope 2: indirect emissions of greenhouse gases deriving from the generation of electricity purchased by the organisation. Scope 3: other indirect greenhouse gas emissions that are a consequence of an organisation's operations, but are not directly owned or controlled by the organisation such as commuting employees, business trips, production of purchased goods, emissions from use of products sold. In 2017 we commissioned a specialised company to measure and analyse our 2016 GHG emissions. Our direct and indirect GHG emissions measured in tons of CO2 equivalent were as follows: G4-EN15 Scope 1 1,144.9 tCO2 eq. G4-EN16 G4-EN17 Scope 2 2,039.1 tCO2 eq. Scope 3 2,009.9 tCO2 eq. Scope 2 represents the consumption of electricity while the value of Scope 3 is mainly generated by the commuting of Valcambi employees. At the time of production of this Report, the data on GHG emissions for 2017 were not yet available. We will report these data in our 2018 Sustainability Report. G4-EN19 The 2016 data cannot be compared with the previous data of 2014 and 2015 as they have been calculated with greater precision by a specialized company appointed by Valcambi. G4-EN20 Valcambi does not emit ozone-depleting substances into the atmosphere. 37 Our social performance G4-DMA Social issues that are particularly relevant for Valcambi are: • Providing a healthy, safe, and rewarding work environment for each of our employees; • Providing training for our employees; • Offering the best services and products to our business partners, fully compliant with the highest industry standards and government regulations; • Compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements in regards to the origin of the precious metals; • Adherence to Swiss Law and the most stringent international standards for our client onboarding process. We are well aware that significant social issues can occur in the precious metals market, particularly in the upstream part of our value chain. At Valcambi we operate with a zero-tolerance policy to activities such as white collar related crimes including money laundering, human rights related crimes including working conditions and child labour: we will not enter into a business relationship with entities or individuals displaying non-transparent business conduct or where doubts may occur in regards to the origin of metals. Labour practices and decent work G4-DMA Valcambi’s wealth is our people. We offer advantageous contractual agreements, we guarantee good social performance and we endeavour to continuously improve our work environment. 93 32 15 11 3 0 <30 years 30-50 years >50 years Permanent staff 2017, age groups by gender Men Women G4-LA1 In 2016, Valcambi employed a total of 173 people, of whom 150 were permanent and 23 temporary employees (as of 31.12.2016), a decrease of 5.47 per cent versus 2015. The total people fluctuation rate in 2016 was 2.6 per cent annually. In 2017, Valcambi employed a total of 171 people, of which 154 were permanent and 17 temporary employees (as of 31.12.2017), a decrease of 1.16. per cent versus 2016. The total people fluctuation rate in 2017 was 6.6 per cent annually. 38 This is due to the global economic slowdown that affected the minerals and precious metals sector and the natural workforce turnover. Increased mechanisation and job rotation in the processing departments also allow for some flexibility to reduce temporary manpower when the plant is not operating at full capacity In 2016 and 2017 70 per cent of all employees had worked at Valcambi for more than five years. Eight per cent of our employees have been with us for more than 25 years. The average employee tenure is 12 years. 54 56 49 38 39 25 12 12 7 2 3 2 2 3 <1 year 1-5 6-10 11-20 21-30 31-40 >41 years Length of employment, permanent staff 2017 2016 2017 Remuneration is based exclusively on the evaluation of skills and experience; the variable remuneration is assessed against a balanced scorecard of individual and team-based performance objectives. G4-LA2 Despite the global economic slowdown, 100 per cent of our workforce received a performance bonus in 2016 and 2017. G4-LA9 We have increased and diversified our training offer. In 2016, the working hours dedicated to training amounted to 1,949 hours and 120 employees received training for an average of 16.24 hours each. In 2017 training hours amounted to 2,335 hours with 159 people trained for an average of 14.68 hours each. Some of the training offered was mandatory, while other sessions were optional; the subjects covered aspects including health and safety, IT, languages, lean manufacturing, finance, fire service, quality management, compliance, sworn assayer, precision measuring instruments and taxation. We offered our personnel the chance to join internal and external training courses. Health & Safety issues are supervised by our Health & Safety Manager, in collaboration with the HR department. G4-LA6 Our safety target remains to achieve a Zero Incidents rate and to protect and continually improve the health of our workforce. To enhance health and safety measures our staff receive training on an ongoing basis. In the period 2016 to 2017 a limited number of injury events of low gravity have been registered. The number of accidents has remained constant in comparison to the two previous years while seriousness has decreased by 45 per cent. The absentee rate has slightly decreased. 39 N° events FR LDR AR 2015 4 12.7 207.5 5.6% 2016 4 13.2 133.9 5.3% 2017 5 15.3 115.2 4.9% FR (Frequency Rate) = number of injuries / number of worked hours x 1,000,000 LDR (Lost Days Rate) = number of lost days due to injury / number of worked hours x 1,000,000 AR (Absentee Rate) = number of lost hours / number of worked hours To support the OHSAS 18001 certification, a broad training programme has been implemented and great efforts have been deployed to raise awareness and foster a culture of prevention on health and safety aspects. Product responsibility G4-DMA All our products leave our factory with clear labelling, either stamped or, when this is not possible as in the case of gold and silver grain or certain semi-finished products, accompanied by a certificate. G4-PR3 The stamp or certificate includes data on weight, metal description, fineness, Hallmark (CHI Essayeur Fondeur) and, where appropriate, a serial number. G4-PR5 Assessing how satisfied our customers are with our products and services is necessary to capture the essential meaning of quality. In 2016 and 2017, Valcambi measured its customers’ satisfaction using the following instruments/indicators: • Visits Report (to measure overall satisfaction). • Customers Complaints (where we also monitor the resolution time with the objective of keeping it short). • Customer Turnover and Sales Statistics (if the service does not meet their expectations, customers could end the business relationship and turn to other suppliers, decrease their referrals, or not complete an order. If they are satisfied, customers are likely to continue the business relationship with us). • Feedback from Customers (emails / phone calls). 40 Based on their feedback we can state that in 2016 and 2017 our customers were very satisfied with our products and services. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we conducted a client satisfaction survey. The findings of these will be shared in our 2018 Sustainability Report. Society G4-DMA Bribery and corruption are considered a potential risk in the precious metal supply chain. Valcambi's G4-SO3 ethical standards, as described in the Code of Conduct and the Precious Metals Supply Chain Policy, (www.valcambi.com) request behaviours that do not tolerate any form of corruption or bribery. Rigorous policies, procedures and controls are applied internally (for employees and external contractors) and externally (in the supply chain of precious metals). G4-SO4 All Valcambi employees are required to understand, adhere to and sign our Code of Conduct. Any G4-SO10 information regarding incidents related to any form of corruption or bribery as well as misconduct, dishonest or illegal activities occurring at Valcambi have to be reported. Our employees can also submit an observation in the form of an anonymous communication. Our whistleblowing procedure is known by all our employees, and training on these subjects is held periodically. Valcambi has implemented the compliance with the Precious Metal Supply Chain Policy which is audited on an annual basis by independent auditors according to LBMA guidelines. The policy as well as the audit results are publicly available on our company’s website. Human Rights G4-DMA Valcambi is committed to ensuring respect for human rights in conducting its activities. G4-HR5 Valcambi frames its commitment to human rights in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business G4-HR6 G4-HR10 (ILO) and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the OECD Due G4-HR11 Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-affected and High Risks Areas. We comply with the transparency guidelines set by GRI and uphold the framework set by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We comply with relevant sector standards such as the LBMA Gold Guidance, the Responsible Jewellery Council Code of Practice and Chain of Custody Standard and the Fairtrade Standard for Gold and Associated Precious Metals from Artisanal Mining. The Legal and Compliance Officer is responsible for overseeing and managing Human Rights Abuses and White Collar Crimes. He/she ensures that management and employees are in compliance with the rules and regulations of regulatory agencies and value-related risks, when dealing with potential and current business partners. Valcambi recognizes and respects the importance of labour standards to protect workers and provides a guide to employees to ensure compliance with labour laws and regulations in Switzerland in order to promote a positive and ethical work environment. Valcambi confirms social responsibility standards by collaborating with suppliers ensuring that they follow international standards on freedom of association and collective bargaining, forced labor, child labor, harassment or abuse, disciplinary practices and discrimination, among other practices 41 Acronyms and Abbreviations Ag Silver Al Aluminium ASFCMP Association Suisse des Fabricants & Commerçants de Métaux Précieux ASM Artisanal Small-Scale Mining ARM Alliance for Responsible Mining Au Gold BGI Better Gold Initiative CAHRAS Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas CS Credit Suisse Cu Copper EPRM European Partnership for Responsible Minerals ESR Electro Silver Refining GHG Greenhouse gas GJ Giga Jules GRI Global reporting initiative ILO International Labour Organization IT Information Technology LBMA London Bullion Market Association LPPM London Platinum and Palladium Market NGO Non-Governmental Organization OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OPIR Ordinance on Protection against Major Accidents Pd Palladium Pt Platinum SBGA Swiss Better Gold Association tCO2 eq. tons of CO2 equivalent UNEP United Nations Environment Programme WWTP Wastewater Treatment Plant 42 UN Global Compact Principles Global Compact Principles page Human Rights 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights 41 2 Businesses should make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses 41 Labor Standards 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to 15, 41 collective bargaining 4 Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor 41 5 Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labor 23, 38 6 Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation 34 Environment 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges 7 8 Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility 34 9 Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies 34 Anti-Corruption 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery 41 43 GRI Content Index General Standard Disclosures General Standard Page Ext.
