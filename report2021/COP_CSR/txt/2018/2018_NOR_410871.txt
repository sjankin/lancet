The Values of simplifying Working as a responsible business means good business for Amesto. We always attempt to find good methods to contribute to society, whether it is through facilitating for our intrapreneurs, cooperation with social entrepreneurs, internships for people who need it, strategic pro bono projects and trying our best to work environmental friendly. The aim is for social responsibility to be a natural part of the workday at Amesto. The Values of Simplifying shall have a strong standing in the companies underneath the Amesto brand. Simplifying business is our mission, but we must also seek to simplify in everything we do, whether it being the way to take environmental responsibility or the way of working sustainably. Every day there are at least 150,000 people using any of Amestos’ services. We have over 1,000 employees in Scandinavia and many 100 suppliers. Amesto wants to, and has the opportunity to be a longterm partner for a sustainable society. 5 What do we do in Amesto? In Amesto, we focus on three areas of sustainability: ▪ The Value of Simplifying diversity ▪ The Value of Simplifying shared value partnership ▪ The Value of Simplifying the environment The values of simplifying are the outcome of collecting and gathering the social projects that exist in the companies that are part of the Amesto family. The values add a framework to the work we do on Corporate Social Value. Amestos’ vision; Life is short, work somewhere awesome. Amesto is the sum of the people who work here. Those who glow for their job, are engaged and help to create a good workplace. Those who are always looking to make things easier. Leaders who are predictable, wise and enthusiastic. Leaders who look, listen, challenge and respect their employees. Together we create awesome! We look upon our purpose as that of delivering sustainable and responsible solutions for our customers so that they achieve their goals. We simplify their everyday life by asking the right questions and through sharing our expertise. obtain this, our values add an effect to our goal of reaching awesomeness. Through giving people a chance to learning through practice, through helping Medicine sans Frontiérs become a more effective NGO, through helping our employees think environmental friendly during their workday. It is easier to communicate and measure the effects that these values add to the company, by getting the employees engaged in them. We have created the values to acquire the employees to appreciate that our work with corporate social value, not only is a responsibility, but a value, not only for society, but for the business. By working in a sustainable way, both economically and socioeconomically, we are building a corporation that can withstand time, and not become a dinosaur. Amesto will be a company that evolves following the times we are living in, focusing on the requirements created by customers and employees. 6 LIFE IS SHORT, WORK SOMEWHERE AWESOME Amesto is the sum of people who work here. The ones who spark for the job they do. The ones who are committed and contribute to creating a great workplace. Those who are always looking to simplify in everything they do. Leaders who are predictable, wise and enthusiastic. Leaders who look, listen, challenge and respect their employees. Together we create awesome! The value of simplifying shared value partnership We are into the 2. year of our strategic collaboration with Médecins sans Frontiéres (MSF). Amesto's ambition is to develop MSF Nordic as a showcase for best practice of how effective an NGO can be administered, focusing on good and effective business solutions. We see the value of this partnership in a Nordic context, engaging the offices in both organisations in Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm around MSFs work and making it meaningful and relevant for both parties involved. Médecins sans Frontiéres has identified that the three Nordic sections wish to work closer and harmonize their finance systems. Together with Visma, we have ventured to add value through pro-bono partnership for MSF. Amesto started working hands-on with implementation of streamlining the administration of MSF in 2016, having spent most of 2015 identifying the project. Throughout 2017 we have continued our implementation fase, and reports from MSF have started coming back, containing positive feedback. The implementation of Visma Salary with Visma.Net Expence for travel and expense has made a huge impact on the organisation. The staff and referrers report on improved timesaving value, less mistakes being made and this again gives the finance team less work when it comes to controlling and correction work. In 2017 referrers also reported on setting a record high on the number of registered donors, reporting that one of the factors being the ease of the backoffice work. The solution has been effective and MSF are ensuring that the processes are of great add value in camparison with previous routines. 2017 was also the year where Médecins Sans Frontières and Amesto Translations started their cooperation fully, and all departments of the MSF have taken advantage of the translation services offered. Through the Amesto Secure MT tool, MSF has easy axcess to translate texts and articles. Translators from Amesto have also helped Médecins Sans Frontières with major projects, such as translation of new websites, articles about our work and subtitling of films made for getting doners and other different types of communication. 7 MSF is growing as an organization, and the office's activities are increaseing. This would usually implicate that the administration of the MSF would increase accordingly. However, through Amesto's pro bono assistance we have grown without having to increase the number of manpower in administration. This leads to huge savings for MSF, and we believe that the cooperation in 2018 will continue increasing these savings. Amesto Denmark continues with their major project, upgrading their Visma Business Platform. Further plans are in regard to the streamlining of internal ERP processes based on the new version af Visma in order to make way for One Stop Reporting implementation in 2018. This will help us immensely as we will have the possibility to present results from different data sources in one reporting system, and at the same time facilitate the way we consolidate the monthly reports. The effect measured: In 2017 we get reports from MSF that they have started seeing the effects of the work that is being layed down through Amesto. Processes that before were very timeconsuming, have now become streamlined, and less timeconsuming, making the workday for the employees in the administration of MSF much more efficient. In addition, MSF continues growing, but without the need of exponentially growing their costbase. 8 The Value of Simplifying Diversity We are continously working on creating diversity in our organisations, as we believe that equal people create good things, but diversified people create awesomeness. Amesto is diversified. We are 4 different businesses units, which attract people with different interests, varied backgrounds, diverse religions and beliefs, from different agegroups. We have through the year continued to have a greater focus on increasing our femal leader corp. In 2017, 10 out of 23 superiors are female, in Amestos main businesses. This equals 43 percent. Our goal is to have continous focus on femal leadership. At a strategic level, we decided to change our Holding company boards. We placed each of the CEO’s of our companies as an observations boardmember in a board of one of the other companies in the Group, in order to get different perspectives, and also for each of the CEO’s to get an understanding of other business in Amesto Group. At an operational level, when looking at how we work in each of the businesses, we give each company the tools and supply easy access to partners in order to make sustainable decisions when hiering. Top Temp, an Amesto company, which industry is recruitment, uses different partners in order to assist people into jobs. We cooperate with several rehabilitation enterprises, such as Fretex, Joblearn and directly with NAV (the Norwegian state), in order to help their candidates into ordinery jobs. Fretex and MSF have also used assessment skills and methods from TopTemp for their candidates in order to get valuable information about what is going to succeed in given directions and they have also assisted in adressing interviewing skills. 9 Simplifying the Value of the Environment As member of the Ecolighthouse foundation, Amesto supports climate action on a national level. We look to reduce our own footprint and we try to make an impact on all the employees that work for an Amesto office. Eco-Lighthouse is Norway’s most widely used certification scheme for enterprises seeking to document their environmental efforts and demonstrate social responsibility. In 2917 the Eco-Lighthouse foundation acquired work towards satisfying requirements and implementing environmental measures on a systematic and ongoing basis in order to create more environmentally friendly operations and safer work environments. Through the Eco-Lighthouse Foundation Amesto has prepared industry-specific requirements. Enterprises are certified subject to independent assessment and must undergo a recertification process every three years. We are also required to submit annual environmental reports. The Eco-Lighthouse certification scheme has been approved by the Norwegian public procurement authorities. We are also, through member organisations trying to put preassure through procurment and prioitizing environmental rental spaces where ever and when ever we can. Most of our offices in Norway have now been certified Ecolighthouse, and in Sweden, we are working with the environment through ISO. During 2017 Eco-lighthouse managed to become a national environmental certifified organization recognized by the EU. The certificate can be included as an approved contract and qualification requirement as an environmental management system when Norwegian businesses are on offer in Europe, without having to go for other, more complicated systems. The main office in Norway underwent a resertification in 2016, and was again certified for three new years. In 2017 we also established Amesto as the main office for the whole group, including Top Temp. This makes it easier to coordinate our efforts. Representing Amestos CO2 footprint 10 Global Compact Amesto is committed to deliver to the UN's Global Compact. We do our best to deliver on all the ten principles related to human rights, labor standards, environmental awareness and anti corruption. Through this affiliation, we have committed to doing our best to conduct sustainable business through keeping with these ten principles. We try to promote Global Compact and our other corporate responsibilities through our sales channels, through our corporate procurement, and through any digital channels we use. We take notice that in sales processes potential future client companies increasingly are asking for documentation on our Corporate Social Value profile. In regard to the UN Sustainable Development Goals we see that some of them have a clear relevance to our core business and the social corporate value programs we have. Through our strategic collaboration with Mediciné Sans Frontiérs we work in relation to goal nr. 3: Good health and well-being. In, as mentioned above, increasing efficiency in the administrative processes, MSF can focus on growth without increasing expenditure, hence, more of their collected money go to what is their purpose, saving lives. Through our commitment to Eco-lighthouse we are tapping onto goal nr. 13.2; climate action, where we have integrated environmental meassures into our business, in order to reduce our own footprint. In thinking sustainable business growth, goal nr. 5 of gender inequality is at a high level of our agenda, and through our vision of creating an awesome place to work, we always look at how our employees measure us as a company. As a family owned company, we drive a business that is very value based, and we seek to ask questions and improve ourselves as a business all the time. This makes goal nr. 9 an essential for us, as does goal nr. 10. HUMAN RIGHTS It is necessary for Amesto to win the confidence of the world around us and develop a good reputation among our employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, partners, banking and insurance connections and the public authorities. Competitors as well as the company’s own employees must have confidence in 11 the Groups professionalism and integrity at all times. This demands that the Group behave with caution, honesty and objectivity. We focus on value-based organizational philosophy and try to create a strong winning culture. We need not necessarily be the largest, but we want to be the best within our business areas. Our values and norms must saturate everything we are as a company. What we stand for, how we do things and how we communicate. We focus on what is important, and we place great emphasis on ensuring that our employees are with us. Our daily great challenge is that our values are not just going to be nice words, but that we recognize them in everyday business. Our guidelines are rather general in a multifarious group such as Amesto. Nevertheless, we have tried to be as specific as possible, but without expecting the guidelines to give specific answers to every conceivable question. In the Nordic countries, the laws are rigid enough that human rights violations do not become an issue. Through the audit that is undertaken each year, we make sure that business is conducted in a good and proper way. We have also created a code of conduct for our partners and suppliers, where we outline the business conduct we expect our suppliers and partners to act on. LABOUR The overall objectives of the HSE work in Amesto Group AS is to meet our vision of “Life is short, work somewhere awesome”. In addition we work to prevent that our operations do not cause accidents, damage or loss off; • Employees or others' lives and health • The external environment • Knowledge and information We aim to achieve our intentions through: • Qualified staff who inhabit continuous training • Implementation of internal control • Management and employee involvement at all levels • Through good cooperation in the work environmental group • Monitoring of absence because of sickness and occupational injury statistics • Preventive measures through sporting activities, social events and a good work environment The group's employees have acceptable HSE, pay and working conditions. There are no forms of forced labor in our activities (incl. making sure that employment contracts are legal and that employees are not required to make any kind of financial deposit). There is no discrimination against or discriminatory treatment of employees. The group does not, directly or indirectly contribute to the violation of human rights. In addition, we monitor and evaluate performance through our yearly employee survey and individual appraisal. This to ensure that everyone gets the possibility to speak their mind, and that the right measures are set to each and everyone individually.The satisfaction of the employees, in all the countries in which we have offices, is increasingly positive. The work environment is of great importance. We see that in creating a positive work environment, we achieve the goals we are set out to make. It is Amesto Groups philosophy that a good, active and creative environment is essential for success and for good results today and in the future. We evaluate the abovementioned factors and document them prior to entering into any commercial investment. In addition, Amesto, through the Eco-lighthouse program, attempt to ensure that our suppliers and partners meet equivalent standards as we are devoted to. These factors are regularly being revised 12 Amesto administers revision of the complete HSE system. The management of the individual companies is responsible for following up. We conduct our yearly safety inspection cross all offices, where each employee speak their mind about what they find satisfactory, and what they find unsatisfying. • All managers and managing directors undertake HSE training courses to keep track of new laws and legislations that continuously are being implemented. • Amesto is continually thriving to address the issues of diversity when it comes to ethnicity, educational background, age and gender and believe that a good blend of all factors bring us closer to an innovating team. ANTI-CORRUPTION Corruption includes bribery and improper influence peddling. Corruption undermines legal business activity, distorts competition, destroys the business's reputation and exposes companies and individuals to risk. Bribery occurs when an attempt is made to influence someone in the execution of his/her duties by giving them an illegal personal benefit. Improper influence peddling occurs when an illegal benefit is given to someone in order to influence the execution of a third-party's duties. This kind of illegal benefit may take many forms; e.g. cash, objects, credit, discounts, travel, accommodations or services. Amesto is against all forms of corruption and will work actively to ensure that this does not occur in the Group's business activities. However, should it occur, we do have measures to implement. The prohibition against bribery and improper influence peddling applies to both the party who gives or offers an illegal benefit and the party who solicits, receives or accepts this kind of benefit. It is sufficient that an inquiry or offer of an illegal benefit is submitted in order for the case to be illegal. It is not a necessary condition that the illegal benefit be received by the person on whom an attempt is made to exert influ-ence. Facilitation payments are payments aimed at expediting or securing the provision of products or services to which the company is legally entitled. Amesto opposes the use of this type of payment, even in cases where it may be legal, and will actively work to prevent such payments. If a deviation from this general rule is under consideration, the matter must be documented in writing, and the management is responsible for informing the Board of Directors about this. We also want to point out that Amesto pays tax with honor as it gives stability for the governments to create and carry out activities that lead to generate equity in society, because there is no doubt that the national cooperation will result in economic benefits for society. Amesto is being audited by Deloitte every year. Deloitte has thereby had a sound run through the corporate governance of Amesto. 13
