Portable Ventilator (Healthcare initiative): Gowthami, a 9-year-old girl was suffering from a rare condition known as Auto Immune Disorder. She was under ventilator support 24/7. Due to high hospital expenses, she had been kept under home care in a remote Senji village in Tamil Nadu. In 2016, Hexaware's CSR team with the help of the Innovation team took up a project to make an IOT device to monitor her ventilator remotely. The initiative was a success, but the ventilator maintenance was a cropping issue. In 2017, Hexaware sponsored a portable ventilator to ensure uninterrupted health care and ensured survival of Gowthami. The portable ventilator operated on 8 to 12 hour power back up. Hexaware also equipped Gowthami with a powered wheel chair so that she can move freely as earlier she was not able to commute on her own. The initiative enabled her to get back to her school education. Hexaware also applied special solar chargers to the inverters at home to tackle long power outages. The day the team went to handover all the new equipment to Gowthami, her first few words were, Mother, let's go to the shop, let's go to the road, let's go to Balvikas, let's go to JAPAN!!!! The joy on the girl's face was wonderful to see. We are hoping that soon Gowthami will not need the ventilator at all. Prepared by Goodera Page 12
