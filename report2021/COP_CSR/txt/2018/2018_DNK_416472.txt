We want a business with a defining culture, a business with values that are widely recognized. For us these are the key components of being a leading services company. The new GDPR will be in force as from 25th May 2018. Being a service provider, Moranti handles a significant amount of personal data, which require documented processes and systems.

The replies are then analyzed and made into an action plan, where representatives from both managers and employees are involved, selecting the focus areas of significant importance in the APV. All comments are replied upon. Based on the APV and daily dialog with the employees, we measure and rank our working environmental status. The APV result and action plan is uploaded to the intranet being accessible for everybody in the company. CSR Rapport 2018 Page 5 Senior policy To preserve important knowledge and skills in the company, we have a defined senior policy for our elder employees The policy offer: From the age of 60 a.

The sick leave percentage for 2017 was 5,7%, which is a decrease of almost 1% compared to 2016. As a responsible company, caring for our employees, we ensure an environment where dialog between managers and employee are normal. It is through dialog any factors influencing the sick leave is revealed. The company operates with different categories 1. Informal “Welcome back” dialog held upon return from sick leave 2. Informal “Phone call” when an employee has been absent more than 3 days 3. “Occupational retention” dialog is held if the employee is long-term ill. The meeting needs to take place no later than 4 weeks after 1st day of absence. The dialog is regarding, how we as a company, together with the employee, doctor and municipality can adjust the work for the employee to ensure fast and easy return to work Work-related injuries Vi are fortuned not to have had any accidents or injury in the company. If, however an accident or injury should occur they would be reported to the to the Industrial Injury Board (Arbejdsskadestyrelsen) Training Education All our employees are trained in our compliances and then the specific tasks each employee will fulfill e.g. written communication, call flow and conflict handling.

CSR Rapport 2018 Page 6 Motivation is essential, both to ensure development individually and as a company.

We welcome people who need to be tested in their abilities to work after e.g. accidents, long-term illness etc. In corporation with the American Embassy, AmCham, business companies and volunteers we invite Somalis teenagers to visit our company – showing them why it is essential to get an education and what opportunities companies like ours, can offer them. CSR Rapport 2018 Page 7 Business areas Moranti is one of Denmark's oldest service, call and contact centers. We offer standard and customized solutions for customer service / helpdesk, monitoring / support team and back office assignments. We serve customers globally in 6 languages. Our headquarter is located in Copenhagen where our dedicated employees strive to provide the good experience every. Customer service Customer service covers a wide range of different tasks, where each area / task requires separate competencies and personal profiles. Reception and Switch board More and more companies choose to outsource their reception/switchboard to avoid unnecessary wait and/or lost calls. We offer; switchboard, handling of messages both by phone and e-mails as well as managing calendars. We handle both full time solutions or overflow situations (ie calls are redirected to Moranti Services when your lines are busy, during holiday periods, etc). All calls are handled by trained employees, who are experienced in similar assignments, giving our business partners the possibility of increased service level (answer rate, extended opening hours, flexibility etc.). The calls can be handled in Moranti’ systems or directly in external systems. Customer service / helpdesk Customer service / helpdesk is a broader service than the reception and switchboard. Customer service includes e.g.: Handling of inquiries Guidance Support Registration Reporting We offer customer service / helpdesk as a fulltime solution (where Moranti takes all incoming calls), outside opening hours or as overflow during working hours.

On-site services Today customer service is a strategic business area for most companies. However, not being core business, companies request skilled and trained employees from Moranti to be located at their premises. Others see on-site employees from Moranti as supplement to their own employees, adding different skills – this being languages, experiences, profile or the like. It is not only a flexible solution but at the same time cost-efficient. Back Office Back office consists of a variety of different administrative assignments. Outsourcing of these create opportunities for economic optimization, without compromising on quality.

Moranti believes, in addition of ensuring healthy growth, that it is important to show responsibility. This also applies to the selection of suppliers when purchasing goods and services. By working with responsible supplier management, we ensure our focus on the social and environmental responsibility. Growth must be made with respect for human rights, labor rights, environmental conservation. We are actively fighting against corruption and unfair trading practices. We require our suppliers and partners to comply with the guidelines for social and environmental responsibility in accordance with internationally recognized principles and rights as defined by, amongst others, the UN. The principles are defined in our Code of Business Conduct. Our procurement policy is designed to ensure uniformity of the requirements we wish to present to our current and potential suppliers. This enables us to transfer our own standards and principles to both our customers and the society. When selecting suppliers, we are particularly aware of our supplier's ability to manage quality, effectively. Equally important is they have a positive environmental and safety profile that, as a minimum, is equivalent to the principles of the Global Compact. In Moranti, responsible supplier management implies ongoing reviews of selected suppliers, especially those who have a direct impact on the following: The quality of the services we provide to our customers Our image and brand in the market The environment and the work environment The ability to ensure continued good profitability We communicate openly about the challenges we may have, including both positive and negative consequences of supplier assessments and responsible supplier management. We believe, that an honest dialogue and cooperation creates the necessary understanding enabling us to and allocate the necessary resources to influence and improve social and environmental conditions. CSR Rapport 2018 Page 11 We care about the environment Environmental objectives Being a significant market player within our business area we are aware of the affect we have on the environmental surroundings.

We are committed to reduce the overall environmental impact and to work actively to prevent and reduce environmental impacts from our employees and core activities. We want to be perceived as an environmentally responsible company and by joint efforts achieve lasting benefits for the environment, our business, our customers, employees and society. Environmental policy From an overall perspective, Moranti aim to reduce the environmental impact and energy within a reasonable a financial frame. We comply, as a minimum, with relevant environmental legislation. We use sustainable energy, hybrid company cars and our waste management recycling system are factors which reduces the environmental impact. We want all employees to be are aware of and comply with our environmental policies, where the management team has the responsibility of promoting environmental awareness. We want to create an environmental awareness by a continues involvement, inspiration and training of our employees. Our environmental policy and CSR report is available to all our stakeholders, and we encourage an open dialogue with customers, authorities and other stakeholders concerning all environmental conditions. We have a procurement policy, which include environmental considerations. We aim to use suppliers, who are environmentally aware, when we purchase new equipment, such as IT or any other electronics, that have an impact on energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Further, we require environmentally friendly products and services in our company, like we changed our previous stationary phones with soft phones. It is a requirement that all our key suppliers have read and duly signed our Code of Conduct confirming they comply with all applicable international regulations on the environment, labor rights etc. Our environmental policy sets the guidelines and actions of improving our environmental performance continuously. All guidelines and solutions must take financial consequences and our working environment into account as well as being reasonable in relation to the performance of our daily tasks. CSR Rapport 2018 Page 12 Waste management Regulator Moranti follow the WEEE Directive (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment), which define common EU rules managing electric scrap for prevention and reduction of waste from electronic equipment and to promote recycling. We want to ensure all our electronic wastes are correctly managed from an environmental perspective and in alignment with our overall environmental objectives and policies. We will comply with relevant environmental legislation and we monitor continuously relevant environmental laws to ensure that our activities are conducted within the established legal requirements. Waste disposal One of our environmental objectives is to reduce the overall environmental impact. We do this by the way we dispose our waste. We have made agreements with our property manager and external suppliers concerning our waste management. Our employees are responsible for sorting waste in various containers and collection systems in accordance with the instructions. Our waste is sorted as follows: Combustibles Paper and cardboard Electronic equipment Soft plastic Batteries Cans Glass and china Energy consumption We know that energy is the base of modern society and that both production and consumption of energy affects the environment. In Moranti, we work actively to prevent and reduce environmental impacts through a continuous reduction and effective use of the energy for heating, water and electricity using sustainable energy whenever possible. The number of employees, require facilities with several m² for our operation, which affect our consumption of heating and electricity. Taking our need for space and overall profitability into account, we continuously aim to align our facilities with technical measures to manage and reduce our energy consumption. Examples of initiatives made; Our operating PCs have been installed with an auto off system We have an automatically heating system Light savers in areas not being used on a regularly basis Transport Company cars As the majority of Moranti’ core business does not involve driving, we are in no need of a large fleet of vehicles. Few activities require transport and when occurring our employees use private cars. Our current company cars do not impact environmental significantly. Nevertheless, we take the environment into account when we acquire new company cars, by choosing hybrids or electric driven cars to improve fuel economy and the reduction of CO2 emissions. Further, we aim to reduce our travel activities and thus our CO2 by replacing long trips by car or plane with conference calls, Internet and video conferencing, which benefits both the environment and work efficiency.
