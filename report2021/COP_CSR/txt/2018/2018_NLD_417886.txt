P a ge 9 of 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 4. Sustainable business Sustainability is a vital part of our corporate culture, which is necessary to continue to increase our long-term success and to minimise our future development risks. Our CSR policy is based on three pillars: Environmental Responsibility, Social Engagement and Economic Enhancement. Environmental responsibility Our environmental performance is constantly improved by applying sustainable principles along our entire value chain. We strive to reduce and mitigate adverse effects from our activities while ensuring health and safety for our employees. Logistics We operate sophisticated warehouses, in which we use modern technology to help us efficiently loading and unloading trucks, reducing fuel and resource requirements. Architecture We use automated systems in our main warehouses that ensure we can operate as effectively and efficiently as possible. Additionally, we invest in modern IT across our offices and facilities, boosting efficiency and cutting energy use. We use the warmth of the earth as a significant heating source in our offices and in 2018 we will start the installation of solar panels on the roofs of our warehouses. Waste Management Whenever possible, we reduce, reuse, recycle and improve materials to utilise resources in the most environmentally prudent manner. In our offices, we raise awareness of waste disposal and waste reduction and we recycle waste paper. We invest in digital administrations systems that make us work more efficient and reduce our paper use. Procurement We actively promote transparency on product information. We comply with the most stringent regulations. Our warehouses are ISO 22000 and HACCP certified, and operate a high-level processing risk management system. All products that enter our facilities are subject to comprehensive quality controls, handled with the utmost care, and stored in climate-controlled environments. Social engagement We pursue meaningful social initiatives that improve people’s lives by enabling local community and societal participation. Human rights Our human rights procedures are firmly embedded in our Code of Conduct, which is applicable to all staff members working within B&S. Being part of the UN Global Compact highlights our commitment to the ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption. P a ge 1 0 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Employee empowerment We provide a workplace that is free from discrimination harassment and victimisation, where everyone received equal treatment. Our people are given autonomy in performing their tasks, and we encourage them to act as pioneers and entrepreneurs. We invest in sophisticated equipment and warehouses to create a safe workplace. Keeping a positive working atmosphere is also about creating a healthy workplace, giving people energy and self-confidence. To that end, we provide free access to a gym, encouraging employees to exercise during working hours. Talent development We maintain close relationships with (applied) universities to spot talent early on and provide students with internships in various disciplines. Once on board, we offer young graduated trainee programs in our B&S academy, preparing them to become experts in their field. Local development Our focus lies on improving people’s lives through community and societal participation. For example, we provide employees who are disabled or have a distance to the labour market with appropriate functions. We also work with general food associations or food banks to ensure that surplus food, which is too close to its expiration date to be sold, is distributed to those in need. In the event of a major catastrophe or crisis, we help facilitate the transportation of aid to the region in which it has occurred to help alleviate suffering, which we believe is a worthwhile contribution to social development. Economic enhancement We follow strict customer and supplier acceptance procedures, and set quality standards that suppliers and customers need to comply with. Implementing these procedures enables us to ensure that compliance is safeguarded along our entire supply chain. Credit Risk The aim of our corporate policy is to safeguard our continuity, while maintaining a balance between risk and financial returns. Our strong balance sheet enables us to remain independent and ensure sustainable growth. Currency We source and distribute large quantities of goods globally. To reduce risk from currency transactions, we match incoming and outgoing cash flows as closely as possible in the same currency. To safeguard our stability, our treasury department uses hedging instruments. Long term relationships We strive for long-term relationships built on expertise and involvement to understand our stakeholders’ needs. We have relationships with a variety of customers and suppliers in many countries and are committed to understand and respect these relationships by maintaining an open dialogue. P a ge 1 1 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Know your relation Before taking on a new customer or supplier, we apply our Know Your Relation procedure, gathering all relevant data. Creditworthiness of new relations is checked upfront to avoid corruption, bribery, fraud and other unethical behaviour. Customer relationships are checked with the OFAC and EU Sanctions list.

Human Rights principles  Principle 1: Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and  Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Overview B&S is based in the Netherlands where the majority of our business is directed and where the key office and staff are situated. We are also active in sizeable operations in Afghanistan and Mali. B&S adheres to national laws, rules and regulations in the countries in which it is active. All employees are offered the best possible conditions. As a minimum, these conditions exceed the ILO labour conventions. Our company respects human rights and always treats people with respect and dignity. Our stakeholders respect us because we keep our promises, and act with honesty and integrity by conducting ethical and professional business at all times. We have operations in many countries and goods are transported worldwide and therefore respecting human rights is a core part of how we conduct our daily business. We are convinced that the human rights of every individual should be respected, no matter where we do business. In Afghanistan, where we also operate a warehouse, the national human rights conditions are different from what we are used to in Europe. In order to make sure our principles are implemented in all our undertakings we strive to implement the same human rights principles in Afghanistan as those implemented in our offices in The Netherlands. This is applicable for all our internal and external stakeholders. Assessment, policy and goals We emphasize our support to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The protection of the Human Rights is derived from group ethics, rules and policies and further based on applicable policies from the ILO and UN conventions, all as far as relevant for the activities of our company and our industry. Our human rights procedures are firmly embedded in our Code of Conduct, which is applicable to all our staff members. This includes ensuring that we are never involved in child labour, nor forced labour. All staff members should understand the principles, procedures and guidelines stated in this Corporate Code of Conduct. It is expected that staff members work in the spirit of those principles and actively propagate them in order to protect or to improve the company’s integrity and reputation. Company managers are expected to lead according to our standards of ethical conduct, in both words and actions. Managers are responsible for promoting open and honest two-way communications. Managers must be positive activists and role models and must be diligent in reporting unethical or illegal conduct.

Implementation in 2017 Topic 1. Procedure review and discussion with senior management on breaches The company reviews procedures yearly and has discussions between the Executive Board and senior managers on the effectiveness and completeness of these procedures, breaches, and incidents. Topic 2. ‘Local first’ policy in Mali Last year, we have promoted our first Malian National as Manager of our PX shop in Mopti. His expertise and know-how contributed to the highest monthly sales in over 2,5 years of operation! Topic 3. Serving MINUSMA by expanding our position After showing a successful operation of five retail outlets in Mali, we have extended our number of shops in 2017. By working together with colleagues from different divisions we’ve opened our very first Superstore in Bamako, the capital of Mali. The multi-assortment shop has a shopping area of over 300 m2 and is part of our B&S Central Store shop concept which focuses on enabling the end consumer to enjoy items from home. We also effectively moved the location of our PX in Gao, to a permanent and bigger location in Gao’ Super camp. Another great result is the rebuild of our PX Express location in Bamako. For this special project, only our newly trained Malian National staff members were deployed. Because of their support, we’ve emptied the shop completely, replaced the floor and rebuild all product showcases within 72 hours. Topic 4. Solid partnerships with (applied) universities We strongly believe that our responsibility to communities in which we are active goes beyond only doing business, it is also about giving back to the communities in which we work and live. To attract talented people, we frequently organise educational events mainly in the Netherlands. P a ge 1 5 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Our educational activities include guest lectures, career days, and internship events. Moreover, we organise dedicated learning projects in cooperation with various (applied) universities. Career Days Each year, we organise Career Days to meet talented graduates, from various disciplines such as commerce, finance or logistics, who have just graduated from (applied) universities in the region. The Career Days are events where starters and graduates get acquainted with the career opportunities within B&S. Throughout this day, experts explain more about their business activities, challenges and experiences. Their personal stories are meant to provide these young professionals with a better understanding of our day to day operations. Furthermore, conversations with recruiters are held and the graduates get a tour through our offices and logistics facilities. Internship events B&S is present at different internship events from the (applied) universities in our region to attract students for practical internships or graduation assignments. Guest lectures We give several guests lectures each year, and try to add value to the academic programmes of the (applied) universities with whom we hold close relationships. Our employees conduct guest lectures about their area of expertise on a regular basis. This point of view from practice, P a ge 1 6 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress combined with the existing academic content of the lectures, give students real-life insights into specific business cases.

Overview Our people make the difference when it comes to serving our stakeholders, human resources are considered a strategic factor in our day to day activities. Human resources management is primarily focused on supporting the sustainable growth of the company through an operational staff of talented people. It is the responsibility of the human resources department to ensure the quality of our human capital, and support shaping the company’s future by focusing on career development, employee retention, work safety and the well-being of our staff members. The company offers an international in which performance and world-class leadership are promoted. Assessment, policy and goals Our ambition is to be amongst the most attractive and active employers within our industry. All employees have standard working hours, based on local regulations and industry standards and in accordance with the ILO conventions. All employees receive fair compensation for their work in line with local minimum requirements specified by the law and by the industry standards in relevant countries as well as by ILO conventions. Our people have the right to a healthy and safe workplace. Good working conditions and a positive working environment help contribute to a lower absenteeism rate. Our people are given autonomy in performing their tasks, and we encourage them to act as pioneers and entrepreneurs. This has led to the exploration of new markets, the sale of new products, and the opening of new regions. We provide a workplace that is free from discrimination, harassment and victimisation, where everyone receives equal treatment regardless of their gender, colour, nationality, disability, age, marital status, sexual orientation or religion. We are composed of a diverse group of people who are passionate about making a difference and inspiring other people. Their innovative solutions, enthusiasm and self-confidence help us to move forward and achieve our annual objectives.

Procedure review and discussion with senior management on breaches The company reviews procedures yearly and has discussions between the Executive Board and senior managers on the effectiveness and completeness of these procedures, breaches, and incidents. Topic 2. Labour conditions B&S Cruise Shops We recognise the special needs of seafarers, and offer our new employees fair conditions, complying with all Maritime Labour Convention (MLC 2006) guidelines. We gave special attention to the following topics:  Contract terms and conditions  Working and rest hours  Payment and wages  Accommodation, food and catering  Health and safety  Complaint handling P a ge 2 1 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 3. Labour conditions of shop employees in Afghanistan and Mali By adhering to our own policies and the ILO (International Labour Organization) conventions and rights as a minimum, we strive to upgrade the labour rights of local staff in Afghanistan and Mali. The personnel policy in Afghanistan and Mali is basically the same as our personnel policy in the Netherlands, and only partly modified to the local conditions and circumstances. The main topics of our Human Resources policy include:  Employment is recorded by means of a contract;  Agreements are in line with local laws and regulations;  Salaries are competitive with ILO convention as a minimum; and  Each employee will receive internal training and work guidance. The fair salary payment for B&S staff is reflected in competitive salary conditions offered by B&S. Besides a fair salary, staff receives a monthly food allowance and a monthly transport allowance. Working overtime is paid at a rate of 150% and working on Official Public and Religious Holidays is paid at a rate of 200%. Staff is entitled to 10 days paid leave for every six months worked. The working hours are based on the Labour and Employee Law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and depend on the season:  April 1st – October 31st 08.00 hrs. until 17.00 hrs. (1-hour lunch break included)  November 1st – March 31st 08.00 hrs. until 16.00 hrs. (1-hour lunch break included)  Ramadan hours 08.00 hrs. until 14.00 hrs. (no lunch break included) Topic 4. Secure working conditions in Afghanistan The security of the offices and warehouses in Afghanistan is an important aspect. As we store consumer goods in warehouses, the premises need to be protected in relation to potential security threats, theft and other breaches. The B&S compound is located in a relatively safe area just past the city gate of Kabul. The nearest police and military post is only 0.5 kilometre away. The compound is secured by 34 guards on location (working in two shifts), equipped with adequate defence tools. The compound is surrounded with a high fence. There are separate guarded exit and entry gates. All vehicles entering the compound are thoroughly inspected. In addition, the visitors are registered and searched before entering. B&S has an extensive training program to ensure that employees in Afghanistan are competent to perform their jobs and to improve efficiency in relation to food safety, personal health and hygiene. Training courses are provided in terms of workshops, presentations or training-on-thejob. Examples of training that are given: 1. Introduction training 6. Fork-lift safety 2. HACCP Awareness 7. Fire safety 3. Food Safety 8. First aid 4. Personal Hygiene 9. PPE 5. Manual Handling P a ge 2 2 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 5. Training for employees at B&S Dordrecht Security is also an important aspect in our warehouses in the Netherlands, albeit in a different capacity. We use equipment such as forklifts, electric pallet trucks, pallet jacks and electric wrapping machines. The staff is well trained to use this equipment safely. Furthermore, warehouses are well organized and clean which also contributes to the safety of our staff. The training of staff is an on-going process. B&S has an extensive training programme to ensure that employees in the Netherlands are competent to perform their jobs and to improve efficiency in relation to food safety and security. It is crucial for us that employees are properly trained. First of all, it ensures their own safety and security, and second, all our processes are strictly followed. In the past years, we have implemented the following training sessions:  HACCP & ISO22000 training: internal training about our quality management systems, HACCP and ISO22000.  Air – freight Security: awareness training about how to recognize, prevent and handle any possible danger (terrorism) during airfreight.  Airfreight Security Controller: training about different kind of security inspections on deliveries for airfreight.

P a ge 2 3 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 6: B&S as knowledge centre Our people have autonomy in performing their tasks, and we encourage them to act as pioneers and entrepreneurs. This has led to the exploration of new markets, the sale of new products and the opening of new regions. We consider education to be an important factor for personal development. We develop our management team by focusing on our internal talent, and believe that the growth of our company means there is enough potential for everyone within the company to follow their own career path. We believe that investing in our employees encourages motivation on our employees at the same time brings the complete company to a more professional stage. B&S Academy In our internal training program, the B&S Academy, new recruits are trained to become experts in their field. Through this academy, we provide a path to management positions for employees with high potential. We train our employees to identify unique sourcing opportunities and help structure tailor-made solutions to deliver to our customers within the complex environment in which we operate. The trainee programme consists of certain modules which cover subjects such as the company’s history, its corporate strategy and main policies. Practical subjects related to commercial aspects, logistics, customs affairs, IT solutions and finance are also included. Experienced employees are actively involved in giving on-the-job training. Trainings have been professionalized even further by combining theory and daily practice on a higher level, providing practical cases and interactive assignments. P a ge 2 4 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Internships We maintain close relationships with (applied) universities, high schools and teachers in the areas in which we are active, with the intention of contributing to the education of the community and sharing knowledge. Every semester a number of students participate in our internship program or undertake graduation assignments in our organisation. Topic 7: Creating synergies within our Retail business concept Teamwork and synergies between all our employees are of utmost importance. To further grow as an organisation, we need a rock-solid base. In the past year, we’ve worked closely together with our colleagues from our sister company Capi-Lux. They have become an integral part of our B&S Retail team, sharing their knowledge and supporting us on improving our Retail concept. Together, we’ve written the foundation of our Retail business concept in a strategic report. We highly value our partnership with Capi-Lux and are looking forward to working together on future projects. P a ge 2 5 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 8: Promoting a healthy lifestyle amongst employees A healthy lifestyle leads to better workplace performance. At B&S, we actively support employees’ goals of staying fit and healthy. We provide free access to a gym, and promote a range of healthy foods in our lunchrooms, including a salad bar, fresh fruit juices, fresh soups and sandwiches. Studies have shown that not only does engaging in regular physical activity raise energy levels, it also increases mental alertness and reduces workplace stress, which enhance productivity. And we believe this is a win-win situation. P a ge 2 6 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Measurement of outcomes Labour rights Company relevance Relevant for all B&S staff.

We recognise that certain resources are finite and must be used in an efficient, sustainable and responsible manner. Whenever possible, we reduce, reuse, recycle and recover to utilize resources in the most environmentally prudent manner. We continually improve our environmental performance by applying sustainable principles along our entire value chain. We recognise the importance of protecting the natural environment, and work to reduce our CO2 emissions and mitigate any negative effects from our activities, while ensuring the health and safety of our people. Assessment policy and goals We look for ways to be energy efficient by sustainably managing our procurement activities. While most of our goods are distributed by road, we continually look for the most CO2-efficient transportation method. Optimizing transportation and minimizing fuel consumption are areas that we strive to improve in. We optimise the use of technology within our warehouses, which helps us improve efficiency and lower our energy and other resource requirements, reducing our overall environmental impact. We use a range of technologies within our buildings to help cut emissions, including motiondetecting lights and energy-saving bulbs in our offices. When we make investments in our warehouses, offices and shops, we incorporate the most up-to-date standards, including looking for ways to save energy and use recycled material. P a ge 3 0 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Implementation in 2017 Topic 1. Procedure review The company reviews procedures yearly and has discussions between the Executive Board and senior managers on the effectiveness and completeness of these procedures, breaches, and incidents. Topic 2. Reducing our footprint Our company reduces its CO2 emissions, with the goal of enhancing its environmental and economic performance:  In the course of 2017 we have been gradually replacing conventional light fixtures with LED fixtures in our current premises. In our new premises (due to be operational in Q3 of 2018) only LED fixtures are used, which consume 40% less energy.  All offices and warehouse areas are equipped with light and motion sensors which automatically turn the lights on and off depending on the amount of light or movement within each section of the premises.  Our energy-efficient ventilation and climate control system which stores residual heat, reduces the need for additional heating or air-conditioning systems.  Our rooftops are fixed with a light and heat reflecting top-layer, providing the ideal temperature within our offices and warehouses. AutoStore In our warehouses in the North of the Netherlands, we expanded the automated storage system for an affiliated company. The system AutoStore is completely automated and allows us to store our products more efficiently and with reduced consumption of power and maintenance costs. Space requirements are also up to 60 percent lower and we are able to prepare orders four times faster. It has brought us new clients, who now benefit from a more advanced and reliable picking process and shorter lead times in the ordering process. At the same time, it has resulted in lower energy use and less maintenance costs. P a ge 3 1 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Optimising warehouse capacity in Dordrecht Over the years we have made various investments aiming to optimise our warehousing operations. To facilitate further growth, we have invested in a new partly automated warehouse next to our current facility in Dordrecht, The Netherlands. Equipped with the most up-to-date storage systems and state-of-the-art equipment, the warehouse reduces warehouse space requirements and allows for faster order picking and delivery compared to conventional warehouses, resulting in us being able to maintain higher sales volumes per square meter compared with conventional storage systems. Investing in information and communications technology (ICT) Focusing on the future, we are currently implementing our corporate digitisation program BiT ERP (expected to be fully operational in Q4, 2018). The system includes software systems for procurement, sales & marketing and warehousing to streamline internal operations. The system enables us to track and manage inventory levels across our platforms. Integration into the systems of our customers and suppliers offers them the possibility to track our inventory, supporting them in optimising their own inventory management by making their order placements more organised and cost-efficient. Adding to this, we are implementing our Product Information Management system (PIM), which allows us to enhance compliance with food safety and customs requirements in an online environment and anticipates the increasing demand of our customers for high-quality and up-todate product information. With the implementation of PIM, we can provide our customers 24/7 access to our product assortment – readily available to order in any desired quantity – and benefit from the cross-selling of products in this online order setting. P a ge 3 2 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress B&S Shop Fly: engagement with Eindhoven Airport Eindhoven Airport wants to be a CO2 neutral airport. The Airport Carbon Accreditation programme connects all partners of Eindhoven Airport to jointly reduce carbon emissions. Over the past years, we have initiated several activities regarding corporate social responsibility. 1. The management needs to make sure that the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme is an ongoing focus. Therefore, it is important to create awareness among the employees. This is done by using posters about waste separation, energy consumption and printing. 2. B&S Shop Fly works with food banks to ensure that surplus food, which is too close to its expiration date to be sold, is distributed to those in need. 3. The amount of freight movements has been reduced from twice a week to once a week. Topic 3. Waste management We raise awareness of waste disposal and reduction among our people, and embed this in our company culture. For example, waste paper is collected in special bins and then recycled. We also invest in digital administration systems, reducing our paper use. Adding to this, B&S works together with food banks to ensure that food items which can no longer be sold to our clients are distributed to those in need. When food items are too close to its expiration date or consists of incorrect labels, we contact the food banks, present the food items and schedule a pick-up date. Removing plastic completely in Mali Our PX shops in Mali succeeded in the implementation of a policy in MINUSMA which forbids the use of plastic bags and other non-biodegradable bags. In order to reduce the consumption of plastic, B&S Central Store removed the option of providing plastic completely in the shops. All plastic bags are replaced with re-usable woven bags, made of natural and replenishable materials. This resulted to a reduced global logistical footprint. P a ge 3 3 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Procuring beverages and soft-drinks locally in Mali In order to utilize resources in the most environmentally friendly way possible, we are procuring more products locally. Whilst reviewing and forecasting the overall logistics footprint we also decided to shift the source of some beverages and soft-drinks to local companies. Products from Coca-Cola, Bavaria beer and non-alcoholic beers are now locally sourced. As a result, we’ve balanced the procurement volumes of full containers in Europe and provided additional sourcing in Mali. Our goal is to maintain and promote local businesses in Mali. We contribute to the local economy and provide support to local companies during the period of civil unrest. Topic 4. Food safety and procurement ISO 22000 & HACCP To ensure the safety of the food supply chains of our customers, we adhere to strict food safety standards. Our ISO 22000 certification and implementation of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point System (HACCP) allow us to demonstrate to our customers around the world that we meet internationally accepted food safety standards. For product recalls, we have a strict HACCP compliant procedure in place ensuring that we are, at all times, able to trace where products have been supplied in order to be able to adequately respond to any recall request. NVWA We are subject to the supervision of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) which performs audits of our compliance with the HACCP system. In order to comply with food safety and transparency requirements, we check our compliance and safety procedures on an ongoing basis with special attention being paid to high-risk products, such as meat and poultry. The food products that enter our warehouses are subject to comprehensive quality controls and are stored in climate-controlled environments. U.S. Army Public Health Center In addition, we are approved by the U.S. Army Public Health Command which allows us to supply U.S. Army caterers. The United States Army performs an annual sanitation audit to check compliance with the HACCP and checks the required food defence policy aimed at protecting food supply against intentional adulteration, among other things. P a ge 3 4 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress To improve transparency related to our own GoodBurry products we have further improved the product information on our product packaging. The information on our product labelling fully complies with the most stringent regulations for product labelling, such as the most current 1169-2011 EU regulations and UN requirements. Addition of nutritional values;  Clear declaration of ingredients;  Better traceability through the addition of EU registration number (EU Health mark) and on seafood products the FAO fishing areas;  Better legibility through amending the label structure.

Anticorruption  Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Overview B&S has a long history with diverse activities dating back for more than a century. We are proud of our background. It has evolved over time and determines the professional organisation that we are today. The way we do business, our Corporate Code of Conduct has evolved alongside. It is a sustainable and strong pillar on which the company has earned the trust of its business partners. Whereas the Corporate Code of Conduct is firstly applicable for the company’s own staff members, we consider it important that our stakeholders follow similar good governance and business ethics. We actively promote our ethical behaviour to stakeholders, even in other languages if needed for a better understanding. Our integrity should be beyond all doubt. In view of the important social role of our company, it is imperative that all our employees comply with the legislation and regulations of the countries in which we are active and also comply with the values and standards that apply within our company and which have been laid down in this Corporate Code of Conduct. We expect our employees to show integrity and honesty in their mutual relationships and in relationships with stakeholders. We also expect integrity and reliability from our business partners, such as clients, suppliers and other business partners. The company abides by the local legislation, industry minimum standards, ILO and UN conventions and other statutory requirements. Assessment, policy and goals Our company will not cooperate in illegal transactions or transactions suspected to aim on the laundry of money. We do business based on honesty and ethical management, trust and integrity and we expect the same from everyone with whom we do business. Our company will not accept any influence in the decision making by people based on promises, gifts, bribes or kickbacks, or by any other measure that is unethical or that will tarnish our reputation for honesty and integrity. Even the appearance of such conduct shall be avoided. Gifts, favours and hospitality are to be handled with great caution. Excessive gifts and hospitality can affect our business judgment and can create expectations from third parties. As a result, the company can be embarrassed by its disclosure. Gifts, favours and hospitality may only be accepted when they are consistent with general accepted business practices and ethical standards and do not in any way violate applicable law. In accepting gifts, favours or hospitality any attempt of bribery or kickback should be avoided. P a ge 3 7 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Staff members who are engaged in procurement activities should safeguard their freedom of action to deal impartially and to avoid conflicting loyalties. Therefore, gifts, favours and hospitality of any kind which would obligate or tend to obligate the staff member must not be accepted. We expect our suppliers to respect our gift policy when doing business with us, just as we will respect the similar policies of our clients. Our company maintains a zero-tolerance attitude towards fraud. This is applicable for all our staff members but we also expect our business partners to refrain from fraud. All the divisions and business units are subject to general policies, procedures and control mechanisms to prevent and detect fraud. Reports of fraud or attempt of fraud will be seriously investigated and reported to the Executive Board, followed by appropriate sanctions, if necessary. Implementation in 2017 Topic 1. Procedure review The company reviews procedures yearly and has discussions between the Executive Board and senior managers on the effectiveness and completeness of these procedures, breaches, and incidents. Topic 2. Know Your Relations principle We comply with all relevant legislation, but we are also aware that this can change abruptly and affect our business. When such cases occur, we strive to adjust to the new rules and regulations in the best way and as far as possible while at the same time considering our own long-term interests and objectives. We select our business partners carefully and they are only accepted after extensive screening to ensure ourselves that our supply chain is transparent and not in breach with any regulations and we are not infringing any intellectual property or trademarks. If deemed necessary we rely on the services of local professional experts for designated compliance areas. Strict internal policies and guidelines have been drawn-up regarding business agreements with new suppliers and customers by means of a Know Your Relation (KYR) procedure. In order to avoid corruption, bribery, fraud and other unethical behaviour, the new relations and their Ultimate Beneficiary Owner(s) are checked with the OFAC and the EU Sanctions list. Throughout the company there is extensive knowledge of the content and impact of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Topic 3. External recruitment agency in Mali We work together with a recruitment agency in Mali to hire new talented people. Using their knowledge and experience we make sure that we are compliant with all local regulations and hire employees who fit our desired profile. All our employees are sub contracted to this agency to make sure that everything is in line with local laws in Mali. The policy is basically the same as our personnel policy that is used in the Netherlands, only partly is modified to the local conditions and circumstances. The main points of our Human Resources policy comprise of: P a ge 3 8 o f 4 0 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress  Employment is recorded by means of a contract;  Agreements are in line with local laws and regulations;  Salaries are competitive with ILO convention as a minimum; and  Each employee will receive internal training and work guidance.
