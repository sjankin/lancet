This report presents an overview of the measures and the actions we undertook over the past year to put these principles into practice.

Sincerely, Pierre Langlois Chief Executive Officer Econoler 1 United Nations Global Compact Reporting Team UNCG Communication on Progress (COP) 2 Company Profile Econoler is a consulting firm specialized in the design, implementation, evaluation and financing of energy efficiency projects and programs. The firm also has experience in renewable energy, energy performance contracting, climate change mitigation and carbon financing. In addition to its international headquarters in the City of Québec, the firm has offices in Montréal and Toronto (Canada), Tunis (Tunisia), Cotonou (Benin), Lomé (Togo), Abidjan (Côte-d’Ivoire), Mexico (Mexico), Suva (Fiji) and Hanoi (Vietnam). Econoler’s North American and European subsidiaries include: Econoler USA, Inc. (Washington, D.C.), Econoler S.A. (Sofia, Bulgaria) and IFS2E (Paris, France). Company’s Administration Structure The firm currently operates four divisions: International Projects, Canadian Operations, Program Evaluation and the Econoler Training Centre. Each department is overseen by a director reporting to the President and CEO. Econoler relies on its team of specialized staff and a worldwide network of associate consultants and partners contributing to the implementation of its projects. The firm places a special emphasis on partnering with local firms and experts. They are led by a project management team comprised of a technical director in charge of the quality of the firm’s outputs and a project manager who oversees contractual and legal obligations to both clients and subcontractors. Lastly, technical directors and project managers report to Econoler’s Director of Operations. International Experience Econoler has been operating for the past 35 years in industrialized, emerging and developing countries on more than 3,000 assignments worldwide. Most of these projects have been carried out for utilities, private firms and governments, as well as for major multilateral and bilateral organizations. 2 United Nations Global Compact Reporting Team UNCG Communication on Progress (COP) 3 Description of Practical Actions Econoler is keenly aware that properly fulfilling its corporate social responsibility (CSR) plays a major role in maintaining its standing as a leading energy-efficiency consulting firm in a rapidly growing and increasingly competitive global market. The firm wants the UNGC principles to become some of the core values driving our staff’s and our firm’s tireless pursuit of professional excellence. For this reason, Econoler joined the UN Global Compact in 2013. Over the past year, we took actions to develop a set of ethics policies setting out our positions on workplace anti-discrimination, environmental protection, anti-corruption and human rights. Our specific actions related to each major aspect are reviewed below. 3.1 Labour Econoler is committed to creating and maintaining a physically and psychologically healthy and safe work environment, where no current or prospective employee is at a disadvantage because of their age, colour, disability, gender, marital status, national or ethnic origin, race, religious belief or sexual orientation. Physical, mental and sexual harassment will automatically result in dismissal. 3 United Nations Global Compact Reporting Team UNCG Communication on Progress (COP) Ref.: 1624P 4 United Nations Global Compact Reporting Team UNCG Communication on Progress (COP) In June 2018, Econoler has adopted a new Procurement Policy and Procedures to act as a framework for the purchase of goods and consulting services. This document is aimed at (1) obtaining the best value in pricing, quality and services for the goods and services that Econoler purchases from its suppliers and (2) maintaining the highest ethical standards in dealing with its suppliers. These policy and procedures apply to Econoler’s staff, contractors and suppliers. The policy and procedures are also aligned with Econoler’s commitment to environmental responsibility, sustainable development and gender equality. The policy will enable the company to honour the following four core procurement principles: › Equality and non-discrimination: Upholding this principle will ensure that suppliers are treated fairly and equitably by providing transparent information and an impartial administrative process. › Transparency: This principle applies to public announcements about contract opportunities and rule-based decision-making that limits discretion of the procuring entity. › Integrity: Goods, works and services must be acquired without any incidence of corruption or conflict of interest. › Value for money: This principle requires obtaining suitable goods, works or services in a costeffective manner In addition to providing its staff members with a competitive healthcare insurance package, Econoler also makes many efforts to create a pleasant and supportive work environment by organizing sport activities, social gatherings and the monthly staff lunch party. Econoler guarantees an objective treatment of all decisions pertaining to the selection of local subcontractors that are purely based on experience, education and merits. Econoler does not hesitate to hire junior resources and to provide opportunities for internships. From July 2017 to July 2018, Econoler’s directors supervised a total of eight interns. 3.1.1 Goal The ultimate goal of Econoler’s labour policy is to create and maintain a safe, healthy and pleasant work environment, where every employee is treated equally to enable them to achieve their professional aspirations. This goal is not only applied to Econoler’s permanent staff, but also to the project subcontractors and partners. 3.1.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluating Econoler’s department directors access the services and inputs of its staff so as to improve their management skills and knowledge of each staff member’s professional profile. Employees can use an anonymous complaint mechanism to comment on their work relations and environment and report issues and problems. 5 United Nations Global Compact Reporting Team UNCG Communication on Progress (COP) 3.2 Envrionment As a leading international energy-efficiency and renewable-energy consulting firm, it is only natural for Econoler to make every effort to engage in and promote environmentally sustainable practices. We have adopted a green policy and incorporated concrete actions into our environment-management and daily operations and participated in a number of voluntary international environmental initiatives. In 2018, Econoler established a committee to exchange information and views about opportunities to reflect our values as a firm specialized in energy efficiency. The committee is also collecting suggestions from staff to improve the sustainability of the company’s activities. Once or twice every year, the committee will meet to share the success of our firm and help other part of the organization learn from the experiences of their colleagues. We believe that collaboration and cooperation are essential for the growth of the firm and create an important added value to our work. 3.2.1 Goal The ultimate goal of Econoler’s environmental policy is to limit the company’s carbon emissions and environmental impacts by adhering to strict environmental principles and practices. 3.2.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluation At Econoler, we closely monitor our performance in reducing carbon emissions as part of the international voluntary initiatives and communicate the results to relevant stakeholders. 3.3 Anti-Corruption Since our professional activity spans diverse national and cultural contexts around the world, including countries where the rule of law is weak, Econoler is committed to avoiding and denouncing any form of corruption and bribery. We prohibit offering, giving, solicitation or acceptance of any bribe, whether in cash or in other forms of inducement, or engaging in any other corrupt practices. Econoler strictly follows its anti-corruption principles and steers clear of any proposal that lacks transparency, particularly at the stage of project development. If any abnormal situations arise in the course of project implementation, Econoler does not hesitate to denounce them and report them to relevant authorities. The new Procurement Policy and Procedures adopted in June 2018 (as described in the Labour section) aims at fostering the company’s transparency in all its transactions for purchasing goods or consulting services. 6 United Nations Global Compact Reporting Team UNCG Communication on Progress (COP) 3.3.1 Goal The ultimate goal of Econoler’s anti-corruption policy is to ensure the moral decency, ethical integrity and legal soundness of the assignments undertaken by strictly avoiding association with any corruption or bribery practices. 3.3.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Econoler’s staff is required to report any issues and questions regarding potential abnormal situations to our Development Director, especially at the early stage of project development. When such suspicions are confirmed, the firms or actors in question are put on a black list. Econoler’s staff is well informed about our anti-corruption policy and any misconduct on their part will result in their dismissal. 3.4 Human Rights Econoler is dedicated to protect human rights in its work environment and within its work agreement with external consultants (local sub-contractors and partners). The company ensures that workers are provided with safe, suitable and sanitary work facilities. Econoler adopted a Gender Equality Policy in December 2017, which has been designed to achieve the following three main objectives: › To capitalize on its existing internal gender parity as a tool for gender mainstreaming in project development and management; › To provide a framework for developing project-based understanding of and technical capacity in gender mainstreaming; › To generate knowledge and information about the gender-energy nexus. As a firm committed to gender equality, Econoler supports the growing concern for addressing gender issues in the field of sustainable energy. Econoler’s recent and ongoing experiences show its continued commitment to gender sensitivity in its projects: In a new project undertaken with the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Econoler will lead, in collaboration with African scholars, a research assignment to discover how and which EE policy decisions help deliver energy justice and enhance economic opportunities for women in rural areas of Sub-Saharan African (SSA). 7 United Nations Global Compact Reporting Team UNCG Communication on Progress (COP) Econoler was also recently involved in Ghana, where it designed an energy efficiency (EE) strategy and action plan setting short, medium, and long-term objectives and milestones for municipal public buildings in Accra. The project is aimed at ensuring sustainable development and enhancing urban resilience and included a workshop to raise awareness about the importance of energy efficiency among local youth and particularly to foster young women’s interest in pursuing technical careers. Hopefully, the girls who attended the training will become agents of change by spreading their newly acquired knowledge among their peers. The energy sector has often been seen as gender-neutral, a perspective that is detrimental to women and girls who are left behind with respect to their specific energy needs and the economic and social opportunities arising from sustainable energy. Indeed, the issues of the “energy-poor” are often related to gender issues: access to an inadequate energy source is linked to health, economic and educational consequences. The work of international bodies from networks such as ENERGIA shows that there is sufficient evidence that addressing women’s rights and gender-equality concerns in energy is a key solution in not only enhancing women’s wellbeing but also creating a virtuous circle that improves energy efficiency and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Econoler also supports Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy, which emphasizes the critical role that women and girls have to play in environmental protection and climate action. All around the world, women are still being left out in all aspects of the energy sector, whether it is energy consumption, distribution, financing or policy-making. For example, in many countries, social norms hinder women to access loans, which is a main barrier for women entrepreneurs to finance EE or RE systems. The lack of technology literacy among women is a frequent problem in both industrialized and developing countries; as a result, women are underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). By applying a gender-equality perspective to its projects, Econoler hopes to promote greater involvement of women not only as energy consumers but also as major players throughout the value chain of sustainable energy technologies and services. 3.4.1 Goal Provide a safe, pleasant and harassment-free work environment to all employees and external consultants equally. 3.4.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluating Employees who have reason to believe to be the victim of harassment may file a complaint, verbally or in writing, with their immediate superior or the Deputy Managing Director. Any complaint will be treated in strict confidence and in the event that the accusations are found to be true, appropriate actions will be taken, as appropriate, as quickly as possible. 8 160 Saint-Paul St., Suite 200, Quebec City, QC G1K 3W1 CANADA | Tel.: +1 418 692-2592 Fax: +1 418 692-4899 www.econoler.com
