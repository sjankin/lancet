The biggest increase was seen in the customer mindset related question concerning the use of customer feedback to improve work processes. This is an especially pleasing 20 Annual review 2017 CASE Top team workshops across Cargotec Senior leadership teams have a significant impact on the performance of the business the teams are steering. Most of the LEAD population are leading top teams (i.e. teams of managers) and hence it is critical we allocate appropriate resources for making sure both the leader and the team are high-performing. To this end, we paid special focus on some 10 teams identified on the basis of our leadership data as significant opportunities for growth and impact, and facilitated rigorous intervention in support of the teams. We also trained a group of internal experts to increase our ability to deliver more such interventions in 2018. Through this, we are seeing remarkable growth in the effectiveness of these teams. CASE Compass leads to actions Based on the results of the Compass Employee Engagement survey, the managers in each business area organise feedback sessions and draw action plans with their teams. The progress of 1–3 key action points is followed throughout the year. As an example, Kalmar’s action points in 2017 focused on strategy communication and execution follow-up. The actions were divided into three areas: Continue strategy communication, Improve communications through the line and Enhance winning spirit at Kalmar. In each of these areas, concrete results were achieved. CASE Hiab’s mentoring programme enables personal growth on the job Since 2016, Hiab has carried out a mentoring programme as part of its human resources development. During the programme, mentoring pairs have shared and gained knowledge and skills, and new ways of thinking have been learned by both. The programme continues with a new set-up in 2018. During its course, it has accelerated the career development of the mentees, while, for the mentors, it has given new ways of thinking and developed their coaching skills.

The reason for the change is that during the year we implemented a new reporting system which enables us to apply generally accepted emission factors directly in the system and thus reduces the risk for reporting errors in future periods. Emission factors for indirect greenhouse gas emissions (GHG Scope 2) are from the Internal Energy Agency’s publication series “CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion” (2015, 2016, 2017). Scope 2 factors are updated every year after new version has been published.

Air emissions are locally regulated and their monitoring and quantification are based on site-specific methods. Waste data reported under G4-EN23 is based either on waste records received from waste contractors or estimations when there are no exact figures provided by the waste contractors.

Year 2017 Company Business areas Sustainability 47 Sustainability GRI content Reference and omissions 2017 G4-12 THE ORGANISATION'S SUPPLY CHAIN Cargotec appreciates long-term and localised suppliers throughout each business area. We choose our suppliers with care and on the basis of objective factors such as quality, reliability, delivery and price. Compliance with laws and regulations as well as respect for international human rights are required of each supplier. During 2017 we launched a supplier sustainability program with which we further developed our screening processes on the area of sustainability. In Kalmar, the total number of direct suppliers was around 1,100 at the end of 2017. Kalmar spend was broken down geographically as follows: 29 percent of purchases were from the Americas, 52 percent from Europe and Middle East, and 19 percent from APAC. In 2017, the top 50 suppliers represented 61 percent of the spend, and the top 100 suppliers represented 75 percent of the spend. Kalmar runs enhanced Supplier Relationship Management programmes with a few selected strategic partners to generate competitive advantages, business benefits and customer values for both Kalmar and the suppliers. Hiab had a total of 907 direct suppliers at the end of 2017, of which 38 were preferred suppliers. Focusing on these preferred suppliers enables continuous development of the supply chain management. Hiab also runs extended Supplier Relationship Management programmes together with a few selected suppliers. In 2017, the top 50 suppliers covered 51 percent and the top 100 suppliers 83 percent of the supply volume. The major share of Hiab suppliers was from Europe (82%). The rest of the suppliers were from America (14%) and Asia (4%). MacGregor has a history of more than 20 years of collaboration with particular suppliers. At the end of 2017, MacGregor had approximately 850 direct suppliers. The top 50 suppliers covered nearly 70 percent and the top 100 suppliers approximately 75 percent of the supply volume. Approximately 45 percent of the supplier volume was from Asia and 54.5 percent from EMEA and 0.5 percent from North America.

This review describes our work and sustainability focus areas, also taking into consideration the communication needs towards external stakeholders. Our strategy defines our sustainability approach and reporting principles. The reported material indicators are based on our internal KPIs, measurements, processes and policy statements. To ensure that the review is comparable with other companies and fulfils requests by external stakeholders, our current sustainability reporting framework has been influenced by peer and competitor benchmarking, as well as day-to-day work that involves analysing investor and customer requests. Our sustainability reporting has also been influenced by requests arising from Cargotec’s commitment to the UN Global Compact and other key international commitments and organisations relating to sustainability. From 2010 onwards, Cargotec’s sustainability reporting content has been approved by senior executive management representatives or the Executive Board. The reporting content of this 2017 review has been assessed by executive management representatives to evaluate its alignment with our strategy and sustainability targets, and to ensure that we report matters that are both internal priorities and of interest to our stakeholders. Although no major requirements were received from external stakeholders regarding the reporting content, we made some adjustments to further prioritise the material issues and ease comparisons in later reporting.

Our ongoing dialogue and collaboration with different stakeholders enable us to identify opportunities to create value for our customers and shareholders and provide input for setting our sustainability targets. Integrity, fairness, confidentiality and compliance with stock exchange rules guide all our communications. G4-26 APPROACH TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT s. 22–37 Business areas Stakeholder group Examples of stakeholder interaction Customers Our business areas gather customer feedback regularly and engage in active dialogue with customers through direct meetings, marketing, extranet, newsletters and social media, for example. Personnel Our Human Resources Information System ZONE and the People Portal section on our intranet serve as platforms for distributing people processes. We periodically conduct structured surveys with our employees, such as our employee satisfaction survey Compass, and arrange co-operational group meetings, target and performance discussions as well as personnel info and team meetings. See the results of Compass 2017 on page 20. Investors Cargotec’s Investor Relations aims to ensure that all market participants have correct and sufficient information at all times to support a fair valuation of Cargotec’s share. In addition to executing financial communication and proceeding investor requests, Investor Relations organised several events and meetings in 2017. Examples include the Capital Markets Day in London and roadshows in 15 countries. The AGM was held in Helsinki on 21 March 2017. Local Cargotec’s sites are actively involved in local stakeholder engagement and goodwill. Traditionally, we engage in charity communities action especially during the holiday season. In 2017, our site in Stargard Poland organised a gift raising campaign for the local orphanage, and employees from the Helsinki HQ inspired Cargotec to support the Finnish childhood cancer organisation Sylva ry via the Team Rynkeby cycling team. In addition, Kalmar arranged an interactive donation campaign by inviting its stakeholders to load a virtual containership, with every additional virtual container increasing the donation sum paid to UNICEF. Also Hiab made a donation to UNICEF during the holiday season. Authorities With our own operations located in 45 countries, we engage with local authorities to ensure regulatory compliance in our operations. Suppliers We run extended supplier relationship management programmes with selected suppliers to create joint value for our own and our suppliers’ business. Research and Cargotec frequently collaborates with universities and other research institutions over the world. For example, in 2017, education MacGregor started a joined research project with the Hamburg Univesity of Technology develop a solution for the institutions maintenance and service of ships with augmented reality. Media Cargotec arranges press meetings in connection with trade events and result publications, among others. We issue dozens of press releases every year covering a wide array of topics. In 2017 we launched a new company web site at www.cargotec.com. 50 Annual review 2017 GRI content Reference and omissions 2017 G4-27 RESPONSE TO KEY TOPICS AND CONCERNS RAISED Our interaction with employees builds a foundation for both innovations and a committed workforce. Structured methods of gathering employee feedback include our employee engagement survey Compass. In 2017, Compass received a response rate of 86 (2016: 88) percent. According to the results, our people take pride in the work they do and evaluate both our team collaboration and team performance positively. The biggest increase was seen in the customer mindset related question concerning the use of customer feedback to improve work processes. Despite the positive feedback, we have also identified improvement areas. The results show that we need to concentrate on being clear enough when communicating direction and on creating confidence for the future. Further investments in development and training are also needed. In 2017, we announced plans to consolidate our support services under Cargotec Business Services (CBS) to harmonise global processes across functions, business units and regions. The CBS, operating out of Sofia, Bulgaria, was launched in October with a pilot to serve Finance, HR, IM and Indirect procurement services in Finland. To support a smooth transition in the pilot country, we offered retention packages according to good practice, including extended notice periods and stay-on incentives as well as outplacement services to support re-employment in case of redundancy. Other possible solutions included internal transfers, early retirements, changes in work duties and reporting lines as well as the possibility for some positions to be relocated and job rotation for the remaining employees. In November, we announced plans for a global rollout of the CBS concept with the long term goal to expand the service offering as well as apply new technologies like automation in processes. The future service model requires developing new skills and roles in various functions to facilitate effective collaboration. We plan to offer all employees training and change management support for the new way of working.

Our product range is wide, and there are currently no generally accepted industrial standards for evaluating the environmental impacts of our products or services. It is not possible to have one evaluation methodology or same parameters to evaluate all products or services, which is why we have developed evaluation methodologies and related parameters for individual products and services, when required by customers, regulation or other market development need. We do not publish calculation methodologies or detailed information about the technical achievements due to business confidentiality. The products listed under this GRI indicator are those that have been launched or standardised during the 2017 reporting period. These new products are not necessarily included in our Offering for eco-efficiency concept yet, because the fulfilment of the eco-efficiency criteria is checked by an independent external auditor to ensure the reliability of our eco-efficiency portfolio. More information about our eco-efficient offering can be found on page 40 of this Annual review or on our company websites at www.cargotec.com, www.kalmarglobal.com, www.hiab.com and www.macgregor.com. See also G4-EN27 for other products mitigating environmental impacts. Kalmar • The Kalmar Light Forklift range was updated from F series to G series. To help customers save costs and meet their environmental targets, the DCG50-90 range uses AGCO 44AWF Stage 4 engines to reduce fuel consumption by 15 percent and NOX emissions by 89 percent when compared to Stage 3 engines. DCG forklifts can also be used in Kalmar’s proprietary Eco mode, which provides 15 percent less fuel consumption when compared to normal operation mode. The new forklift also has improved productivity by 10 percent compared to the previous generation – meaning that operators will be able to perform 100 more lifts per week on average.

Scope 1 GHG emissions decreased by 14 percent and Scope 2 emissions by 11 percent. The reduction in total GHG emissions was 12 percent compared to 2016. The main contributors to the reductions achieved were savings in natural gas and electricity use at Cargotec sites as well as the decreasing trend in country-specific emission factors and changes in the reporting boundary. G4-EN18 GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS INTENSITY Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions intensity 2017 2016 2015 GHG emissions intensity index 83 86 88 The GHG emissions intensity is based on the ratio of total energy consumption and sales by sites included in the reporting boundary. The base year is 2014, where the index value is 100. In 2017, the GHG emissions intensity decreased by four percent compared to 2016 and by 18 percent compared to base year 2014. The intensity reductions are mostly accounted to savings in electricity and natural gas use, the decreasing carbon intensity of country-specific emission factors and changes in the reporting boundary. 54 Annual review 2017 GRI content Reference and omissions 2017 G4-EN21 NOX, SOX AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT AIR EMISSIONS Weight of emissions, t 2017 2016 2015 Nitrogen oxides (NOX) 2.4 2.3 2.2 Particulate matter (PM) 0.9 2.0 1.3 Sulphur oxides (SOX) 0.4 0.4 0.2 Volatile organic compounds (VOC) 70.9 66.1 54.7 EFFLUENTS AND WASTE G4-EN23 TOTAL WEIGHT OF WASTE BY TYPE AND DISPOSAL METHOD Weight of waste, t 2017 2016 2015 Hazardous waste 600 600 500 Non-hazardous waste 10,500 10,000 8,900 of which recycled 9,400 8,700 7,800 Total 11,100 10,700 9,400 Over 70 percent of the waste generated at Cargotec sites is metal, aluminum and wood waste, which have high recycling value G4-EN24 TOTAL NUMBER AND VOLUME OF SIGNIFICANT SPILLS No significant spills have occurred during the reporting period. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES G4-EN27 EXTENT OF IMPACT MITIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES The following products, product components or services introduced during 2017 may decrease the environmental impacts of our products and services. A wider selection of products and services that help to mitigate environmental burden are presented in Cargotec’s Offering for eco-efficiency concept (more information on page 40 or at cargotec.com/sustainability). Cargotec has an external audit process in place to guarantee the reliability and transparency of the eco-efficiency offering, and the efforts listed under this GRI indicator may not necessarily be included to the offering concept yet. The audit is conducted once in a year. Hiab • Hiab presented the world’s first fully-electric powered skiploader concept vehicle. The electric MULTILIFT Futura was developed in partnership with EMOSS. The vehicle is silent and reduces local NOX emissions by 100 percent compared to similar diese-powered vehicle, thus being ideal especially for urban environments and out-of-hours operations. It also helps customers to decrease their CO2 emissions when compared to diesel powered skiploaders. • Hiab launched a new service offering, HiConnectTM , which adds connectivity to load handling equipment, thus enabling fleet owners to receive real-time information of their Hiab equipment’s operation and condition, optimise the performance of their equipment and avoid unnecessary downtime. MacGregor • MacGregor opened a new facility in Norway specialising in advanced virtual reality training to improve the safety, efficiency and cost-effective deployment of our equipment. Kalmar • Kalmar launched a fully electric mid-range forklift truck. Compared to a diesel powered forklift truck, the electric truck decreases NOX and other local air emissions by 100 percent. Also CO2 emissions may potentially be decreased by as much as 100 percent.Kalmar is the first leading equipment manufacturer providing electric trucks in this capacity class. • Kalmar launched a Rail Mounted Gantry (RMG) crane. The crane has an electric drive unit and sources power through either a cable reel or conductor bar, thus generating zero emissions at source. RMG cranes can be either manually, remotely or automatically operated. Manually operated cranes can also be retrofitted in the future to be remote controlled or automated when the customers’ operations change.

In 2017, 79 percent of new direct material suppliers were audited against the labour practice, human rights and environmental management criteria. ENVIRONMENTAL GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS G4-EN34 NUMBER OF GRIEVANCES ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FILED, ADDRESSED, AND RESOLVED THROUGH FORMAL GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS During 2017, 57 cases of potential misconduct were reported to the ethics and compliance team either through the anynomous SpeakUp Line or by direct reporting to the Ethics and Compliance organisation. During the year we saw an increasing trend in the cases reported directly by management which is a positive result arising from increased awareness and training campaigns. Investigation was started for all cases reported during 2017, and 32 cases were resolved during the year. Additionally, 33 cases from previous years were resolved. A majority of the cases reported during 2017 were related to unethical business conduct, such as conflict of interest, fraud, corruption or policy violations. Other cases related to employee related issues, such as harassment, discrimination or labour rights. One reported case was related to suspected human rights violations by a third party. No grievances related to the environment were filed in 2017. As part of the investigation process, the Ethics and Compliance team agrees with relevant management on remedial actions, such as improved policies, trainings and disciplinary actions. The final decision on disciplinary actions is made by the Code of Conduct panel which consists of the Extended Executive Board (EEB). 56 Annual review 2017 GRI content Reference and omissions 2017 SOCIAL EMPLOYMENT G4-LA1 TOTAL NUMBER AND RATES OF NEW EMPLOYEE HIRES AND EMPLOYEE TURNOVER BY AGE GROUP, GENDER AND REGION Number of Rate of new employee hires and employee turnover employees % New employee hires 1,008 10 Employee turnover 1,330 14 Voluntary turnover 790 8 Number of New employee hires by gender, age group and region employees % of total New hire rate % By gender Male 800 79 10 Female 208 21 12 By age group Under 30 years old 273 27 25 30–50 years old 596 59 10 Over 50 years old 139 14 5 By region AMER 266 26 17 APAC 133 13 7 EMEA 609 60 10 Number of Employee turnover by gender, age group and region employees % of total Turnover rate % By gender Male 1,085 82 13 Female 245 18 14 By age group Under 30 years old 239 18 22 30–50 years old 735 55 12 Over 50 years old 356 27 13 By region AMER 336 25 21 APAC 343 26 17 EMEA 651 49 10 The information about new hires and employee turnover includes only permanent employees. The rate of new employee hires is the number of new hires divided by the number of all permanent employees at the end of 2017. New hire rates within the employee breakdown categories are calculated by dividing the new hires within the category by the total number of permanent employees within the breakdown category. For example, the new hire rate for female employees is the number of new female hires divided by the number of all permanent female employees at the end of 2017. Turnover rates are calculated on similar basis as new hire rates.

Fully aligned with Cargotec’s own Code of Conduct, Cargotec has a specific supplier Code of Conduct, which has been delivered to strategic suppliers during 2017. The process continues in 2018. Freedom of association, abolition of child labour and forced and compulsory labour are examples of the basic principles Cargotec demands from its suppliers. Cargotec conducted a supplier sustainability risk analysis during 2016. Human rights were included in the risk analysis as one perspective. The risk for human rights violation is increased in our supply chain in certain countries. The supplier code of conduct process is part of Cargotec’s supplier sustainability management program, with which Cargotec aims to mitigate any risks for breaching the international human rights. During 2018, one of Cargotec´s sustainability targets is focusing on supplier sustainability. We aim to further screen the human rights and other sustainability risks in our supply chain with a sustainability self-assessment tool. Additionally, we will renew the human rights risk assessment of our operations during 2018. Please see Cargotec sustainability targets on page 41.
