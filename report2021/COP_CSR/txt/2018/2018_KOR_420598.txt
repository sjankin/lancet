For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (“CGUs”). A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are (i) Intangible assets largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The value in use is estimated by applying a pre-tax discount rate that reflect current market assessments of the Intangible assets are measured initially at cost and, subsequently, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU for which estimated future cash flows have not been adjusted, to the estimated future losses. cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or CGU. Amortization of intangible assets except for goodwill is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in date that they are available for use. The residual value of intangible assets is zero. However, as there are no foreseeable limits to the periods over which profit or loss. club memberships are expected to be available for use, this intangible asset is determined as having indefinite useful lives and not amortized. The estimated useful lives of the Group’s assets are as follows: (m) Leases Useful lives (years) The Group classifies and accounts for leases as either a finance or operating lease, depending on the terms.

If the market for a financial instrument is not active, the Group establishes fair value by of the lease. Any initial direct costs are added to the amount recognized as an asset. using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques include using recent arm's length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to as reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. If each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Contingent rents are there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable charged as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, the Group uses that technique. Periodically, the Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests it for validity using prices from any observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on any available observable market data. The depreciable amount of a leased asset is allocated to each accounting period during the period of expected use on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy the lessee adopts for depreciable assets that are owned. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. The Group reviews to determine whether analytical techniques. the leased asset may be impaired. (ii) Classification and level of disclosure for fair value (ii) Operating leases K-IFRS No. 1107 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires the Group to classify its financial instruments held at fair value according to a hierarchy Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under that reflects the significance of observable market inputs. The classification of a financial instrument is based on the lowest level input that is significant operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below. Level Description (iii) Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease Level 1 Financial instruments are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market. Determining whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease shall be based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets (the asset) and the arrangement conveys a right to use If there are no quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets, financial instruments classified as Level 2 have been valued Level 2 the asset. using models whose inputs are observable in an active market. At inception or reassessment of the arrangement, the Group separates payments and other consideration required by such an arrangement into those Financial instruments are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If the Group concludes for a financial lease that it is impracticable Level 3 observable market data (unobservable inputs). to separate the payments reliably, the Group recognizes an asset and a liability at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset that was identified as the subject of the lease. Subsequently, the liability shall be reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance charge on the liability recognized using the purchaser's incremental borrowing rate of interest. (iii) Determination of fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value Deposits, loans and receivables (n) Non-current assets held for sale The estimated fair values of money market deposits and deposits with a residual maturity of less than 6 months are the carrying amounts. The estimatNon-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through ed fair values of deposits, loans and receivables which are not impaired are the present value of contractual cash flows discounted at current market continuing use, are classified as held for sale. In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate rates by factoring in the default rates and credit spreads. The estimated fair values of individually assessed impaired deposits, loans and receivable are sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. The assets or disposal group that are classified as non-current assets held for sale the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. The estimated fair values of collectively assessed are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. impaired deposits, loans and receivables are the carrying amounts less allowances for loan losses. The Group recognizes an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write-down of an asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell, and a gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, up to the cumulative impairment loss previously recognized in accordance with K-IFRS Held-to-maturity financial assets No. 1036 ‘Impairment of Assets’. The fair values are the quoted prices in the market or fair values evaluated by a credible evaluator. If there is no such information, their fair values are A non-current asset that is classified as held for sale or part of a disposal group classified as held for sale is not depreciated (or amortized). estimated by using observable market prices of financial assets with similar credit level, maturity and profit rate. (o) Non-derivative financial liabilities Depository liabilities The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities in accordance The carrying amounts of non-interest bearing deposits and deposits with no stated maturity or a residual maturity less than 6 months are assumed to with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of financial liabilities. The Group recognizes financial liabilities in the consolidated be fair values. The estimated fair value of an interest bearing deposit is the present value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rate (market statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial liability. rate) of a recently issued deposit with the similar maturity.

(ii) Other financial liabilities (q) Employee benefits Non-derivative financial liabilities other than financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are classified as other financial liabilities. At the date (i) Short-term employee benefits of initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at fair value minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition. SubShort-term employee benefits are employee benefits that are due to be settled within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees sequent to initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. render the related service.

If the contribution already paid exceeds the are translated into the presentation currency using the following methods: contribution due for service before the end of the reporting period, the Group recognizes that excess as an asset (prepaid expense) to the extent that The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, whose functional currency is not the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, are translated to prethe prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund. sentation currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to functional currency at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. (iv) Retirement benefits: defined benefit plans When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in the translation is transferred to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the relevant proportion of such cumulative amount is reattributed to non-conemployees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. trolling interest. In any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the relevant proportion is reclassified to profit or loss. The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which in substance is considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation, refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to are recognized in other comprehensive income in the translation reserve. any applicable minimum funding requirements. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the (t) Equity capital effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized immediately in OCI. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares and share options are recognized as net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the ana deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. nual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss. When the Group repurchases its share capital, the amount of the consideration paid is recognized as a deduction from equity and classified as treasury shares. The profits or losses from the purchase, disposal, reissue, or retirement of treasury shares are not recognized as current profit or loss. If the When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on Group acquires and retains treasury shares, the consideration paid or received is directly recognized in equity. curtailment is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The Group recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. (u) Share-based payment transactions (v) Termination benefits The Group has granted shares or share options to its employees and other parties. For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the Group measures the goods or services acquired and the liability incurred at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the Group remeasures Termination benefits are recognized as an expense when the Group is committed demonstrably, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal the fair value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period. detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognized as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable more (v) Finance income and finance costs than 12 months after the reporting period, then they are discounted to their present value. (i) Interest Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly (r) Provisions discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or liability (or, where appropriate, a shorter Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of period) to the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit losses. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate of a provision. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. TransWhere the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined at the present value of the expected future cash flows. action costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability. Where some or all of the expenditures required to settle a provision are expected to be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement shall be recognized when, and only when, it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the entity settles the obligation. The reimbursement shall be (ii) Fees and commission treated as a separate asset.
