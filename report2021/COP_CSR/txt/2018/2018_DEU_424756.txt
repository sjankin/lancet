Liberia: Buildup of urological expertise III. Kenya and Senegal: Biomedical engineers for Sub-Saharan Africa Background The challenge: Lack of skilled personnel in biomedical engineering Following the devastating 2014-2015 West African Ebola outbreak, Liberia sought to rebuild its health In a world where over a billion people have insufficient access to healthcare provisions, Sub-Saharan system and increase health professional capacity across the country. With respect to developing a Africa is one of the most disadvantaged regions in this respect. This is caused in significant part by a lack sustainable medical education system Liberia was especially interested in qualified clinical faculty members of skilled personnel and a lack of funding. As the population grows and life expectancy increases, new to support the teaching of resident practitioners in the nation’s nascent residency programmes. Amongst challenges are emerging, such as the greater incidence of non-communicable diseases. these was urology. National plans for healthcare development in Kenya and Senegal aim, among other objectives, to enhance infrastructure and equipment in their health sectors. Such equipment requires the services of biomedical engineers, whose job is to take care of and maintain medical products and surgical instruments, build Support and modify equipment for patients’ use, and manage clinical equipment deployed in hospitals. There is However, with no urological instrumentation in the entire country of Liberia, KARL STORZ was approached considerable demand for biomedical engineers in public and private hospitals, in smaller health centres by the Director of Global Surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York (USA) following which a set of and among the suppliers and distributors of medical equipment. In a 2015 survey of global biomedical urological instrumentation was provided to the JF Kennedy Medical Centre in Monrovia, the only academic engineering resources, however, the World Health Organisation (WHO) found there were just 23 biomedical referral hospital in Liberia. The equipment has been in regular use under Dr. Bashir Yunusa, a urologist engineers in Senegal. Kenya, meanwhile, already has a basis for biomedical engineering as a career, with a working at the JF Kennedy Medical Centre. Visiting urologists are now able to treat numerous patients who professional association and a study program offered in one university. have been waiting to remedy their urological conditions. In addition, the equipment has allowed visiting However, the teaching is theoretical, technologically outdated and there is still a huge shortfall in the urologists to teach the next generation of surgeons in urological technique and management. number of people qualified to do this important work. If medical equipment is not maintained or operated properly, it can harm patients, reduce recovery speeds and even put lives at risk. With heavy reliance on outside expertise, repair times are long. The solution: A strategic alliance driving the increase of applied biomedical engineering capacities As part of Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) develoPPP.de program, the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) has formed a strategic alliance with five global leaders in the manufacture of healthcare products and services: B. Braun (Melsungen), Drägerwerk (Lübeck), KARL STORZ (Tuttlingen), Siemens Healthineers (Erlangen) and Sysmex (Norderstedt). The partners are working together to develop a bachelor degree course in biomedical engineering for Kenya and Senegal and to equip the involved institutions to enable practically oriented education. The strategic alliance also includes Education & Health Ministries and a number of universities as well as hospitals in the partner countries, and FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences in Germany has been asked to provide educational expertise in this field. The approach: A three year collaboration project with academic and medical partners The strategic alliance aims to increase the supply of qualified biomedical engineers in Kenya and Senegal by introducing a practical and market-oriented bachelor degree in applied biomedical engineering. The project has started with an analysis of the underlying conditions in both countries for the introduction of the degree course. Based on proposals for the teaching content being developed by the FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences, the strategic alliance will identify institutional needs in the partner countries, such as the affiliation of universities with teaching hospitals, and establish appropriate structures and partnerships between relevant parties to overcome any gaps that exist. In collaboration with the academic and medical Dr. Yunusa treating urological conditions with the donated KARL STORZ equipment partner institutions, the alliance partners will equip them with the medical devices they need, and train lecturers and other personnel to operate the equipment and to train others in its use. A range of knowhow transfer and networking activities will also take place to further build the capacities of the selected training institutions. Once the preconditions are in place in each country, the bachelor programs can be introduced and implemented. The objectives and content of each country’s course will be determined by local training and governmental institutions in cooperation with the FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences. The courses will include basic theoretical content as well as practical learning approaches such as student lessons in training labs and hospitals. Students will acquire basic academic knowledge of subjects like mathematics, 14 15 anatomy and physics, as well as management skills and specialized practical competences in areas such as hygiene and disinfection, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and measuring and control technologies. They will also develop the relevant technical knowhow for working with the modern high-tech equipment. On graduating, they will be qualified to work as technicians in public health facilities, as well as trainers, consultants or commercial representatives in a broad array of positions across the health sector. The partners will ensure the sustainability of the course by assisting in accreditation processes, ensuring an integral approach and long-term financing strategy in collaboration with the local partner institutions and establishing links to the labor market for the resulting qualification. Expected health sector impacts and results • Capacities for practical, market-oriented biomedical engineering are improved in Kenya and Senegal. • By the end of the project, partner institutions are in the position to offer applied biomedical engineering programs with qualified staff in Kenya and Senegal. • Transfer of technology, technical knowhow and experiences to Kenya and Senegal. • The project is also expected to have a number of longer-term health and development impacts, such as improving people’s access to effective diagnosis and treatment in the partner countries and encouraging well qualified people to remain in their home country where they can contribute to better healthcare standards.

Congratulations to the 2018 AGA-ENT – KARL STORZ Fellowship Award Winners: Work in Moshi, Tanzania, in August 2018 Mr. Andrew Lau Surgical training and the provision of surgical care in Moshi, Tanzania, was greatly enhanced through a (NIHR Academic Clinical Fellow in ENT, Mersey sector, HEE North West; Final year PhD student in Surgery & donation of ENT equipment earlier this year. Prof. David Howard, a Founding Member of AGA-ENT, has Oncology, University of Liverpool) been teaching in Moshi, Tanzania for years and greatly facilitated AGA-ENT’s efforts in Tanzania. A new set of esophagoscopes and equipment for foreign body removal was brought to the Kilimanjaro Christian Mr. Saleh Okhovat Medical Centre (KCMC) by Mr. Matt Lechner (Royal London Hospital/UCL Cancer Institute) and Prof. David (Year 6 Specialty Trainee, Glasgow, West of Scotland) Howard (Imperial College London) in August 2018. The KCMC is an approximately 400-bedded hospital with an estimated catchment population of 15 million people. Any global health interventions here therefore make a palpable impact on health equality in Tanzania. The ENT unit comprises three consultants, one staff registrar, half a dozen residents and some rotating interns. There has been support from Professors David Howard, Gayle Woodson and Tom Robbins who visit a few times a year, and who have been doing so for many years. The local ENT consultants are towards the early part of their consultant careers, and are among only fifteen in the entire country. They are now beginning to develop the unit’s ability to deliver services such as audiology and speech and language therapy. In this area foreign body ingestion requiring surgical removal is very common and the team did not have the appropriate equipment to deal with this before. The visit in August and the donation of the equipment greatly facilitated the training of the local surgical team and the overall surgical care in this area. 18 19 Work in Moshi, Tanzania, in November 2018 Mr. Andrew Lau (NIHR Academic Clinical Fellow in ENT, Mersey sector, HEE North West; Final year PhD student in Surgery & Oncology, University of Liverpool) was awarded one of the two inaugural AGA-ENT – KARL STORZ Fellowships. Together with Prof. David Howard he travelled to Moshi, Tanzania, in November 2018, and provided further training to the local ENT team at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), using the previously donated equipment and further equipment (acknowledgement to Mr. Issa Beegun for his help and support). The provision of good quality esophagoscopy equipment by the company KARL STORZ, including sturdy, appropriate-sized forceps has made a significant difference to foreign body removal at KCMC, as seen in the below images. Further training has been provided, ensuring the sustainability of the donation.

Patients are seen in a busy outpatient clinic and referred donated equipment for either oncological treatment or surgical management. Mr. Okhovat has established regular simulation training sessions and hopes to return there in 2019. Mr. Okhovat showed that the equipment is being used extremely effectively in diagnosis and management of ENT patients on a daily basis. Images are recorded, documented and stored securely for future follow up and surveillance. The faculty receives a resident and medical students on ENT rotation. Patients who are diagnosed with NPC, are referred to Yogyakarta for treatment and further management. RSUD Wonosari, ENT Department Wonosari Hospital ENT department is a level 3 unit led by Dr Ima (Head of ENT Surgery). KARL STORZ and AGA-ENT have provided the department with endoscopic equipment and a camera system which were brought there by Mr. Matt Lechner in 2016 and 2017. These have been used effectively for the early detection of nasopharyngeal cancer and other head and neck cancers. Strong efforts have been made to engage with local general practitioners in order to improve the head and neck cancer referral pathway. It is evident that the donated equipment has helped the ENT department at this busy district general hospital enormously.

China: Five-Year Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) Training Project KARL STORZ formed a five-year strategic collaboration agreement with Renji Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. KARL STORZ will provide equipment and knowledge support to build the Training Center into a world-class MIS training and academic center. KARL STORZ participated in the blueprint design and construction together with Renji Hospital at the early stage of the Training Center to make sure the facility is equipped with advanced hospital design concepts. With over 2,000 m2, the Training Center is composed of MIS Training, Nursing Training and Simulation Practice sections. It also has one fully equipped and accredited dry lab that meets the criteria of conducting complex surgical operations. The Training Center will start to provide MIS training programs across multiple disciplines, covering head to toe. Helping Chinese MIS surgeons to master minimally invasive surgical skills with standardized operation procedures and professional operation requirements, KARL STORZ China has helped to build many MIS training centers around the country in collaboration with local hospitals. The Renji Hospital Training Center Mr. WeiPing Li, President of Renji Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and Mrs. Mei Yang-Mille, is expected to provide Chinese MIS surgeons with direct access to international academic scholars and Managing Director of KARL STORZ China at the Strategic Agreement Signing Ceremony (September 2018) academic exchange programs, so that MIS surgical skills in China can be elevated to a higher level and more innovative surgical treatments can be developed by Chinese surgeons. The Training Center also takes on the mission of promoting MIS clinical research and creating innovative new products and new technology applications in MIS, working together with Chinese surgeons. KARL STORZ and Renji Hospital Training Center believe that indigenous innovation in MIS is the foundation for progress in treatment and cure. NMU Training Center is the fifth training base that KARL STORZ supported in China. Previously, KARL STORZ cooperated with Qingdao University Affiliated Hospital in Northeast China to build its first MIS training center. KARL STORZ also supported Guangzhou Zhongshan Hospital, Hong Kong University Shenzhen Hospital and Ningxia Medical University (NMU) to establish their training centers. All centers have become important pillars of regional MIS development. Chinese surgeons attending training classes at the center (September 2018) 24 25 VII. Brazil: Supporting medical care in rural regions Together with the local dealer, KARL STORZ supported this activity again in 2018 by providing the following: • Supply of endoscopic equipment and instruments Together with our Brazilian distributor H. Strattner, KARL STORZ has been supporting the project “EC FMUSP – Expedição Cirúrgica da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo” (Surgical • Prior training of program participants on the handling of devices and instruments in the KARL STORZ Expedition of the Medical School of the University of São Paulo) since 2013 (former project name: showroom in São Paulo “Bandeira Científica”). This innovative project was designed by medical students in collaboration with • Funding of transport costs for the necessary medical devices physicians from HC FMUSP (Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo) and the Cleveland Clinic. The main objective is to contribute to the social, academic and professional • Local support through dealer and KARL STORZ’s personnel development of the university students through actions which are designed to improve the health conditions in remote and vulnerable places in Brazil. In a country with extreme socioeconomic inequalities like Brazil, EC FMUSP aims at objective improvements in the present, by providing clinical care, imaging and minimally invasive surgeries to deprived populations and by the development of a critical awareness and technical learning for future doctors. The project combines aspects of medical training, research and free medical care as well as the establishment of medical structures in remote regions. In the project, the medical students have contact with each stage of the process, starting from project planning over scientific assistance to medical care. The project consists of three pillars: Assistance, Education and Research. With regard to assistance, the project is designed to address part of the surgical demand in the poor areas, perform complete gynecological, digestive and ultrasound examinations and realize educational activities for the population. Furthermore, it brings minimally invasive technology to places where it has not been present so far, including local continuity plans. Finally, the project proposes management measures at the hospital, municipal and state levels to improve the situation. In relation to education, the project brings the undergraduate student in contact with a different reality from that seen in tertiary hospitals in big cities. It integrates the student in each stage of the surgical process, so that they experience the surgical procedure in a global and longitudinal manner, from admission to hospital discharge and it provides technical learning of surgeries and diseases, in radiology and ultrasound. The student is also encouraged to develop a critical spirit and social awareness as well as forming links with local universities, in order to maintain the exchange of experiences even after the end of the project. Students of the renowned Brazilian Medical School (FMUSP) (July 2018) In the research area, the project includes the collection of detailed epidemiological data for further analysis and academic publication and it returns the results to the municipality. In addition, the project promotes the application of previously developed projects related to surgery and it is designed to motivate graduates to better understand the area of academic research. Currently, about 50 students and physicians of the renowned Brazilian Medical School (FMUSP) and Cleveland Clinic are involved in the project. Since 2013, the EC FMUSP activities have been carried out in various remote regions. This year, the main activity was realized between July 1 and 8, 2018 and the EC FMUSP went back to the city of the first initiative (COXIM, Mato Grosso do Sul). The objective was to observe the effects of this initiative in the long term in addition to obtaining feedback for constant improvement. In general, the advances in healthcare made by the city of Coxim since then, especially in women’s health issues, were clearly perceptive. Whereas in 2013 there were no MIS at all, the city has now become a local hub of minimally invasive surgeries. During the July 2018 observation, 63 minimally invasive surgeries (gynecological and digestive procedures) and 404 ultrasound examinations were performed. In addition, a symposium on nursing in surgery with 216 registered participants was held as well as a course on minimally invasive surgery for local staff. The project thereby contributes to improving medical care in Brazil’s rural areas, spreading minimally invasive techniques, and providing training in the handling of endoscopic instruments and devices.

Sybill Storz Managing Director of KARL STORZ SE & Co. KG “The young participants of “Jugend forscht” venture on their projects with impressive and exemplary enthusiasm. Therefore, it is a great pleasure for us, and for me personally, to support young researchers in making the leap into the world of research. We are very happy to experience the talents of students and apprentices, to see how they implemented their ideas, and to learn about their research results.” (February 2018) Michael Beck Mayor of Tuttlingen “Young people who shape their own future, whose heads are full of ideas, define and are essential for our society. The people of Tuttlingen have for many years benefited from the inventive spirit of the many founders of medical technology companies in our region, and we are therefore more than happy to be able to host youth science competitions such as “Jugend forscht” and “Schüler experimentieren.” (February 2018) School meets medical technology As part of the “School meets medical technology” event in July 2018, some 80 students of the OttoHahn-Gymnasium secondary school in Tuttlingen met at the KARL STORZ Training Centre to learn about the world of medicine and the great variety of apprenticeships and degree programs offered at the family company. At the hands-on stations, students could get an idea of how physicians use the endoscopic instruments for diagnosis and treatment (June 2018) After a brief welcome and two presentations from New Applications and Research & Technology on varied application options of fluorescent imaging and current endoscopy trends, the students had the opportunity to find out about the wide range of career options available at KARL STORZ. Following the presentations, all 11th graders rotated through the four stations awaiting them: A company tour through the KARL STORZ Visitor Centre was followed by a hands-on workshop with medical virtual reality simulators. After a brief orientation, the students were able to try out the training systems and practice their hand-eye coordination in a highly realistic simulation environment. At other hands-on stations of various medical specialty areas, the students could actively try out original surgical instruments. Students learned about the advantages of virtual training for the reliable identification and elimination of foreign bodies (June 2018) 40 41 A motivational trailer was used to contact the schools of the counties Rottweil, Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, Supporting the MINTec Camp Medical Technology and Tuttlingen, and invite them to participate in the competition. Classes may still apply with their project ideas through January 2019. As part of its membership of the national excellence cluster of MINT schools (MINTec), the Gymnasium Spaichingen secondary school held the first “MINTec Camp” in southern Baden-Württemberg in September 2018; these camps offer students the opportunity to discover a specific MINT topic. Motivational trailer The 4-day “Medical Technology” camp allowed 20 interested senior secondary school students from Film teaser [only available in German] at: http://go.karlstorz.com/gc-2018-de-1 throughout Germany to gain a variety of insights into specialty areas as well as qualification, training, and career options in this area. Available via QR code (please scan): As a member of the industrial sponsor club of Gymnasium Spaichingen, KARL STORZ supported the project with a financial donation and organized a one-day event to help students gain a variety of practice-oriented insights into medical technology. The students were divided into two groups and learned about the company portfolio and career perspectives at KARL STORZ; after that, they had the opportunity to try out physician endoscopy training on medical virtual reality simulators. School project with the Wild Wings team For the fifth year in a row, KARL STORZ has implemented school partnership projects “Strong Together” in collaboration with the local ice hockey club Schwenninger Wild Wings. Whereas in the past, school classes and groups of students were invited to apply with social projects, this year’s focus was on “Exercise & Sports.” As part of this year’s competition, students were asked to think about how they could create opportunities for themselves or others to get more exercise or play more sports in everyday life. Participating is very easy and well worth it: KARL STORZ provides the three student teams that present the three best project ideas with up to €1,500 in funding for implementing these ideas. To end up in the top three, it is a good idea to combine a creative application with a strong project idea and a clearly defined goal, that is, to state how the project manages to integrate exercise and sports into daily life. In addition, KARL STORZ and the Schwenninger Wild Wings support the three winning projects in the organizational implementation of their projects.

Support of education and apprenticeship training Following up on our previous Progress Reports, we want to highlight our efforts in the area of education and apprenticeship training. The preservation of proven structures and concepts and the initiation of new projects demonstrates the great commitment of KARL STORZ to the field of apprenticeship training. Training and university studies at KARL STORZ Employees are a company’s most important resource. Therefore, KARL STORZ places great value on young people receiving a solid education today, as they are tomorrow’s qualified employees. In 2018, we hired 43 trainees and 17 university students who are enrolled in a practice-oriented program at the BadenWürttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW). In addition, 53 trainees and students successfully completed their training or university degree and we offered more than 90 % of them an unlimited employment. Currently, there are a total of 188 young people who are in training or enrolled in university studies. Since 2006, KARL STORZ has also been inviting interested parents of first-year apprentices. At an afternoon event, the parents receive a company tour and the opportunity to talk with representatives of the Human Resources department. This year, 55 participants attended the parent afternoon and learned about how KARL STORZ medical devices are manufactured at various workplaces. In the trainee workshop, they were familiarized with the work environment and tasks of industrial apprentices and could admire the first items made by the job entrants. While touring the Visitor Centre, parents additionally gained an impression of the wide range and variety of medical device and system innovations and were invited to try out the virtual reality simulators used by trainee surgeons to practice their hand-eye coordination. The apprentices proudly showed their parents the various workplaces in the trainee workshop (November 2018) Virtual reality simulators: Parents viewed the demonstration of how surgeons practice their hand-eye coordination with great interest (November 2018) 52 53 KARL STORZ apprentice wins national competition of surgical “Women in MINT professions”: What does an instrument maker do? instrument makers Despite excellent career perspectives and development opportunities, the percentage of women in MINT professions is still comparatively low.

The industrial apprentices in both companies spend 2 months at the other company on an exchange basis to learn new processes and skills. The exchange especially expands the apprentices’ understanding of processes involving cooperation between companies. Cooperation without handicaps – one-week internship for trainees at a facility for people with disabilities In collaboration with an association for people with disabilities, “Lebenshilfe für Menschen mit Behinderungen” [Life Aid for human beings with disabilities], Tuttlingen District Association, KARL STORZ has been offering a one-week internship at Lebenshilfe for trainees in their first year of training through the project “Cooperation without handicaps” since 2003. Beyond professional qualification and the social interaction with coworkers, this project enables trainees and students to learn to interact with other people in our society. In Tuttlingen, Lebenshilfe runs a workshop for people with disabilities, an assisted living facility, and a facility that provides support and care for people with severe disabilities. Initially, KARL STORZ apprentices and university students attend a local information event followed by a visit of the various departments of Lebenshilfe Tuttlingen. In the subsequent weeks, the apprentices and students have the opportunity to complete a voluntary, one-week internship at Lebenshilfe. Internships can be completed at the workshop, the assisted living facility, or at the care facility. At a final event, the interns then reflect on their experiences and impressions together with the Lebenshilfe employees, and more detailed information about the causes and types of disabilities is discussed. This project benefits both interns and people with disabilities because the personal collaboration and exchange reduces prejudice and makes integration a reality in everyday life. This year, 18 KARL STORZ apprentices and students completed an internship at Lebenshilfe. The KARL STORZ management is particularly committed to support people with disabilities and their integration into society. Therefore, we not only support the “Cooperation without handicaps” project but have been placing production orders with the Lebenshilfe workshop for years. The workshop employs people aged 18 to 65 with mental and multiple disabilities. The employees are supported occupationally and also receive personal development opportunities in the form of numerous accompanying programs, such as on numbers and money, cooking and baking as well as through music therapy, etc. Diverse and exciting: Apprenticeship as an instrument maker at KARL STORZ In various areas of the Lebenshilfe association, KARL STORZ apprentices gain insights into the work and life of people with disabilities. 56 57 Internship year with technical focus In cooperation with the local Steinbeis vocational school, we support adolescents who have not found an apprenticeship position to help them get ready to enter the professional world. During the one-year program, participants attend the vocational school three days per week. On the remaining two days of the week, participants work at the KARL STORZ trainee workshop. The project’s practice orientation is intended to improve the readiness of participants to enter an apprenticeship program. KARL STORZ actively contributes to the support and development of these students. We aim to offer program participants a regular apprenticeship position. Between 2008 and 2018, we have already been able to provide apprenticeship positions to 20 program participants. Educational partnership with local schools Since 2009, KARL STORZ has been in a cooperation agreement with the Hermann-Hesse-Realschule (intermediate-level secondary school). In 2010, we added an agreement with the Wilhelmschule. Throughout the school year 2017/2018, we conduct joint events such as • Job internships & tours • Technology classes at the KARL STORZ trainee workshop • Applicant training, including a “real” job interview with staff from KARL STORZ Human Resources • In-house exhibition, where KARL STORZ trainees present their occupations to the students • Support of Girl’s Day and the Technolino project to offer girls and elementary students playful and age-appropriate insights into technical occupations KARL STORZ trainees with two students and the director of the Leidse Instrumentenmakers School Exchange program with vocational school in the Netherlands (November 2018) In cooperation with the vocational school Leidse Instrumentmakers School (LIS) in the Netherlands, which specializes in precision mechanics and medical technology, KARL STORZ again conducted an exchange program for third-year apprentices in surgical instrument making this year. Unlike the dual education system in Germany, where vocational schools and companies collaboratively offer vocational training, separated into theory and practice, at LIS, both theory and practice are taught at the vocational school. Three KARL STORZ apprentices traveled to the Netherlands for two weeks, and in return, three LIS students visited KARL STORZ and the Tuttlingen vocational school Ferdinand-von-Steinbeis for one week. All costs for the exchange were covered by KARL STORZ and LIS. The exchange program allows apprentices to familiarize themselves with the work environment of another culture that has a different vocational training system. Thanks to the cooperation with LIS, KARL STORZ can now for the first time offer a stay abroad for apprentices in the mechanical field. 58 59 Support of Franco-German partnership projects Franco-German Discovery Day of the Franco-German Youth Office (FGYO) Upon the initiative of the Franco-German Youth Office (FGYO), German and French companies and institutions once again this year opened their doors to numerous students to give them an impression of everyday working life in France and Germany and an opportunity to learn about the language and culture of the neighboring country. As part of the project carried out under the auspices of the German Foreign Office and French Foreign Ministry, students are invited to visit institutions and companies in their region that work closely with the other country. One declared objective is to particularly involve young people with special needs. The project makes an important contribution to the students’ vocational and intercultural orientation and is intended to sensitize them to the economic importance of FrancoGerman relations. As part of the Discovery Day, two classes from two local schools visited KARL STORZ in March and May 2018. During an extensive company tour, which focused on the close collaboration between KARL STORZ and the IRCAD training center in Strasbourg (France), students learned about the differences German and French teenagers on a tour through the KARL STORZ Visitor Centre (June 2018) and similarities of the German and French work environments. In a live video linkup, they were connected to the French training center and invited to ask questions. The adolescents discovered what it means to work in an intercultural professional environment and how important language and intercultural skills are in today’s professional world. The Discovery Day is intended to motivate them to choose a profession in the international environment. Franco-German Youth Meeting of the Rotary Clubs of Tuttlingen and Thann-Cernay In June 2018, the Rotary Club Tuttlingen welcomed 17 French teenagers from Thann in the region of Alsace, France, as part of the Franco-German Youth Meeting. The initiative aims to foster Franco-German friendship as a core element of the European Union. In April 2017, the German teenagers had already traveled to Thann for three days to get to know young French people and discover their country. During the 3-day return visit, the young people from Alsace had the opportunity to learn about the country, people, and culture on the other side of the border. The program aimed to encourage teenagers to learn foreign languages, gain experience abroad, and build long-term, international relationships. The teenagers were invited to the KARL STORZ Visitor Centre and gained interesting insights in the HOSPITAL1® model hospital as well as the world of endoscopy, which offers applications in over 15 medical specialties. After the tour, the teenagers formed Franco-German teams to participate in a skills competition. 60 61 Support of the Tuttlingen Team Trail IV. University cooperation projects In October 2018, following 9 months of construction, the City of Tuttlingen opened a Team Trail designed Collaboration with the Tuttlingen university campus – to help student groups and apprentices learn about teamwork on Honberg Mountain in Tuttlingen. The trail KARL STORZ Premium-Semester consists of eleven stations, ranging from a giant seesaw to a large wall to be ascended as a team. The Team Trail is an adventure-based learning tool to promote holistic learning. It aims to foster personality development and social skills as well as cooperation, conflict resolution, and communication skills within the group. The Team Trail is available to schools as well as cooperating partners of Tuttlingen youth work. The grand opening on Honberg Mountain was attended by Stefan Ahlhaus, Head of Human Resources at KARL STORZ, Tuttlingen Mayor Michael Beck, KARL STORZ apprentices as well as the apprentices of the City of Tuttlingen. KARL STORZ actively supported the project with a financial contribution and plans to integrate the Team Trail in the new apprentice induction week. Stefan Ahlhaus Head of Human Resources of KARL STORZ SE & Co. KG In 2009, the Tuttlingen university campus was established; it is a model institution of higher education that differs from existing universities in terms of trusteeship, organization, and teaching.

KARL STORZ bicycle leasing program KARL STORZ employees for climate-friendly mobility As part of the nationwide CITY CYCLING event, in which the City of Tuttlingen participated for the first time on September 10-30, 2018, both the city and the team of the company sports group KARL STORZ Aktiv achieved excellent results: A total of 73 KARL STORZ employees competed on their bikes during the event and biked a total of 15,000 kilometers to take 3rd place overall in the Tuttlingen competition. In the Company category, they even took 1st place. The objective of the Climate Alliance campaign is to have as many climate-friendly kilometers traveled by bike as possible, whether for professional or private purposes, and to thereby promote climate protection and bike-friendlier cities. The best teams, most active schools, and most committed individual cyclists were personally recognized by Tuttlingen Mayor Michael Beck as part of an official awards ceremony held on the Tuttlingen market square. “By participating in the Tuttlingen CITY CYCLING, we are very happy to have made a small contribution to climate-friendly mobility and reducing CO2 emissions, as we tallied many kilometers. It is nice to see that more and more people are realizing that events like these are not only good for your health but also benefit the environment – and are simply fun to do,” stated Nader Hassanzadeh, president of the KARL STORZ Aktiv company sports group. The Tuttlingen cyclists can be proud of themselves: In the category of cities under 49,999 inhabitants, the first-time participant Tuttlingen tallied a total of 242,011 kilometers to take first place in BadenWürttemberg and third place nationally. Riding bikes is popular and a good way to offset the typically sedentary office work. With the introduction of a company bicycle leasing program in June 2017, KARL STORZ offers employees an attractive mobility option that actively contributes to health, to reducing traffic, and to protecting the environment. For this purpose, KARL STORZ cooperates with a bicycle leasing company and thereby enables KARL STORZ employees to conveniently finance their favorite bicycle (regular or e-bike up to 25 km/h) through lease payments. Instead of paying directly at the store, for a term of 36 months, part of the monthly gross salary is withheld as a so-called salary conversion to pay the leasing rate to the bicycle leasing company. The salary conversion reduces taxable income and social security contributions. Only the monetary advantage (1% of the gross list price of the bicycle) remains tax relevant. In total, employees can save up to 30% compared to purchasing the bicycle in cash. Since the introduction of the program, 278 individual leasing contracts have been entered into, and for another 19 contracts, the bicycle transfer is pending.
