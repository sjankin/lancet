Message from Management The Shin-Etsu Group (the Group) achieved its highest profit ever and recorded its eighth consecutive year of increased profit in the fiscal year ended March 2018 (FY2017). At the same time, we were able to strongly move forward towards realizing our targets of making Contributions to the Earth's Future. In this message for our CSR Report 2018, I would like to introduce our management objectives and the CSR activities that we are carrying out to accomplish these objectives. President Yasuhiko Saito > Chairman's Message Chihiro Kanagawa Realizing Business Principle The Group's Business Principle is to contribute to people's living, society and industry through value creation in materials and technologies, while observing all laws and regulations as well as conducting fair corporate activities. With these Business Principle as a foundation, each and every one of the people working in our group is conscientiously carrying out their daily work with the objectives to supply key materials that meet society's needs and to contribute to the solution of the various issues that the Earth on which we are living is facing. Having these two objectives propelling us forward, our company is working to enduringly develop. In order to work to realize these objectives, in FY2017, we carried out the following activities. Strengthening ESG Activities 1 In recent years, an increasing amount of attention is being given by investors to companies' ESG activities. In August 2017, we reorganized former CSR Promotion Committee and formed an ESG Promotion Committee to further promote company-wide ESG activities in all aspects of our corporate activities. This committee is now chaired by myself, as the president of Shin-Etsu Chemical, and is comprised of 40 persons, including the members of Shin-Etsu Chemical's Board of Directors, the people in charge of relevant divisions and departments and the people in charge of CSR at a Group company, and it also has a secretariat. In this way, we are moving ahead with the strengthening of our Group's ESG activities. Contributing to Achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Since 2010 the Group has been a participant in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and has been voluntarily supporting and practicing in our business operations and strategies the UNGC's Ten Principles with regard to the four fields of human rights, labor standards, the environment and the prevention of corruption. Furthermore, we are also concentrating our efforts on achieving the United Nation's SDGs. In the process of considering the making of investments in our existing businesses as well as the development of new products and new businesses, we always assess their compatibility and suitability with regard to SDGs. Upon clearly explaining their congruence with SDGs, proposals of investment ideas are then submitted for consideration at our Board of Directors Meeting. In this connection, more than 90% of the investment proposals made during FY 2017 were those contributing to SDGs. At this point, I would like to briefly introduce just some of our company's products that are contributing towards the achieving of SDGs. PVC based resin window frames, silicones that are used in such areas as automobiles, construction and solar panels, and rare earth magnets that are used in motors and generators in such areas as hybrid cars, electric vehicles and wind-power generators are contributing to the achievement of Goal 13 to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Activities such as recycling of water, recycling of rare earths in the manufacturing process and waste reduction are contributing to Goal 12 to 3 ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. In this manner, our contributions to SDGs lead to the making of Contributions to Earth's Future that our Group's is pursuing, and at the same time, it also leads to our company's business expansion and growth and the development of new products. Tokyo Principles for Strengthening Anti-Corruption Practices As I explained earlier, right at the start of the statement of our Business Principle it emphasizes that we observe all laws and regulations as well as conducting fair corporate activities. In February 2018, we were the first company to agree to sign onto the Tokyo Principles for Strengthening Anti-Corruption Practices pursuant to 2 that established by the Global Compact Network Japan . Assenting to these Tokyo Principles also contributes to the achievement of Goal 16: to promote just, peaceful, and inclusive societies. We have notified all of the Group's companies of the decision we made to sign the Tokyo Principles, and we are endeavoring to further raise awareness of the fundamental importance of corruption prevention in our corporate activities, as we go about carrying out our daily work. Totally Committed to Responsible Care ®3 The Group signed and put into practice the Responsible Care Global Charter of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) in 2006, Furthermore, ® in 2014, we also signed the revised Responsible Care Global Charter issued by the ICCA. In accordance with this Charter, we are continuously striving to further contribute to the role of chemicals in improving the quality of life as well as in sustainable development by working to make continuous improvements in and achieve the highest levels of excellence in occupational safety and health, process safety and prevention and environmental conservation. In FY 2017, a total of 21 Group offices, globally, carried out their business activities in compliance with the Charter through such means as carrying out audits of environmental and safety management. As I stated above, I am introducing only some aspects of the Group's CSR activities that we are presently working on. These activities are explained in greater detail in each chapter of this CSR Report. All of us working in the Group are aiming to continue to grow together with society through all of our corporate activities. Going forward, we will continue to strive towards new value creation that responds to the needs of society, and we will steadily fulfill our corporate social responsibilities, as we work towards making Contributions to the Earth's Future. We sincerely ask for your continued understanding and support in the future as well.

Changes in Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity Relative to FY1990 Levels Regarding the greenhouse gas emissions intensity for FY2017, the Group and the Company achieved 53.4% and 48.9% of 1990 emissions respectively. Environmental Data Thermal energy recycling initiatives Each plant in Shin-Etsu Chemical is working on the recycling of heat energy. ■ Cogeneration promotion Steam and electricity are produced in a plant using a cogeneration system1. Electricity made with the cogeneration system is supporting the operation of manufacturing facilities. In addition, steam is being used for heating and thermal insulation for manufacturing equipment. Steam used for heating will not be emitted but will be reused for manufacturing equipment in which steam with lower temperature can be used. The steam is finally changed into water to be collected and recycled. ■ Waste heat recovery Heat is recovered from the production process and is used as thermal energy in another process. Furthermore, the remaining waste heat is mainly collected as steam to make cold water in the absorption refrigerator. This chilled water is used for cooling the manufacturing equipment, etc. Flow of steam and electricity at the plant 1 Cogeneration system (heat and power combined) This system generates power with engines, turbines and fuel cells using natural gas, petroleum, liquefied petroleum gas, etc. and simultaneously collects heat which would be generated. 30 Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Scope 3 Emissions by Category in FY2017 (unit: thousand of tons CO2e) The Group's Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions for FY2017 were 16,754 thousand tons of CO2, amounting to 76% in the supply chain1. 1 Supply chain All stages of a product from raw material production until it reaches the final customer.

Located inland in the south-west region of Gunma prefecture, the Complex draws its water required for manufacturing almost from nearby rivers and purifies the discharges of water from the Complex before return to the rivers. The Gunma Complex is situated in a rich natural environment. Downstream from the nearby rivers sits the Tokyo metropolitan area where these rivers sustain the daily lives of its residents as well as industry and agriculture. Although the manufacturing of chemical products requires large quantities of water, the Complex strives to conserve valuable water resources by keeping its water withdrawals from these rivers to a minimum. For this reason, the Complex reuses as much water as possible in its manufacturing and water cooling processes by recycling and circulating water and ensuring there is no water leakage outside of the Complex. Besides purifying the water before return to the rivers, rigorous water quality management is also applied. The Complex strives to maintain optimum conditions by continually monitoring the operating status of water treatment facilities and conducts regular water quality analysis of discharges of water to verify that it is in strict compliance with high water standards. Furthermore, they separate rainwater to prevent inflow of rainwater during heavy downpours as a measure to protect their treatment facilities from being damaged by natural disaster. In addition, since 2014 they have been carrying out seismic strengthening works assuming large-scale earthquakes. By effectively utilizing limited water resources, the Gunma Complex will continue to fulfill its responsibility as an upstream located production base. Rainwater Utilization at Overseas Group Company Calls are increasing for the protection of the world's water resources, and since its foundation Asia Silicones Monomer Limited has been making effective use of the plentiful rainfall it enjoys in its location in Thailand. It stores rainwater in storage tanks on-site, using it for industrial water and as coolant for waste gas incinerator. It always maintains a reserve of rainwater for use in fire fighting in the event of an emergency. It also supplies Group company Shin-Etsu Silicones Thailand and its nearby partners with rainwater for uses such as industrial water. 33 Waste reduction Achieve zero waste emissions (landfill waste 1% or less Since the production volume in FY2017 increased substantially compared to FY2017 target of the final amount of all waste generated) FY2016, the amount of waste generated, the amount of waste recycled, and the amount of waste for landfills all increased. Due to the characteristics of the The final waste landfill disposal rate was 4.45% in the FY2017 results manufacturing formula, a zero waste emission, which the Group aimed at, could Shin-Etsu Group and 4.32% in Shin-Etsu Chemical not be achieved because there is a process where a certain amount of residue FY2017 evaluation The target was not achieved occurs. We will continue to work on fewer emissions and less waste for landfills. Achieve zero waste emissions We have external contractors to handle our disposals. We check to confirm that FY2018 target Promotion of reduction of waste generation through the contractor properly handles disposals by regularly inspecting their operation. intensity Flow of Waste Disposal Amount of Waste Recycled Amount of Waste for Landfill Environmental Data * The figures are aggregated only for Shin-Etsu Chemical and group companies in Japan because waste standards differ from country to country. 34 Waste Recycling at Overseas Group Company Simcoa's Waste Utilization As an environmental initiative, Simcoa in Australia, manufactures and sells silicon metal, is committed to waste utilization. The waste utilization not only reduces environmental impact but also results in waste materials becoming a valuable resource by treating them as a by-product, and as such, the company is positively working towards reuse. Charcoal is one example of a way in which waste materials are urilized. Wood from forest clearing for a bauxite mining operation is processed to produce charcoal. Previously, parcial the wood from the forest clearing operations was burnt, however, in 2004 the company began producing charcoal for incineration with the goal of effectively using the resource as a by-product. Drew Harris Currently, Simcoa uses 100,000 tons of wood to produce 25,000 tons of charcoal each year. The source for the wood is General Manager Production felled trees from the bauxite mining operation, plantation wood, waste from sawmill and so on. Other examples of waste utilization in addition to charcoal are listed below. We hope these example initiatives help to demonstrate our commitment to the environment and waste utilization. Examples of Simcoa's Waste Utilization Amorphous silica fume is a by-product of silicon metal. Initially when Simcoa began operations, there was no market for silica fume and the waste had to be buried in an on-site landfill. Simcoa developed Silica fume a market in Australia for silica fume as an additive to increase the strength of cement, and has sold its silica fume for the past 25 years. Fine charcoal is screened off from the lump charcoal because it cannot be used in the silicon metal Charcoal fines furnaces and is sold for the production of barbecue briquettes. A certain amount of slag1 is generated as a by-product during the manufacturing process of silicon Dross metal. Slag is treated as a waste product by most silicon smelters, however, Simcoa sells this slag as a resource for producers of steel for deoxidization. Sawdust and wood mulch are generated during cutting timber. It is sold for use in soil improvement. Sawdust and wood mulch Investigations are underway into the potential use of this by-product for biomass energy generation in the future. As some of the quartz rock recovered from the quartz mine is too small for use in the silicon metal Undersized quaitz furnaces, it is sold as flux materials for use in metallurgical operations and as decorative stone for use with concrete. 1 Slag Slag is a waste produced when molten metal is separated into fractions during metal smelting. Simcoa Operations 35 Resource recycling The Group collaborates with customers and related industry groups, using cutting-edge technologies to recover used products, extract resources, and reuse them in the Group's products. Through these initiatives, it is possible to reduce the waste output of our customers and the Group itself. We are also contributing to environmental conservation through reuse of resources. Rare Earth Magnet Resource Recycling Rare-Earth Magnet Resource Recycling Process The Group manufactures rare earth magnets by our integrated production process using separation and refinement techniques to extract rare earth magnets from rare earth raw materials. As one of the measures to achieve stable procurement of raw materials, since 2007, the Group has been recycling magnet powder generated by our rare ear th magnet manufacturing processes. Furthermore, from March 2013, we have also been developing techniques for recycling rare earth magnets used in recovered power-saving air conditioners and hybrid cars in order to re-use resources. These initiatives have made it possible to reduce the environmental impact that comes along with resource development and to safely and securely protect the valuable rare earth resource. The Group's rare earth magnets create significant economic and social value as recycled products and also contribute significantly to energy conservation. Recycling of PVC Products Initiatives for the recycling of products containing PVC are making progress. There are various methods for recycling PVC, the most common of which is material recycling. Material recycling uses used PVC products as raw materials to create new PVC products. PVC pipes, flooring materials and other PVC products are not greatly influenced by foreign substance contamination, so various kinds of recycling are conducted for those products. In particular, 60% of used PVC pipes and joints are recycled for reuse in new PVC pipes and joints, and 70% of agricultural film is recycled for use in flooring material. Vinyl Environmental Council 36 Conservation of biodiversity initiatives, pollutant countermeasures Conservation of Biodiversity The Group aims for environmentally considerate product design starting already from the product development stage. At the same time, we are also meeting our responsibility as a chemical company by working actively to ensure strict control of chemical substances, mitigate global warming, reduce energy consumption, reduce the amount of waste generated, prevent water pollution, and make other environmental contributions. We are also engaged in activities such as tree planting in our plant site in compliance with the Factory Location Act (Japanese law) and voluntary river cleaning in areas neighboring our plants. Furthermore, we request that our business partners implement environmental conservation initiatives in accordance with our CSR procurement guidelines. The Group preserves the earth's ecosystem through these efforts.

Upon purchase, we ask all our pulp suppliers to consider conservation of biodiversity, and we have confirmed that they all have obtained national and/or international forest certifications. In addition, we work hard to know about our suppliers' activities on biodiversity activities. Release of Chemical Substance The Group has chemical substances which requires strict release management. The Group works on reducing chemical release with proper manufacturing processes as well as establishing the proper operation conditions of pollutant treatment facilities. In addition, the Group reports the amount of chemical substance released and moved in natural environment according to the PRTR system1 in the PRTR Law2. The main factor in the increase of chloroethylene release is the increase in the number of work days at the PVC plant. On the other hand, release amount per consumption has declined by 5.2% compared with FY2014 due to the production equipment running at optimal conditions. The amount of PRTR controlled substances generated varies depending on production volumes. 1 PRTR system Chemical substance release and transfer notification based on the Act on Confirmation, etc. of Release Amounts of Specific Chemical Substances in the Environment and Promotion of Improvements to the Management Thereof. 2 PRTR Law Short for Act on Confirmation, etc. of Release Amounts of Specific Chemical Substances in the Environment and Promotion of Improvements to the Management Thereof.

Prevention of Air Pollution The Group is working to reduce emissions of air pollutants by setting emission reduction targets at each of our Group companies and by converting to fuel components with less sulfur. Each group company carried out regular investigations on emitted gas to confirm compliance with laws and regulations. In FY2017, emissions of soot, NOx and SOx increased as production volumes increased significantly. Soot Emissions Trends NOx Emissions Trends SOx Emissions Trends ESG Data Environmental Data 38 Initiatives for Reducing Emissions of Substances Governed by Environmental Regulations The manufacturing processes used by the Shin-Etsu Group do not discharge waste water or waste gas byproducts as-is into the atmosphere or rivers, instead extracting substances which can be used as fuel or raw materials, thoroughly recycling them and rendering them harmless before eliminating them. Below are some examples. The cellulose derivative manufacturing processes of the Shin-Etsu Chemical Naoetsu Plant use caustic soda to process pulp created from trees. The result then undergoes reactions with chemicals such as methyl chloride to produce cellulose derivative products. The waste gasses created by this process contain environmental pollutants such as VOC and PRTR controlled substances. The processes also create water with a high concentration of salt. These waste products are incinerated, producing a gas consisting of carbon dioxide and water vapor. The waste water is highly concentrated salt water, which is used as a raw material in electrolysis process. This manufacturing process also creates water with high BOD values, containing organic compounds. This waste water is treated by anaerobic water treatment equipment1, separating most of the organic compounds in the waste water into methane gas and carbon dioxide. The methane gas is then used as fuel for the plant's boilers. The amount of methane gas produced each year is equivalent to 3 million liters in crude oil equivalent, and accounts for 20% to 30% of the fuel used by the boilers. The waste water discharged from the anaerobic water treatment equipment contains some undecomposed organic compounds, so it undergoes additional treatment using aerobic water treatment equipment2, purifying it to BOD levels below discharge reguratory standard levels before discharging it. 1 Anaerobic water treatment equipment Equipment which processes water containing high concentrations of organic substances by closed it in an oxygen-free environment and using bacteria which do not require oxygen to break the organic substances down into substances such as methane gas. 2 Aerobic water treatment equipment Equipment which uses bacteria which require oxygen to break organic substances down into carbon dioxide and water. Prevention of Soil Pollution Groundwater and soil monitoring at each plant is being carried out in accordance with the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act, and we make sure that we are in compliance with laws and regulations. In FY2017, at its plant sites, the Company monitored groundwater and soil as total of 133. 39 Environmental Accounting In FY2017, the Company referring calculated to the Environmental Accounting Guidelines 2005 prepared by the Ministry of the Environment in Japan calculated the investments and expenditures involved in the reduction of the environmental impact of air pollution, water pollution, environmental release of chemical substances, etc.; energy-saving measures to conserve the global environment; and waste reduction and recycling to improve reuse of resources.

Quality control The Group is making an effort on stable supply of the high quality products requested by the customers. Each the Company's division and/or Group companies are promoting quality control activities. The sales department, research and development department, manufacturing department and quality assurance department cooperate in roles as in the following in order to meet the demands of our customers. Sales department Receive to the customer requests, and promptly inform them to the research and development department as well as the manufacturing department Research and development department as well as the manufacturing department Utilize the customer requests for the improvement of existing products and research and development of new products Quality assurance department Make a final confirmation on product taking into account the product characteristics and the customers use 1 Almost all of the Group's manufacturing bases, both domestic and overseas, have obtained certification of the quality control systems such as ISO 9001, IATF16949 , etc. Quality Control ISO 9001 Certification of the Shin-Etsu Group 1 IATF16949 It is a quality management system for automotive industry. Response to complaints We have established a strict rule to make an initial response to all quality complaints from customers within 48 hours of receipt. In particular, the recall and product liability problem that has a social impact is defined as a critical quality claims and is given high priority distinguished from other claims. When a serious claim occurs, it is immediately reported to the top management so that a company-wide response can be implemented. 42 Quality audits and support To solve the zero quality problem, the claim and complaint information from the customers are closely examined. In quality audits, quality control activities and the quality control system are checked and improved. Also, quality control activities are evaluated according to two different viewpoints, which are the customers' viewpoint and quality cost viewpoint. We work to find the root cause of quality issues and to make an effort toward the recurrence prevention. 1 Furthermore, Six Sigma programs are deployed on a company-wide basis in order to improve the quality level. Quality audit (August 2017, Shin-Etsu Chemical Gunma Complex) The 18th debrief session of the results of Shin-Etsu Six Sigma (February 2018, Shin-Etsu Chemical Head office) 1 Six Sigma programs Quality improvement method developed by Motorola in the 1980s. Focused on processes where quality variation appears, it is designed to minimize variation within the processes and thereby reduce the incidence of quality defects. This approach has been adopted across the Group. Product safety control Product safety is being managed from product development to transport based on internal regulations. The safety is confirmed and risk assessment is per formed for environment and health in the development of new chemical substances. We also focus on developing products as well as their 1 manufacturing technologies which do not use hazardous substances that have been designated by the Industrial Health and Safety Law and Chemical Substances Control Law , as well as the EU 2 RoHS Directive . Furthermore, we submit necessary notifications and reports according to laws and regulations. 3 Customers are offered information such as product hazards and risks in SDS in order to ensure proper transmission of information to the supply chain. Through SDS, customers are requested to handle products safely by complying with laws and regulations, installing abatement equipment, wearing protective equipment, etc. 4 5 As a transportation safety measure, we issue Yellow Cards and/or Container Yellow Cards that are affixed to containers. Furthermore, pictorial indication of hazard and harm is also implemented in 6 accordance with GHS . 1 Chemical Substances Control Law Short for Act on the Evaluation of Chemical Substances and Regulation of Their Manufacture, etc. A law intended to prevent environmental pollution by chemical substances that can be harmful to human health or to ecosystems. 2 RoHS (Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances) Directive EU directive on restricting the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. 3 SDS (Safety Data Sheet) SDS lists the physical and chemical properties of the chemical substance together with harmfulness and emergency response procedures. Designed to promote safer use of chemical substances and prevent accidents and incidents, SDS are supplied by manufacturers, importers and distributors to customers at the point of sales or shipment. 4 Yellow Cards The yellow cards are cards on which all relevant information on treatment required in case of an accident during transportation of chemical substances is described. The cards are handed to the transport contractor to be brought by tanker lorry or other means at the time of transportation. 5 Container Yellow Cards The standard yellow card system is not suitable for use with mixed cargoes and small-lot deliveries.

ESG Data 43 Shin-Etsu Group Key CSR Issues Key Issue 4: Promoting CSR procurement and the diversification of supply sources Policy The Group will procure fairly and build an environmentally conscious supply chain. Basic Procurement Policy A Basic Procurement Policy has been formulated for the purchasing of supplies needed for production activities, including raw materials, sub materials including transportation packaging, and machinery and equipment. This policy is ensured in the Group and posted on the website. Business partners are expected to understand the Basic Procurement Policy and asked to incorporate the content of the Policy into their supply contracts. In addition, the Group prepared and distributed the Guidelines for CSR Procurement so as to ensure that business partners have a deeper understanding of the Basic Procurement Policy. We held an explanatory meeting of CSR procurement for suppliers in July 2017. It was to ask suppliers for understanding and cooperation to our promotion of CSR procurement. In January 2018, we established the Supplier Hotline to ensure the transparency and fairness of transactions between the Group and suppliers. Briefing of the Guidelines for CSR Procurement (July 2017, ShinEtsu Chemical Head Office) Basic Procurement Policy Shin-Etsu Group CSR Procurement Guidelines Supplier Hotline Compliance with the Act against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, Etc. to Subcontractors Staff members in charge of purchasing and procurement attend external seminars and internal training sessions to learn specific examples in order to support thorough compliance with the Subcontract Act. Also, we make sure that all the subcontractors that are applicable for the Subcontract Act are in full compliance by periodical checks and through new transaction report. Internal auditing for compliance with the Act against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, Etc. to Subcontractors (December 2017, Shin-Etsu Chemical Naoetsu Plant) Initiatives Aimed at Eliminating the Use of Conflict Minerals 1 In our Basic Procurement Policy, the Group has declared our dedication to eliminating conflict minerals from all product procurement. We ask that all business partners adhere to this policy, and we regularly perform studies of pertinent minerals, tracking their production all the way back to the smeltery level. 1 Conflict minerals Minerals used to fund armed groups in conflict areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighboring countries. These conflict minerals are tantalum, tin, gold, tungsten, and their derivatives. 44 Procurement Audit By asking business partners to reply to a supplier CSR procurement questionnaire, we confirm whether they conduct business activities in accordance with the Group's CSR Procurement Guidelines. Additionally, we visit business partners in Japan and overseas whenever necessary to carry out audits. Procurement Conferences The Purchasing Department holds a company-wide meeting every six months with all procurement department personnel companywide to discuss material procurement. This meeting is not only for reporting material procurement but also for training procurement department personnel according to the Guidelines for CSR Procurement and checking the status of CSR procurement as well as learning the latest examples of CSR Procurement inside and outside the Company. Procurement conference (Shin-Etsu Chemical Head office) Business Continuity Initiatives The Group has formulated a Business Continuity Plan and is prepared for contingencies. We would like business partners to understand the effectiveness and practicality of the Group's Business Continuity Plan and draw up a business continuity plan of their own. Control of Chemical Substances Used as Raw Materials The Group checks the ISO 14001 status of business partners and considers preferential business transactions with business partners that have ISO certification so as to purchase materials of lower environmental impact. On making contracts on specifications for raw material supply, we work to confirm the following. The business partners' use of chemical substances that impact the environment in products and packaging, compliance with the relevant laws and regulations Compliance with the RoHS Directive 45 Shin-Etsu Group Key CSR Issues Key Issue 5: Respect for human rights, the development of human resources and the promotion of diversity Policy The Group will respect the fundamental human rights of all people involved in the Group. Respect for Human Rights Observance of International Labor Standards The Group respects the human rights of employees in accordance with the international labor standards through the International Labour Organization (ILO), and never discriminates employees on the basis of race, age, gender, sexual preferences, ethnic or national origin, disabilities or religion. To this end, the Company confirms with its consolidated companies every year whether respect of human rights, labor management, and employment are being appropriately implemented following laws and regulations in their respective countries and regions. In addition, when building a new plant, its impact on the region in terms of human rights is taken into consideration. Confirmation Items concerning Respecting Human Rights Prohibition of child labor, proper working hours, decent wages, proper employment contract in writing, prohibition of inhuman treatment, prohibition of discrimination, freedom of association Efforts for human rights awareness The Group has established a Human Rights Enlightenment Promotion Committee. This committee holds regular human rights awareness training for directors and employees. Human rights Q & A are serialized in our internal company newspaper, and we compile a human rights enlightenment motto to coincide with our annual human rights week in December. Furthermore, the Company has been a member of both the Tokyo Industrial Federation for Human Rights and the Osaka Dowa / Human Rights Issues Industrial Federation and participates proactively in events held by both federations as well as training sessions held by administrative organizations. Human rights awareness training (July 2017, Shin-Etsu Chemical Osaka Branch) 46 Education/Training and Personal Development The Group supports employees to grow through various training systems. The training system has training for different staff grades, international adaptation training, auditing student system, environmental education, safety education and mental health education. Conduct international adaptation training The Group is expanding its business activities throughout the world. Competency to communicate in foreign languages is therefore an essential skill for smooth operations. Therefore, the Company offers the following kinds of training. English language training (meeting skills course and presentation skills course) Cross-cultural communication training Chinese conversation classes Auditing system for students In 1962, the Company established an auditing system for students. Under the learning system with the goal of improving the workforce, up to about ten operators at manufacturing sites of the Group each year are chosen and sent to study at universities for one year. In the 55 years since the system was introduced, a total of 531 employees have completed the program and are now functioning in various workplaces. Training system list Continuing Chinese languages classes Du Yan, lecturer in Chinese I have been in charge of Chinese-language classes at Shin-Etsu Chemical since about 20 years ago. At first, these classes were like an association of those who liked to study the language, and I taught language useful for travel and other things, such as about the history and culture of China and the disposition of Chinese people. But since four years ago, I have emphasized students' efforts to pursue their studies and reviewed the content of classes so that the language could be used for daily operations. The students are enthusiastic about learning Chinese, and some of them have passed the Chinese Proficiency Test. Recently, one student reported, I was able to exchange emails with business partners in Chinese, and another said, I was able to talk directly with people at the company I visited on a business trip, and the negotiations went well. I am very happy to receive such reports. I will strive to teach Chinese in an easy-to-understand way so that students can use it effectively. Chinese languages classes (May 2018, Shin-Etsu Chemical Head Office) 47 Performance-based Personnel Evaluation Systems and Equal Opportunities The Group has introduced a personnel system that places importance on employee ability and work performance. This system proves useful for increasing employees' motivation, as their treatment reflects their performance, attitude, and evaluations of how they meet their challenges to achieve higher goals. To operate the personnel system in a fair and appropriate manner, evaluation training is provided for all managers who conduct performance review so that they can carry out personnel evaluations in a fair way. Transparency is increased by making evaluation standards available and disclosing the results. In addition, there is a system of interviews between a person who evaluates and the person who is evaluated to ensure that they can communicate successfully. During interviews, each staff member and his/her immediate superior are using Communication Sheets to ensure mutual awareness of the superior's expectations and are setting half-year goals. Furthermore, feedback on progress is given for further ability development. Promotion of Diversity Active promotion of diverse human resources As a group engaged in business operations around the world, the Group hires local employees at overseas group companies and hires foreign nationals in Japan. The entire Group is also working to proactively employ people with disabilities and create environments where it is easy for them to work. Our employment population for persons with disability exceeds the legally mandated employment rate. We have created the Internal Re-Employment Program for employees who have reached the retirement age of 60 years, which allows employees who wish to be re-employed to stay until a maximum age of 65.

Today, however, companies disclose non-financial information which provide materials for investment decisions, at their own discretion, so it is difficult for investors to obtain and compare information equally. In 2013, in order to improve this situation, the Ministry of the Environment led the world in building a system to disclose non-financial information, particularly environmental information, and began verification tests of the system. This system is expected to allow companies to disclose non-financial information in a format that enables investors to compare it with information from others and promote active dialogues between companies and investors and other stakeholders. We hope that investors and many other stakeholders will inspect the information disclosed under this project and obtain a deeper understanding of our CSR initiatives. 1 ESG investment An investment method in which investors pay attention to not only corporate financial information, but also to non-financial information, such as initiatives for the environment (E), society (S), and governance (G).
