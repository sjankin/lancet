Suppliers Assessment Every year, the Purchasing and Quality Assurance teams assess all suppliers by means of audits, verifying issues such as service, on-time delivery performance, compliance with specifications and quality assessment. They can be in-person or self-assessment audits, and be effective for one to three years. We also have an auditing schedule for suppliers of raw materials and critical supplies; in these cases, assessments are conducted by staff from the Quality Assurance area. When a supplier does not pass the assessments, we give formal notice thereof to the supplier involved. Then, we plan an annual improvement program with the supplier. The Purchasing team analyzes the development of the plan and, if the result is satisfactory, we authorize the reincorporation of said supplier into the system so as to render services or provide products again. | 31 2.7.

Waste Recycling Part of the recyclable materials generated during the operations were donated to the municipalities and other entities close to the places where we operate. Largely, they were destined to companies in charge of transforming and reinserting the waste as raw material in other productive processes. During the processed food operation in Argentina, we recycled: • 19,720 kg of scrap • 2,318 kg of plastic • 47,260 kg of cardboard paper • 42,345 units of drums We restored 200-liter steel drums used by the production area so that they may be used in the following season. We use organic waste as soil enhancing agents in the surrounding farms. We work with appropriate rotation of locations and movement of the soil.

Active Involvement and Development of our Communities Our commitment: Supporting community development in our fields of action Material issues related to this commitment and presented in this chapter: • Education • Nutrition • Housing 7.1. Social Investment Commitment at San Miguel We have a strong vocation to make a positive transformation in our areas of influence. We contribute economic, social and environmental value to the communities where we are present and we do so based on the following objectives: • Promoting local development focused on nutrition, health and education. • Serving our employees as a priority. • Investing in operative improvements with a positive impact on the local communities. Nutrition, Health and Education are the main lines of action that lead our community development strategy. They are part of our identity; they impact on our business and respond to the needs of the communities where we operate. These three lines of action are aligned with specific SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), and interact with other goals. Thanks to the Living a Winning Life program (South Africa), for example, we foster the acquisition of social and work skills, but we also address gender and health issues. In 2016 we invested $3,661,402 in actions with the community, 45.88% more than in 2015. We implemented development programs, we conducted impact assessments and participated in schools. The depth and scope of the initiatives vary based on the magnitude of the operation, the context and the communities’ needs. Leaders from every sector of the company participated actively in Sustainability Committee meetings and volunteering activities. | 89 7.2.
