26 September 2018 H.E. António Guterres Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 USA Dear Mr. Secretary-General, Huntsman is proud to include information regarding our integration of the UN Global Compact Ten Principles in our 2017 Sustainability Report titled, “Bringing Chemistry to Life: Growth and Sustainability in Asia Pacific.” Upon final publication, our 2017 Sustainability Report will be freely available to all stakeholders on Huntsman’s web site at www.Huntsman.com/sustainability. In our Communication on Progress, we express our support for the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals and acknowledge the chemical industry’s role in progressing them. More specifically, we identify 12 SDGs that Huntsman actively supports through community outreach, improvements that reduce our environmental footprint, and product innovations that advance sustainable development. We continue to incorporate the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact as appropriate into our corporate policies and standards, as these principles complement our own business values and goals. I am proud to reaffirm Huntsman’s continuing support for the Ten Principles of the Global Compact with respect to human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. With this communication, we express our continued commitment to advance those principles within our sphere of influence. Sincerely yours, Peter R.
