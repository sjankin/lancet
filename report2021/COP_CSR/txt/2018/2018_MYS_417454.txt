FUELING YOUR FUTURE TOWARDS WORLD GO GREEN ANNUAL GROUP REPORT MAY 2017 – APRIL 2018 BATC DEVELOPMENT BHD COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 2018 1 REMARKS BY GROUP EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN Dato’ Seri Mohd Safie M. Jaffri Group Executive Chairman BATC Development Bhd Energy security and independence are vital to national security and to the socio-economic development of any country. The rise and fall of a nation depends on the strength and sustainability of their energy resources. Unfortunately, the passionate pursuit of energy resources and the high level of dependence on fossil fuel have caused climate change and global warming which must be addressed immediately. I call upon all leaders in the world to work towards a mutual agreement to coordinate and unify the clean energy and biofuel policies and ensure the market’s stabilization in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of clean energy and biofuel to the industry and consumers while securing a steady income to producers and a fair return on capital for those investing in this industry. BIONAS is willing and able to issue investment to meet the demand of any country for biofuel or waste to energy projects in their respective countries. BIONAS takes proactive steps by collaborating our expertise and technology with any party to make climate action a reality. 002 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 2018 STATEMENT BY GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ZURINA AMNAN Group Chief Executive Officer BATC Development Bhd 2nd May 2018 To our stakeholders: I am pleased to confirm that BATC Development Bhd reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption.

We strive to find ways of conducting businesses using smart approaches and most of our R&D work centers on finding ways to minimize or eliminate the impracticalities. Today, we have successfully formulated and synthesized a very stable mixture of bio-fuels with Nano Emulsion and Polarization Technology which requires blending & storage tanks to mix bio components and fossil fuels. Even though most of our additives are Jatropha based, we have the technology to formulate “Drop-In” additives derived from other types of feedstock such as used cooking oil, canola, cotton seed oil, algae etc. As bio-fuels and renewable fuels are comparatively new to existing fossil, we do not wish to be seen as competitor to the oil majors. Instead we opt and prefer to collaborate with the oil majors, national oil and energy companies to further enhance their existing products and turning them into renewable fuels. We firmly believe that through collaboration with the oil majors we would be able to speed up the promotion and use of renewable energy, minimize or eliminate investments required for infrastructure setups and utilizing the oil majors’ industry knowledge & experience, retailing, and supply chain. Through our technology, we believe this could also reduce the use of fossil thus prolonging the life of oil reserves. 0023 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 2018 BIONAS PRODUCTS REGISTRATION, CERTIFICATION & TEST REPORTS The Company’s products registration with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 0024 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 2018 Certificate of Fuel Additive Registration from Department of Energy, Ministry of Energy, Philippines to Bionas Philippines Corporation 0025 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 2018 Permanent Registration for B30(M) Bio-Petrol and B30 Bio-Diesel issued by the Ministry of Energy, Philippines for Bionas Philippines Corporation 0026 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 2018 Test result by PUSPAKOM (Malaysian Government Vehicle Inspection Agency) with 94% Emission Reduction.

The pre-existing plan to provide $100 billion per year to developing countries for these purposes was extended through 2025. The development of Africa Clean Energy Hub (ACE HUB) is to assist the goals laid out by the Paris Agreement COP21. The Hub will function as the Center of Administration and Implementation of Paris Agreement on COP21. The Center shall provide real-time reporting on key performance indicators, Technology Transfer, Training and Certification for Compliance and Conformity to Paris Agreement that has laid out goals of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions and thus limit the global temperature increase. The study published in the August 2017, issue of Nature, found that almost all major industrialized nations are failing to meet the pledges they made in Paris Agreement. In addition to failing in contributing their pledges, the countries are not even enacting the policies already planned to reducing the CO2 output. In assisting member countries, the Clean Energy programs to be undertaken by the ACE HUB will be implemented through proposed Turnkey Design, Finance, Built, Operate and Transfer within the agreed concession period. The programs run by the ACE HUB will incorporate the Poverty Eradication, Multi Feedstock, and Alternative Fuel programs. No further investment in clean energy/biofuel Production Infrastructure, and Technology Transfer, Benefits to Consumer and Real Time Results and beyond are essentially the essence of this Program. The ACE HUB will focus on the production of Bio-Diesel, Bio-Petrol/ Gasoline, Bio-Heavy fuel, Bio-Jet Fuel, Bio-Energy Emission Solutions (Clean Coal), Waste to Energy and Oil Spill Cleanup Initiatives and Programs. It is imperative that all Paris Agreement COP21 stakeholders within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to participate actively in this program in order to achieve the success climate change target of 2030. We will develop three Centers/Towers with the state of the art facilities to implement and deliver the Climate Change programs for the world. 0076 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 2018 WORLD CLEAN ENERGY HUB AFRICA CLEAN ENERGY HUB 1. GGW Tower The tower is to accommodate all member countries participating in the Great Green Wall of Africa along with all States involved in the program. It will also include Bionas’ Management team to ensure smooth development and implementation of this mega Climate Change programs. 2. Twin Peaks Tower It is anticipated that this Tower will be the tallest twin towers in the world and will be the center for all Paris Agreement Stakeholders under the UN platform to be placed here to participate in the Climate Change programs. It is also expected that 400 oil companies from 200 countries will work here so they can actively participate in this UN Climate Change Programs. 3. ACE Tower The tower is named the African Clean Energy (ACE) Tower suited for the development of Clean Energy in line with the UN’s efforts to ensure clean energy production from contaminated sources such as oil spills and garbage. The tower will be the green smart building and is expected to be the hub of operation of 14 OPEC member countries and non-OPEC countries, as well as the international and local oil and gas companies specializing in the production of clean energy. The main source of funding for these activities will come from the World Bank and the USD100 billion per year for developing countries agreed by the Government around the World under COP21 where the pre-existing plan should be extended through 2025. Countries that have implemented Green Initiatives with certification can claim for Carbon Credit. The world is confronted to critical crude oil depletion and environmental crisis that have threatened the security and harmony of the world. The drastic change to the climate and the speed at which change has occurred are beyond our imagination. Thus, the responsibility to mitigate climate change and global warming lies not only with the government, but also with each and every one of us. 0077 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 2018 WORLD CLEAN ENERGY HUB AFRICA CLEAN ENERGY HUB 1.
