PERFORMANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY REPO RT 2018 Our front cover expresses our deep commitment to transparency and enabling sustainable lifestyles around the world. We chose to highlight a gathering of urban people as they will play the greatest role in making sustainability mainstream, with more than 70% of the world’s population expected to live in mega cities by 2030. Our Pathways to Positive strategy can only succeed if it is relevant and aspirational to them. Around the world, we are seeing a paradigm shift towards good living, with people seeking more authentic experiences. We chose to symbolize this trend with this gathering around a vinyl record player, as it captures the essence and warmth of an authentic music experience, while also reflecting our circular thinking approach. This visual also represents our creativity, the essence of everything we do. © Fulvio Bonavia OUR YEAR IN REVIEW AMPLIFYING GOVERNANCE ACCELERATING GROWTH FAST-TRACKING GREEN TRANSPARENT REPORTING At Firmenich, we are passionate about creating positive emotions to enhance wellbeing, naturally.
