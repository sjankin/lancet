This item reflects portfolios merely administered by Van Lanschot Kempen, over which we have little or no control, and on which earnings are relatively limited. As a result, some portfolios were moved from AuM to AuA.

Comparative figures for 2015 have been adjusted accordingly. 10 In 2017, within Asset Management we introduced AuMG as a new asset category. AuMG refers to portfolios that are only subject to monitoring, plus minor advisory and related services. Clients make their own investment decisions and Van Lanschot Kempen has little or no influence on the management of these assets. As a result, some portfolios were moved from AuM to AuMG. Comparative figures for 2016 have been adjusted accordingly. 11 From 2016, we have reported on Evi as a separate segment, whereas these activities were previously part of Private Banking.

We began the year with a degree of trepidation of what may follow after the referendum in the UK, the turbulent Diversity election process in the US and the rising tide of populism in As a firm, we believe that diversity is an essential piece Europe and elsewhere. The outcome of the election process of the jigsaw puzzle that ensures our success on a in the Netherlands, France and Germany were both sustainable basis.

Economically, it was a fewer blind spots. We also believe that it ensures good year; the global and European economy have certainly access to a much bigger talent pool, thereby ensuring changed gear for the better. that meritocracy truly prevails in the firm.

In essence, the real question is what we do to make a difference to society with respect to climate change. We ‘s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, 21 February 2018 aim to mitigate this threat via our activities, and to work towards a low-carbon economy. Increasingly, we encourage investee companies to adopt sustainable practices, to produce in a sustainable manner, and to report on sustainability. In 2017, we further enhanced our policies focusing on the climate impact of the assets on our balance sheet, our investments on behalf of clients, and our own organisation. By the end of 2017, we had integrated climate risks into our overall risk management processes for our on-balance sheet Karl Guha activities and found such climate risks to be low: our internal Chairman of the Statutory Board assessment pointed out that our balance sheet does not include material climate-sensitive assets. We also started an initial pilot project to make mortgage clients more aware of energy savings and energy production, and of the growing possibilities to finance measures such as insulation and solar panels. Following a positive response, we expanded the pilot to all mortgage clients. We enhanced our climate policy for client investments and improved its integration into our responsible investment policies. We also engaged with companies that were lagging behind in terms of climate policies and performance, and encouraged them to take concrete measures to reduce their carbon emissions. We have selected five of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which serve as a sustainable development agenda for the 2015-30 period. In addition, at the start of 2018 KCM launched the Global Impact Pool, which is investing across listed and non-listed asset classes, with the dual objectives of achieving financial returns and positive social and environmental impact. Four themes were selected for the fund: basic needs and well-being, circular economy, climate and energy, and SME development and decent work.

How do we respect the privacy preferences of our Our ambition to be a responsible wealth manager clients, while other stakeholders and legislation increasregularly confronts us with dilemmas in everyday practice. ingly require ever greater transparency? A few of the dilemmas we faced in 2017 are set out below. At times, the interests of our clients may run up against legal and regulatory requirements we have to meet. For 1. How can we anticipate the future and innovate our privacy reasons, we are, for instance, duty-bound to protect propositions to attract new generations of clients, while the personal details of our clients.

Of course, we comply with legal and different clients may have different views. But how can we regulatory requirements, while at the same time reporting develop new propositions without alienating our existing as transparently as possible. We also inform our clients client base? We engage in ongoing dialogue with our clients about the impact of these requirements to ensure they are to address this dilemma and establish the right sequence not surprised by new developments. And we engage with and pace of change. And we are constantly gaining new stakeholders who are looking for even greater transparency. insights and actively following external developments. 2. How do we prepare our employees to embrace and adapt to continuous change? Pressure on Van Lanschot Kempen and our people continues to build, driven by changing market conditions, client wishes, shareholder requirements, technological trends and growing regulation and legislation. Our daily work is constantly changing, and we have to meet ever more requirements using ever fewer resources. So, how do we prepare? To find out, we conducted a new engagement survey among our people in 2017. Its findings give us insight into their “fitness” and adaptability to change, and serve as a springboard for targeted initiatives. Moreover, by offering our people training and development opportunities, we encourage them to keep developing the skills needed as technology and markets continue to evolve. 3. Responsible investing: where do we draw the line? As part of our responsible investing approach we engage with companies and other stakeholders to encourage positive change. Some social organisations challenge us on the companies in which we invest; they may expect us to engage with more or other companies, or to act on specific abuses very deep in the supply chain. In the real world, this is not as easy as it sounds. For one thing, we have far too many investee companies to probe their supply chains in this kind of depth. In addition, many companies have such lengthy and complex production chains that it is typically very hard to identify direct impact – there is too great a distance between the company and the environmental breach, the poor labour conditions or the corruption scandal. Depending on what’s feasible, we will use our influence as an investor. However, there will always be some tension between what we can realistically do and what some stakeholders expect from us.

The table below gives more detailed insight into these four themes. For each of them, we explain what our stakeholders expect and how we met those expectations in 2017.

In 2017, we focused on making these products as accessible and convenient for clients to use as possible – whether via mobile or desktop, app or website. “Mobile first” is an important part of our online strategy, and mobile on-boarding via the (responsive) website is now available for clients. We developed a new app for Evi Doelbeleggen; we also integrated our product apps so that there’s now one portal that provides an overview of all Evi products available. Internally, we have become more e-commerce and service-oriented: we now have a centralised customer service team capable of answering questions across all channels. Using data analytics The reporting year has been one in which Evi has grown into a more data-driven company. We now have a team fully dedicated to looking at data analytics in order to identify business opportunities. This enables us to target the right offering to the right consumer – improving our ability to give them what they’re looking for, and targeting relevant content to our clients to improve retention. Our Iedereen Verdient Evi campaign also uses data analytics to promote different online messages per target group, based on age and life events. Part of our growth in client numbers in 2017 came from the success of this campaign. Awards and achievements For the second year in a row, Evi scooped the Gouden Stier (Golden Bull) award for best online asset manager. The jury was particularly impressed by our transparency and clear communication. Another decisive factor was the fact that Evi has improved further in the area of client-oriented services compared to last year. Developing in Belgium Until September 2017, Evi in Belgium was part of Van Lanschot Belgium; it is now fully integrated into the Evi team. This centralised e-commerce model gives us opportunities to deploy the expertise, technology and best practices that have been built up throughout Evi. This makes our business proposition scalable in other markets. In Belgium, we continue to focus on gaining new clients, and on converting savers into investors interested in asset management.

Elbert Rodenburg – Managing Director Securities, Kempen Merchant Banking Using data analytics Much of 2017 was spent laying the groundwork for the implementation of the data-driven approach that we need. We now have a strong data warehouse, which we started using in a more commercial way towards the end of the year. Business information helps us offer the right stocks to the right clients; financial information tells us which types of clients and activities are the most profitable; and going forward, external data insights gathered can also be used for our research product. We believe that using technology in this way will help us improve our products and results. Data will help us create more structure in our client and market approach, and will lead to increased flexibility for our employees. We also expect that client demand will shift from maintenance research to data and idea-driven research. In 2017, we implemented a new research delivery platform, Blue Matrix, that allows us to give our clients access to research in a structured way. It also means we can track which research is read most often and that clients therefore find most useful. Conferences Kempen Merchant Banking’s conferences are well known within the industry, connecting investors with corporates. In 2017, for example, we organised life sciences and European real estate conferences – the latter in both the Netherlands and New York. In total, almost 300 investors and 150 corporates attended our conferences during the year. Awards For the third year in a row, Kempen Merchant Banking was awarded the SRP Structured Products & Derivatives Award. These Awards are the most prestigious prizes in the industry, designed to celebrate the best firms in Europe, the Nordics, America and Asia Pacific.

In the case of available-for-sale and returns on investments. These assumptions are subject investments, any equity revaluation is first deducted. to uncertainty. See Note 20, Provisions. An increase in value occurring after an impairment is treated as a (new) revaluation and recognised in equity. Impairments of investments in debt instruments An investment in debt instruments is tested for impairment if there is objective evidence of financial problems at the counterparty, the collapse of a market or other indications. In the case of available-for-sale investments, any debt revaluation is first deducted. If during the subsequent period the amount of the impairment of an available-forsale debt instrument decreases, and the decrease can objectively be attributed to an event occurring after the write-off, the previously recorded impairment is reversed through profit or loss. Impairments of non-financial assets The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the higher of the fair value of an asset less costs to sell and its value in use. This fair value less costs to sell is the price that would be received on sale of an asset or paid on transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the valuation date. To determine whether assets are impaired, the individual assets are allocated to the lowest level at which cash flows can be identified (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that have been subject to impairment, other than goodwill paid, are reviewed annually to determine whether the impairment can be reversed. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill paid, are tested for impairment annually by assessing whether there are any indications that these assets are impaired. Impairments of goodwill To measure the recoverable amounts, we calculate the value in use for each cash-generating unit (CGU). This calculation reflects an estimate of future cash flows, multiple scenario analyses and discount rates. Future cash flow estimates are based on our strategic plans and different types of investigation into possible trends. Events and factors that could have a significant impact on these estimates include market expectations, effects of mergers and acquisitions, competitive conditions, client behaviour and changes in the client base, cost structure, trends in interest rates and risks, and other circumstances specific to the industry and sector. For more information on the discount rates used, see Note 11, Goodwill. Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near future against which these temporary differences can be offset. Estimates are used when determining future taxable profits, since these are subject to uncertainty. Acquisitions In the case of acquisitions, it is necessary to determine the fair value of the acquired assets (including any intangible assets and goodwill acquired), as well as of liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position. Estimates are used for this, particularly for those items which are not traded on an active market.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of incorporation or acquisition, being the date on which Van Lanschot Kempen acquires control, and are consolidated until the date that such control ceases. We consolidate interests in investment funds if we have power over the investment fund and are exposed to or have rights to variable income stemming from our involvement and are able to use our power over the investment fund to influence the variable income. The assessment of control is based on the actual relationship between Van Lanschot Kempen and the investment fund. Van Lanschot Kempen takes into account its interest for its own account and its own role, or that of one of its group companies, as fund manager.

The lease obligation is recognised under Other liabilities. The interest component of the finance costs is charged to the statement of income over the term of the lease. Segment information The different operating segments form the basis for our primary segmentation. An operating segment is a business unit that can earn revenues and incur expenses and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by its management or the chief operating decision maker and for which discrete financial information is available. Additional information is reported geographically based on where the business activities are located. Intra-segment transactions are conducted on commercial terms and market conditions (at arm’s length). Risk management 122 RISK MANAGEMENT 1.

The risk appetite statement is then submitted to the Supervisory Board for review and approval. In addition, the Supervisory Board reviews the development of the risk profile twice a year. Risk appetite reports serve as important discussion documents for these reviews. The risk appetite statement is based on the following guiding principles: – We only take risks that we understand and can explain; – We only take risks that – directly or indirectly – serve our strategic objectives; – The sum of all risks taken should not exceed our risk–bearing capacity; – When taking risks, we take the requirements and expectations of all stakeholders into account; – We do not take any risks that could seriously harm our reputation; – The risk appetite should be considered in all business decisions at every level of the organisation; – We avoid risks that could lead to legal or regulatory breaches. 1.2 Organisation of risk and capital management The purpose of our risk management framework is to identify and analyse risks at an early stage, as well as to mitigate and monitor those risks. Adequate internal control procedures and reporting systems, including the application of standards and limits, are key elements of the risk management framework. The organisation of our risk management framework is based on the three lines of defence principle. Day-to-day responsibility for risk control lies with the front office and/or operational departments (the first line of defence); Compliance, Group Risk Management and Finance, Risk management 123 Table 1.2 Risk and capital management framework Supervision Supervisory Board § 1.2.1 – Risk Committee – Audit and Compliance Committee Risk and capital management Statutory Board § 1.2.2 – Group Risk Committee – Credit Risk Committee – Market Risk Committee – Asset & Liability Committee – Compliance & Operational Risk Committee – Credit Committee – Product Board Implementation and review Group Risk Finance, Compliance Group Audit § 1.2.3 Management Reporting & Control Execution Private Evi Asset Merchant Treasury Restructuring Corporate § 1.2.4 Banking Management Banking & Recovery Banking 1.2.1 Supervision The decisions of the Statutory Board are taken during The Supervisory Board oversees the risks and capital meetings of the Executive Board.

In practice, forbearance measures do not always have the desired effect – i.e. the recovery of the client’s payment Tables 2.3.3.A through 2.3.3.G show the total volume of capacity or an end to the process of declining payment forborne exposures. We apply several types of forbearance capacity. This may for example be the result of a further measures (see Table 2.3.3.C). Following the decision to deterioration in the client’s financial circumstances or the apply such a measure, a loan remains under the supervision failure of those circumstances to improve as expected. of the Restructuring & Recovery department until the forbearance situation has ended. Such cases will be reanalysed and a strategy determined. However, the principle is explicitly maintained that the forbearance measure must be appropriate, sustainable and effective. Any new arrangements agreed with the borrower must also meet these strict criteria. A forbearance situation ends when the “non-performing” status has no longer been applied to the loan for a probation period of two years. The non-performing status must last a minimum of one year starting from the last forbearance measure. The client must moreover have made significant and regular payments of interest and/or principal during at least half of the probation period.

The standardised approach prescribes a set of rules for determining the required capital based on various Retail portfolio characteristics such as client type, loan type, collateral type, The retail portfolio comprises four sub-portfolios with the and external rating. Under F-IRB, banks are allowed to use following exposures: internal estimates of the probability of default (PD) in Mortgage exposures; determining the required capital.

Under A-IRB Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with total banks are allowed to use own estimates for PD, EAD and exposures up to €1 million. LGD. The PD is defined as the likelihood that a client will default within one year, the EAD is defined as the bank’s Risk management 135 The PD models are mostly based on behavioural aspects of the client and the LGD models on the underlying collateral. For the capital calculations a so-called downturn LGD is applied, i.e. the expected loss at default during an economic downturn. Estimation of the EAD is based on the limit and credit utilisation. Non-retail portfolio The non-retail portfolio comprises four sub-portfolios with the following exposures: – Commercial real estate exposures; – Exposures to holding companies that are clients with non-controlling interests and shareholdings; – Exposures to corporate clients; – Exposures exceeding €2,000,000 (excluding residential mortgages) to natural persons. For each of these sub-portfolios an internal PD model has been developed that uses behavioural and other client characteristics to estimate the PD. IRB equity portfolio The IRB equity portfolio includes our own positions in equities in the investment portfolio, subordinated receivables, non-controlling interests and shareholdings which appear on the company statement of financial position of F. van Lanschot Bankiers. We use the simple risk-weighted method to calculate the risk-weighted assets for positions in shares. In this method, a specific risk weighting (190%, 290% or 370%) is assigned to each position, based on a number of characteristics. A risk weighting of 250% is applied for significant investments in financial institutions which is not deducted from equity because they fall below the regulatory threshold. Positions taken in shares and subordinated loans of wholly owned subsidiaries are excluded from IRB. These are reported using the SA method. Other loans and advances The risk-weighted assets of the other portfolios (i.e. excluding retail, non-retail and equity) is calculated on the basis of the standardised approach. 2.5 Quality of loan portfolio As described in Section 2.4, the loan portfolio is divided into retail and non-retail loans. Different approaches are used for retail and non-retail loans to determine the risk profile of the portfolio. Retail portfolio The quality of the retail portfolio (see description in Section 2.4) is determined using statistical segmentation models. These models place retail loans in risk categories based on specific characteristics and statistical models. The loan portfolio is shown by risk categories at year-end in Table 2.5.A.1.

Strategic risk Essentially, then, we manage interest rate risk from both a Strategic risk can be defined as the threat to our results longand a short-term perspective. The short-term interest or equity resulting from failure to respond (adequately) rate risk is addressed mainly from a net interest income to changes in environmental factors, or from incorrect perspective (NII at risk). This involves an analysis of the strategic decisions. Environmental factors include the interest income under a number of market interest rate actions of competitors, clients, potential market entrants scenarios, relative to the baseline scenario. In 2017, all and public authorities. NII-at-risk scenarios remained within risk appetite limits. By December 2017, the most adverse scenario was one in 8. Interest rate risk which market rates fall by 100 basis points over the next Interest rate risk is the exposure of the banking book to twelve months, with Van Lanschot being unable to reduce adverse interest rate movements. Adverse interest rate savings rates sufficiently below the “natural floor” of zero movements may impact a bank’s current and/or future percent. Table 8.A shows the interest rate risk metrics in earnings, capital and market value. Interest rate risks in December 2017. non-banking book items are managed as part of market risk. Our main source of interest rate risk is the interest maturity mismatch between mortgages and loans on the one hand and savings and other funding sources on the other. In general, assets have longer fixed-rate terms than liabilities, Table 8.A Interest rate risk metrics 31/12/2017 31/12/2016 Net Interest Income (NII) at-risk –3.4% –4.2% Duration of equity (in years) 3 4 The long-term interest rate risk is addressed by using the book are not necessarily reported through profit and loss or economic value approach, which looks at how movements equity. Any value mutations are expected to materialise in interest rates impact the value of the bank’s assets and over time in the profit and loss statement, if interest rates liabilities. The main metric used in the economic value develop as indicated by forward rates and no corrective analysis is duration of equity. The duration of the bank’s management actions are assumed. equity indicates the net impact of parallel interest rate changes on its economic value. In 2017, duration of equity Tables 8.B and 8.C show Van Lanschot Kempen’s sensitivity was controlled by ALCO within a bandwidth of 2.8 to 3.8 to interest rate movements based on the contractual years. The duration of three years at year-end 2017 implies interest rate maturities of the respective line items. As the economic value of equity would fall by 2.9% (€40.7 savings and current accounts do not have fixed terms, million) if there were a parallel rise of 100 basis points in the balances of non-maturing instruments are mapped to interest rates. In the event of a parallel fall in interest rates the variable category. We use replicating portfolio models of 100 basis points, the value of equity would rise by 3.1% to estimate the interest rate sensitivity of non-maturing (€44.5 million). At year-end 2016, this sensitivity was deposits. €62.3 million. The full value of this impact cannot be directly linked to the balance sheet or profit and loss statement, as economic value movements in our banking Risk management 146 In assessing interest rate risk, we aim to minimise the impact of differences in accounting classifications, as these should not result in different profit and loss impacts from rate changes. Hence, parallel yield curve shift scenarios have virtually no impact on the result on financial transactions, because all investments designated at fair value through profit or loss are hedged using derivatives (see Note 4, Derivatives), for which market value changes are represented under the result on financial transactions. Hedge accounting is applied to offset changes in the market value of derivatives used to hedge portfolios classified at amortised cost.

Therefore we considered statements. these to be key audit matters as set out in the key audit matter section of this report.

IFRS 9 is not included as a key audit matter, as the Materiality – Overall materiality: €6.025 million. Audit scope – We conducted our audit work primarily in the Netherlands. – Site visits were conducted to Belgium and Switzerland. – Audit coverage: 99% of consolidated total assets, 97% of total revenue and, 99.8% of profit before tax. Key audit matters – Impairments of loans and advances to the public and private sectors. – Fair value measurement of financial instruments. – Reliability and continuity of IT-systems. Materiality The scope of our audit is influenced by the application of considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing materiality which is further explained in the section ‘Our and extent of our audit procedures on the individual responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’. financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both Based on our professional judgment, we determined certain individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall a whole and on our opinion. materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative Overall Group materiality €6.025 million (2016: €4.25 million). Basis for determining materiality We used our professional judgment to determine overall materiality. As a basis for our judgment we used profit before tax. Rationale for benchmark applied We used profit before tax as the primary benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, based on our analysis of the common information needs of users of the financial statements. On this basis we believe that profit before tax is an important metric for the financial performance of the Company and is widely used within the industry. Component materiality To each component in our audit scope, we allocate, based on our judgement, materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between €675k and €3.562k. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our allocated group materiality. Independent auditor's report 230 We also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements In total, in performing these procedures, we achieved the into account that, in our judgement, are material for following coverage on the financial line items: qualitative reasons. Total assets 99 % We agreed with the supervisory board that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit Profit before tax 99.8 % above €300 thousand (2016: €212.5 thousand) as well as Revenue 97 % misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. None of the remaining components represented individually The scope of our group audit more than 0.2% of total group assets, 1.2% of revenues and Van Lanschot Kempen N.V. is the parent company of a 1.7% of profit before tax. For the remaining components we group of entities. The financial information of this group is performed, among other things, analytical procedures to included in the consolidated financial statements of corroborate our assessment that there were no significant Van Lanschot Kempen N.V. risks of material misstatements within those components. We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we Where the work was performed by component auditors, we performed sufficient work to be able to give an opinion on determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the their audit work to be able to conclude whether sufficient management structure of the Group, the nature of appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for operations of its components, the accounting processes our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a and controls, and the markets in which the components of whole.

The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of complex items (including the items The group audit primarily focussed on the significant addressed below as key audit matter) are audited by the components: F. van Lanschot Bankiers N.V., Kempen & Co Group engagement team. By performing the procedures N.V., Van Lanschot Belgian Branch, F. van Lanschot mentioned above at components, combined with additional Bankiers (Schweiz) AG , Van Lanschot Participaties B.V. and procedures at Group level, we have obtained sufficient and AIO II B.V.

Key audit matter How our audit adressed the matter Impairments of loans and advances to the public and private sectors Our audit procedures included an assessment of the overall governance of See note 8 to the financial statements for the disclosures of loans and the credit and impairment process of the Company and the testing of advances to the public and private sectors including impairments, the operational effectiveness of the internal controls directly related to: paragraph ‘Impairments of loans and advances to the public and private – the identification of impairment triggers; sectors’ of the summary of significant accounting principles and subsection – the parameters and data applied in the impairment models, including 2 of the risk management paragraph containing the disclosures in view of the governance around the models and the model validation and credit risk. testing; and – the review and approval by management on the outcomes of the The gross loans and advances to the public and private sectors amount to individual impairments and the impairment models. €9.103 million, the total impairment as at 31 December 2017 amounts to €120.4 million. Independent auditor's report 231 We consider the impairment of loans and advances to public and private For impairments for individually identifiable impaired loans and advances, sectors a key audit matter as management applies significant judgment in we paid attention to the application which is used to identify and to the determination and recognition of these impairments, and complex calculate impairments for these individual items. We assessed the IT models and assumptions are utilized in the process combined with the controls around this application and determined that the calculations are in magnitude of the loans and advances to customer balances. As the alignment with the requirements of IAS 39. impairment of the loans and advances are significant to the financial statements, a change in assumptions may have a material effect on the We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purpose of our financial statements. audit. The impairment of loans and advances to the public and private sectors We substantively tested for a risk based sample of the loans and advances consists of two different components: the judgmental elements such as: – impairments for individually identifiable impaired loans and advances – classification as performing or non-performing loan based on the (‘individual items’); and (non-)existence of triggering events; – the model-based impairments for incurred but not reported losses – nature and accuracy of the expected future cash flows with reference (‘IBNR’). to current economic performance, assumptions most commonly used in the industry, and comparison with external evidence or historical The judgmental elements included in the impairment for individual trends; identifiable impaired loans and advances are: – the accuracy of the applied discount rate with reference to external – timely identification of impairment triggers; sources; and – the expected future cash flows; – the valuation of the corresponding collateral (for example using – the discount rate; and appraisal reports and/or other information) with support of our – the value and recoverability of the corresponding collateral. valuation experts, with reference to industry standards and the inspection of legal agreements and supporting documentation to The subjective elements included in the model-based IBNR concern: confirm the existence and legal right to collateral. – the probability of default (‘PD’); We found management’s judgments to be supported by available evidence. – exposure at default (‘EAD’); – loss given default (‘LGD’); and For the IBNR provision, the Company applies a model for the recognition – loss identification period (‘LIP’). and calculation of the impairment. We assessed the reliability of the data and checked the mathematical accuracy by re performing the extraction of data used and we assessed the outcome of the model validation reports as prepared by the Company. We tested the assumptions and data used for the collective impairment for IBNR provision, by assessing the accuracy of the applied EADs, PDs and LGDs based on reconciling these to the outcomes of the calculation model and by performing sample testing on the source data of the LIP. An area of focus in our assessment has been the accuracy of the LIP and actual incurred losses used as inputs for the expected loss. We found that the Group’s estimates and judgements used in the recognised impairments were supported by available evidence. We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures relating to impairments of loans and advances to the public and private sector. We evaluated compliance with disclosure requirements from EU-IFRS and the appropriate reflection of the Group’s exposures to credit risk. Fair value measurement of financial instruments Our audit included obtaining an understanding and testing of the See notes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 15 and 18 to the financial statements for the Company’s internal controls with respect to the governance over models, disclosures of the financial instruments valued at fair value and subsection financial instrument deal capturing, source data management and the 10 of the risk management paragraph in the financial statements: ‘fair valuation of financial instruments.

For each type of financial instrument in level 2 and 3, we tested, with The total asset value of financial instruments measured at fair value as at support of valuation specialists, on a sample basis, the outcome of 31 December 2017 amounts to €395 million and the total liability value management’s valuations process as follows: amounts to €971 million. – testing the appropriateness of the settings within the valuation models used with market practices; The fair value measurement of financial instruments consists of: – comparing on a sample basis the observable input data with – financial assets and liabilities held for trading; independent data sources and externally available market data (where – derivatives; available), which included assumptions and estimates such as market – financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or prices, credit spreads, (amongst others CVA/DVA) yield curves, loss; and correlations and volatilities; – available-for-sale investments. – evaluating the inputs and models used in determining the unobservable inputs via independent sources where available; For financial instruments traded in active markets and for which observable – independently re-performing, on a sample basis, the valuation using, market prices or other market information is available (level 1) there is the tested data in, where possible, our own valuation tools and with limited judgment involved in determining the fair value of these external data sources where available; and instruments. – assessing the appropriateness of the classification as either level 2 or 3.

Independent auditor's report 232 The fair value of such financial instruments is determined using valuation techniques (such as discounted cash flow models and option valuation models) in which judgements made by management and the use of assumptions and estimates such as market prices, credit spreads, (amongst others CVA/DVA) yield curves, correlations and volatilities are important factors.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the executive board is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the executive board should prepare the financial statements using the going-concern basis of accounting unless the executive board either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The executive board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company s financial reporting process. Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance which makes it possible that we may not detect all misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud, or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

Profit appropriation 237 PROFIT APPROPRIATION Articles of Association on profit appropriation Profit is appropriated in accordance with Article 32 of the Articles of Association. This article states that the dividend on Class C preference shares* must first be paid from distributable profits (Article 32(1)). The Statutory Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, will then determine what portion of remaining profits after dividend distribution on Class C preference shares will go to reserves (Article 32(3)). The portion of the profit remaining after the distribution on Class C preference shares and transfer to the reserves will be at the disposal of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, providing that no further distributions shall be made on Class C preference shares. If losses have been suffered in any financial year which could not be covered by a reserve or in any other way, no profit distributions will be made until such losses have been recovered (Article 32(5)). The Statutory Board may decide that a dividend distribution on Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares will be made in full or in part in the form of shares or depositary receipts rather than in cash. This decision is subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board (Article 32(8)). * There are no Class C preference shares in issue.

The Stichting pursues its purpose by acquiring Class C preference shares in the capital of Van Lanschot Kempen, and by exercising the rights attached to these shares. The Stichting and Van Lanschot Kempen have signed a call option agreement granting the Stichting the right to acquire Class C preference shares up to 100% of the value of Van Lanschot Kempen’s share capital in issue before the exercise of the call option, less one share. When acquiring Class C preference shares, the Stichting is required to pay a minimum of 25% of the nominal amount. To ensure it will be able to pay when the time comes, the Stichting has a funding agreement with ING Bank in place. Van Lanschot Kempen aims to keep any period with outstanding Class C preference shares as brief as possible, and has committed itself to a maximum of one year as the term within which Van Lanschot Kempen will propose to the General Meeting to redeem the Class C preference shares. The Stichting’s Articles of Association have been amended as from 22 December 2017. The amended Articles reflect the name change from Van Lanschot NV to Van Lanschot Kempen NV.
