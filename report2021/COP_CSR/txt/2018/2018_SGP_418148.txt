Shareholders are ultimately responsible for overseeing the implementation of their company‚Äôs long and short-term strategic plans; they play a crucial role in fostering an environment that will support the embedding of sustainability into the strategies of the companies they own. They must signal a willingness to their companies‚Äô management toward elevating social justice, creating business value and meeting regulatory & environmental responsibilities. They encourage and push their companies to set sustainability objectives that are in line with what makes the most sense for their businesses. The Denis family have embraced the journey toward sustainability as this was both a natural transition and adaptation of the Group‚Äôs historical values to the world of today. For a 155 year family-owned business, sustainability could ultimately be defined for the shareholders as the utmost desire to leave the most fitting family legacy: ‚óè a flourishing Group our employees are proud to work for, ‚óè reputable brands our customers are proud to shop for, and ‚óè a sustainable company that we are proud to own and to pass on to future generations.  The 5th generation of the descendants of Etienne Denis are indeed, very proud today to sign-off this inaugural ESG report.

We made a conscious decision to have a fundamental rethink of what manufacturing and marketing mean in today‚Äôs context. Sustainable manufacturing and marketing are strategic imperatives that reflect our company‚Äôs desire to deliver long term value to our shareholders as well as acting in our own self-enlightened interest to conserve the use of resources while achieving our corporate goals. Our role as CEOs is to initiate and supervise a comprehensive framework around sustainable manufacturing & marketing that would cover input and operations as well as the complete life cycle of the product. In this process, CEOs manage relationships between issues, objectives, policies and rules, and act to make them consistent with each other. The role of CEOs is also to gain management and employee support for the sustainability program, to act visibly and transparently, as actions put in place by top management provide the most powerful example to engage the entire company. CEOs should also encourage and reward the personal involment of staff in sustainability efforts to increase participation and to generate a strong feeling of ownership and commitment to the company‚Äôs sustainability strategy. As CEOs, we are willing to conduct the change at a ideal pace that allows our staff to adapt and to change their views and habits, and that delivers results consistently without over-promising. We are also, however, willing to lead the way in our markets and our business sectors. This is demonstrated in the report with many examples such as our involvement in SASPO, an initiative to promote the use of sustainable palm oil with WWF, our decision to have a significant part of our energy used in production sourced from renewables and the BCA Green Mark certification of all our buildings and facilities before 2030. As we embark on this exciting journey of sustainable manufacturing & marketing, , that we  position as a key pillar of our corporate policy, the company will reap the many benefits it offers: the protection of the environment, the prosperity of the community as well as an increase in productivity, profitability and enhancement to our competitive advantage.
