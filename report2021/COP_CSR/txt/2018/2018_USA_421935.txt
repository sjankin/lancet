We acted as a joint bookrunner to underwrite debt refinance for a precious metals mining company operating in an area of Latin America challenged with an increase in factions disrupting the rule of law in the area of the client’s operations. Bank ESG experts retained a third party consultant to review environmental, social and governance aspects of the client’s field operations and engaged the company executive team in enhanced due diligence to query them on ESG matters, and site and community security. The bank approved the underwriting as the client was able to demonstrate that they have been able to bring stability to both their location of operations and the immediately surrounding community and that other ESG concerns had been adequately managed. 2. We acted as a joint bookrunner in a bond issuance for a paper company operating in an area of Latin America that had faced allegations of environmental impacts attributed with their operations by an indigenous community. Bank ESG and business line experts conducted an enhanced review of environmental, social and governance Examples of deals requiring aspects of the client’s operations and engaged the company executive team as part 2017 additional review of the due diligence on the issues. The client’s upstream and downstream operations are certified to FSC forestry certification, one of the certification standards used by BAC as an acceptable standard on ensuring adherence to ESG norms. Discussion with the client and legal review of the issues demonstrated an adequate management plan and engagement with local stakeholders including the indigenous community. The bank approved the underwriting. 3. We acted as a joint bookrunner in a corporate-level bond issuance for a state owned power company for a country in Asia. The company has faced protest activity by environmental activists because of their use of coal fired power as a part of their energy mix for electricity generation. The ESG team conducted enhanced due diligence, evaluating the company’s strategy and commitment to diversifying its energy mix for power generation. The bank decided to move forward with supporting the bond issuance once the team was able to confirm the client’s track record in reducing dependence on fossil fuels and growth in their use of low carbon energy that includes both hydro and renewable energy sources. 8 Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework Reporting Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework (ESRPF) related items, relationships and transactions discussed by the responsible risk committees in 2017. 50 40 1 3 5 7 4 30 4 6 11 12 12 20 8 10 22 16 9 0 Environmental Agriculture and Forestry APAC Environmental & Social Financial Services EMEA Social Gaming Global 2 Hotels and Accomodation LATAM Energy and Extractives US 3 1 Other In 2017, we continued our process of tracking ESRPF related items, relationships and transactions discussed by the responsible risk committees.

We use an operational control approach to define our boundary. The base year for emissions reductions is 2010. Emissions are recalculated back to the base year when a change to a prior inventory would result in a change in emissions of 0.5% or greater. Scope 1 and 2 calculations are based on site-specific data for fuel consumed and utilities purchased, applying published emissions factors and global warming potentials (GWPs). Scope 3 calculations are based on data for the relevant activity, applying published emissions factors and GWPs. Where actual data is not available, estimates are made based on actual data collected in prior years. The gases included in the calculation of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are CO2 , CH4, N2 O, HFCs and PFCs. Our market-based GHG emissions include the impact of renewable energy certificates (RECs) purchased in the U.S. and Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) purchased in the U.K. All U.S. RECs purchased by Bank of America are Green-e certified. Emissions reflect supplier-specific emission rates where available, all of which comply with Scope 2 Guidance criteria. Emissions reflect residual mix factors for European facilities. Residual mix factors are not currently available for facilities outside of Europe. Location-based emission factors are used to quantify electricity-related Scope 3 emissions. *The methodology to calculate Scope 3 emissions in Category 1 and 2 changed in 2016. As a result, 2016 and later emissions in these categories are not comparable to emissions in prior years. 11 2017 Location-based emissions 2017 Market-based emissions Greenhouse gas emissions Units Scope 1 Scope 2 Total Scope 1 Scope 2 Total by region direct indirect Scope 1 direct indirect Scope 1 emissions emissions and emissions emissions and Scope 2 Scope 2 emissions emissions U.S. & Canada Metric tons CO2e 75,407 721,661 797,068 75,407 86,743 162,150 Asia Pacific Metric tons CO2e 1,477 76,559 78,036 1,477 76,559 78,036 EMEA Metric tons CO2e 5,281 35,786 41,067 5,281 8,164 13,445 Latin America Metric tons CO2e 131 2,047 2,178 131 2,047 2,178 2017 Location-based emissions 2017 Market-based emissions Greenhouse gas emissions Units Scope 1 Scope 2 Total Scope 1 Scope 2 Total by country direct indirect Scope 1 direct indirect Scope 1 emissions emissions and emissions emissions and Scope 2 Scope 2 emissions emissions United States Metric tons CO2e 75,253 721,452 796,705 75,253 86,534 161,787 India Metric tons CO2e 1,139 48,491 49,630 1,139 48,491 49,630 United Kingdom Metric tons CO2e 3,677 31,860 35,538 3,677 3,134 6,811 China Metric tons CO2e 162 13,577 13,739 162 13,577 13,739 Southeast Asia Singapore, Malaysia, Metric tons CO2e 45 6,189 6,234 45 6,189 6,234 Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia Japan Metric tons CO2e 80 5,020 5,100 80 5,020 5,100 Ireland Metric tons CO2e 570 1,065 1,635 570 1,886 2,456 Australia Metric tons CO2e 8 1,491 1,499 8 1,491 1,499 Italy Metric tons CO2e 173 893 1,066 173 1,029 1,201 Mexico Metric tons CO2e 59 937 997 59 937 997 South Africa Metric tons CO2e 18 443 462 18 443 462 Russia Metric tons CO2e 102 321 423 102 321 423 Canada Metric tons CO2e 154 209 363 154 209 363 12 2017 Location-based emissions 2017 Market-based emissions Greenhouse gas emissions Units Scope 1 Scope 2 Total Scope 1 Scope 2 Total by country direct indirect Scope 1 direct indirect Scope 1 emissions emissions and emissions emissions and Scope 2 Scope 2 emissions emissions Germany Metric tons CO2e 0 271 272 0 411 412 Saudi Arabia Metric tons CO2e 5 198 203 5 198 203 Brazil Metric tons CO2e 43 144 187 43 144 187 France Metric tons CO2e 11 29 40 11 22 33 Rest of world Metric tons CO2e 798 3,461 4,258 798 3,477 4,274 NOx, SOx, and other significant air emissions Units 2010 2015 2016 2017 from direct combustion SOx Metric tons 17 1 1 1 NOx Metric tons 45 25 21 20 CO Metric tons 56 38 33 31 VOC Metric tons 4 4 2 2 PM Metric tons 7 2 3 3 Metric tons Ozone depleting substances 14 17 14 12 CFC -11e Data are sourced from the Scope 1 and 2 inventory and records kept through our compliance program.
