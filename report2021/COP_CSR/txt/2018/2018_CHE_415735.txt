Communication on Progress UN Global Compact (COP) 2017 Editor: Christina Schönenberger Version: 1.00 Date: 03/09/2018 Statement of continued support by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) To our stakeholders: Within almost 90 years SFS has evolved from a family-owned Swiss company into an international group. However the strong roots are still in the St. Gall Rhine valley and the SFS values are transferred to all sites within the group by an appropriate management model. Sustainability in its actions has been the core driver of SFS since its foundation. For SFS sustainability means partnership with  customer  employees  community  supplier Therefore the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact have been implicitly part of the SFS business model since its first days and have a tradition of decades. I am pleased to confirm that SFS reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and AntiCorruption. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions and achievements to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. Since the SFS Group Sustainability Report as a part of the Annual Report 2017 (available on the SFS Group website annualreport.sfs.biz) is structured based on the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, it is directly used for this annual Communication on Progress as well. Thereby a consistent information towards our shareholders and stakeholders shall be achieved. Sincerely yours, Jens Breu CEO SFS Group AG Version 1.00 dated 09.03.2018 2 SFS Communication on Progress UN Global compact (COP) 2017
