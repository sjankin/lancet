UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT GLOBAL COMPACT NETWORK LEBANON COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017-2018 TABLE OF CONTENTS CHAIRMAN & CEO MESSAGE WHO WE ARE OUR IDENTITY WHAT WE DO SUSTAINABILITY ROADMAP SUSTAINABILITY FOR PEACEBUILDING PILLARS OF SUSTAINABILITY CREATING SHARED VALUE MODEL OUR APPROACH TO THE TEN PRINCIPLES HIGHLIGHTS OF 2017-2018 2 CHAIRMAN & CEO MESSAGE 3 In a country that has been torn by war and religious cleavages for far too long, Cornerstone Development envisioned a need to forge stability and prosperity by developing sustainable communities that are founded on the central pillars of social, economic and environmental responsibility. The Lebanese civil war has indeed devastated Beirut and left it in ruins. Existing efforts during the post-war period to rebuild the Downtown area have fallen short of reconciling housing, commercial, cultural, social and environmental facets of reconstruction, with the latter considered essential to promoting peace and reconciliation. At Cornerstone Development, sustainable development is our own customized approach to peace-building. Our development standards coincide with peace-building principles, in the sense that they go beyond mere physical construction efforts to encompass commitment to human well-being in the broadest sense, commitment to friendly and collaborative relationships and a determined effort to incrementally and interactively build a better and safer Lebanon. In 2016, we joined the UN Global Compact with commitment to contributing to sustainable global development by putting the newly launched UN 2030 agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the core of our work. We are proud signatories of the UN Global Compact and we believe it provides a great platform for engagement on sustainability and for making progress towards our vision. Moving forward, we will continue to endeavor to deliver on the UN Global Compact Principles and SDGs, which align well with our current strategy for sustainable and eco-friendly neighborhood development and peacebuilding through sustainability. ~ Anthony Stephan ~ 4 WHO WE ARE 5 OUR TEAM Our ventures would not have been successful without the hard work of our dynamic and creative team, and without the input of international experts.

At Cornerstone Development, sustainable development is our approach to peace-building. Our development standards coincide with peace-building principles, in the sense that they go beyond physical construction efforts, to encompass commitment to human well-being, commitment to friendly and collaborative relationships, as well as determined efforts to, incrementally and interactively, build a better and safer Lebanon. Cornerstone Development is guided by a vision that peace-building is grounded in processes that prevent the recurrence of violence and conflict, by tackling their root causes, through the strengthening of environmental sustainability, modeling of best practice governance, and the embracing of diversity. PILLARS OF SUSTAINABILITY In 2017, we officially framed our sustainability strategy for peace-building in committing to develop sustainable communities: socially, economically or environmentally; which will in turn constitute the central pillars of stability and prosperity, in a country that used to be torn by war for several years. “We believe that the most central pillar for stability, prosperity and growth is founded on developing sustainable communities; taking into consideration the triple bottom line: economic, environmental and social.” 10 Our strategy comprises three pillars of sustainability that together help in creating shared value: Figure 2 Creating Shared Value Model 11 GUIDING PRINCIPLES Our sustainability roadmap revolving around the three pillars also maps to some of the key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recently launched by the UN. The recent launch of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) opened up new opportunities for us to synchronize our efforts with broader development goals and aspirations in our attempts at creating shared value. Our efforts and strategy in the domain of sustainability encompass a parallel commitment to the following SDGs: These SDGs map in turn to the three pillars of our sustainability strategy as outlined below. These SDGs are helpful in channelling our efforts towards international norms and targets that are globally recognized complementing our core commitment to the ten UN Global Compact Principles that have served to guide our work in sustainability to date. We have been champions of the UN Global Compact since its official launch in Lebanon in 2015, and are on a journey of collective effort and transformation through making global gaols local business. In 2018, Mr. Anthony Stephan was one of the panellists during “Multi-stakeholder SDG Forum” at American University of Beirut with the presence of Dr. fadlo Khuri, President of American University of Beirut and Mr. Philippe Lazzarini UN Deputy 12 Special Coordinator, RHC, UNDP, Resident Representative. This event featured an impressive line-up of speakers representing the different stakeholders who are pushing the envelope in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Lebanon. Discussions revolved around the different roles of the public sector, civil society organisations & private sector in promoting our vision for a better Lebanon. Mr. Anthony Stephan has been presented as a Goal Keeper for SDG11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities). The same night, Mr. Anthony Stephan has been awarded for adopting and supporting SDG11 at Kempinski hotel in Beirut. Mr. Stephan was the first to join the SDG Council that was launched in 2017. He is championing SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. As such, he is expected to lead on the advancement of this SDG nation-wide and become the voice of it. The SDG Council provides strategic direction to Global Compact Network Lebanon in relation to making progress towards the SDGs, capitalizing on private sector leadership, engagement and involvement. This council also mobilize resources and forge the necessary national and international partnerships and stewardship to keep all progress and activities on track in relation to the SDGs. Finally, it also helps to further promote and support GCNL and track the progress being made on the SDG side in the private sector and in the context of nonprofits that are part of the network. For 2018, the SDG Council is playing a major role in supporting the nurturing and building of the necessary research infrastructure and the critical data we need to advance the SDGs in Lebanon To be able to advance the UN agenda 2030 in Lebanon, major gaps in data, statistics, and research need to be addressed. Mr. Stephan is providing the needed support to publish a report on SDG 11 in Lebanon, addressing the following topics:  Urbanization the case of Lebanon  Key Urban Issues  Drivers of urbanization  Managing Rapid Urbanization  The Lebanese Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) 13  The role of Municipalities in Lebanon  Transportation in Lebanon  Agriculture in Lebanon  Environmental Challenges  Informal Electricity in Lebanon  Assessment of sustainable construction in Lebanon  Urban mobility  The Lebanese construction industry  Challenges to sustainable construction in Lebanon  Improving Technical Capacity to Plan and Manage Cities  Key business themes addressed by this SDG  Recommendations 14 Figure 3 Creating Shared Value Model Mapped to the Sustainable Development Goals Through our well-rounded approach to sustainability practices and initiatives, we touch upon all the SDGs mapped in the figure above. In 2017, Cornerstone 15 Development pledged its support for making progress and contributing to SDGs 8, 9, 11, and 12 as they are most relevant to issues addressed in this year’s plan of action. CSR POLICY We have introduced a CSR policy in 2017 that highlights the guiding principles in the field of sustainability as well as underlines our strategy of peace-building through sustainable construction.

We continue to be committed to a high-quality work environment, where our employees feel valued to deliver the level of service our customers and shareholders expect and deserve. We always give high priority to employee development, given its significant role in improving quality, retaining talent, meeting external environmental pressures relating to competition, and change in work design. Our employee development approach invariably revolves around three pillars, training and development, coaching and mentoring, as well as continuous improvement. 23 Figure 6 – A Rounded Employee Development Process IMPLEMENTATION Our commitment to human rights is also reflected in how we deal with our employees, our workers and contractors, our suppliers, and how we run our day to day business with utmost collegiality and respect. Our commitment also permeates our community engagement efforts across their different facets. We are strong believers in Community Engagement and the power that community partnerships and engagement efforts brings to supporting and promoting human rights.  SUPPORTING EDUCATION Cornerstone Development is very dedicated to education. Therefore, we are sponsoring 4 schools: College De La Sagesse Ashrafieh, College Saint Joseph Antoura, College Mariste Notre-Dame De Lourdes Byblos, and College Notre-Dame De Jamhour. We also provided financial assistance to Lebanese students who are attending the prestigious French university Hec including covering their tuition. 24 Through its District//S Project, Cornerstone Development sponsored the Lebanese team that competed in the first Global Robotics Competition held in Washington D.C. in July 2017.  RUNSAWA INITIATIVE In 2016, we were involved in RUNSAWA, a key initiative implemented to support the Lebanese Autism Society and every individual’s right to equality, freedom from discrimination, and education. RUNSAWA was launched by a group of women, united by their passion for running, to fight for different causes every year, and conducting awareness seminars at the end of the run. Cornerstone Development supported the initiative’s first project, which adopted ‘Autism’ as its cause and the Lebanese Autism Society as its NGO of choice. The run collected a total of $116,236 from sponsors, donations and online donations. This amount highly contributed in educating almost 9 children with autism. 25  STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT As part of its stakeholder management strategy, Cornerstone Development holds a quarterly roundtable discussion with its construction contractors and suppliers to articulate and raise awareness about the company's human rights principles and set them as standards that other companies are expected to adhere to. Moreover, Cornerstone Development audits/evaluates its construction contractors on ground to ensure compliance with previously set guidelines for expected human rights conditions. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES In 2016, Cornerstone Development introduced its first Code of Conduct, which ensures that clear rules and ethical social norms govern all work aspects. The Code of Conduct covers major areas including employee conduct, conflict of interest policy, confidentiality and discrimination among other elements. Cornerstone Development intends to roll this Code of Conduct out to all employees next year, and conduct two trainings around it. In the area of equality, Cornerstone Development has been an advocate and supporter of gender equality, as reflected in the balanced employee representation and employee segmentation by the end of 2016, whereby half of the total workforce body comprises female employees. Cornerstone Development intends to continue to embrace and nurture this diversity and create meaningful career paths for women within the organization. Moreover, during 2016 and early 2017, Cornerstone Development advanced its commitment to education by covering the tuition fees of students in 4 private schools in Lebanon and in a prestigious university abroad. The company also took part in a social initiative by the Lebanese Autism Society to collect money to educate nine children with autism. As part of its stakeholder management, Cornerstone Development also intends to organize quarterly roundtable discussions with its contractors to ensure compliance with previously set guidelines and to raise awareness on the procurement manual. 26 AREA 2: LABOR RIGHTS 27 OUR COMMITMENT Cornerstone Development accords primary importance to its relations with its employees internally and to those of its partners and their laborers. Through its signature project District//S, Cornerstone Development works with more than 62 contractors, sub-contractors, and suppliers and employs around 500 workers on its construction site. Given the important role that contractors, suppliers, and laborers play in our operations and sustainability roadmap, we strive to build strong and respectful relationships with them on the basis of clear and responsible social and environmental principles that govern all of Cornerstone Development’s operations and engagement efforts from inception to completion. GUIDING PRINCIPLES The way Cornerstone Development governs its relations with laborers aligns with local labor and employment laws and is inspired by universal instruments and declarations, including core conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO). These instruments guide Cornerstone Development’s commitment to equal opportunity, diversity & minorities’ protection, non-discrimination, and abolition of child labor. OUR POLICIES In the area of labor, Cornerstone Development takes action internally and externally. The Code of Conduct governs the internal environment at Cornerstone Development 28 with respect to labor rights. In addition, our progressive HR policy clearly outlines the rights of employees, including their compensation and benefits, as well as their respective responsibilities. For external stakeholders that Cornerstone Development conducts business with, a set of policies and procedures has been established to ensure that these companies and organizations endorse responsible practices that guarantee workers their fundamental rights at work. IMPLEMENTATION  EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK In 2017, Cornerstone Development’s Management Team worked on developing its Employee Handbook to help its employees understand the main benefits, policies & procedures and code of business conduct and ethics that apply to their status as a Cornerstone Development employee. All the main policies and procedures outlined in the handbook have been set according to the Lebanese labor law. In brief, below is an outline of the main points highlighted in the handbook: SUBPART CONTENT COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS/CONFLICT OF INTEREST/CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES/ COMPETITION AND FAIR DEALING/DISCRIMINATION AND CODE OF BUSINESS HARASSMENT/HEALTH AND SAFETY/RECORDCONDUCT AND ETHICS KEEPING/CONFIDENTIALITY/PROTECTION AND PROPER USE OF COMPANY ASSETS/REPORTING ANY ILLEGAL OR UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR/COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES/VIOLATION OF CODE/ ACKNOWLEDGEMENT/CODE OF ETHICS CHART.

Both of these constitute important milestones for Cornerstone Development in the domain of labor rights. The Employee Handbook helps employees to understand the main benefits, policies, and procedures and code of business conduct and ethics that apply to various aspects of their employment within the organization. The handbook covers elements such as the code of business conduct, employment and salary policies, business travel and expense regulations, attendance and leave policies and various aspects of compliance. The Policy for Health, Safety and Security on the other hand was developed for the District//S Project to ensure that all work on site is carried out according to statutory provisions and that all reasonably practicable measures are taken to avoid risk to employees or others that may be affected. In 2018, Cornerstone Development intends to conduct multiple trainings to roll out and introduce the Employee Handbook and the Policy for Health, Safety and Security to all internal stakeholders. 32 AREA 3: ENVIRONMENT 33 OUR COMMITMENT Our commitment to the precautionary principle and to environmental responsibility is a differentiator of how we run our business. We continue to build on the momentum we have created by being regional pioneers in the development of the first sustainable neighbourhood project in Lebanon. Our Environmental pillar thus showcases our Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and how we rely on an ecofriendly approach, products and solutions, across our District//S project. We also implement various green initiatives that contribute to the greening and improvement of the ecosystem around us. GUIDING PRINCIPLES To ensure its compliance with the three UNGC principles of environmental protection and driven by its vision to be a trail-blazer in Lebanon and in the region through a sustainable approach for vibrant neighborhoods, District//S applied to and was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. Cornerstone Development is the first company in Lebanon, the Arab World and the Mediterranean Basin to adopt the LEED Neighborhood Development standards. This makes Lebanon the fifth country worldwide where a company is granted LEED for Neighborhood Development certification, according to the USGBC LEED rating system. LEED is a point-based rating system devised by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) to evaluate the environmental performance of a building over its life cycle and to encourage market transformation towards sustainable design. 34 OUR POLICIES  LEED CERTIFICATION The LEED rating system provided Cornerstone Development with a framework of policies and practices that it can follow to ensure responsible provision over environment issues and the prevention and management of environmental risks. According to LEED Neighborhood Development standards, District //S is the first sustainable neighborhood in Lebanon, the Arab world, and the Mediterranean basin. The prize judges called District//S: “A comprehensive response to the historic character of Beirut, going well beyond the superficialities of appearance to reflect the cultural and functional nature of the city.” District//S Wins the Sustainable Development Award at SEA Gala Dinner: The Social Economic Award (SEA) is the first award of its kind in Lebanon. It is a pioneering initiative in the region that presents awards to institutions for their CSR initiatives, during a gala dinner that gathers the social and economic elite. Leading local and international companies are selected, based on transparent categorization, 35 according to international standards criteria. Various fields like banking, trade, industry, education, franchising, promotion of welfare, campaigning for a better environment, or even preserving the Lebanese identity, history and heritage, are duly represented. In other words, the SEA is awarded to a company that is capable of creating a long lasting positive national impact. It is in this context that District //S won the Sustainable Development Award of 2016, thanks to its innovative take on the development of a sustainable and eco-friendly neighborhood, located in the heart of Beirut; which aims to better the Lebanese ecosystem, environment as well as promote a healthier and cleaner lifestyle. Moreover, Mr. Anthony Stephan has been awarded for adopting & supporting SDG11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities) in 2017 and Top Real Estate Developer in MENA region/Forbes magazine in 2017. AIMING FOR GOLD Cornerstone Development is looking ahead to earn 11 more points to step its game to the next level and earn the Gold LEED Certificate. Figure7 Where is District //S?  SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT As part of its procurement policy, Cornerstone Development ensures that it integrates sustainability considerations into procurement planning by applying Sustainable Procurement (SP). SP is the practice of integrating requirements, specifications and criteria that are compatible with and in favor of the protection of the environment, social progress and the support of economic development, primarily by seeking 36 resource efficiency, improving the quality of products and services and optimizing costs. Recognizing sustainability in a procurement transaction is best obtained at the specification stage. Project Managers are advised to include eco-labels and social labels as part of the technical specifications and to specify sustainable production and process methods, as long as these do not materially impact upon fair and nondiscriminatory competition. Project Managers are recommended to consider the following aspects when preparing procurement requirements and to apply them during the evaluation process: o Sustainability related reference in the procurement notice which conveys the relevance of sustainability in the specific procurement transaction; o Specific identification of environmental/sustainability conscious potential bidders/subcontractors and vendors which may be well positioned to fulfil the procurement requirements; o Formulate qualification requirements with a view to bidders/subcontractors/vendors’ demonstrating good sustainability records; o Ensure bidders/subcontractors and vendors have the necessary sustainabilityrelated qualifications and capacity, i.e. previous experience, environmental management systems, etc.; o Specify and use quantifiable sustainability criteria together with other technical evaluation criteria; o Allow the submission of alternative offers with sustainable options; o Consider life-cycle-costs and recycling costs as part of the commercial evaluation; o As part of the qualification requirements, perform background and reference checks for their record of social and environmental responsibility. It is expected that the sustainability outcome of the procurement process will be enhanced by taking into account social and environmental impacts along with traditional economic and efficiency considerations – at various stages of the procurement cycle. 37 IMPLEMENTATION  ECO FRIENDLY APPROACH “At District //S, we rely on ecofriendly products and solutions that breathe life back into our cities.” LEED 2009 FOR NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT CORNERSTONE DEVELOPMENT’S LEED PROJECT SECURED TOTAL SCOREBOARD POSSIBLE SMART LOCATION & LINKAGE PREFERRED LOCATION 7 10 BROWNFIELD DEVELOPMENT 0 2 LOCATIONS WITH REDUCED AUTOMOBILE DEPENDENCE 3 7 BICYCLE NETWORK AND STORAGE 1 1 HOUSING AND JOBS PROXIMITY 2 3 STEEP SLOPE PROTECTION 1 1 SITE DESIGN FOR HABITAT OR WETLAND AND WATER BODY 1 1 CONSERVATION RESTORATION OF HABITAT OR WETLANDS AND WATER BODIES 0 1 LONG-TERM CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT OF HABITAT OR 0 1 WETLANDS AND WATER TOTAL 15 27 NEIGHBORHOOD PATTERN & DESIGN WALKABLE STREETS 8 12 COMPACT DEVELOPMENT 6 6 MIXED-USED NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS 4 4 MIXED-INCOME DIVERSE COMMUNITIES 0 7 REDUCED PARKING FOOTPRINT 1 1 STREET NETWORK 2 2 TRANSIT FACILITIES 0 1 TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT 0 2 ACCESS TO CIVIC AND PUBLIC SPACES 1 1 ACCESS TO RECREATION FACILITIES 1 1 VISITABILITY AND UNIVERSAL DESIGN 1 1 COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND INVOLVEMENT 0 2 LOCAL FOOD PRODUCTION 38 0 1 TREE-LINED AND SHADED STREETS 2 2 NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS 1 1 TOTAL 27 44 GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE & BUILDING CERTIFIED GREEN BUILDINGS 0 5 BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY 0 2 BUILDING WATER EFFICIENCY 0 1 WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPING 1 1 EXISTING BUILDING USE 0 1 HISTORIC RESOURCE PRESERVATION AND ADAPTIVE REUSE 0 1 MINIMIZED SITE DISTURBANCE IN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION 1 1 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT 0 4 HEAT ISLAND REDUCTION 0 1 SOLAR ORIENTATION 0 1 ON-SITE RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES 0 3 DISTRICT HEATING AND COOLING 0 2 INFRASTRUCTURE ENERGY EFFICIENCY 0 1 WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT 0 2 RECYCLED CONTENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE 0 1 SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE 0 1 LIGHT POLLUTION REDUCTION 0 1 TOTAL 2 29 INNOVATION IN DESIGN VISIBILITY AND UNIVERSAL DESIGN 1 1 DIVERSE USES 1 1 TREE-LINED STREETS 1 1 30% IN INFRASTRUCTURE EFFICIENCY 0 1 INNOVATION IN DESIGN 0 1 LEED ACCREDITED PROFESSIONAL 1 1 TOTAL 4 6 REGIONAL PRIORITY CREDITS REGIONAL PRIORITY: NPDC6 1 1 REGIONAL PRIORITY: SLLC9 0 1 REGIONAL PRIORITY: REGION DEFINED 0 1 REGIONAL PRIORITY: REGION DEFINED 0 1 TOTAL 1 4 LEED CREDIT CATEGORIES SMART LOCATION AND LINKAGE 15 27 NEIGHBORHOOD PATTERN AND DESIGN 27 44 GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILDING 2 29 INNOVATION IN DESIGN 4 6 REGIONAL PRIORITY CREDITS 1 4 TOTAL 49 110 39 We rely on a sustainable eco-friendly approach, which reflects the sourcing of our products, and the way we planned and organized our District //S Project. o Building materials employ recyclable content and technologically developed eco-friendly systems with an emphasis on energy saving. o Featuring a strategically located unique parking facility that helps ease the congestion in Beirut and therefore reduce carbon dioxide emissions. o Relying on solar-powered thermal heating and street lighting to help cut electricity requirements, and on water re-use systems to reduce wastage. o Featuring biking racks and preferred parking spots for hybrid and electric cars, to aid in remarkably reducing the carbon footprint within the city. o Using stone cladding and installing tall louvered shutters to allow the buildings and the rooms to cool during the summer and therefore cutting energy consumption. LEED PROJECT SCOREBOARD Specifically, the table above embodies LEED’s credit-based voluntary system which allows projects to earn points for environmentally friendly construction of a building and its surrounding.  ALLEVIATING NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES By employing sustainability best practices and featuring green solutions in its signature project, Cornerstone Development significantly contributes to the elimination of various costs associated with environmental mismanagement, hence minimizing economic burden and preserving the environment at once. For example, District //S helps solve the Downtown area parking problem by featuring a strategically-located parking facility displayed on 6 levels that can accommodate over a 1,150 underground parking spaces. This helps ease the congestion in Beirut and alleviate negative economic externalities. Our District//S project also features biking racks and preferential parking spots, to leave room for hybrid and electric cars, all of which helps ease congestion and alleviate the carbon footprint within the city. Traffic congestion is a serious issue in Lebanon and it has generated unpleasant consequences which affect the lives of Lebanese citizens and residents. First and foremost, the issue is largely due to the lack of an organized public transportation 40 system in Lebanon as well as facilities that can accommodate the increasing number of private cars owned. This has caused drivers to double park and clog the road. This problem is intensified in Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon, where conditions are described as mostly congested with a daily traffic volume of 315,000 cars crossing the north and southern highways as estimated by a study done by the IPT Energy Center in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment, ESCWA, and UNDP. In particular, the Downtown area of Beirut and its surrounding district is where many companies and educational institutions are located. The traffic problem has therefore resulted in an economic loss due to the cost of traffic associated with wasted time on the road, excess fuel consumption, prolonged harmful vehicle emissions, and higher vehicle operating costs. By featuring a strategically-located parking facility displayed over 6 levels, District //S eases the congestion and its consequential ramifications in Beirut and the Downtown area by providing 1,150 underground parking spaces. With its goals to “The transport sector alone accounts for 22% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Lebanon.” always pursue healthier and greener solutions and its ambition to cultivate a culture of environmental and social protectiveness, District //S has made it a priority to feature biking racks and preferential parking spots for hybrid and electric cars with a deeper vision of instilling healthy habits in its residents. Bikes have been proven to decrease the need for cars and they are particularly relevant for Lebanon given the low occupancy rate of 1.2 people per vehicle. Along with hybrid and electric cars, bikes will contribute to a decrease in the carbon footprint or the amount of carbon dioxide released by vehicles in Lebanon, which is around 1.6 tons a year per single vehicle. By employing sustainability best practices and featuring green solutions in its signature project, Cornerstone Development significantly contributes to the elimination of various costs associated with environmental mismanagement, hence minimizing various economic burdens and preserving the environment at once. 41  1 TREE PER METER SQUARE In partnership with Jouzour Loubnan, a non-governmental organization committed to the forestation of arid regions in Lebanon, Cornerstone Development’s District //S will plant a tree for every square meter sold. We view responsibility as an approach for how businesses conduct their work. At Cornerstone Development, we demonstrate responsibility by implementing solutions to problems we see in our everyday life and trying to mitigate any inevitable drawbacks that could be induced by our own practices. The population growth in Lebanon over the recent years has increased the demand for residential occupation and consequently building-construction projects. Driven by its belief that socially responsible developments are a cornerstone for the rebirth of a stable and prosperous society, Cornerstone Development saw the opportunity to satisfy these occupational needs through its signature project. The core concept of District //S is to challenge the conventional approach of construction by bringing state-of-the-art ecofriendly products and solutions that instead of misusing our country’s land, brings back life into it. For that reason, Cornerstone Development partnered with Jouzour Loubnan, a nongovernmental organization committed to the forestation of arid regions in Lebanon, and committed to plant a tree for every square meter of District //S sold. For its 120,000 square meter residential and retail space, District //S will plant around 120,000 trees that not only contribute to increased greenery space in Lebanon but also absorb around 1,200 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. 42  ENVIRONMENTAL MENTORSHIP Cornerstone Development took part in an environmental accelerator, ENVIRONMATE, as a mentoring partner to one of the participant teams. As a mentor, Cornerstone Development provided the team with the resources, including an overview of LEED, to create a proper framework that grows their idea into viable implementation. ENVIRONMATE is a competition-based accelerator launched by the Global Compact Network Lebanon in 2017. The initiative invites young professionals, including university students, to submit an idea for a home-grow solution which addresses one of today’s most urgent energy and environmental challenges in Lebanon. 43 MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES After delivering its procurement manual to contractors and sub-contractors, Cornerstone Development is working on ensuring that all of its construction partners work in compliance with the policies and conditions outlined in the procurement manual. Cornerstone Development intends to have a training for all contractors to introduce them to the essence of this procurement manual and entice them to adhere to its provisions. By relying on solar-powered thermal heating and street lighting to help cut electricity requirements, the signature project of Cornerstone Development, District//S, contributes to reducing energy consumption within this complex by 60%. Moreover, using stone cladding and installing tall louvered shutters allows the buildings and the rooms to cool during the summer and therefore cut energy consumption. Moreover, the project’s green space of 9,000 m2 is expected to absorb carbon dioxide and release enough oxygen for 155 individuals to breathe. District//S also contributes to decreasing carbon footprint through the following practices:  Easing the congestion problem by featuring a strategically-located parking facility displayed on 6 levels that can accommodate over a 1,150 underground parking spaces;  Featuring biking racks and preferred parking spots for hybrid and electric cars that will contribute to a decrease in the carbon footprint or the amount of carbon dioxide released by vehicles in Lebanon, which is around 1.6 tons a year per single vehicle; and  For its 120,000 square meter residential and retail space, District //S will plant around 120,000 trees that not only contribute to increased greenery space in Lebanon but also absorb around 1,200 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, one acre of trees has the ability to remove 13 tons of particles and gases annually. 44 AREA 4: ANTI-CORRUPTION 45 OUR COMMITMENT The real estate business is a multifaceted business process; it involves working with many stakeholders through every step of the value chain and performing activities like the acquisition of land and obtainment of government approvals.
