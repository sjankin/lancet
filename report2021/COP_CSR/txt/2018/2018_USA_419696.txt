K-C also routinely encourages employees to report concerns to anyone in management with whom they feel comfortable as part of its compliance culture. Such claims, no matter how received, are thoroughly investigated. Kimberly-Clark commits to respect all human rights by having a policy commitment to do so, engaging in ongoing human rights due diligence and having processes embedded in our business to remediate human rights impacts. A foundational component of our remediation process is the myriad of formal and informal grievance mechanisms in our business. Our formal grievance mechanisms include those provided via our Code of Conduct: 1. Formal process which allows anyone around the globe to report a concern around compliance with our Code of Conduct 2. Annual acknowledgment ‚Äì Annually we ask Kimberly-Clark employees to acknowledge they have read and understand our Code of Conduct and understand that they have an obligation to raise concerns regarding violations of the Code. 3. Corporate Social Compliance Audits ‚Äì We conduct over 100 audits of key suppliers annually. As a part of this activity we review a given supplier‚Äôs compliance with our Corporate Social Compliance Standards and local wage, hour and payroll laws. These audits include a random sampling of supplier employee interviews. 4. Consumer Reporting ‚Äì Users of products around the globe may report concerns via toll-free calls or via the internet. 5. Informally, we receive and investigate incidents of grievances from employees, suppliers and consumers around the globe. 6. Kimberly-Clark collaborates with global unions on an ongoing basis to discuss a variety of global labor issues with a goal to continue to foster open, productive communications. GRI 103-3 Evaluation of the REPORT SECTIONS ‚Äì Welcome to Our 2017 Sustainability Report; Materiality management Assessment, Report Development and Stakeholder Engagement approach GRI 201-1 Direct economic TABLE ‚Äì Business Data and Financials value generated 10-K (pg. 10) and distributed GRI 201-2 Climate change risks At Kimberly-Clark, the majority of our operational greenhouse gas (GHG) Principle 7 emissions result from energy use at our manufacturing facilities. In line with our Essentials for a Better Life vision, we strive to address issues like reducing our carbon footprint by understanding how it affects all aspects of our business ‚Äì from regulatory complexity to cost implications to environmental and social concerns. To manage and reduce the GHG emissions from our operations, we have developed a corporate-wide GHG inventory of the three major greenhouse gases. These are Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4) and Nitrous Oxide (N20). Using the right Global Warming Potential Multipliers, these three types of emissions are combined and expressed into a single indicator called Carbon Dioxide equivalent (CO2e). All the GHG emissions reported internally and 51 Kimberly-Clark 2017 Sustainability Report GRI # DESCRIPTION CROSS-REFERENCE/DIRECT ANSWER UNGC GRI 201-2 externally are expressed in Metric Tons of CO2e, following the Greenhouse Gas (continued) Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) issued by the World Resources Institute (WRI). All the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party entity to provide limited assurance of their accuracy and completeness. Moving forward as part of our next generation goals aligned with Sustainability 2022 strategy, Kimberly-Clark set a goal of reducing GHG absolute emissions from manufacturing by 20% from a 2005 baseline. The three strategies considered and dimensioned as tools and drivers to deliver GHG reductions are the following: 1. Execution of rapid payback energy conservation/efficiency improvement projects and energy best practices adoption. 2. Deployment of behavior-based LEAN Energy transformation in Kimberly-Clark manufacturing facilities worldwide, as a tool to implement a facility energy management system; funded in three fundamental pillars: a) Mindset, Behaviors and Capabilities b) Management Infrastructure and c) Operational Systems. 3. Execution of alternative energy projects including renewable energy such as biomass boilers, cogeneration plants and renewables such as solar and wind fueled electricity. Kimberly-Clark has been tracking its GHG emissions since 2005. The GHG emissions reduction progress has been 18% from 2005 to 2017. Kimberly-Clark identified some inherent climate change risks that have the potential to generate a substantive change in its business operations, revenue and expenditure. One example of risk driven by changes in regulation is the carbon tax in some of the countries/regions where K-C operates. K-C participates in the European Union Trading Scheme and is closely following the development of proposed climate emissions legislation in the United States and in other 34 countries where Kimberly-Clark has business interests related to its manufacturing or raw material sourcing. The company has built a database to track the existing and emerging carbon legislation in those countries where Kimberly-Clark operates, studying in particular the development of carbon legislation in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mexico. One particular example, which originally became law, was the carbon tax scheme in Australia, where Kimberly-Clark at that time had three manufacturing sites: Albury, Ingleburn and Millicent. A carbon pricing scheme in Australia was introduced by the Gillard Government and became effective on 1 July 2012, and was in operation until it was repealed by the Australian Senate on 17 July 2014. The scheme required entities which emit over 25,000 tons per year of Carbon Dioxide equivalent greenhouse gases and which were not in the transport or agriculture sectors to obtain emissions permits. The price per ton of emitted CO2 in 2012-2013 was $23; and $24 in 2013-2014. Kimberly-Clark is actively looking for other alternatives, such as renewable energy; for instance, in September 2017, it was announced that Kimberly-Clark will power North American mills with renewable wind energy, through agreements to annually purchase approximately 1,000,000 megawatt hours (245 megawatts ‚Äì MW) of electricity from two new wind power projects in Texas and Oklahoma. To support the growth of renewable energy sources, Kimberly-Clark has signed on to the Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers‚Äô Principles, a collaboration of leading companies seeking simplified access to the renewable electricity to meet their clean and low-carbon energy goals. One description of risk driven by changes in physical climate parameters is the change in temperature extremes; for instance, Sitio del Nino Mill, in El Salvador, is the biggest manufacturing facility within the Latin American Operations of Kimberly-Clark; with almost 10% of the volume of the region. Approximately 35% of the electricity in El Salvador is generated from hydraulic sources; extreme temperatures in the summertime have high impact on the availability and price 52 Kimberly-Clark 2017 Sustainability Report GRI # DESCRIPTION CROSS-REFERENCE/DIRECT ANSWER UNGC GRI 201-2 of electricity due to the reduction of levels in rivers and dams, driving high (continued) costs of electricity. In 2013, this mill had the highest cost of electricity among Kimberly-Clark, at almost $200 per megawatt. Additionally, constant outages from the electrical grid resulted in production loss and other internal equipment failure, impacting the operation‚Äôs overall efficiency. At the same time, the only certified sludge disposal supplier decided to double the cost to dispose sludge. To help offset, Kimberly-Clark initiated the LEAN Energy management system to help optimize energy efficiency.

Our sourcing processes seek to balance responsible sourcing standards and support for local supplier options while optimizing total delivered cost inclusive of material cost and transportation. As a result, a significant amount of purchases are made with local suppliers where possible, while recognizing that some purchases must be made where suppliers are available on a global basis.

We planned and performed our work in accordance with the AA1000 Assurance standard 2008 (AA1000AS). We were engaged to provide an AA 1000 Type 2 assurance, which covers evaluation of adherence to the AA1000 AS assurance principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness. We also reviewed the reliability of specified sustainability performance information to a moderate level of assurance. In addition, as criteria for our assurance work, we used the GRI 101 Foundation guidelines which set out the Reporting Principles for defining report content and quality and the ISO standard 14064-3: Greenhouse gases Part 3: Specification with Guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions. The information and presentation of data within the Sustainability Report is the responsibility of Kimberly-Clark. This statement is the responsibility of WSP and represents our independent opinion. The intended users of this statement are the readers of the Kimberly-Clark Sustainability Report and it is intended for this statement to be read in its entirety. Our assurance team has the appropriate experience and competency to complete this assurance engagement. WSP has a Quality Management System (QMS) which is certified to BS EN ISO9001 under which all our work is managed. The WSP Assurance team is not working for Kimberly-Clark beyond what is required of this assignment. Methodology for Adherence to the AA 1000 accountability Principles and GRI Our work was conducted between March and May 2018. We tested, on a sample basis, the processes and management practices used to adhere to and evaluate adherence to the AA1000AS Accountability Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness. The GRI Reporting Principles of ‚Äòstakeholder inclusiveness‚Äô and ‚Äòmateriality‚Äô for defining report content are very similar to the AA1000AS principles. In addition, we also tested adherence to the GRI Reporting Principles of ‚Äòsustainability context‚Äô and ‚Äòcompleteness‚Äô and to the GRI Reporting Principles for defining report quality of accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness. Evidence gathering for evaluating adherence to the Principles included: ‚Ä¢ Understanding and testing the processes used to adhere to and evaluate adherence to the AccountAbility Principles and the GRI Reporting Principles. ‚Ä¢ Inquiring of management, including senior management at executive and functional levels, and of relevant management responsible for the day to day management of sustainability, about the effectiveness of processes used to manage and evaluate the sustainability impact of Kimberly-Clark. ‚Ä¢ A review of the output of Kimberly-Clark‚Äôs 2016 materiality review and strategy based updates and how the AA1000 inclusivity principle has been addressed. ‚Ä¢ Observing and inspecting management practices, process testing and evidence gathering across the organization on a sample basis. ‚Ä¢ Collecting and evaluating documentary evidence and management representations that support adherence to the principles. 68 Kimberly-Clark 2017 Sustainability Report INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT (Continued) Methodology for Assurance of Sustainability Performance Data WSP‚Äôs review of specific sustainability performance data used ISO14064-3 as a guideline under the AA1000AS standard as the umbrella standard. Currently there is no assurance guideline specifically for water, waste, or energy. Therefore, WSP has applied the principles from ISO14064-3 to the Greenhouse gas emissions, water, waste, and energy assurance. The performance data review has been conducted to a limited level of assurance including evaluation of the adequacy of the collection, processing, consolidation and internal reporting of data. The WSP inventory and management system review consisted of a desktop review of supporting data and an output of the 2017 inventory and data files from the Kimberly-Clark internal sustainability data management system. WSP Opinion On the basis of the work conducted nothing came to our attention to suggest that the Sustainability Report does not meet the principles, content and quality requirements of AA1000AS for a Type 2 Moderate Level of Assurance and the GRI Reporting Principles. WSP has found no evidence that Kimberly-Clark‚Äôs 2017 GHG, energy, waste and water inventory is not materially correct, is not a fair representation of the corresponding data and information or has not been prepared in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. We have made the following findings and conclusions with respect to the AA1000 (2008) principles and the GRI Reporting Principles. INCLUSIVITY ‚Äì Kimberly-Clark has systems in place for internal and external stakeholders to participate in the development of the organization‚Äôs response to sustainability issues. The 2016 materiality assessment process helped identify the links between stakeholder participation and the determination of Kimberly-Clark‚Äôs sustainability issues. During 2017, a cross section of internal stakeholders was consulted by a third party organisation to provide confirmation to Kimberly-Clark that stakeholder reporting needs were being met through the sustainability reporting. Stakeholders also have opportunity for engagement in relation to the Sustainability Program via regular internal and external stakeholders interactions throughout the year. Stakeholder participation is also encouraged across all regions and sites through the network of sustainability coordinators. It is acknowledged that the Sustainability Report needs to be globally representative. Some local Sustainability reports have also been produced during 2017 to address local stakeholder requirements. Kimberly-Clark is developing a process for ensuring that local issues as well as global sustainability issues are appropriately addressed. SUSTAINABILITY CONTEXT and MATERIALITY ‚Äì Kimberly-Clark completed a sustainability materiality assessment in 2016 which determined the relevance and significance of issues that are material to its sustainability performance. The materiality assessment process was used to identify the issues which have been presented in the 2017 Sustainability report. This materiality assessment followed a clear process for identifying business risks which was informed by engagement with stakeholders, societal and peer-based norms, financial considerations and policy based performance. The materiality assessment was reviewed during 2017 to ensure that the process and identified issues reflected stakeholder interests and expectations and the activities of Kimberly-Clark during 2017. This demonstrates an ongoing determination to prioritize and report on material sustainability issues. The report presents performance information concerning Kimberly-Clark‚Äôs direct activities in the wider context of sustainability as well as its value chain and considerations to geographic contexts are made where appropriate. Page 2 of 4 69 Kimberly-Clark 2017 Sustainability Report INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT (Continued) It will be important for the materiality process to show application and integration on an ongoing basis across site, regional and group levels of the organization. Consideration should be made to producing regional materiality matrices in addition to the global materiality matrix to ensure that regional variations can be documented and addressed as appropriate. RESPONSIVENESS and REPORT QUALITY The Kimberly-Clark Sustainability Report provides stakeholders with a globally representative explanation of changes in the organization throughout the year, and reports on performance on all the key material issues. Data is provided to support qualitative statements where available and the accuracy of data is audited internally before it is presented in the Sustainability Report. Assumptions and techniques used for estimation are included as part of this review process. The Sustainability 2022 portal on the Kimberly-Clark website provides additional information and links to other sustainability communications including regional sustainability reports. It should be noted that sustainability communications such as regional reports are not subject to the same level of internal assurance as the global report. This has been identified as an area for future focus for Kimberly-Clark to address the need for responding to local stakeholders while ensuring global alignment and consistency of strategy and communications. Kimberly-Clark also communicates with employees on a variety of sustainability issues through team meetings, email communication, noticeboards and the intranet. Responses are made to sustainability requests from customers and other stakeholders as they arise. It is noted that that consideration is being made to providing additional on line sustainability data and information which could be used to increase the frequency of reporting beyond the annual reporting cycle. Improved access of information to local audiences is also planned through the use of regional reports and translation of the global report. GRI REPORTING PRINCIPLES FOR DEFINING REPORT QUALITY ‚Äì It is our opinion that the Sustainability Report meets the GRI Reporting Principles for defining report quality of accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness. Completeness ‚Äì The report includes coverage of material topics and their boundaries, sufficient to reflect significant economic, environmental, and social impacts, and to enable stakeholders to assess the reporting organization‚Äôs performance in the reporting period. Accuracy ‚Äì The reported information is considered sufficiently accurate and detailed for stakeholders to assess the reporting organization‚Äôs performance. Balance ‚Äì The reported information reflects positive and negative aspects of the reporting organization‚Äôs performance to enable a reasoned assessment of overall performance. Performance information is presented to show year on year comparison and the achievement or otherwise towards goals set. Clarity ‚Äì The report presents information in a manner that is understandable and accessible to stakeholders with the appropriate use of tables and diagrams and stories to help present information. It is noted that future reports are likely to be translated into different languages which is to be encouraged to aid accessibility of the report to a wider geographic audience. Comparability ‚Äì Sustainability data are selected, compiled and reported in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards, Core level which are best Page 3 of 4 70 Kimberly-Clark 2017 Sustainability Report INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT (Continued) practice benchmarks which allow for comparison relative to other organizations on a year by year basis. Reliability ‚Äì The reported information is gathered, recorded, compiled and analyzed in a way that it can be subject to examination, and that establishes the quality and materiality of the information. The information and data in the report is subject to rigorous internal audit review. The internal audit process together with the external assurance of the Sustainability report and specified reporting information using a recognized best practice standard ensures that the report can be relied upon. Timeliness ‚Äì The information in the report clearly indicates the time period to which it relates and this is presented alongside data from previous years to aid comparability of data year on year. RELIABILITY OF SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE INFORMATION We have evaluated the systems and processes used to collate and report the scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, select scope 3 GHG emissions (purchased goods and services, capital goods, fuel and energy related activities, waste generated in operations, end of life treatment of sold products, and investments), energy, water, and waste performance data for 2017 and have been able to obtain an AA1000:2008 moderate level of assurance in respect of the data which is reported in the Sustainability Report. This level of assurance is equivalent of a limited assurance under ISO 14064-3. The findings of the assurance engagement provide confidence in the systems and processes used for managing and reporting sustainability performance information. Data trails selected were identifiable and traceable, and the personnel responsible were able to reliably demonstrate the origin(s) and interpretation of data. The internal sustainability data management system compares data entries against a band of expected values to flag significant anomalies in the data. Kimberly-Clark collects the specified performance data monthly and quarterly reviews by the Kimberly-Clark Sustainability Corporate team enables data to be analyzed more frequently and as a result Kimberly-Clark can more actively identify data anomalies and improvement opportunities for sites not meeting their improvement goals. A few errors in the reporting of waste, water or energy were identified during the assurance exercise; These include missing hazardous waste data at the Barrow site and missing corrugate at the Jenks site identified through audits of the sites. However, these did not have a material impact on reporting at Kimberly-Clark Group level. All errors were corrected prior to the Sustainability Report being published. A more detailed summary of the review process, findings, and recommendations for Kimberly-Clark to consider implementing for future reporting have been provided in a separate ‚Äú2017 Kimberly-Clark Data Assurance Review Findings Report‚Äù.
