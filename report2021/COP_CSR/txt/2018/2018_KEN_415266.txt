The Obuya-Star Field Partnership was formed to develop cricket in Kenya, and to use the sport to develop society. Since reaching the World Cup Semi-Final in 2003, Kenyan cricket has been in decline and through this partnership, the aim was to bring the sport back to its glory days by supporting young talent interested in the sport through getting at least 150 young cricketers signed to sports clubs and academies by the end of the tournament. The tournament included children aged between 8 – 19 Years old to help kick-start this revolution. Furthermore, through the determination to use cricket to develop society, 8 out of the total 48 teams included under-privileged children from various public schools, which would open the door for them to participate in cricket as professionals by developing their cricket skills and provide them with an education. Enthusiastic fans keenly watching the cricket match 20 Environmental Responsibility Tree Planting  On 30th April this year we participated as an organization in a tree planting exercise held at Kereita forest. We successfully planted 2001 trees in this CSR activity aimed at conservation and environment sustainability. Kapa management pledged its participation in the coming years in this noble initiative. Energy efficiency  The company has been amongst the first to be awarded a compliance certificate by ERC in 2017. Water Consumption  Kapa is continuously striving to reduce its water foot print and during the last year reduced overall consumption with over 3 Million Litres.

There was reduced biomass consumption in 2017 by 24% largely due to new boiler installation. IDO consumption reduced overall by 2% compared to 2016. 23 Energy Efficiency – New Boiler Kapa generates mainly liquid waste which can pose an environmental concern. To mitigate any environmental effects, the company operates an effluent treatment plant which processes all industrial liquid effluent to ensure it complies with the statutory requirements before discharging to the Sewer Line. In this regard, TDS, BOD and COD is closely tracked and controlled. All sewerage effluent is treated by Mavoko Water and Sewerage Company. Additionally, the company uses a Biomass boiler whose main fuel are agricultural process wastes and therefore avoids cutting of trees. With the versatility of this boiler, different types of fuels can be burnt at high efficiency and the fuel gases passed through a bag filter to reduce particulate load to the environment. New Boiler House The company’s raw materials used in operations are recycled and therefore there exists minimum wastes. With the plastic ban on carrier bags and secondary packaging, the company has complied with statutory regulation on types of packaging. By introducing a highly efficient boiler that can run on agricultural wastes products, the company has greatly reduced if not eliminated the cutting down of trees for firing boilers. This means that no trees are cut to sustain operations. Kapa has introduced limited solar heating systems for water heating which is environmental friendly as a source of energy. All processes which emit gases with particulate load are passed through bag house filters to reduce the particles dumped in the environment. Boiler Fuel – Coffee Husks 24 Community Engagement Kapa recognises that its social responsibility to the community is integral to its business.

In return, we have received queries and guided on ethical dilemma that employees are faced with as they work. Our recruitment provides equal opportunities for all qualified applicants. Work Environment We believe in order to maintain healthy organizational culture, strong ethical codes need to be followed. Every individual has to play his own role. Apart from creating a healthy culture it also helps to avoid employee lawsuits against the employer. We hold regular sessions on ethics and how to approach ethical dilemmas among staff. We challenge management staff to hold regular discussions with employees to work through potential ethical issues that may come up and find ways to brainstorm through them as a team. If everyone is on the same page, it is more likely that the team as a whole will adopt the same types of ethical behaviours. Our Employees To affirm our commitment to ethical behaviour within the Company, we have included the ethics awareness training in our new employees orientation programme and the executive visibly demonstrates the commitment to ethics during these sessions. The company’s policy is also that it will not use, be complicit or benefit from forced labour in compliance with the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. 33 Health and Safety We have boosted Health & Safety Awareness in our organisation. Our staff are encouraged to be aware of safety issues and we ensure that all our meetings start with a safety talk. We hold Health & Safety meetings every month where all issues are brought to light and addressed immediately. By law we are required to carry out the quarterly workplace Staff in their PPE’s in our Soap and Detergent plants safety inspection. This is a walkabout of the factory done by the safety committee members to check for health and safety aspects such as any signs of hazards in the workplace (e.g. unguarded moving parts of machinery, slippery floors without any warning signs) and general safety awareness among staff as noted from their adherence to requirements such as use of PPE’s and observance of safe working practices while carrying out tasks.
