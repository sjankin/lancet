Energy is critical to the continued growth of many African countries. While efforts to provide energy have been plentiful, the reality is that few projects have succeeded. Having the skillset to transform an energy idea into an operational reality remains critical on the continent. 360 MW Lekela was established to do just that: to deliver competitively priced, clean, reliable generating renewable power energy quickly and at scale.

The challenge of providing affordable, reliable power is a recurring theme across the continent, and lack of access to energy is considered a significant constraint on growth. Lekela believes this challenge can be met by using the potential of the continent’s extensive renewable resources. With the continued improvements in solar and wind technology, we are determined to harness this energy to help secure Africa’s path to sustainable growth.

We are proud to have achieved this in partnership with our construction and development teams. By working together to overcome challenges, we delivered 280 MW of renewable power to the South African grid, on time and on budget. Between this time and the scheduled commercial operations date in December 2017, the two sites generated over 150 gigawatt hours (GWh) of early operating energy – enough electricity to power 33,000 South African homes for a year. The Loeriesfontein and Khobab sites, both with 140 MW capacity, constitute South Africa’s largest combined wind farm development. Noupoort wind farm Our first wind farm has now been operating successfully for over 18 months. In 2017 our operations and maintenance engineers have kept the site running with excellent reliability, ensuring that the South African grid has a dependable low-carbon power source available – Noupoort wind farm when the wind is blowing. Noupoort generated just over 293 GWh of power in 2017.

Environmental stewardship is integral to achieving this goal and is incorporated at the centre of strategy from initial project screening right through to decommissioning.

To do this we set out an environmental management approach that begins at project acquisition. Lekela proactively responds to environmental risks and works to mitigate our impact from construction through to decommissioning.
