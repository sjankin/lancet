For Teijin, I think choosing think sharing such a vision throughout the organization and personnel from both the materials and healthcare sides of the bringing together people with differing views can bring business to establish a pipeline between the two will close the about innovation. gap and make networking easier. I think it is important to accelerate work being done now by having employees cross those boundaries while they are young through personnel exchange with each business. Who is to handle this selection of personnel with purpose? Since criticism comes with the territory, I think the job clearly requires a skilled hand. Namely, management. To further elaborate, the mindset that personnel transfers diminish employees’ standing needs to be changed. Conversely, personnel transfers need to be positive. Unless that is assured, really good people are not going to be selected. This is the idea of open innovation.

I think that lifting up younger people and seeing what this type of changing the balance does, brings forth creative friction. Fortunately, the outlook is bright for Teijin’s businesses. There is major potential in growth fields. If something was needed, I would say it is more young people.

Another key the case that management does not own it. For that reason, opportunities, and so evaluation of such particular supervisors is having a vision.
