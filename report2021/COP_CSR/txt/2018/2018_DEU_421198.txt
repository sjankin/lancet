Similarly, the restructuring information to management and investors regarding present expenses that we eliminate in deriving our profit (nonand future business trends relating to our financial condition and IFRS) numbers are likely to recur should SAP perform results of operations. restructurings in the future.  The revenue adjustment for the fair value accounting of the acquired entities’ contracts and the expense adjustment for acquisition-related charges do not arise from a common conceptual basis. This is because the revenue adjustment aims to improve the comparability of the initial post-acquisition period with future postacquisition periods, while the expense adjustment aims to improve the comparability between post-acquisition periods and pre-acquisition periods. This should particularly be considered when evaluating our operating profit (non-IFRS) and operating margin (non-IFRS) numbers as these combine our revenue (non-IFRS) and expenses (non-IFRS) despite the absence of a common conceptual basis.  Our restructuring charges resulted in significant cash outflows in the past and could do so in the future. The same applies to our share-based payment expense because most of our share-based payments are settled in cash rather than shares.  The valuation of our cash-settled share-based payments could vary significantly from period to period due to the fluctuation of our share price and other parameters used in the valuation of these plans.  In the past, we have issued share-based payment awards to our employees every year and we intend to continue doing so in the future. Thus, our share-based payment expenses are recurring although the amounts usually change from period to period.

An example is the work carried out by SAP employees in Christchurch, New Zealand. In 2017, our volunteers engaged with four organizations that were established following the catastrophic 2010 and 2011 earthquakes. Initiatives such as Cultivate Christchurch, Ethique, Kilmarnock, and Science Alive! are all playing a key role in the ongoing revitalization of the city, with regards to both business and the post-traumatic recovery of its citizens. Teams taking part in the SAP Social Sabbatical initiative were embedded within these organizations to build operational capacity, identify key strengths and weaknesses, and inform strategic growth decisions for the ultimate benefit of 5,190 estimated beneficiaries.

Key initiatives for 2017 included the following: – EKOenergy certification Most of our renewable electricity is purchased on the electricity market and is not produced by SAP. As recommended by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and CDP, we actively look for the best available quality. Therefore, all of our purchased renewable electricity is EKOenergy certified. EKOenergy is the international not-for-profit ecolabel for energy. It certifies electricity from renewable energy installations that fulfil additional sustainability criteria. Through the purchase of EKOenergy, we also contribute to EKOenergy's Climate Fund, used to finance solar projects tackling energy poverty. – Electric vehicles As a result of our business expansion, the number of SAP employees eligible for a company car has increased annually. We want to ensure that the resulting growth in our car fleet does not undo our successes in cutting emissions. To help address this, SAP aims to increase the number of electric vehicles (battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) in our company car fleet from 5% at the end of 2017 to 20% by 2020. All electric company cars charged at SAP are powered with 100% renewable electricity. In addition, in Germany, we provide employees with an incentive to switch to electric alternatives by offering a battery subsidy that partially offsets the higher costs of an electric vehicle. – Internal carbon pricing for business flights We continue with our program introduced in 2015 to reduce the impact of air travel by SAP employees. In addition to avoiding business flights by investing in virtual collaboration and communication technologies, we invest in carbon emission offsets for air travel in the majority of countries we travel from by charging an internal carbon price. This offset effort resulted in a compensation of 135 kt in 2017. – Investment in carbon credits In 2017, we continued to realize the benefits of our investment in the Livelihoods Fund. Several years ago, we made a commitment to invest €3 million covering a 20-year participation in a fund that supports social causes as well as the sustainability of agricultural and rural communities worldwide. The returns from this unique investment in the Livelihoods Fund consist of high-quality carbon credits. Following the success of this scheme, we plan to invest in a second Livelihoods Fund in 2018, increasing our commitment to sustainable initiatives. In 2017, the carbon credits we received helped us to offset our carbon footprint by 21.4 kt. 92 Combined Management Report | Energy and Emissions Financial Performance: Review and Analysis +6% +12% +26% cloud and software revenue (IFRS) profit after tax (IFRS) new cloud bookings Economy and the Market conditions.

However, we estimate the probability of occurrence of this risk to be remote. We classify this risk as a medium risk. Consolidated Risk Profile Following SAP’s overall strategy towards the cloud powered by SAP HANA, we have revised the structure of our risk report to better reflect the risks of our adapted risk profile. We consolidate and aggregate relevant risks identified by the different business units and functions following our risk management policy, monitored by a Group-wide risk management governance function. Based on our aggregation approach, we recognized only minor changes in 2017 in the percentages of all reported risks categorized as “high” or “medium” in our risk level matrix. The number of risks categorized as “high” accounted for 17% (2016: 11%) of all reported risks, while the risks categorized as “medium” accounted for 52% (2016: 67%) of all risks reported in the Risk Factors section. In our view, considering their impact level and likelihood of occurrence, the risks described in our aggregated risk report do not individually or cumulatively threaten our ability to continue as a going concern. Management remains confident that the Group’s earnings strength forms a solid basis for our future 136 Combined Management Report | Risk Management and Risks Expected Developments and Opportunities Future Trends in the Global spending, loosening financial conditions alongside increasing monetary accommodation and improving terms of trade will Economy support the Brazilian economy over the medium term.

However, information. 162 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS and Notes | Notes Despite the change from an incurred loss to an expected credit loss model, we do not expect our impairment allowances for trade receivables and other financial assets to be materially different from what they would be if we continued our current accounting policies. Hedge accounting We will apply the new hedge accounting requirements prospectively. The types of hedge accounting relationships that we currently designate meet the requirements of IFRS 9 and are aligned with our risk management strategy. Thus, all existing hedge relationships that we have designated in effective hedging relationships in the past will still qualify for hedge accounting under our new policies. In contrast to our current policies where fair value changes related to the forward element and foreign currency basis spreads have been recognized in profit or loss immediately, the respective costs for forward contracts designated in an effective hedging relationship are recorded in other comprehensive income under our new policies. Thus, the forward element and foreign currency basis spreads are recorded as cost of hedging in other comprehensive income. However, this is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosures IFRS 9 will require extensive new disclosures. Our assessment included an analysis to identify data gaps against current processes, and we are in the process of implementing the system and controls that we believe will be necessary to gather the necessary data to be able to provide the required disclosures where they are material. IFRS 16 (Leases) On January 13, 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16. We will adopt IFRS 16 as per its effective date of January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. The new standard will significantly impact especially the lease accounting by lessees as, in general, all leases need to be recognized on a company's balance sheet (represented by right-of-use assets and lease liabilities). We plan to use practical expedients offered by the standard (such as short-term leases, low-value leases, and no separation of non-lease components of a contract). Due to the adoption of IFRS 16, we expect the total assets and total liabilities to increase, as right-of-use assets / lease liabilities will have to be recorded for those items that were previously “off balance sheet”; operating profit is also expected to increase, as costs that were treated as rental expenses in the past will have to be presented as interest expense going forward. As the effects of applying IFRS 16 will depend on the lease agreements in effect at the time of adoption, the IFRS 16 impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements cannot be estimated reliably.

Values assigned reflect our past experience and our expectations regarding an increase in the addressable markets. Budgeted operating margin Operating margin budgeted for a given budget period equals the operating margin achieved in the current fiscal year, increased by expected efficiency gains. Values assigned reflect past experience, except for efficiency gains. Pre-tax discount rates Our estimated cash flow projections are discounted to present value using pre-tax discount rates. Pre-tax discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approach. Terminal growth rate Our estimated cash flow projections for periods beyond the business plan were extrapolated using segment-specific terminal growth rates.

For 2017, that report is as follows: The management of SAP is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. SAP’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of SAP’s CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). SAP’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment under these criteria, SAP management has concluded that, as at December 31, 2017, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued its attestation report on the effectiveness of SAP’s internal control over financial reporting. It is included in the independent auditor’s report on the Consolidated Financial Statements as at December 31, 2017.

This option indicates that a report contains the minimum information needed to understand the nature of the organization, its material topics and related impacts, and how these are managed. The Further Information on Economic, Environmental, and Social Performance includes information that is required to comply with the GRI Standards.

It also reveals why through profitability. and how something such as employee engagement ultimately leads to gains or losses in business performance. We believe that such insights are a prerequisite for fully modeling the financial impact of non-financial performance. Using Cause-and-Effect Analysis To create and validate these chains of cause and effect, we turned to both internal and external stakeholders. We started with those inside SAP, meeting in small groups that rigorously examined the impacts of activities related to each of our nonfinancial indicators. Next, we conferred with external stakeholders, including academics, financial investors, and industry peers, to vet our findings. Finally, we used real data from SAP to translate our cause-and-effect chains into a quantified impact on operating profit. Documenting Financial Impact Since 2014, SAP has used techniques such as linear regression analysis to document the financial impact of four non-financial indicators. We assess each indicator to see what a change of 1pp (or 1% for carbon emissions) would mean for our operating Figure 1: Connectivity Between Social, Environmental, and profit.

We believe that engaged employees are likely to want to help SAP achieve our target in lowering GHG emissions. Yet another possible outcome is that a higher level of employee engagement may lead to more business activity requiring travel, and therefore could lead to an increase in GHG emissions. GHG Footprint > Growth Lowering SAP’s GHG footprint could have a positive impact on SAP’s revenue because customers increasingly ask their suppliers to act sustainably. This reasoning is supported by a study by PwC (2013) confirming the existence of a positive correlation between a company’s environmental performance and financial performance.29 On the other hand, where additional travel is conducted to generate additional business, the resulting increase in SAP’s GHG footprint could have positive impact on growth. GHG Footprint > Customer Loyalty We believe that lowering SAP’s carbon emissions has a positive effect on our reputation, thereby enhancing SAP’s standing with our customers.

In 2017, we encouraged open dialog through coffee corner sessions, virtual all-hands meetings, and social media. In addition, SAP includes sustainability in its onboarding training for new hires as well as management or line of business (LoB) specific training.

Maintaining High Standards Across Our Supply Chain We expect all our business partners to respect human rights and to avoid complicity in human rights abuses. Our codes of conduct for suppliers and partners require them to uphold labor rights and to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. In addition, we may carry out on-site audits to assess performance. Respecting Human Rights Throughout Our Product Lifecycle As reflected in our human rights risk assessment, we are committed to respecting human rights throughout the lifecycle of our products – from design through development to use. We develop innovative solutions that help customers embed human rights standards into their business and supply chain strategies. For example, our customers can use the SAP Ariba Supplier Risk solution to gain the intelligence and transparency they need to understand human rights risks within their supply chains. They can then make informed procurement decisions that may improve lives. When designing any solution, our development teams ensure that the product complies with human rights standards. For example, accessibility is a key area of focus and we follow Web content accessibility guidelines such as the Section 508 standards to ensure inclusive design in all our software. The protection of personal information is another key area of focus for our development teams. To help ensure that our products enable our customers to respect digital rights, we adhere to robust privacy and security standards. These are defined in our global product development, quality, product standards, and data protection and privacy policies.

It strives to ensure that diverse activities meet high sustainability standards. businesses have a fair chance at competing for contracts and are treated equally with other SAP suppliers. Targeted to reach What We Buy and Where We Buy a 5% spend ratio for diversity suppliers in selected countries by It From 2020, the GPO will proactively involve diversity suppliers in selected categories in defined countries into our sourcing At SAP, we consider our suppliers to be key partners in our process. In 2017, we started a pilot project in the two business success. In 2017, we spent more than €5 billion in procurement categories ‘Services and HR’ and ‘Marketing’, transactions with nearly 16,000 suppliers worldwide. aimed at identifying a potential diversity-certified supplier for every bidding process whenever applicable.

It enables the procurement departments of our customers as well as our GPO to identify, manage, and mitigate sustainability risks within our supply chain. These risks include, for example, unethical practice, workplace discrimination, workplace safety neglect, the use of child labor, human trafficking, and environmental disasters such as oil spills and radioactive contamination. In addition, this innovative solution helps SAP measure due diligence activity and report on information-sharing programs across the supply chain. By providing insights into supplier risk, the solution enables us to detect early warning signals, minimize costly disruptions, and proactively monitor risk factors for each supplier. In this way, SAP can prioritize its corporate responsibilities, quantify the impact it wants its business to have, and identify the critical issues affecting the supply chain. SAP also works closely with suppliers to find new ways to make our supply chain more sustainable. We have a number of ongoing projects that minimize our impact on the environment in areas such as enterprise mobility, catering, office supplies, and SAP events. Our chief procurement officer and chief sustainability officer meet each quarter to discuss progress and challenges related to embedding sustainability in our procurement practices.

By promoting company133 wide initiatives, we dispose of less waste and reduce the amount of water we use in locations worldwide. A global approach 106 combined with local targets and initiatives ensures that we optimize our environmental performance. Taking steps to recycle our waste and save water also contributes to our business performance. Through ongoing initiatives at SAP sites, we reduce our operational costs while engaging our employees in our efforts. 2016* 2017 Managing Our E-Waste * E-waste for 2016 was recalculated. The rise in e-waste stems Our e-waste comes from the data center servers, IT equipment largely from recycling more servers in EMEA. including PCs, peripherals, and a range of mobile devices. Our servers and IT equipment are either resold or recycled in an environmentally friendly manner depending on their condition. In 2017, we continued our engagement with our international Cutting Down on Landfill Waste sustainable e-waste disposal partner. In addition, we work In 2017, we continued to roll out ‘zero waste’ diversion programs together with local e-waste disposal partners.

Among other improvements, this sets printers to produce double-sided, black-and-white printouts as a default. In 2017, we continued our approach of paperless contracting. By using the SAP Signature Management application from DocuSign to enable electronic signatures, we have been able to handle 60,702 pages of contract, cutting down on paper contracts significantly. We have also successfully changed working behavior to significantly reduce the amount of pages that our employees print. A secure pull-printing system requires that employees bring their ID badges to a printing device to activate a job. This ensures better document security, and makes people think Further Information on Economic, Environmental, and Social Performance Waste and Water 243 about whether the printout is really needed.

This is calculated as the number of reportable accidents × 1,000 employees/number of fulltime equivalents. Reportable accidents are work-related and include commuting accidents that result in more than three days of absence from work. In 2017, the TMQ was 3.6 (3.6 in 2016). We also measure the accident rate per one million working hours. In 2017, this value slightly increased to 2.4 reportable accidents per one million working hours (2.3 in 2016). 403-3 There are no workers with a 3, 8 high incidence or high risk of diseases due to their work within SAP. 403-4 Stakeholder Engagement √ SAP 8 405-1 GRI Content Index √ SAP 5, 8 405-2 SAP does not tolerate SAP 5, 8, 10 discrimination on any basis; this includes our commitment to equal pay for men and women for work of equal value.

Our respective statement for 2017 is as follows: The Executive Board is aware of its responsibility to ensure the integrity of the SAP Integrated Report 2017. The members of the Executive Board have applied their collective mind to the preparation and presentation of our integrated report. Similar to previous reports, we have applied the Guiding Principles of the <IR> Framework, but we also must ensure our compliance with legal requirements, such as the provisions regarding financial reporting in the German Commercial Code as set out in detail in the German Accounting Standard 20 Group Management Report, while balancing other reporting standards such as the GRI Standards of the Global Sustainability Standards Board, with the <IR> Framework. Our Executive Board has reviewed the SAP Integrated Report 2017, including the consolidated financial statements, the combined management report, as well as the additional information on economic, environmental, and social performance. Our Executive Board believes that the integrated report is presented in accordance with the <IR> Framework as far as possible given the aforementioned restrictions.
