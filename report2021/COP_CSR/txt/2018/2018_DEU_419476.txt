We are an air carrier, licensed by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) according to EU-OPS1, our Maintenance Organization (MRO) is certified according to EASA Part 145. Our air ambulance operations are certified by EURAMI (European Medical Institute). As a certified airline, we obtain parts only from suppliers providing us with a certificate of origin. During the reporting period of 2017 we received parts from approximately 105 suppliers, of those 85% came from companies in the United States of America, 10% came from Germany, 1% came from Canada and 1% came from the United Kingdom. 102-10 Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain During the reporting period there were significant changes in terms of the size, structure or ownership of the organization. On April 27, 2017 FAI's new 4,800 m² carbon neutral maintenance hangar, known as Hangar 8 at Albrecht Dürer Airport (NUE) in Nuremberg was completed. It represents an investment of € 7 m and has created at least 10 new local engineering jobs, plus a number of other support positions. FAI rent-a-jet AG was able to increase the fleet to a total amount of 23 aircraft. 102-11 Precautionary principle or approach Our organization addresses the precautionary principle as follows: Our headquarters in Nuremberg are carbon neutral. Also, in all of our facilities water savers are in place to reduce our daily use of fresh water. Part of the electricity used is generated from our own photovoltaic system on the roof of Hangar 7 . For environmental reasons we use biogas instead of the common (cheap) gas. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2017 FAI Sustainability Report 2018 10 102-12 External initiatives Our organization endorses or supports external charters, principles and initiatives listed in the table. United Nations Global Compact Rio Declaration, principle 15 The precautionary principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development is implemented at the company level among other things as stated in the companies Code of Conduct. 102-13 Membership of associations Our organization is a member of associations and interest groups listed in the following table: EURAMI (European Aero-Medical Institute e.V.) EBAA (European Business Aviation Association) GBAA (German Business Aviation Association e.V.) MEBA (Middle East Business Aviation) ABAA (African Business Aviation Association) United Nations Global Compact ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2017 FAI Sustainability Report 2018 11 Strategy 102-14 Statement from senior decision-maker Dear Readers, FAI rent-a-jet AG is among the leading providers of air ambulance and VIP charter services worldwide and still improves its performance every year in economic, social and environmental areas. FAI stands for individual mobility for its customers and sustainable solutions at the same time. FAI is one of the 10 largest operators in General Aviation in Europe and the largest business jet operator in Germany. FAI Group’s fleet of 22 jet aircraft and one turboprop includes four Bombardier Global Express jets, six Bombardier Challenger 604s, 11 Learjet 60s, one Learjet 55 plus a Premier 1A and a King Air 350. In 2017 FAI recorded an operational income of approximately € 77 Mio. Besides the headquarters at Albrecht Dürer Airport Nuremberg (EDDN), FAI operates satellite offices in Dubai and Miami, as well as a line station in Dakar. On April 27, 2017 our third hangar at Albrecht Dürer Airport Nuremberg was completed. The new hangar, known as Hangar 8, represents an investment of € 7 Mio. and increases FAI’s hangar floor by another 4.500m², bringing the total usable space of the facility to 14.000m², representing one of the largest carbon neutral FBO’s in Europe. The hangar’s carbon neutral status was achieved by purchasing additional carbon credits from the European Union Emissions Trading System. These credits are being used to support worthwhile projects around the world to neutralize greenhouse gas emissions. This latest development will complement FAI’s existing Hangars 6 and 7, both of which are certified carbon neutral and will continue to serve base maintenance needs. In May 2017 FAI rent-a-jet AG was awarded the prestigious 2017 Gold Safety of Flight Award by the European Business Aviation Association (EBBA) during the EBACE Convention’s 40th annual event in Geneva, Switzerland. The Gold Award is awarded to member companies operation business aircraft for forty years or 80,000 hours without an accident. Since 2005 FAI is an active member of the United Nation's Global Compact. This membership reflects FAI's efforts in economic and social efforts and ecological areas. Corporate responsibility and the reporting of corporate responsibility strategies and programs at FAI continue to be a work in progress. While initiatives and programs, as well as progress from year to year are discussed, we recognize the need to report quantifiable metrics and targets, in particular as they relate to our social performance and economic impact. These are a lot of goals to reach for FAI and we are willing to reach and improve them every year. Please follow us on our way.

These are published in the Federal Gazette Bundesanzeiger (www.bundesanzeiger.de). Enter FAI as a search term. The Company is managed by the Executive Board, consisting of four (4) executive members. The Executive Board is responsible for all decisions regarding economic, environmental and social impacts. 102-46 Defining report content and topic boundaries In order to define the material aspects and boundaries of the report, we used as a foundation the quick check of the sustainability software 360report. In the first step, we evaluated the data base in the GRI stakeholder survey of the sector air transportation (primarily passenger air transportation), in order to take the size of FAI rent-a-jet AG into account. In the second step, we adapted the materiality matrix using an initial selection of indicators and aspects. This adaption as well as the selection of relevant indicators are based on the contribution of the Executive Assistant to Chairman and were carried out in consultation with Members of the Board. Once the materiality was defined, 360report answered and worked on the questionnaires. This was done in close collaboration with the staff of Human Resources, Operations, Accounting as well as other staff members and the experts from 360report. Aspects and indicators, whose materiality was classified as low or very low and were not taken into consideration in this report. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2017 FAI Sustainability Report 2018 18 102-48 Restatements of information Our organization has previously reported on sustainability issues. Compared to the previous Sustainability Report there are changes in the statement of information. FAI-rent-a-jet AG has published a sustainability report in previous years. As this report becomes more detailed, 360report software gave us the opportunity to comply with this. 102-49 Changes in reporting In comparison to the previous Sustainability Report there have been no changes in the scope of report of material topics and topic boundaries. Please also refer to 102-48 102-51 Date of most recent report The last sustainability report has been published in the year 2017 for 2016 . ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2017 FAI Sustainability Report 2018 19 102-52 Reporting cycle Our report is published on a yearly basis. 102-54 Claims of reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2017 FAI Sustainability Report 2018 20 ECONOMIC GRI 201: Economic Performance (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed For determining taxable income our Company uses accruals based accounting method recorded as revenue and expenditures in the income statement. As a result of the internal data management system previously used, the economic business figures required by GRI were not yet available in this format. We will adjust the system to be able to generate these business figures in the near future in the appropriate format. The EVG&D cannot be allocated by national, regional or market level. The reason being that the percentage of local supply options depend on routes flown in the air and therefore fluctuates significantly in order to be able to report fixed percentages. 201-2 Financial implications and other risks and opportunities due to climate change We have not yet verified the risks of natural disasters due to climate change for our business activities. We assume no strong hazard due to our geographical location. FAI rent-a-jet AG does not operate in the classic energy-intensive industries, however, ranks among a growing sector with raising greenhouse gas emissions: Air-transport CO²-regulations apply for all aircraft operators according to European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) for intra-European Economic Area (EEA) flights. Due to the Stopping the Clock-decision for international flights from/to the EEA, the EU-ETS is temporarily suspended until the international Civil Aviation Organization ICAO shall have developed and adopted a global model for the regulation of international aviation emissions. However, we are affected indirectly by climate changes, as we have to pay for higher energy and raw material prices, which in turn result in higher demands on energy management. Nevertheless, we have a CO² strategy, which is explained in more depth in the environment section of this report. We are unable to provide information on a systematic and database-supported analysis of the financial consequences of climate change. 201-3 Defined benefit plan obligations and other retirement plans Our organization does not have a occupational pension provision for employees. Currently there is no plan to introduce a scheme. All fixed employees are covered by the German Social Security System which includes a pension scheme. As provided by law, FAI rent-a-jet AG contributes 50 percent to all contributions of the employees into this pension scheme, up to the social security contribution ceiling. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2017 FAI Sustainability Report 2018 21 GRI 202: Market Presence (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 202-1 Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage FAI rent-a-jet AG wages are based on the employee's ability, engagement, job performance and commitment. There is no gender bias regarding pay scale and everyone is paid above minimum wage. GRI 203: Indirect Economic Impacts (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 203-1 Infrastructure investments and services supported We have made the following investments in infrastructure or services supported during the reporting period.

Humboldt Stiftung None Monetary donation Nürnberger Tafel None Monetary donation Leon Heart Foundation None Monetary donation GRI 204: Procurement Practices (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 204-1 Proportion of spending on local suppliers Our company does not have a specific policy determining that locally-based suppliers shall be given preference. It is currently not planning to introduce such a policy either. Even with such policy in place the main suppliers for aircraft parts and services are in the United States, France and the UK. GRI 205: Anti-corruption (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 205-1 Operations assessed for risks related to corruption Due to our zero tolerance policy, the risk of corruption is very low. Description as such is found in the Company’s Code of Conduct. 205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures Each new staff member receives a FAI rent-a-jet AG’s Code of Conduct for review and signature the day he/she starts working. It provides instructions, policies and procedures to combat corruption. 205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken During the reporting period there were no incidents of corruption in our organization. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2017 FAI Sustainability Report 2018 22 GRI 206: Anti-competitive Behaviour (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 206-1 Legal actions for anti-competitive behaviour, anti-trust, and monopoly practices In the reporting period, our organization was involved in zero legal actions due to anti-competitive behaviour or violations of antitrust law. In the following table you can see the overview of these legal actions.

FAI rent-a-jet AG is one of the leading providers of air ambulance and VIP charter services worldwide. The supply of services we offer is surely an exposure for the biodiversity in the nearby protected areas. Although we try our best to minimize the environmental damage, we will not be able to avoid it completely. We can't do much against the turbine exhausts our aircrafts produce, for patients must be brought home and pilots must absolve their training flights. But we do have other methods to save the environment like producing our own electricity, waste separation or investing in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our headquarters in Nuremberg are carbon neutral. There are no apparent dangers to the biodiversity for the locations listed in Table 23. 304-3 Habitats protected or restored Our organization was not involved in rehabilitation, re-naturalization or protection of areas. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2017 FAI Sustainability Report 2018 28 GRI 305: Emissions (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 305-1 Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions Our organization calculates the entire Scope 1 CO2 emissions with 360report.
