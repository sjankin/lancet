We believe that architecture can make a real difference and contribute to changing the way we live, think and behave. Good infrastructure is crucial in this equation. Gottlieb Paludan Architects has always been focusing on infrastructure by developing and designing solutions for roads, public transport and public utilities, such as water and sewerage, electricity, gas and telecommunications. This year, we have dedicated ourselves to an additional area: Commercial & Office. With this market, we support the environment to provide better working environments. We believe that well-functioning workplaces and institutions constitute the basic framework for a comfortable life. Our architectural mission is to create beautiful, sustainable and long-term solutions within our three market areas. We are pleased to conﬁrm our ongoing commitment and support to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.

This has an impact on all three aspects of sustainability. ˄ Bicycle parking below Lyngby Station Gottlieb Paludan Architects has re-designed the basement below the station in order for it to work as a bicycle parking facility. The project involved demolishing the heavy concrete structures to the platforms and main entrance, renovating all surfaces, optimizing wayfinding and preparing the connection to the coming light rail. Users’ sense of safety was a priority, thus the underground facility has been equipped with CCTV, custom-made light fixtures with strong light and loud classical music. interview with Christina Tolstrup13 < Värtaverket Power Plant, Stockholm The essence of sustainability A case in point is, for example, the Climate and Our CHP plants and other technical installaEnvironmental Centre in the North Zealand town tions do not have longer service lives than the Christina Tolstrup is Head of Sustainability of Hillerød: it is a project that was screened for equipment they house.

How do we choose materials that will work with ful and durable solutions, not least when Such a project calls for customized, site-specific old buildings?

It may be stone reinforcements at the corners, or particularly strong stone cladding, or steel which has been rounded or painted in a way that makes it clear that it is very durable. We can revisit these age-old solutions and strengthen them or let them inspire us to develop other solutions. It is an excellent way of entering into a dialogue with our construction heritage. Can we provide solutions that benefit society at large? Yes, I believe we can! For example, we incorporate more bicycle parking at the stations we renovate and ensure that there are more opportunities for organizing car shares; at Lyngby Station, we have just re-designed the basement below the station in order for it to work as a bicycle parking facility, and as the users’ sense of safety was a specified priority, the underground facility has been equipped with CCTV, custom-made light fixtures with strong light and loud classical music.

It is nothing like as interesting to focus on a particular aspect and make some changes there unless you are aware that what you are doing has particular financial, social and environmental effects. N How can landscape solutions contribute positively to climate change? When you are working on landscape solutions, there is often an issue, such as handling surplus soil or rainwater for that matter, which needs to be turned into something positive. A case in point is the rainwater project at the creek Kagså in Copenhagen. The background to the project is that Kagså is currently heavily impacted by wastewater, and the SIGNATURFORKLARING Områdeinddeling neighbouring areas are contaminated by floodProjektområdet ing from the creek during periods of torrential VD vejbyggelinje rain.

Professional and organizational development In line with Gottlieb Paludan Architects’ business strategy, we are constantly improving our professional capabilities in order to strengthen the ability to solve the increasingly complex challenges that face our societies. Our employees are offered further training in relevant disciplines, for example DGNB certification, the Green Building Council’s LCA tool for life cycle analysis, project management and process management courses and seminars. Gottlieb Paludan Architects is organized into six teams: three teams focusing on energy and utilities and three teams focusing on mobility and transport. Each team is headed by a team leader. The team leaders support the project managers and undertake the quality assurance process and secure coordination of competences and staff across the office. This has resulted in a better working environment for our employees and created a more direct line to the nearest day-to-day managers. We will continue to improve the organizational development within the company, ensuring optimal working conditions for all employees. 27 Human Rights Gottlieb Paludan Architects conducts its business in accordance with Danish law, including the Danish Salaried Employees Act (Danish: Funktionærloven) which secures human rights and employment rights. We take care to uphold the general principles of basic human rights for everybody through all our work. Labour Gottlieb Paludan Architects conducts its business in accordance with Danish law, including the Danish Salaried Employees Act (Danish: Funktionærloven) which secures human rights and employment rights, including the prevention of child labour, forced labour and employment discrimination. All employees have the freedom of association and collective bargaining. Environment Anthropogenic climate changes and their impacts on our world require the inclusion of new methods and new ways of thinking in the field of architecture. Our work is driven by our belief in the sound business sense of increased focus on ethics, sustainability and holistic thinking, and our goal is to continue to promote greater environmental responsibility through our work. ˄ Køge Waterworks Anti-corruption A new “house of water” in Køge combines the future-oriented Gottlieb Paludan Architects’ main activities supply of clean drinking water with research, learning and play. are concentrated in Denmark and Scandinavia, The general public is invited to get close to the water processes The Global Compact which traditionally top Transparency both inside and outside the facility.
