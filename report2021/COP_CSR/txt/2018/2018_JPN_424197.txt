We established a Group-wide business transformation program and made significant investments in corporate infrastructure in both Japan and our international business. These are important programs within the context of our strategic objective to deliver sustainable growth and enhanced corporate value for society and all our stakeholders, including our people, our clients, media companies, content owners, platform developers and public institutions. Over the last two years, the Group has implemented important working environment reforms in the Japanese business to support and promote the mental and physical health of our employees (FY2017 FY2018). These reforms have included investment in business processes and HR systems, physical work environments and personal development programs for our people. More investment in the working environment reforms will be completed in the current financial year. These ongoing investments in our people and our business strengthen the Group and are vital for the long-term sustainable growth of our business. In tandem with our domestic initiatives, since FY2017 we have been carrying out corporate infrastructure improvements in our businesses overseas. We are developing a common platform to provide high-quality services efficiently around the world, and promoting the introduction of business tools and a Company intranet to standardize business processes and share knowledge among networks quickly and effectively. We expect that, by FY2019 or FY2020, we will again be on a growth trajectory, as a result of the overall improvement of business following our corporate infrastructure improvements. 009 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Further, given the environmental changes resulting from the advance of technological innovations, the Dentsu Group recognizes the need to transform its Japan and international businesses, in order to continue providing the value demanded by society and customers. To this end, we have devised three policies. First, we shall expand our marketing communications business. We will promote more precise and sophisticated integrated planning methods, accelerate research and development, and develop external alliances to capture increasingly diverse consumer contact points. The coming full digitization of media will bring the challenge of how all players might best use the digital media environment, while still making good use of traditional media. We will drive the associated innovations by applying our distinctive strength, thereby enhancing our competitiveness. Second, we will broaden our business domain. We will combine Dentsu Group capabilities, acquired in the advertising business, with the expertise of companies outside the Group to expand our service lines and respond to increasingly complex and advanced customer business issues. In light of the rapid changes afoot in the business environment, the Group views investment as indispensable for quickly expanding its business domain. Up to now, Dentsu Aegis Network (DAN), in charge of our international business, has aggressively engaged in M&As and made other investments. We will expand on these efforts and invest in areas of business promoted by both our domestic business and that of the Group. Third, we will become a business partner for our customers. By expanding the Group’s business domain and enhancing our service lines, we aim to evolve from being a partner in the marketing communications domain to being one able to contribute to the diverse value chains of our customers. Based on the above policies, the Group will itself institute changes to meet social and industrial transformations. The ultimate goal is for the Group to become the best possible partner when it comes to helping customers realize their own business transformations. The Group comprises in excess of 900 companies operating in over over 145 countries and regions with more than 60,000 talented employees. By organically linking these employees, strengthening their capabilities, and providing them all with optimal missions, we can increase the value of the services we provide clients. My vision for the Dentsu Group’s future is that it be able to create new social value through an organizational structure that facilitates employee and Company growth. We will make every effort to ensure that this is achieved. 010 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Leadership Message Message form Chief Financial Officer REFORMS, TRANSFORMATION TO BOOST CORPORATE VALUE FY2017 Performance focused on ensuring legal compliance in our domestic FY2017 (ended December 31, 2017) saw the Dentsu Group business, with emphasis on eliminating overwork, and engage in reforms and transformation in both Japan and on establishing a corporate infrastructure that will lead to overseas. sustainable growth.

Since then, much has been achieved. Our revenues have increased three-fold, with 57.9% of our revenue now generated from digital activities – an industry leading figure. Our workforce has grown from 15,000 to more than 42,000 people and we have made 150 acquisitions and investments, transforming our capabilities and talent. However, while we have a lot to be proud of, we remain focused on the future and the opportunities that lay ahead. 2017 was a challenging year for our industry and our business.

In 2017, our growth was primarily driven by acquisitions, as organic growth came under pressure. 2017 was a challenging year for Dentsu Aegis Network, our clients and the industry as a whole. As a result, we missed our budget globally and in all three regions. A disappointing performance given our track record of outperformance versus the industry. However, our trading comparatives were much tougher than those of the holding companies. We did experience an improvement in our momentum towards the end of the year. After a first quarter which was Nick Priday relatively strong, the second quarter saw a sharp slowdown Senior Vice President, Dentsu Inc. and was the weakest quarter of 2017. Performance stabilised CFO, Dentsu Aegis Network in the third quarter, and then growth returned in fourth quarter where we reported organic revenue up by 1.2 per cent. In 2018 we forecast a return to organic growth driven by an improving market and strong new business wins in 2017. In 2018 and beyond we envisage returning to a more balanced revenue growth profile of organic growth and acquisitions. A Record Year for Net New Business 2017 was a record year for net new business in terms of media billings. We won $5.2 billion dollars of net new business, well above the average of the previous three years and more than double that achieved in 2016. We won the biggest media pitch of the year as well as the biggest creative assignment. These wins demonstrate the talent and capability we have in our organisation as well as the competitiveness of our product. The level of new business wins in 2017 are expected to contribute one to two percent of organic revenue growth in 2018. This helps drive our expectation that our organic revenue growth will improve in 2018 and for us to return to a position of outperformance against the sector. 021 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Acquisitions Provide Scale, Capability Infill and Driving Growth Across the Business Entrepreneurial Talent Rolling out best in class systems and platforms will be a key We continue to show strategic intent in the market to enabler of our strategy.

Cash Performance We finished 2017 with a strong cash position driven by close management of working capital. The introduction of a cash performance metric to the senior management bonus scheme has yielded results. Net debt / EBITDA, our leverage measurement, at the end of 2017 was 1.1x, lower than that of 2016, despite topping the M&A league table across the sector for the second year in succession. This gives the business capacity to continue to invest in targeted acquisitions going forward. 2018 is an Investment Year as We Seek to Accelerate Our Business Transformation In 2017 the underlying operating margin declined in line with our budget – the margin contraction reflects planned investments and the impact from slower top line growth in a challenging market. Investment in the business for long term growth will continue in 2018 to support common platforms and shared global systems across our network. This will allow the business to operate efficiently at scale. Further inward investment will standardize business operations, support faster decision making and improve efficiency. We expect to see further margin moderation in 2018 with a return to growth in 2019 & 2020. 022 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 People Perspectives of the Key People Change Client Value with the Opportunities Brought by Disruptions Disruption is an inevitable consequence of the scale and speed of innovation that is happening in the transition to a digital economy.

Based on changes in people’s awareness and behavior, the platform integrates and manages marketing measures that take a fresh look at client business and marketing issues. More than a methodology, PDM is a vision and strategy for how the Dentsu Group will develop data infrastructure and cultivate human resources, as well as what we must do to provide high-quality services. With digitization now commonplace, we discern a need to look at the people behind the data. To this end, our vision is to approach planning from the basis of IDs rather than cookies. This has accelerated data alliances in a variety of areas, thanks to the support of numerous clients and platform developers in Japan and overseas. We are planning advances in PDM through alliances Shuji Yamaguchi President and CEO with the Merkle Group Inc., and Dentsu Aegis Network. Dentsu Digital Japan is preparing to host the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020.

By generating stimulating ideas, we hope to drive marketing innovation and contribute to Group growth. Business Producers with Solutions In 2018, Dentsu changed the name of its Account Management Division to Business Producers Division. This expresses our intention to commit to the success of customer businesses by going beyond the meeting of corporate needs and creating solutions in the advertising communications domain to deliver true achievements, namely, those resulting from meeting the needs of consumers and society, the recipients of products, services and advertisements. Given that consumers are increasingly discerning and have the option of not buying or using items and services, they must grasp the underlying meaning of products if purchases are to be encouraged. To this end, Dentsu is engaged in two major reforms. The first reform involves piecing together the behaviors and articulations of individual people, Hiromi Suzuki rather than viewing product and service recipient as a group. As a result of the advancement of Executive Officer digital technologies, we have devised a People Driven Marketing™ concept to take the pulse of Dentsu Inc. individuals’ behavior.

At the core of the reforms and, thus, our main priority, are the mental and physical health of our employees. We are promoting improvements and reforms in a broad area, covering from in-house equipment and environments to work processes, in order to simultaneously achieve shorter working hours and higher quality work. In 2017, we introduced the “Work-Diet” to visualize and review our business processes Company-wide. This was the starting point for our work-environment reforms. The result was leaner operations, with some eliminated, while others were simplified, automated, or outsourced. By the end of 2017, approximately 400 business processes had been switched to an emerging Chieko Ouchi Executive Officer form of business automation technology: robotic process automation.

This is a huge challenge, but when the reforms have been achieved, the Company will undoubtedly be stronger. I believe we will continue to shine 10 years, and even 100 years, from now. Beyond the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games Dentsu will have the chance to play a number of roles in connection with the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. These activities will enhance the value of the Summer Olympics not only for the Japanese sports world, but also for the nation as a whole, as well as for countries around the world. The Games represent an opportunity to increase interest in sports and ties to competitive sporting organizations in Japan and abroad. They will help enhance the enjoyment of Japanese professional sports, as well as those sports in which members of the Japanese public routinely engage. At the same time, the Olympics will promote the further maturation of the nation’s sporting world. Another offshoot will be a soft legacy: know-how related to the hosting and management of Olympic and Paralympic Games.

As of January 1, 2018, the Board of Directors comprises 12 Directors (of whom four are independent outside directors). We have appointed four directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members (of whom three are outside directors). Under the Board of Directors is the Group Executive Management Committee, comprising executive officers, including the representative director and executive directors.

In addition, the Internal Control and Compliance Committee, which has been delegated by the Board of Directors on internal control and risk management, has been established to improve the effectiveness of internal control and risk management. Through these systems, we are ensuring soundness, transparency and efficiency of management, and are working to improve corporate value over the medium to long term.

Personally, I understand the term to denote management, conducted by managers, that reflects the kind of management demanded by shareholders. However, to distinguish between owners (shareholders) and management (managers), many modern corporations find that it is not so easy to completely align management demanded by shareholders with that conducted by managers. The primary aim of corporate governance is to provide guidance, so that management might be seen by shareholders as being convincing in terms of balance between growth and stability, long-term investment and short-term returns, as well as scale and efficiency. The secondary objective is to appropriately explain these initiatives and degree of achievement to obtain shareholder support. We have done much to improve our corporate governance system and its implementation. Currently, it is our goal to conduct Dentsu Group management in such a way as will garner shareholder approval with respect to our globalized, digitized, and value-added business efforts. Another important focus is on innovation management, whereby management and stakeholders—including customers, business partners, employees and society—coexist and work well together. An example of this kind of management involves the supervision of managers, to make sure that the Dentsu Group working environment reforms in Japan are promoted. To maintain the system of rules, practices, and processes by which a firm is directed and controlled, in 2016 Dentsu transitioned to being an enterprise with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, and increased the number of independent outside directors. This has resulted in lively discussions at Board of Director and Audit and Supervisory Committee meetings. There is a constant awareness, among the directors and committee members, regarding the need for us to engage in the kind of management that our shareholders and other stakeholders expect. Before meetings, outside directors are provided with the information they require through briefings on agendas. In addition to prepared proposals, we also discuss new agenda items proposed by outside directors. In order to summarize the Dentsu Group’s management performance we prepare appropriate financial statements and create the Dentsu Integrated Report. This report is designed to increase understanding of, and support for, our management practices. Regardless of whether the Group’s performance is good or bad, the Board of Directors and Audit and Supervisory Committee work with independent accounting auditors to ensure the financial statements are an accurate and timely representation of management. 029 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Message from Executive Officer INTERNAL CONTROLS TO MEET STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS Shun Sakurai Executive Officer In January 2018, I was appointed executive officer from outside Dentsu to be in charge of internal controls. To address a series of labor issues and proceed resolutely with working environment-related reforms, it was decided that a person with an outside perspective and no prior experience in this position should be placed in the executive structure to review Company management. Looking at Dentsu from the viewpoint of someone with experience outside the Company, it would appear that all employees are engaged in their work with a high degree of motivation. In addition, since Dentsu develops business in many areas, I sense diversity in human resources. That said, even with the high quality of these human resources, there are some areas in need of consideration with respect to the working environment. As I understand it, my role in internal controls is to set up a mechanism ensuring thoroughgoing, solid Company management. This includes ensuring financial soundness, appropriate business processes, IT environment improvements, and legal compliance. I am then to verify the proper functioning of the mechanism, and to see that risks surrounding the Company are at a minimum. In light of labor issues, in April 2017 Dentsu took steps to enhance its internal control function by setting up the Internal Control and Compliance Committee under the Board of Directors. As the chairman of this committee since January 2018, I was selected as the executive in charge of identifying and analyzing critical risks surrounding Dentsu, and the one to engage in responding to each of these risks by preventing or mitigating them. In addition to maintaining this system of controls, I liaise with the Internal Audit Office and the Audit and Supervisory Committee. This reflects the need to properly implementing the plan–do–check–act process and product improvement cycle. Further, we are creating an internal control system for the Dentsu Group to identify Group-wide risks in an attempt to thoroughly manage the Group from the standpoint of internal controls. I think about internal controls and compliance in the context of sports. In the sporting world, one is required to strictly follow the rules to win the competition. Even if you win, you will not be respected unless you have followed the rules. The same is true in business; we must compete while following basic rules. Internal controls—a prerequisite for successfully developing any business—are the product of rules that have been formulated and to which there must be strict adherence. With rapid advances in the digital economy and other developments, the business environment is undergoing massive changes. In order to contribute to the resolution of issues at the societal and international levels, and to the achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals while pursing the Dentsu Group’s own sustainable development, we must address corporate management issues head on and meet stakeholder expectations. 030 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Governance Dentsu Group Internal Control System Internal Control System The Dentsu Group Internal Control System encourages compliance among directors, executive officers, and employees, while at the same time supporting continuous corporate development as Dentsu meets its social responsibilities. The Dentsu Group Code of Conduct is positioned as a shared behavioral code to ensure that directors, executive officers, and employees of Dentsu and its subsidiaries carry out their duties in compliance with the law, regulations, and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation. The code also ensures that business is conducted appropriately, while the Internal Control and Compliance Committee works to maintain and improve internal controls. In accordance with Internal Control and Compliance Committee policies, the CSR Committee and other committees formulate rules and develop manuals to inculcate a thorough awareness of proper business execution among all employees through training and other activities. There are business-related check items for risk management and compliance, while a broad range of inspections are conducted. The items checked include the appropriateness of rules; whether business is conducted in accordance with the rules; and if reporting of, and responses to, problems are prompt, in order that issues might be identified and issues improved. We also establish internal control mechanisms at Group companies to maintain and enhance corporate value throughout the entire Dentsu Group. Dentsu Group Code of Conduct ➡ http://www.dentsu.com/csr/overview/codeofconduct.html Risk Management Under the Internal Control and Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the executive director in charge of internal controls as a system for comprehensively managing Group-wide risks, the Dentsu Group strives to achieve continuous improvement by understanding Group risk management conditions and formulating, executing, monitoring, and improving policies and risk management processes using the four-step PDCA management method. We establish risk management rules, as well as formulate and execute specific response plans, prioritized in order of risk severity. This we do to maintain and improve our system to prevent risks and to minimize their impact should they occur. Departments are assigned responsibility for each key risk. They formulate and implement response plans to reduce the likelihood of risk; submit mid-term progress reports; and prepare year-end selfassessments as well as guidelines for the next fiscal year after they have been discussed by the Internal Control and Compliance Committee. The committee then shares risk awareness and the proposed responses with the Board of Directors and Audit and Supervisory Committee, and monitors situations as appropriate. To prioritize key risks, the Dentsu Group conducts quantitative and qualitative analyses using a risk map. This data visualization tool takes into consideration the frequency and impact of each risk, and uses correlation analysis to identify those risks considered key. Information Security Development of an Information Management System The Company set up the Dentsu Group Basic Policy for Information Security and a very strict information security management system to protect the Group’s important data, as well as personal and other information received from clients. Based on this Basic Policy, information management rules and other related guideline details were formulated to clarify procedures that must be followed. We also conduct detailed awareness activities for officers and employees through training, briefings, and the distribution of pamphlets and other materials. Given the importance of managers in information management, the Company has started a new manager training course to educate managers about their roles and responsibilities. Further, Dentsu and 49 Dentsu Group companies in Japan have obtained ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and JISQ 27001:2006 certification, international standards for information security management systems. Dentsu is striving to implement more stringent information security management Group-wide, to flexibly respond to the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated environment of information and communication technology. 031 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Compliance Compliance Promotion System Dentsu formulated the Dentsu Group Code of Conduct, according to which directors and executive officers who discover violations of prevailing laws or who encounter other serious compliance-related issues are required to report their findings immediately to the Board of Directors, Internal Control and Compliance Committee, as well as the Audit and Supervisory Committee.To maintain and improve the level of employee compliance and ensure employee awareness of compliance-related issues, rules and manuals are developed and training programs conducted. In addition, a Compliance Line was set up for the reporting of internal violations and an external contact point handled by a law office was established to ensure that those seeking consultation or reporting violations are in no way penalized. In FY2017 (ended December 2017), Dentsu Inc. and Dentsu Group employees in Japan submitted nine reports and proposals (FY2016: 7; FY2015: 15; FY2014: 10), all of which were addressed. Moreover, The Compliance Digest booklet the booklet Compliance Digest was distributed to all Group companies to promote an understanding of compliance. Corruption Prevention Response In accordance with the Dentsu Group Code of Conduct, which underpins our CSR activities, we have anti-corruption policies to ensure that we conduct business in an honest, fair, and transparent manner. In compliance with bribery regulations in the countries and communities around the world where we do business, Dentsu is proscribed from involvement in corrupt acts designed to enable the Company to obtain unfair profits. In order to meet our social responsibilities and conduct sound business activities, we shall strive always to cultivate compliance awareness through in-house training. Policies on Antisocial Forces Dentsu rejects all requests from antisocial forces and groups. It has departments that block relationships with groups and offer support through alliances with cooperating entities within and outside the Company. Dentsu and all Group Companies comply with a Basic Policy on the Rejection of Organized Crime Groups and Other Antisocial Forces, in respect of which they take a firm stand against antisocial forces, and at the same time request that business partners do the same. Basic Policy on the Rejection of Organized Crime Groups and Other Antisocial Forces ➡ http://www.dentsu.com/csr/compliance/compliance.html Bid to End Bribery by Group Companies Abroad DAN provides compliance training on the intranet for Group companies outside of Japan, the participation rate of which is up to 90%. As a follow-up, each company also holds its own training sessions and strives to raise employee awareness regarding bribery. Incident of concern or Speak Up! Policy suspicion of wrongdoing The risk of fraud and other wrongdoing is a threat to the Group’s profitability and reputation. DAN thus within the workplace established an internal reporting program, called Speak Up!, for reporting any incident of concern or • Bullying or harassment that raises suspicions of wrongdoing in the workplace. Employees can make a report to line managers, • Theft or fraud • Bribery and corruption HR staff or senior managers, or they can follow internal grievance procedures.

Based on the three pillars of thorough labor management, enhanced worker protection, the review of workflows through job inventories and smart work styles, we worked on reforming our labor management, business processes, internal infrastructure, office environment, personnel evaluation system, and health management system in 2017. Recognizing that employees with healthy minds and bodies are the foundation on which strong management is built, we aim to foster the self-actualization of each employee while simultaneously reducing hours and increasing operational quality. They will enable us to change the work style of Dentsu employees in Japan and create a new Dentsu. The Independent Advisory Committee, which comprises outside experts, is currently monitoring our efforts. Measures developed and implemented in 2017 (excerpt) 1.

This was less than the 2,100 hour target announced in our Basic Plan for 2017. Following the January 2017 transition to the management of overtime work in excess of statutory working hours (achieved by calculating the number of employees exceeding the Article 36 rule), we found that only one employee exceeded the rule in March and, from April to December, no employee has exceeded the overtime rule. The utilization rate of paid leave per employee was 64.0% in 2017, an 8-point improvement over the 56.0% achieved in the previous year. This was assisted by the use of robotic process automation (RPA), which allowed some 400 work processes previously carried out by humans to be automated by the end of 2017. Thus, the goal of having RPA work processes account for 12,000 hours of work per month had been achieved in December of that year. In terms of costs incurred related to work environment reforms, we spent ¥1.3 billion for an urgent increase in employees; ¥4.0 billion for operational efficiencies, including the introduction of IT, RPA, and ICT for in-house work inventories, policies such as outsourcing, and labor management; and ¥1.7 billion for office environment improvements, amounting to a total of ¥7.0 billion. In 2018, we plan to invest a total of ¥13.0 billion, broken down into ¥8.0 billion for promoting the creation of a foundation for future growth through the acceleration of various measures and work environment reforms; ¥2.5 billion for office environment improvements; and ¥2.5 billion for the hiring of additional employees. Measures to be Implemented in 2018 • The entire Company takes a day off once a month as non-statutory holidays (Input Holidays). • Employees are able to check their condition when they arrive at work (Vitality Note). • Dentsu has been developing programs that focus on the growth of individual employees and will make available more than 100 hours per year of learning opportunities. We will continue to focus our efforts on strictly observing legal requirements and reducing long working hours through the steady execution of our basic plan, while at the same time we will protect the physical and mental health of our employees. In addition, we will promote Company-wide work environmentrelated reforms, so that past labor problems will never again occur. 034 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Governance Inappropriate Domestic Digital Advertising Business Practices in 2016 An in-house committee—that was formed on August 15, 2016, included outside professionals (attorneys), and was chaired by then-senior executive vice president and CFO Shoichi Nakamoto— drew on advice from third-party professionals (certified fraud examiners and accountants) regarding instances of inappropriate or potentially inappropriate practices within the digital advertising services provided by Dentsu and some Dentsu Group companies in Japan. The committee identified related issues and their causes, and formulated measures to prevent their recurrence. In January 2017, after having investigated approximately 214,000 invoices issued for digital advertising services in Japan between November 1, 2012, and July 31, 2016, projects involving unsuitable practices were reported individually to advertisers. The following measures have been adopted to prevent a recurrence of such practices. 1. Since 2016, the independently established Business Process Management Division’s Digital Confirmation Section has conducted inconsistency checks on media placement and transaction data. As of this publication, not a single case of impropriety has been detected. 2. We implemented business process reengineering to digitally manage advertising, conducted an extensive inventory of operations, and formulated a standardized work flow in November 2017. From 2018, business process auditing will be conducted by an auditing firm. 3. As part of our promotion of system compliance, in February 2018 we implemented a major overhaul of our online ordering system. This improves work efficiency and accuracy by coordinating advertiser and Dentsu order data and reduces posting and confirmation work. During 2018, this will be linked to reporting and alert systems as we promote further automation. 035 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Sustainability Message Message from the Chairperson of the CSR Committee New Group-wide Challenges Nobuyuki Tohya Representative Director Executive Vice President We are approaching an age that demands transformations unlike any that Japanese society has experienced up to now. The changes are required in areas from digitization to the working environment and the realization of a diverse and inclusive society. Amid significant changes in the working environment, there are demands that corporations like ours also embrace this new society. As a result, the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee has been holding serious discussions on a broad range of social issues faced inside the Company as well as by external stakeholders. The issues include the environment, social and governance (ESG) criteria emphasized by institutional investors and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In terms of a standard of corporate evaluation, I believe the ESG criteria will become increasingly important. The Dentsu Group’s CSR Committee, the main promoter of the criteria, is committed to proactively disseminating relevant information outside the Company. At the same time, we are increasing our focus on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices and the Carbon Disclosure Project. To this end and through an employee initiative, we have created Group-wide project teams to engage in such activities as seminars to raise employee awareness, as well as to conduct surveys on consumer awareness of the SDGs. We believe the teams provide each employee an opportunity to consider what their social value is to society, and how they might work for society. We expect this will provide employees with a chance to attain personal growth. The CSR activities demanded by society are not limited to social contributions, but include those realized through business activities, thus more than anything else, they represent an opportunity for employees to build relationships with society. We will continue to strengthen the efforts directed at our stakeholders and driven by the CSR Promotion Committee members, which promotes CSR activities in each Group department. Even as times change in the face of progress, the ideas of employees and their gift of visualization remain the core competence of the Group’s marketing and communications business. We thus hope to ensure a freer and more flexible environment to facilitate creativity as we take on new challenges Group-wide. 036 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Sustainability Dentsu Group CSR Code of Conduct The Dentsu Group Code of Conduct, basic to our CSR activities, is based on seven key areas of Dentsu CSR activities: corporate governance, respect for human rights, ensuring a safe and civilized working environment, environmental protection, fair business practices, addressing consumer issues, and contributing to the community. While strictly observing the laws, regulations, and social norms of each country, the code outlines the conduct that all managers and employees in the Dentsu Group must comply with to fulfill their social responsibilities. Dentsu Group CSR Promotion System The Dentsu Group’s CSR Committee—comprising five officers and chaired by an executive officer— serves as an advisory body to the Group Management Committee, which is tasked with making important management decisions. In FY2017, the CSR Committee met 11 times. Subordinate advisory committees are set up under the CSR Committee to examine specific facets of the Company. CSR activities for our overseas businesses are formulated by Dentsu Aegis Network Board of Directors, before being reported to the Management Committee and CSR Committee. CSR promotion committee members have been designated in all Dentsu Head Office divisions, in an effort to promote awareness of specific CSR policies among all employees. At the same time, executive officers in charge of CSR have been appointed in Group companies in Japan, while in Group companies abroad, CSR Champions have been appointed. These efforts are designed to advance CSR activities on a Group-wide basis.

The Company joined the United Nations Global Compact in December 2009 and upholds its 10 principles on human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. It submits a CSR report every year to the UN Global Compact, and compiles an annual stand-alone activities report (Communication on Progress: COP) aimed at the realization of the 10 principles. Dentsu also has become a member of CSR Asia, the largest CSR-related think tank in the Asia–Pacific region, which focuses on deliberation of ESG issues in Asia and the strengthening of alliances with companies in Asia. 037 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Dentsu Group Medium-Term CSR Strategy 2020 In accordance with the Dentsu Group Code of Conduct, based on the medium-term CSR strategy— stipulating the four key areas and common goal—the Group will continue contributing to the realization of a sustainable society by steadily promoting CSR activities worldwide. CSR Planning: Realizing a Sustainable Society Nations around the world face a number of social issues, including those that are environment-related, such as global warming, as well as human rights violations that are found in some countries and regions. Many of the issues are the result of corporate activities, since the increased social expectations and demands are causing companies to focus on a variety of activities to fulfill their responsibilities. The advertising industry being no exception, we have persevered in our effort to manage the impact on the environment and society. However, the role that should be played by the advertising industry is far greater than we had anticipated. That said, we have a significant impact on consumer behavior as it relates to the buying of such goods as daily consumer items, and extends to once-in-a-lifetime major purchases. While being aware of the magnitude of the impact that advertising has on consumption, we also should remain aware of our responsibilities in terms of the fairness of the content and of goods and services that consumers purchase. When it comes to environmental and social impact, we believe advertising companies should bear in mind both direct and indirect impact. Based on the above considerations, we developed a plan that defines the common goal of the Dentsu Group. The plan—involving the collection of data regarding the Group’s resources and knowledge in Japan and overseas—will be steadily executed with a view to realizing a sustainable society, and through the promotion of sustainable business activities. Four Key Areas Environment Community To tackle climate change through reducing our environmental To build a more effective civil society through a wide variety of footprint across our operations community activities Supply Chain Responsible Marketing and Sustainable Consumption To develop a more resilient supply chain through developing To promote a sustainable society through implementing responsible sustainable procurement practices marketing practices as well as encouraging sustainable behavior Quantitative Targets in Japan and Group Companies outside Japan Dentsu Group companies in Japan Group Companies outside Japan Environment Reduce our carbon footprint per person by 30% Reduce our carbon footprint per person by 40% Have 90% of the employees participate in Dentsu’s CSR program and Community Enable 500 charities to build communications capabilities contribute to community development Cooperate with 90% of our main suppliers to promote sustainable Achieve 100% compliance with our supply chain charter Supply Chain business activities principles Provide 90% of our employees with training in the responsible Responsible Marketing and Engage 1,000,000 people with sustainable consumption execution of their duties and use their skills and expertise to give Sustainable Consumption campaigns something back to society 038 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Sustainability Respect for Human Rights Human Rights Policy and Systems The Dentsu Group is engaged in business activities that incorporate a respect for global human rights in all communications related to business activities, including advertising. We ensure that our activities maintain high ethical standards and reflect awareness of human rights, with the aim of helping to realize a sustainable and rich communication society. We recognize protecting employee human rights to be an important responsibility, and so strive to prevent harassment and honor the human rights and individuality of all our employees, in order to make the most of their abilities. Dentsu Aegis Network released the Group’s declaration with regard to slave labor and human trafficking, which echoes the stipulations of the United Kingdom’s Modern Slavery Act 2015. We will make an effort to prevent human trafficking, slavery, and forced labor by identifying and evaluating potential human rights impacts and risks in our business activities and supply chain. Statement on UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 ➡ http://www.dentsuaegisnetwork.co.uk/modern-slavery-statement Human Rights Promotion System The Dentsu Group Human Rights Education Conference is held twice a year for those in charge of human rights education at the Company, and for human rights education managers at Group companies in Japan. In addition to fundamental human rights issues, topical themes are also covered. Human Rights Awareness To increase human rights awareness, the Group runs human rights awareness training programs based on both employee hierarchy and occupational field. The Dentsu Group Human Rights Education Conference is held twice a year for those in charge of human rights education at the Company, and for human rights education managers at Group companies. There are also various opportunities to raise awareness of human rights. Textbooks with information on human rights and explanations of their connection to advertising are utilized by employees. The Human Rights College, a site that collects past examples of advertising expressions related to human rights, is posted on the Company’s intranet. This initiative enables continuous online learning that increases knowledge and realizes the pursuit of better communication. Further, a newsletter dealing with timely human rights-related topics is distributed within the Group twice a month. In the area of advertising and human rights, the Group has a permanent consulting contact, to ensure that expressions communicated to the world are appropriate, and to respond to Group-wide inquiries. In addition to this, we cooperate with human rights-related seminars held at the Japan Advertising Agencies Association, and make efforts to raise awareness throughout the advertising industry. Site screen of the Human Internal Reporting to Protect Human Rights Rights College We established a contact desk that responds to inquiries from Group employees and allows the identification of possible human rights-related risks associated with the right of expression in advertising. During FY2017, the desk received 296 inquiries. These were handled individually, in a bid both to prevent any recurrence of the issues and to increase human rights awareness. All harassment-related issues are centralized at the Harassment Counseling Section, which has contact points at Dentsu branches as well as law firms outside the Company, and provides consultation services. The section coordinates with harassment contacts at each Group company, in a bid to prevent harassment across the Group. To ensure that employee education prevents both power and sexual harassment at Dentsu offices, we have issued an educational book entitled STOP! HARASSMENT. We also hold training sessions tailored to target audiences, including new employees and new managers, and post messages on bulletin boards calling attention to the Company’s anti-harassment policy as well as Human Resource Management Division manager’s assistant and CSR promotion committee members. 039 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Ensuring a Safe, Civilized Work Environment Development of Human Resources Recognizing that human resources are its greatest asset, the Group provides employees with appropriate capability-developing opportunities and supports employee self-development, in line with each individual’s career and the organization’s goals. Diversity Promotion Promoting Female Participation Dentsu helps develop and support the careers of female employees. To maximize the Company’s strength, we formulated an action plan for the promotion of diversity to run from January 1, 2015 until December 31, 2019. Through the plan, Dentsu is striving to expand its existing female-friendly work environments so that female participation in the workplace might increase. Summary of the Action Plan Goals 1. Increase the ratio of women among new graduate recruits (permanent employees) to at least 35% by 2020. 2. Increase the ratio of women among managers to at least 10% by 2020. Specific efforts 1. Adopt measures to recruit and select female employees. 2. Enhance management skills of managers. 3. Foster career awareness among female employees. 4. Dispel uncertainty over work–family balance (raising children, providing care) by revising current systems and support measures. 5. Redesign work style to encourage greater output, reduce long working hours. Summary of the Action Plan ➡ http://www.dentsu.com/csr/workingenvironment/workplaceenvironment.html. In FY2013, we launched the Female Employees Promotion Project, to create a working environment in which temporary leaves of absence will not jeopardize employees’ careers. In addition, at an early stage of their careers, women are given ample opportunities to think about their careers at, for example, lunch meetings with senior female employees. This gives them the chance to hear about the experiences of others, and to attend career seminars held by lecturers invited from outside the Company. Employing People with Disabilities As part of its efforts to promote the employment of people with disabilities, in April 2013 the Company established Dentsu Solari, a wholly owned Group company that was designated as a special-purpose subsidiary in November of that year. The employment rate of people with disabilities at three Group companies (Dentsu, Dentsu Works, and Dentsu Solari) is 2.14% (as of 1st of June, 2018). The Company also employs people with disabilities in account management, as well as in creative and other areas. Along with Dentsu Solari, we are trying to expand their employment opportunities. 040 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Sustainability Contributing to the Community Dentsu Group Initiatives Recognizing that local communities are important stakeholders and as a leader in the sphere of communications, Dentsu develops social contribution and community activities. These facilitate the resolution of issues, as well as promote development within, and build relationships of trust with, local communities. Employee Participatory Community Activities At Dentsu, we provide opportunities for employees to collaborate with local communities and support volunteer activities. In 2017, Dentsu twice conducted an in-house volunteer foreign currency coin sorting activity, led by the NPO Japan Habitat Association. Fifty-seven employees took part, with the sorted coins then changed to US dollars and used in Southeast Asian countries for afforestation projects and to help improve the living conditions of local children. Employee Participatory Community Activities SOCIETY AND THE POWER OF COMMUNICATION Kyoko Ikeda Director, Corporate Philanthropy Dept. Administration Division For business to be sustainable, it must coexist in harmony with, and be beneficial for, society. Under the slogan The Power of Communication for Society, Dentsu leverages the know-how and skills accumulated through our core business to support human resource cultivation and activities that tackle social issues. One of our core activities is the Advertising Elementary School project in Japan. During a study period, students create a commercial intended to improve their communication skills and encourage self-discovery. The activity leads them to discover issues in an educational environment, resulting in the creation of better curriculums through the development of educational materials and class support. Further, our social contribution activities enable us to contribute to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In conjunction with the National Federation of UNESCO Associations in Japan, we have developed a variety of NPO support programs and projects. For many years, we have also been engaged in activities focused on education, hunger, responsible use, the environment and other of the 17 SDGs. One result of the activities having been conducted over the long term is that they have had a positive impact on communities. At the same time, the employees involved have learned a lot, while gaining a sense of the enjoyment of social contribution. We plan to create a platform that combines the knowledge of our business partners and stakeholders with the know-how of our employees to further expand the scope of activities in which Dentsu can play an important part. 041 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Responsible Marketing Communications Dentsu Group Initiatives In recognition of the substantial impact advertising has on society, Dentsu has established behavioral principles and guidelines related to creative work, and pays the utmost attention to advertising production. Dentsu Creative Code Society is substantially impacted by creative output and processes centered on advertising. In recognition of our social responsibility and in order to fulfill our role, we position the success of our customers and the creation of a better society as our mission. To this end, we established the Dentsu Group Creative Operational Code, a behavior policy for every employee involved in creative businesses in all Dentsu Group companies, units and divisions. We make an effort to improve ethics and creativity within creative businesses by constantly learning and improving. Guidelines Regarding Advertising and Marketing That Affect Children In 2016, NGO Save the Children Japan published Guidelines Regarding Advertising and Marketing that Affects Children formulated by the NGO’s Children's Rights and Marketing/Advertisement Review Committee. Dentsu cooperated with the formulation of these guidelines through Global Compact Network Japan. Publicity Business Guidelines Dentsu has formulated Publicity Business Guidelines, and conducts its publicity business in accordance with these guidelines. Contributing To Sustainable Development At the September 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were announced as an action plan for humanity, the Earth and prosperity. The plan comprises 17 goals and 169 targets. The Dentsu Group, which provides a diverse array of value in the communications field and always looks to the future, is contributing to the resolution of global social issues. Through seminars and workshops, we are helping to provide support for stakeholder SDG initiatives. As part of these activities, in November 2017 we invited photographer Leslie Kee to create portraits of Dentsu employees engaged in efforts to achieve the SDGs. In this way it was hoped that awareness of the SDGs would be further inculcated within the Company. In addition, we created the SGDs Communication Guide. It is a guide for employees engaged in corporate management and advertising, as they go about their advertisement-related and promotional activities in connection with the SDGs. Photographed by LESLIE KEE Further, the Dentsu Group is participating in the groundbreaking initiative called Common Ground, with the world’s five other top advertising and marketing services groups (Havas, IPG, Omnicom, Publicis, and WPP). The Group is focused on Goal 3, which is health, and is working with NGOs to counter global infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.

Dentsu Basic Procurement Policy In line with the Dentsu Group Code of Conduct and desire for fair business dealings with its suppliers and business partners, the Company established the Dentsu Basic Procurement Policy. 1. Fair business dealings We shall conduct fair business dealings. (1) Our business dealings shall comply with laws and regulations. (2) When selecting suppliers and business partners, we shall not only take into account economic factors, but also give due consideration to compliance and environmental issues. 2. Cooperation with Dentsu’s management system When our suppliers and business partners collaborate with us, we request understanding of, and cooperation with, Dentsu’s management system, including the Dentsu Group Code of Conduct, the Dentsu Procurement Guidelines and other Dentsu Group rules. Dentsu Basic Procurement Policy, Dentsu Procurement Guidelines ➡ http://www.dentsu.com/csr/compliance/procurementactivities.html Dentsu’s CSR Procurement Activities The Dentsu Group promotes CSR initiatives even with regard to procurement. By distributing Dentsu procurement guidelines among its business partners, we expect them to respect human rights, comply with prevailing laws and regulations, support environmental conservation, and show respect for intellectual property rights in terms of the production and provision processes of all services. The Dentsu procurement guidelines were revised in March 2014, in order to observe the addition of international anti-corruption regulation tenets (the 1977 US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the 2010 UK Bribery Act), as well as regulations pertaining to conflict minerals (Section 1502 of the US Dodd-Frank Act of 2010) as part of our business ethics with the aim of realizing CSR procurement that helps contribute to human rights. To monitor environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks in the supply chain, Dentsu conducts supply chain assessments. These are online surveys comprising 30 ESG-related questions. By 2020, we aim to have collected survey responses from 900 companies. Having already received responses from 246 companies, it was revealed that 182 companies (73.9%) are specifically aware of the existence of the Dentsu Group Code of Conduct. In addition, we ask all new clients to comply with the requirements of CSR-related procurement by incorporating a subcontractor basic agreement clause governing CSR procurement activities. 043 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Respect for Laws and Regulations and Various Rights in Business Activities In order to maintain fair business practices in communications activities, compliance with various laws and regulations is expected and Dentsu aims to take the lead to be the cornerstone of legal norms in order to maintain its stakeholders' and society's trust. To this end, efforts are taken to ensure compliance with various laws such as the Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations, for the appropriate offering of premiums and advertising; Act on the Protection of Personal Information, for the adequate protection of personal information of consumers who participate in campaigns and questionnaires; the Act against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, Etc. to Subcontractors, to conduct fair and appropriate dealings with subcontractors; and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, to conduct appropriate stock trading. As part of such efforts, for intellectual property rights in the realm of creative expression for advertising works, such as trademarks, design rights, copyrights, and publicity rights, Dentsu works to (1) improve the knowledge and awareness of employees through continuous educational and training programs, (2) disseminate information through easy-to-understand legal handbooks and manuals and the Company intranet, and (3) establish a designated department for consulting on legal and creative affairs. Going forward, Dentsu will continue to protect intellectual property rights and develop an environment for legal compliance in order to be a cornerstone for legal norms. Tax Behavior Principle The Dentsu Group formulated its Tax Mission Statement and Tax Strategy to maintain consistency with Dentsu Group business strategies and activities, corporate values and social responsibilities, as well as to maintain and improve Group value by taking appropriate tax positions and paying taxes as appropriate. 044 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Sustainability Structures for Environmental Activities Dentsu Group Initiatives Recognizing environmental problems to be a key issue in terms of the Group’s corporate social responsibility, Dentsu established the Dentsu Eco Program to promote Group-wide environmental protection initiatives. In recognition of these efforts, Dentsu was certified as an Eco-First Company by the Ministry of the Environment. As a result, the Group will continue these activities and contribute to the realization of a sustainable society by collaborating with all stakeholders and environmental communication initiatives. Environmental Policy The Dentsu Group aims to make each employee strongly conscious of its corporate philosophy of Good Innovation and, based on the Dentsu Group Code of Conduct, reduce the environmental burden generated through its business operations in order to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society. • In order to realize a sustainable society, we will correctly assess the environmental impact of its business activities and work to reduce its burden on the environment. • Work to develop and propose environmentally conscious business activities and contribute to the improvement of environmental issues. • Ensure thorough implementation of environmental compliance and engage in ongoing improvements to boost environmental performance through more precisely defined environmental objectives and outcomes. Environmental Protection • Actively endeavor to prevent pollution, alleviate climate change, and conserve biodiversity and ecosystems. Environmental Communication • Actively engage in environmental education, for the next generation and environmental communication activities for business partners and employees, to raise recognition of environmental issues. Structures for Environmental Activities and Management System Dentsu designated environmental managers to advance Group-wide efforts for the environment. Additionally, we adopted the Dentsu Group Eco Program (ongoing) in January 2005, and we acquired ISO 14001 certification in May 2005. Integrated Group certification that included subsidiaries in Japan was acquired in June 2006. Dentsu and 17 Group companies hold this certification as of January 2017. Raising Awareness At Dentsu, we promote environmental slogans, eco-awards, and other awareness activities as measures aimed at heightening employee environmental awareness. In addition, we encourage employees to take the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Certification Test for Environmental Specialists and acquire certification. Our activities include providing handbooks for use in employee education, including the Green Event Guide to promote eco-friendly green events, and the Greenwash Guide to eliminate advertisements that are misleading in terms of their impact on the environment. Eco-First Commitment Declaration Dentsu is an Eco-First company1 certified under the Eco-First System2 set up in 2004 by the Ministry of the Environment. In 2017, Dentsu declared its commitment to the Eco-First System, which aims to help realize sustainable societies through cooperation with stakeholders. We will continue to promote awareness and understanding of environmental issues, as we work to reduce environmental burdens. 1. Dentsu was certified under the government’s market greening policy in 2008. 2. For Eco-First System details, see Ministry of the Environment website: https://www.env.go.jp/en/focus/docs/files/20111109-07.pdf , pp. 15, 18. The system is operated by the Ministry of the Environment for companies that promote initiatives for environmental conservation, involving initiatives that support environmental conservation, such as those designed to ameliorate the effects of global warming, as well as curb waste and support recycling and other environment-friendly conservation efforts. 045 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Climate Change Countermeasures Governance The CSR Committee takes a lead in determining Company policies and key items related to global climate. These are discussed by the CSR Committee, before being reported to the Group Executive Management Committee. Strategies and Responses Based on the Group’s environmental policy, the CSR Committee conducts performance evaluations on sustainability and provides feedback to business units through the CSR Promotion Committee. During this process, risks and opportunities are discussed from mediumand long-term perspectives. This is imperative, given that environmental protection is one of the key targets of the Group’s Medium-term CSR Strategy 2020. Risks and Opportunities With the recent expansion of our international business involving M&As and other arrangements, our global environmental burden may increase. Recognizing the issue as an emerging risk, in collaboration with DAN we are working on ways to reduce this burden. Initiatives to Reduce CO2 through SBT To realize a decarbonized society, the Dentsu Group aims to achieve the 2°C target* stipulated in the Paris Agreement, an accord within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions based on scientific evidence by establishing Science Based Targets (SBT). Dentsu received the international Science Based Targets initiative certification in recognition of having established science-based goals. The Dentsu Group aims to reduce Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions 24% by 2030 compared with 2014 levels, and to reduce Scope 3 (business trips) CO2 emissions 25% per employee by 2050 compared with 2015 levels. We plan to continue tackling climate change issues by making further efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. * According to the framework for global warming countermeasures adopted at COP 21, the planet’s average temperature increase is to be held at under 2°C compared with pre-industrial revolution levels. It was agreed that we must reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to zero during this century. 046 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Sustainability Data Summary Employment Data (Parent Company only) Number of Employees (Each year-end) Employee Composition (December 31, 2017) March 2014 March 2015 December December December Male Female Total 2015 2016 2017 Consolidated 39,427 43,583 47,324 55,843 60,064 Executive officers, others 43 2 45 Non-consolidated 7,425 7,348 7,261 6,799 6,927 Management staff 1,531 136 1,667 Non-management staff 2,575 1,028 3,603 Contract employees 269 288 557 Ratio of Women among Managers (FY2017) (Unit : %) Clerical staff 1 532 533 (including personnel seconded to the Company and Partners / Senior staff 117 43 160 Total 8.0% excluding personel seconded from the Company) Part-timers, others 32 24 56 Seconded from other entities 211 95 306 New Graduates Hired Total 4,779 2,148 6,927 April 2014 April 2015 April 2016 April 2017 April 2018 Note: “Executive officers, others” indicates senior corporate advisors, special advisors and executive officers (excluding Directors and Audit and Total 135 132 144 145 145 Supervisory Committee Member). “Part-timers, others” indicates permanent part-timers, non-permanent part-timers and employees of Male 91 92 88 82 84 overseas branches.

(2) Significant goodwill and intangible assets The significant portion of goodwill as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, arose from the international business segment which forms a group of cash generating units, and amounted to ¥718,447 million and ¥798,177 million ($7,064 million) as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Significant intangible assets other than goodwill as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, consist of customer relationships in the international business segment, which amounted to ¥172,712 million and ¥172,318 million ($1,525 million) as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Among them, the amount recognized when the Company acquired Dentsu Aegis Network Ltd. in March 2013 was ¥114,297 million and ¥112,775 million ($998million) as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, which the remaining amortization period at December 31, 2017 is 13 years. (3) Impairment testing of goodwill Recoverable amounts of the international business segment to which significant goodwill was allocated are determined by the value in use based on the financial budget for the next fiscal year approved by management and the management forecast for the subsequent four years. The continuing growth rate of 2.0% (2.0% as of December 31, 2016) is set for cash flows beyond the four-year period. The pre-tax discount rates used for determining value in use are 7.5% and 7.3% as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. For the goodwill above, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units sufficiently exceeds its carrying amount. Therefore, it is unlikely that the recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units will fall group of below the carrying amount even with reasonable changes in the key assumptions. 086 Dentsu Integrated Report 2018 Financial Report 16.

The objectives of plan asset investments are to reduce long-term contribution obligations and improve benefits within a tolerable risk while securing sufficient assets to grant benefits. To achieve these objectives, mediumto long-term future estimates of pension finance are taken into account, and the effect of uncertainty in the plan asset management on plan assets financing (such as the possibility of fund shortages) and tolerable levels of uncertainty in the rates of return on plan assets are adequately reviewed. In addition, asset investments are managed to achieve these objectives by establishing a policy for future optimal asset composition ratios (hereinafter referred to as policy asset allocation ), selecting an asset manager and monitoring asset allocation, after setting forecasts of expected rates of returns on appropriate assets for investment. The policy asset allocation is verified annually and reviewed as necessary if any changes are made to the terms and conditions set at the time of the policy's establishment.
