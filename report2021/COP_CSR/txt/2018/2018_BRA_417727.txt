To this end, financial literacy and the formation of a retirement culture is becoming increasingly essential for people to be able to make good choices. Our industry plays a key role in this context by promoting educational efforts and discussing and proposing to regulators new forms of encouraging long-term savings. The new retirement industry regulations (CNSP Resolutions Nos. 348 and 349 and SUSEP Rules Nos. 563 and 564) illustrate our progress at the end of 2017 in this sense. They promoted major breakthroughs in the annuitization market, allowing clients, for instance, to schedule financial payments during the accumulation period and get annuities using only a portion of their financial reserve. With these changes, we expect that Brazil will come closer to more mature markets, such as the American one, which has nearly 10% of industry assets in this fundraising model. As for the economic scenario, the 6% interest rate drop implies a need for increased investment portfolio diversification to achieve improved gains. For the past two years, the retirement industry has been preparing for this scenario and is already offering sophisticated funds with allocation, including abroad. As a result of CMN Resolution No. 4,444, the next step is allowing the creation of multimarket retirement funds with a variable-income allocation of up to 70%, which should take place in 2018. Lastly, the market has to face the challenge of improving consumer experience. Consumers are increasingly demanding more user-friendliness, transparency, and accessibility, especially in the digital environment. According to the Brazilian Continuous Household Survey (Pnad C) of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in Brazil, 116 million people are connected to the Internet, which represents 64.7% of the population over the age of 10. This is a challenging scenario, but it can also be construed as a major industry opportunity to stand out and bolster competitiveness. We are aware of these moves and ready to respond to each of these trends assertively and swiftly. 25 To ANNUAL me, to innovate REPORTis2017 to create.
