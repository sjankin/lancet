COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 1 INTRODUCTION I AM PLEASED TO CONFIRM THAT MADS NØRGAARD COPENHAGEN ACKNOWLEDGE ITS CONTINUED SUPPORT TO THE TEN PRINCIPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT IN THE FOUR ISSUE AREAS; HUMAN RIGHTS, LABOUR, ENVIRONMENT AND ANTI CORRUPTION. IN OUR FIRST ANNUAL COMMUCNICATION ON PROGRESS, WE DESCRIBED OUR ACTIONS TO INTEGRATE THE GLOBAL COMPACT AND ITS PRINCIPLES INTO OUR BUSNIESS STRATEGY, CULTURE AND DAILY WORK. NOW, AS MEMBERS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, WE KEEP THE SAME SIMPLE REPORTING METHOD BUT THEN CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THINGS DONE. WHEN SIGNING UP FOR THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT MEMBERSHIP, WE ESTABLISHED A CSR TEAM WITHIN THE COMPANY. THIS WAS INITIATED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL TOOK AN ACTIVE PART OF THE MEMBERSHIP AND WORKING ON IMPROVING WITHIN THE 10 PRINCIPLES. AT THIS POINT WE HAVE 1 PERSON IN CHARGE AND THEN ALSO GET SUPPORT FROM AN EXTERNAL CSR CONSULTANT. OUT OF THE 4 AREAS HUMAN RIGHTS, LABOUR, ENVIRONMENT AND ANTI CORRUPTION, WE DECIDED IN THE FIRST YEAR OF OUR MEMEBERSHIP, THAT OUR MAIN FOCUS WILL BE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PART, AS OUR INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE MOST NON ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY. FOCUS HAS BEEN SPLITTED, SO IN 2017 WE FOCUSED ON CREATING TRANSPERANTCY IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. THE FIRST STEP TAKEN WAS TO SEND OUT A QUESTIONARE, WHICH COVERED THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT PRINCIPLES. THE GOAL WAS TO MAP THE LEVEL OF CONCIOUSNESS OF THE 10 PRINCIPLES WITHIN OUR SUPPLIERS. SINCE OUR CODE OF CONDUCT HAS BEEN UPDATED AND HAS NOW BEEN RESEND TO ALL 1st TIER SUPPLIERS.
