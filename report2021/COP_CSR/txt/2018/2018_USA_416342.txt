Today, Veritas protects and manages data for 86% of the Fortune 500. Our solutions help organizations use their data to deliver better patient outcomes, protect military forces, and enable educational institutions to deliver low cost education to remote communities, to cite just a few examples. As we drive the future of our customers and our business, we’re also thinking carefully about the future of—and our impact on—our people, our communities, and the environment. While Veritas has transitioned from an on-premise backup and recovery to a leading multi-cloud data management company, one thing that has remained constant is its deep and abiding sense of corporate responsibility. Just as we’re defined by our business mission and vision, we’re similarly characterized by our commitments to diversity and inclusion, corporate citizenship, and environmental sustainability. This inaugural report provides an update on our progress in support of these three areas and I invite you to review it. I’m proud of the progress we’ve made and even more excited about our future. Greg Hughes Veritas Chief Executive Officer 3 About Veritas Organizations need to transform in order to remain competitive, foster innovation, improve productivity and reduce costs. Information is the digital currency of the 21st century and a critical enabler of that transformation. There’s no differentiation in infrastructure—cloud-based apps and services are available to everyone—but your information is uniquely your own and your most important business asset. 86 % But strangely, most organizations do not manage their data that way. They have little idea of what data they own, where it is, what it consists of, whether it’s sensitive or subject to regulation or whether it is adequately protected. Veritas research shows that 85 percent of the data being stored by companies is useless or “dark”. That means most businesses are only operating with 15 percent of their information potential and are courting compliance risk and penalties into the bargain. of global So, companies urgently need to start managing their data more proactively. That means Fortune 500 making sure it’s protected, accessible, resilient, visible, compliant with regulations, reliably movable, including in the new world of multiple clouds and software defined data companies centers. rely on Veritas. That’s very hard to do with today’s tools. Today, data is locked away in multiple silos, fragmented, duplicated, invisible and easily portable. And most organizations have deployed a collection of specialized tools for single functions that weren’t designed to work together, adding complexity and cost. OUR SOLUTIONS Our comprehensive 360 data management solution enables you to control any aspect of your data—from protection and availability to storage, visibility and compliance—across a multi-cloud landscape more scalably and costeffectively than with a collection of single purpose tools that weren’t designed to work together. 360 Data Management Data Visibility Data Protection Compliance Readiness Data & App Portability INTELLIGENT CORE Discovery, Classification, Policy Automation Storage Optimization Business Continuity 4 Headquartered in Founded in Mountain View, Operations in California 1983 more than 35 countries Company Snapshot More than 7,000 employees $2.5 billion company that partners with the around the world largest technology leaders CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Veritas has its origins in Tolerant Systems, founded in 1983 and later renamed Veritas. Veritas merged with Symantec in 2005, and adopted the Symantec brand. After separating from Symantec in January 2016, Veritas is now an independent privately-held company, majority-owned by the investment funds managed by The Carlyle Group, a global alternative asset manager and private equity firm. Our Board of Directors, chaired by L. William Krause, is made up of eleven members (two women and nine men) and includes a Compensation Committee and an Audit Committee. Our Senior Director, Corporate Responsibility, reports to the Senior Vice President and General Counsel for Veritas, and works in partnership with the CEO and Board of Directors to establish strategic direction for corporate responsibility efforts. Our Code of Conduct guides our decisions and ethical behavior. All Veritas employees are required to regularly take training on our Code of Conduct and ethics policies. In fiscal year 2017 (FY17), or April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017, we also included an anti-corruption training module to our annual Code of Conduct training, which all employees are required to complete. 96 percent of employees completed this training. Furthermore, we are committed to responsible sourcing and require our Tier 1 suppliers to adhere to our Global Supplier Code of Conduct. 5 At Veritas, we believe in a talented, diverse and inclusive workforce. We engage in sound environmental practices and invest in positive social impact around the globe. 6 Our Approach to Corporate Responsibility At Veritas, in addition to helping companies harness the power of their information, we are working to become a leading global corporate citizen and to position our company for long-term sustainable growth. With a sharp focus on our commitment to ethical and responsible business practices, corporate responsibility is fully embedded in our business strategy. INTRODUCING OUR VERITAS VALUES Our journey as an independent company has been a transformative one. We launched an enterprise-wide culture initiative in FY17, during which we collected key input from the entire organization to understand the values that best define who we are and what we stand for. We worked with corporate culture experts and equipped more than 300 global employee ambassadors with the tools to help implement positive culture change. This collaborative effort led our employees to ratify the Veritas values: • Empower employees to succeed and grow • Create unique value for our customers every day • Excel as a team through collaboration and inclusion • Innovate to win by creating the future • Inspire trust with integrity and accountability We see these values as foundational to the evolution of our culture. Our employee engagement survey process enables us to monitor the adoption and impact of these values on our organization. We will continue to use the values as a guiding light to drive our behavior and achieve our strategic goals. OUR SUPPORT FOR UNITED NATIONS PRIORITIES Veritas is a United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) signatory, a UNGC Network USA member, and a signatory of the Women’s Empowerment Principles, a partnership initiative of the UNGC and UN Women. In FY17, we conducted a benchmark analysis and mapping exercise to understand how to further integrate the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into our business, and to identify alignments with our current activities. We identified nine SDGs to commit to and use in our strategy development process. Throughout this report, we have indicated the SDG linkages to our relevant topic areas. 7 Our Material Issues In FY17, we conducted a materiality analysis to help identify the issues of most importance to our business. We considered the concerns and expectations of our stakeholders and identified areas of both risk and opportunity. As part of the analysis, we: • Undertook a comprehensive review of the environmental, social, governance, and economic topics most relevant to Veritas, the broader technology and communications sector and our internal and external stakeholders. • Surveyed internal stakeholders at various management levels who represent diverse business units—such as Global Staffing, Corporate Responsibility, Supply Chain, Marketing and Finance—and who directly engage with external stakeholders. • Conducted a peer benchmark analysis to assess industry trends, competitive landscape and external stakeholder priorities (results of the survey and peer benchmark represented the external stakeholder portion of our materiality analysis). • Mapped top issues to a materiality matrix. The issues of greatest stakeholder concern and company impact include, in alphabetical order: Corporate Governance Economic Performance Customer Satisfaction Employee Engagement and Development Data Privacy and Protection Innovation Diversity and Inclusion The results of the materiality analysis allow us to better define our corporate responsibility strategy and disclosure priorities. MATERIALITY MATRIX • Customer Satisfaction • Data Privacy & Very High Protection • Corporate Governance • Economic Performance • Diversity & Inclusion • Employee Engagement & Development • Innovation Stakeholder Concern • Employee Health & Safety • Energy & GHG • Supplier Management • Compliance High Emissions • Supplier Working • Ethical Conduct Conditions • Transparency • Environmental Management • Product Environmental Medium Attributes • Community Engagement • Public Policy • Waste • Water Medium High Very High Company Impact 8 Employees Veritas employees facilitate our company’s success and provide vital contributions to our corporate culture. Our culture drives a shared set of behaviors, language and competencies across the organization and supports how we achieve our strategy and goals. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION We strive to attract and fully engage diverse and talented individuals to contribute to our growth and put us at the forefront of our industry. Diversity includes all the ways in which people differ, encompassing the different characteristics that make one individual or group different from another. While diversity is often used in reference to race, ethnicity, and gender, we embrace a broader definition of diversity that also includes age, national origin, religion, disability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, education, marital status, language and physical appearance. Our definition also includes diversity of thought, ideas, perspectives and values. Our goal is to build a work environment where all employees are valued for their differences and unique perspectives. In FY17 we took important steps to further embed diversity and inclusion commitments across our organization. We began by completing an internal “diversity footprint” analysis by region, business leader and job grade. A snapshot of our analysis related to gender is included below. We used the analysis to inform our diversity strategy, which will be reflected in our recruitment plan, including implementing a diverse candidate slate for over 80% of all open positions. Further, we partnered with Mills College in Oakland, California to analyze if unconscious bias was observed in any of our recruiting processes. The outcomes and recommendations from the research were presented to our leadership team. We also launched unconscious bias training for vice presidents and above, with the goal of rolling out this training to all levels in the organization. Insights from our diversity footprint analysis contributed to the expansion of important employee benefits. As of January 1, 2017, we offer up to eight weeks Veritas Gender Data* paid parental leave, with 100 percent pay, to U.S.-based employees who are mothers, fathers or domestic partners of a newborn, as well as parents of a newly adopted or newly placed foster child.

For example: • Veritas participates in the TechWomen program, an initiative of the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, designed to empower and support the next generation of women leaders in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) from Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East. In 2017, eight female Veritas employees were mentors to three emerging technical women from Algeria, South Africa and Kyrgyzstan. The mentees spent four weeks at our Mountain View offices learning about Veritas and developing their skills. Three TechWomen mentees spent four weeks at our campus • At our September 2017 Veritas Vision Conference, in Mountain View, California, where they worked with Veritas an inspiring and engaging afternoon was organized: mentors to further develop their technology skills. Women at Vision Empowered. The participants were invited to watch the documentary “She Started It” on women entrepreneurs in the technology industry. The movie was followed by a panel discussion with the movie’s director and a female CEO featured in the movie to discuss women entrepreneurship. A workshop was also put together by Watermark, an organization dedicated to increasing the number of women in leadership positions. Participants discussed the five key influencers for women’s success. • As a Change Alliance Partner for The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference—the world’s largest gathering of women technologists—Veritas was pleased to send over 100 Veritas women to the October 2017 conference in Florida. We welcomed 400 potential candidates at the Veritas booth. Of these, 22 were interviewed on the spot, 315 applications were later reviewed and potential offers are still in progress. We believe a diverse and inclusive culture is defined through action. To support a workforce that embraces every culture, language, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability and background, we have established seven Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) with more than 38 chapters across the company. Our ERGs promote a culture of diversity and inclusion while providing a forum for women and minorities to achieve their full potential and be empowered to succeed.

Our online Privacy Statement lets customers know what information we collect on our websites, and how we use that information in accordance with our mission to make the world a safer place. In addition to ensuring that our customers’ data is safe and protected, we also strive to help our customers improve their data privacy posture and prepare for upcoming data privacy regulations, like the European Union’s forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Veritas’ 360 Data Management for GDPR provides an enterprise-ready compliance solution that helps organizations prepare for the regulations strictest guidelines and arms them with a confident governance approach. Veritas delivers tools and services that are tailor-made for each stage of GDPR-readiness, so that organizations can better locate, search, minimize, protect and monitor their personal and sensitive data. AN OPEN EXCHANGE OF IDEAS Veritas Open Exchange (VOX) is an online platform designed to facilitate conversations, ideas, connections and learnings across our customer community. Launched in July 2016 as the epicenter of on-domain interaction and engagement between both internal and external audiences, we created VOX to get closer to our customers, to better listen to their needs and to use their insights to help guide our business strategy. VOX blogs and discussions also allow our stakeholders to share experiences, ask questions and find answers from industry peers and Veritas employees. During our Vision Conference in September 2017, our executive keynote sessions were streamed live via VOX, allowing us to double event attendance with virtual participants from more than 34 countries. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT Another way we fully represent our brand to customers is responsive social engagement. We use social channels to engage in conversations, welcome innovative ideas, share company updates and highlight newsworthy items. We address negative sentiments, reputational risks or competitive issues in an equally mindful way that protects our brand integrity while providing excellent customer service. We use a “response tree” method to properly evaluate and respond to any customer concerns in a timely manner, with dedicated subject matter experts ready to respond to specific issues.

All Tier 1 suppliers are required to adhere to our Global Supplier Code of Conduct (or “Code”), which describes supplier management. We our standards and expectations for labor, health and safety, the environment and are an Affiliate Member of business ethics. the Responsible Business We have voluntarily adopted the RBA Code of Conduct and applied the Code to our supply chain and Tier 1 suppliers. We add Social and Environmental Alliance (RBA) (formerly Responsibility and/or Conduct requirements to our Tier 1 suppliers’ contracts. the Electronic Industry These added requirements ask suppliers to confirm acknowledgement of the RBA Code of Conduct (including by implementing a compliance management system), Citizenship Coalition)— to complete the RBA Self-Assessment Questionnaire (the results of which are which outlines a strict set reviewed by Veritas) and to participate in the RBA Validated Audit Process.

As such, we support At Veritas, we work to preserve and uphold human rights throughout our company and our supply chain. We have a zero-tolerance policy for forced labor, slavery, the rights and wellbeing of child labor, and human trafficking, as outlined in our Human Rights Policy, the RBA all workers and communities Code of Conduct and the United Nations Global Compact. We comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act, as well as the California Transparency in Supply Chains that are affected by our Act of 2010, which requires us to disclose our efforts to eradicate slavery and supply chain. human trafficking from our supply chains. Beginning in 2018, we are planning for employees with direct responsibility for supply chain management to complete training on recognizing human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain. CONFLICT MINERALS Veritas’ approach to addressing conflict minerals issues in our supply chain aligns with the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) (formerly the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative), led by the RBA and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative. We require our suppliers to complete the RMI’s Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), which identifies mineral country of origin and the smelters and refiners being utilized. The template also facilitates the identification of new smelters and refiners that should undergo an independent third-party audit to verify that they are “conflict-free”. One hundred percent of our suppliers have completed the CMRT. 14 In 2016, we set a goal of validating all products manufactured for Veritas as “conflict-free” across all four minerals (tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold) by 2020. As of FY17, 25 percent of in-scope suppliers provide products to Veritas that do not contain conflict minerals. For more on our conflict minerals due diligence process, please see our Veritas Conflict Minerals Report, which was released in September 2017. SUPPLIER DIVERSITY At Veritas, we believe that supplier diversity is a distinct business advantage that supports economic growth in the communities we serve, and reflects another way we offer value to our customers. As part of our Supplier Diversity program, we actively track our supply base and monitor progress towards our company diversity spending goals. We also participate in various activities of outreach, engagement, and instruction with our current and prospective suppliers, including through supplier mailings, mentoring, attendance at national and regional conferences, and awareness campaigns. LOOKING AHEAD As we work toward regular RBA membership over the coming year, we will further integrate sustainability principles into our standard operating supply chain procedures for sourcing, contracting, and compliance. We plan to implement a Global Supplier Sustainability Program by the end of 2018, which will include sustainability-specific training and expectations guidance for our supply chain employees and Tier 1 suppliers. Through the RBA e-Learning Academy, for example, our employees and suppliers will have access to best-in-class online trainings on a range of sustainability topics, from corporate responsibility program management to methods of combating trafficked and forced labor in the supply chain. 15 Environmental Sustainability Veritas is integrating environmental sustainability priorities into our operational, product, and supply chain strategies.

In our Pune, India facility, our electricity usage dropped by nearly 50 percent in FY17 following an energy audit, the installation of more energy efficient lighting and equipment, and the relocation of our data center to several more efficient spaces. We plan to conduct more energy audits in FY18 in additional locations where energy reduction opportunities exist. • As a first step in improving our waste management efforts, we conducted an independent waste audit at our Mountain View headquarters in March 2017. The audit helped us identify opportunities to increase landfill diversion and cost savings, including adding a compost stream to be compliant with AB 1826 in California (Mandatory Commercial Organics law).

GIVE teams develop relationships with communities where Veritas operates and raises awareness among Veritas employees for causes that are important to employees and local communities. GIVE teams seek opportunities to give back to their communities and raise awareness for the causes that matter most to them. 19 In April 2017, Veritas launched a global product donation program in partnership with TechSoup. This organization provides eligible nonprofits and organizations in the United States and over 40 countries around the world with discounted software, hardware, services and training that enable people to work toward a more equitable world. From April 1 through September 30, 2017, Veritas donated 765 licenses of “Veritas Backup Exec 16” and 202 licenses of “Veritas System Recovery 16, Server Edition” to TechSoup, corresponding to US$1,087,049 of in-kind donations. One of the organizations that Veritas has been pleased to support as part of this program is GNMF, a small nonprofit in the Netherlands dedicated to local conservation and environmental protection efforts. “We have a small computer network to support our work. Security and data protection on our server is very important, but we have little knowledge about it. With Veritas System Recovery, we can now guarantee that our IT is managed in a safe and secure way.” —Joost Reijnen, Adjunct Director of GNMF 20 About this Report Thank you for your interest in Veritas.
