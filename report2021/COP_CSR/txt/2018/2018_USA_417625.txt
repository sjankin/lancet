António Guterres Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 Dear Mr. Secretary-General, I am pleased to report back on the progress made by Real Leaders in its support of the ten principles of the Global Compact, since signing our written commitment to do so one year ago. Furthermore, we would like to express our continued support for the Global Compact and renew our ongoing commitment to the initiative and its principles for a further year. We have made the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company and have engaged in collaborative projects worldwide to advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, and particularly the Sustainable Development Goals. We have taken practical actions to implement the Global Compact principles. As a global media company and the world’s first sustainable business & leadership magazine, we have adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals as our publishing template. On our website (www.real-leaders.com) and in our print publications, we have categorized our content against the 17 goals as a way of clearly showing, and educating, our audience around the types of action that can be taken to achieve each goal. This has included an interview with Executive Director of the UN Global Compact, Ms. Lise Kingo that was distributed to our global audience. All our print magazines have a dedicated upfront page (https://real-leaders.com/summer-2018/7/) that outlines all 17 Sustainable Development Goals and acts as a guide to the stories we feature. Each story in the magazine is flagged with a relevant SDG logo to highlight the action business can take to achieve the SDG’s. Real Leaders is committed to educating and inspiring business leaders around the world by showing them how to run their companies according to responsible and sustainable business practice. Real Leaders has promoted and implemented the Global Compact principles in both print and digital formats, that have been viewed by the following audiences: 1.
