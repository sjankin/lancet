Letter from RiTS CEO 04 It gives me pleasure to submit our report to UN Global Compact for the year to September 2018. Our company and our team have a burning desire to make positive change to Iraqi society. As we explained in our last communication starting from 2016 we changed our direction, to focus our efforts on the problem of youth unemployment as we see it the biggest single threat to Iraqi society. Hence we focused our efforts to help graduate entrepreneurs own successful projects. Entrepreneurship being a highly neglected aspect of development in Iraq. We gained experience from establishing Iraq’s first business startups incubator in 2016 and at the same time we experimented with establishing social media grouping that brings together Iraqi professionals, scientists, mentors, inventors, academics, business leaders, and investors to work closely with the graduate entrepreneurs. This form of “Crowdsourcing” was hosted on Linked in initially. Our flagship initiative under the title “Noah’s Ark” was launched on 3rd August 2017. The Ark is an online incubator providing help and support for ALL Iraqi graduate entrepreneurs and for ALL their startup needs. This initiative is quite unique as, unlike all similar initiatives including UNDP’s own “Innovation for Development”, we work on the base of the pyramid rather than the tip. So we are not searching for a few good ideas. Rather we are searching for all potential entrepreneurs 05 (we found they form 12% of Iraqi graduates). Thereafter the role of the incubator and supporting crowd is to help each entrepreneur choose an idea for his/her startup. Thereafter helping them enrich the idea with the latest in science and technology to maximize its competitiveness, nursing the project until launch and beyond. We have made reasonable progress so far with Noah’s Ark and are beginning to attract help and support from a number of influential organizations. We pause to let the platform statistics to speak for themselves. Finally we reconfirm our support for the UNGC objectives. The remainder of this COP will indicate our commitment. Sincerely, Aziz Alnassiri CEO, RiTS 06 Human Rights Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Assessment, Policy and Goals: With our growing staff as a pioneering company in Iraq and for the recognized Iraqi situation, human rights is one of our priorities, and as one of our goals is to rebuild the Iraqi humanity ,we at (RiTS) have a clear and strong policy to ensure a healthy environment for wellbeing and creativity .

Assessment, Policy and Goals: We have no instructions or regulations that prevent the freedom of association, or the right of collective bargaining. We hold regular staff general meetings whereby the staff are encouraged to make suggestions to improve the workplace environment. Indeed, we are proud of the garden we planted last summer thanks to a suggestion from a member of staff. We have embedded in our processes a policy for the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation , away from any ethnicity, gender, religion, political trends in compliance with the laws governing the country. As an example we never mention gender as a condition of filling a vacancy. On the other hand, RiTS eliminates all forms of forced and compulsory labour, such as child labour. The youngest employee we ever employed was 19 years old. Implementation: We allow staff time off work to engage in community training participation to enhance and develop their social skills. We have implemented a partial staff training and development programme, encouraging employees to develop and build on their existing skills base. All personnel are encouraged to develop their skills by attending appropriate training courses.

Measurement of outcomes: Being restricted in some environmental related issues, allowed us to have a small but yet beautiful garden which will affect purity of the air surrounding the office. In this year we have met and supported a number of social impact entrepreneurs who we expected to have a positive results locally. Anti-corruption 09 Assessment, Policy and Goals: Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery Iraq is one of the leading countries in corrupt practices. Unfortunately it is not one of the leading countries in fighting corruption. Yet corruption is causing severe hindrance to the expansion of the economy and it almost always led to failed projects. RiTS has devised 4 projects, the first of which deals with petty corruption over citizen transactions. The second project deals with the corruption associated with public sector purchasing. The third and fourth projects deal with a specific corruption type that affects the lives of many Iraqis, namely the ration card system and the handling of crude oil. In implementing these anti-corruption solutions, it is hoped that Iraqis will gain rare and comprehensive knowledge in anti-corruption methodologies and practices. This knowledge can then be positively exploited to sell Iraqi consulting expertise to the rest of the world, thereby turning a difficulty into a positive opportunity. Furthermore, it is been a year since we launched the first Iraqi platform for entrepreneurship, which allows young entrepreneurs to invent, share their ideas in public, and find funding opportunities in a new form that will, hopefully, open the door for the youth and investors to participate in a growing Iraqi economy away from corrupt practices. Implementation: RiTS Initiative to implicitly fight corruption (Noah’s Ark), the first virtual platform for entrepreneurship in Iraq is now one year old, and have a rapidly increased numbers of visitors and members, which hopefully will contribute in creating an ecosystem of large numbers of business startups, thus generating a new thriving private sector free from corrupt practices. http://noah-ark.org/ Measurement of outcomes: The great feedback and cooperation opportunities we have this passing year are very important indications of the Iraqi will to fight corruption in all its forms, as we are still in the starting phase of building the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Iraq, it sounds very promising culture that the Iraqi youth insisting on building and we are going to help by building the concrete and basic environment through Noah’s Ark.
