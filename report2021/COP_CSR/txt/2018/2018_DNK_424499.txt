We grow over 30 different crops, and raise almost 150,000 heads of livestock every year. Ingleby wants to be a world leader in sustainable farming. More than 3,000 people work on our farms and help us care Our goal is to produce sound, healthy food on thriving and living farms. for our crops, livestock, biodiversity and soils. We love the land and are committed to the intelligent management of the Earth’s resources. We want to grow more with less. We substitute input with knowledge. We work hard to grow our crops and rear our livestock, while actively promoting biodiversity, fertile soils, animal welfare and greener energy sources. In Ingleby, we know that we can't be green, if we are in the red. But we are farmers, not land speculators. We are not out to make fast returns by taking shortcuts or mining our farms. Our approach to sustainable farming attracts high-quality and skilled colleagues. It gives us respect and legitimacy in our communities. And it makes our work more complex and interesting.

We hope that being an ethical producer will make us a preferred supplier of both quality milk and beef. Ultimately it is the informed consumer who will drive change within the dairy industry by supporting dairy farms that raise male calves, and purchasing high quality dairy beef.

EXTENSIVE GRAZING Extensively grazed pastures accumulate organic matter and, as a result, serve as carbon sinks rather than carbon sources. Keeping stock numbers low and allowing the vegetation to recover naturally, prevents overgrazing and exposure of the soil, which in turn prevents leaching of nutrients and erosion. Not introducing any exotic forage species benefits indigenous invertebrates, birds and mammals specially adapted to the original vegetation. Cattle grazing on natural grasslands, Uruguay.

ENGAGING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY To engage our local community in wildlife management as well as farming, we work with the Center for Advanced Research and Technology High School in Clovis, California. Each year, 6-7 students come out to our farm during our nest box inspections that takes place twice a year. Initially, the students prepare a hypothesis, which forms the basis of their thesis. As part of their curriculum, their thesis, along with their findings, is presented at the end of the semester. This way, the students get hands-on experience working with wildlife and in return, we get to see their scientific results. Students inspecting owls, USA. Photographer: Gary R.

SAFETY IN INGLEBY Our overall goal in Ingleby is a zero-harm work culture. Realistically, we know that this is difficult to achieve. Farming is a hazardous profession. Our farm teams work with large machinery, vehicles, chemicals and livestock. They are exposed to bad weather, noise and dust. Providing safe work environments for our teams is one of our most important responsibilities. In 2017/18, we increased our focus on health and safety at all levels in the organisation and implemented the Safety Colleague concept. We reduced the total number of accidents worldwide by 21% and near misses by 50% compared to 2016/17. But even one accident is one too many, and we will continue focusing on health and safety in 2018/19. Milking carousel, Tasmania.
