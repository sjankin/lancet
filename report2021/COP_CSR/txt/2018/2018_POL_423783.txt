At the outset, I would like emphasise that our Company’s greatest asset is its employees and that none of the achievements you will read about in this Report would have been possible without their dedication. On behalf of the Management Board of Grupa LOTOS S.A., I would like to extend our sincere thanks to all of the Group’s employees. 2017 saw record-high financial performance by Grupa LOTOS. Optimal asset management by the Company and its taking maximum advantage of favourable market conditions as well as effective measures taken by the Polish government to combat the ‘grey market’ led to consolidated revenue of more than PLN 24bn, up by over 15% year on year, and net profit of close to PLN 1.7bn, up by as much as 65% year on year. We are also proud to have delivered highest-ever LIFO-based EBITDA, which in 2017 came in at PLN 3.1bn.1 In line with the Company’s robust performance, the price of its shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange rose from approximately PLN 38 in autumn 2017 to a high of PLN 69. We also paid the first dividend in a decade. Taking advantage of favourable macroeconomic conditions, we managed to reduce the Company’s net debt by PLN 2.3bn and optimise its structure, which resulted in a safe financial leverage of 23% at year-end. Grupa LOTOS’s refinery is among the most technologically advanced ones in Europe and is currently undergoing yet another key upgrade. In 2017, we processed more than 9.6m tonnes of crude oil. We are the second largest producer of fuels in Poland. Every third car in the country fills the tanks with fuel produced by our refinery. We either own or hold interest in 33 offshore and 10 onshore licences. In addition to conducting upstream operations in Poland and the Polish zone of the Baltic Sea, we also produce hydrocarbons on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and in Lithuania. In 2017, the sum of our 2P reserves rose to 88.2m barrels, with production at 8.4m barrels. One of Grupa LOTOS’s strategic objectives for 2017–2022 is to enhance the security of our environment in line with Poland’s economic, environmental and energy policies, including by taking measures to diversify our feedstock sources. As part of our efforts to achieve this goal, we restructured our upstream operations, a process which included establishing LOTOS Upstream, a company dedicated to managing the Group’s upstream activities and investment projects. Own hydrocarbon production, which is our key business segment, helps us diversify feedstock sources and thereby reduce business risk, while significantly enhancing Poland’s energy security. Our diversification efforts last year included purchase of feedstock from the US and Canada and signing a forward contract for the supply of US crude oil. We are guided by the principle of sustainable development in all our business areas, which translates into building value not only for our shareholders, but also for our environment and diverse stakeholder groups. We are convinced that in pursuit of sustainable development we will continue generating profits for shareholders, providing high quality products and services, and ensuring energy security for Poland. Committed to sustainability, Grupa LOTOS cooperates with the United Nations Global Compact on an ongoing basis, has joined a partnership for the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030, has been listed in the RESPECT Index, and was ranked 4th in the 11th edition of the Responsible Business Ranking. 1 Net of one-off events and direct costs of a maintenance shutdown at the refinery 6 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS In order to be able to fully satisfy consumer requirements and maintain our competitive edge, we remain focused on our innovation projects, including, in particular, those related to low-carbon transport and alternative fuels, such as hydrogen, CNG and LNG. One of our most ambitious strategic objectives is to become the leader of the Polish next-generation fuel market. We have been also developing our know-how associated with the use of hydrogen as a fuel for vehicles and as a means to store energy. I am pleased to be able to report to you our strong performance in 2017. On behalf of the entire Management Board, I would also like to assure you that we will make every effort to ensure that through our decisions we continue to deliver value for all Grupa LOTOS stakeholders. Yours faithfully, Mateusz A. Bonca President of the Management Board Grupa LOTOS S.A. 7 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS LETTER FROM THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD G4-1 G4-2 Ladies and Gentlemen, 2017 was a successful year for the oil industry. Favourable macroeconomic conditions, with average annual oil and gas prices far above expectations, and effective measures taken by the Polish government to combat the ‘grey market’ were among the key drivers of oil companies’ growth. Grupa LOTOS took full advantage of the favourable market conditions, delivering record-breaking financial results last year. The Company’s strong performance was also appreciated by investors, naturally resulting in a rise in its capitalisation. The Management Board of Grupa LOTOS managed to markedly reduce its debt and improve cash flows from operating activities. For the first time in a decade, LOTOS also paid a dividend. As part of a plan to remodel its corporate structure, Grupa LOTOS established LOTOS Upstream, a company dedicated to managing the Group’s upstream operations. It was a key development for the Group, contributing not only to the consolidation of its upstream business, but also to Poland’s energy security at large. In early 2017, LOTOS commenced implementing its strategy for 2017–2022, which is focused on financial stability and development. The Management Board remains committed to delivering these two objectives. In 2017, Grupa LOTOS devoted a lot of effort to the EFRA Project, a key deep crude oil processing upgrade of its refinery. As at the end of 2017, the project was 90% completed. What is important, Grupa LOTOS invests in innovation. In order to meet market challenges and attain its goal of becoming the leader in implementing innovations on the Polish market, it develops electric mobility initiatives and focuses on key projects in the field of alternative fuels. I hope that 2018 will see LOTOS continue its robust performance and strong growth in key areas.

The second stage of the strategy implementation, covering the years 2019-2022, schedules the implementation of a new investment program based on the best development projects, effective construction of the mining assets portfolio and further development of the fuel station network and implementation of innovative projects building the future value of the LOTOS Group. By implementing the adopted strategy, we want to continue to build our position of: • optimally vertically integrated manufacturer of high quality fuels and chemical products, • supplier of specialized logistic services and other services • the leader of implementing innovations within the scope of the core business. At the same time implementing the strategy „Stabilization and safe development” is a guarantee of a stable increase in value for the shareholders and an important role in ensuring the country’s energy security. More about our strategy STRATEGIC GOALS OF THE LOTOS GROUP As part of the strategy, we have set the five main strategic goals, the implementation of which will enable the stable development of the group: 1. effective use of assets: conducting activities under extraction licenses, further technological optimization of refineries, introduction of new products and alternative fuels, and care for quality standards, 2. successive and repeatable reduction of operating costs and optimization of margin in the entire value chain, 3. readiness to develop and implement innovations with a dedicated fund, a modern model of cooperation with research centers and creative involvement of employees, 4. flexibility in responding to emerging risks that the LOTOS Group also sees through the prism of business opportunities, 5. care and development of talents in the organization, improving broadly understood security (work, infrastructure and information systems) and greater social responsibility. MAIN MEASURES OF STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION We have adopted the following key parameters for implementing the strategy: 1. doubling the average annual LIFO EBITDA result in 2019-2022 to the level of approx. PLN 4 billion, 2. reduction of the debt ratio: net debt / LIFO EBITDA to the level not higher than 1.5x, 3. implementation of investment projects for the total amount of PLN 9.4 billion within 6 years, 4. possession of the 2P crude oil and gas reserve base (certain and probable) at the level not less than 60 million boe, 5. reaching the level of hydrocarbon production at the level of approx. 30-50 thousand boe per day (i.e. barrels of oil equivalent for the day of extraction), 22 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS 6. expanding the sales network to 550 petrol stations, 7. keeping the LTIF (Lost Time Injury Frequency) below 3. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGY IN 2017 In 2017, we carried out intensive work on the strategy operationalization and the implementation of an effective system for monitoring the objectives implementation. We launched a cyclical process of monitoring the implementation of individual strategic initiatives and set up a cross-functional forum for discussing the key challenges and development directions of the Group. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE „EFFICIENTLY USED ASSETS IN THE ENTIRE VALUE CHAIN” IN 2017 A new, safer concept for the development of a sustainable extraction portfolio The year 2017 was intended for the reorganization of the extraction segment and preparation of a plan for the construction of a balanced asset portfolio. A new company was established – LOTOS Upstream, which will eventually acquire extraction and exploration activities, while LOTOS Petrobaltic will operate in the field of services for extraction companies. Highest competitiveness thanks to technological innovations and new products The main investment of Grupa LOTOS S.A. is the EFRA Project (Effective Refining), which, by the construction of one of the most advanced installations of delayed coking, will enable deeper processing of crude oil. The project will contribute to the increase in the model margin by approx. USD 2 / bbl. The progress of the whole EFRA Project implementation at the end of December 2017 amounted to 90%. At the same time, the analytical and preparatory activities have been undertaken regarding the portfolio of further development projects. Three possible directions for the further development of the refinery are considered: • oil block for the production of Group II and III base oils, • gasoline complex for the production of motor gasolines from raw gasoline, • olefin complex along with production of ETBE. The decision to launch another project will be made in the second half of 2018. LOTOS Energy Hub in retail and care for high quality standards Retail trade at the LOTOS Group is carried out by LOTOS Paliwa, responsible for managing the fuel stations network. In 2017, we continued work on the standardization of the service station network in terms of unifying its image: external and internal visualization as well as optimization of service quality at petrol stations. In the general satisfaction ranking from the national fuel station network, the LOTOS station network achieved the highest result among the competition. Concurrently to expanding the network, we develop and improve the non-fuel offer, including catering, groceries and additional services (car washes, trailer rentals). This is also accompanied by opening new Subway points of sales. The LOTOS service station network is also preparing for challenges related to the development of electromobility. In the last year, we have selected 50 stations on the TEN-T roads (motorways and expressways in Poland) that are to be equipped with electric vehicle charging points. At the same time, using the EU funds, 23 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS we implement a pilot implementation of the first 12 charging points. The aim is to allow free passage of electric vehicles on the Gdynia – Gdańsk – Warsaw route. w punkty ładowania pojazdów energią elektryczną. Jednocześnie wykorzystując fundusze unijne, realizujemy pilotażowe wdrożenie pierwszych 12 punktów ładowania. Celem jest umożliwienie swobodnego przejazdu pojazdom elektrycznym na trasie Gdynia – Gdańsk – Warszawa. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGIC GOAL „EFFECTIVE PROCESSES GUARANTEEING STABILITY” IN 2017 We launched the Effectiveness Improvement Program, which aims to optimize cost management and streamline processes within the organization. In the published results of Solomon Associates for 2016, Grupa LOTOS S.A. confirmed its competitive advantages, being in the first quartile for the areas of Process Utilization, Energy Intensity Index, Return on Investment. The implementation of the strategic objective also requires actions on the commercial side, including the optimization of the integrated margin and the diversification of raw materials. In 2017, over 20% of crude oil processed at the Gdańsk refinery came from a direction other than the one from the east. Material diversification is an important measure in the process of ensuring stable crude oil supplies to the Grupa LOTOS S.A. refinery and improving the efficiency of its processing. At the end of 2017, Grupa LOTOS S.A. signed a derivative contract for the supply of American crude oil to the refinery in Gdańsk. The contract provides for the delivery of a minimum of 5 crude oil by sea in 2018. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGIC GOAL „READINESS TO IMPLEMENT INNOVATION” IN 2017 In 2017, we focused our main efforts in the field of innovation on the implementation of new models of cooperation with research units and start-ups, creating joint research agendas. Grupa LOTOS S.A. has joined projects including Space3ac start-up acceleration – a pilot project within the government program Start in Poland, the effect of which is to commercialize innovative solutions, including products and services. We have also initiated a program for supporting the internal innovativeness, the LOTOS Inspiruje program, which created a framework for the functioning of the process of notification of innovative ideas by employees and the evaluation of these ideas. LOTOS Vera (a subsidiary of LOTOS Lab) will implement innovative and development projects for Grupa LOTOS S.A. In the near future, it is planned to set up an incubator for innovative projects, what will allow for the full use of innovation potential. We have also undertook actions to launch a corporate innovation support fund (Corporate Venture Capital fund), which will seek and acquire innovative projects to improve the operations of the LOTOS Group, and to build new business areas. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE „ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS” IN 2017 We have developed a new approach to managing risks and opportunities at the LOTOS Group. Particularly noteworthy is the new categorization of risks, defining 4 main categories of risks in operations: strategic, operational, financial and reputation and compliance with regulations. At the same time, we are developing methodology and strengthening our competences in the area of ​​searching and defining business opportunities, allowing us to eliminate identified risks and create value for shareholders. 24 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGIC GOAL „STRONG TEAM, CONSISTENT CSR AND SECURITY” IN 2017 Caring for talents as the key element of competitive advantage We have taken the initiative to build a knowledge management system in the organization based on modern channels (e-learning platform). This solution will allow the effective transfer and sharing of knowledge and will support systemic development of employees’ competencies necessary to implement current and prospective business goals. Projects aimed at the development of managerial staff are aimed at the preparation for efficient functioning in the organization and construction of a culture of continuous improvement. Confirmation of involvement in employee matters and professional management of human resources is granted in 2017, for the third time in a row, by the Polish Human Resources Association for Grupa LOTOS S.A., the Certificate of HR of the Highest Quality. 25 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE G4-2 G4-14 UPSTREAM SEGMENT We will optimize the financing structure in the coming years. We will gradually build a healthy and balanced portfolio of assets based on currently known investment projects. We intend to increase our involvement in the development of deposits, supplement the portfolio of extraction assets based on market opportunities and limit the share of concessions for deposits in the mature phase of extraction, in the entire asset portfolio. In addition to organic growth, we plan to actively use the investment opportunities available on the market and complement the portfolio based on the purchase of new attractive assets. An important element of our activities is building a strong position around the existing Sleipner and Heimdal hubs, as well as the construction of new hubs, e.g. in the area north of Heimdal. We strive to maximize the output from currently producing deposits, effective development of new deposits using the existing infrastructure in the so-called fast-track, extension of the hub’s lifecycle and postponement of obligations related to the decommissioning of production infrastructure. As part of the implementation of the hub strategy, we cooperate with experienced Statoil and AkerBP operators, what ensures high efficiency of operations. The main direction for the development of our mining operations will be the North Sea areas, both as part of the Norwegian and British Shelters, as well as the Baltic Basin region (Baltic Sea, land concessions in Poland and Lithuania). The total capital expenditure provided for in the Grupa LOTOS S.A. Strategy for the development of defined extraction projects is PLN 3 billion in the 2017-2022 period. In addition, the Strategy provides for the possibility of allocating additional funds from the PLN 3.3 billion pool to be divided among the Segments into new development projects in the perspective after 2018. DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT CRUDE OIL REFINING We intend to maintain a technological advantage in the Central Europe region and to compete in the field of innovation. We are implementing the EFRA Project investment program. We also analyze three potential directions of building a further competitive advantage based on developed refinery assets. DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT RETAIL We are planning to optimize customer service and sales processes, revitalize the loyalty program and introduce innovative products and services while improving current services. We strive to become the leader in the implementation of new generation fuels (CNG, LNG, electricity, hydrogen) as part of the LOTOS Energy Hub project. INNOVATIONS We will develop new models of cooperation with research units and start-ups, creating joint research agendas and a fund for the implementation of innovative solutions. Investment expenditures for 2017-2022: • PLN 2.0 billion for already implemented projects, • PLN 4.1 billion reserved for prepared projects but before the final investment decision (mainly in the extraction segment), • PLN 3.3 billion planned as additional capital expenditures after 2018 – for alternative projects, the final selection of which will take place in 2018 on the basis of economic parameters and market development. 26 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS G4-2 G4-14 KEY OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS IN THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT SEGMENT OPPORTUNITIES RELATED SEGMENT RISKS RELATED TO EXTERNAL FACTORS: TO EXTERNAL FACTORS: • indications of the possibility of an upturn of the econo• the growth dynamics of oil and natural gas prices is mic situation in the commodity market, lower than assumed in the assumptions for 2017-2022, • higher profitability of developing the new deposits as a • high variability of macroeconomic conditions at the result of cost reduction in the upstream sector, among moment of making key decisions in strategic projects, others, in the price of drilling services, • growing competition in the transaction market, inc• greater availability of oil platforms due to the lower luding from companies supported by private equity utilization rate, funds. • the potential for further cost optimization and increase in the efficiency of the industry as a result of implementing innovations and advanced technical and technological solutions, • the withdrawal of some players from the mining and production area gives the opportunity to acquire attractive assets, • the emergence of new development opportunities, eg.

The growing competition from refineries from the Middle East will be the source of the basic risks in the segment of production and trade. It should be expected that the main European market for these refineries will be the Mediterranean area, however, it will affect the total fuel balance in Europe. In addition, the risk of possible decline and low level of product cracks, especially for medium distillates (i.e. light heating oil and diesel oil) will be a threat. On the other hand, the possibility of high demand for fuels on the part of individual customers and the potential closure of smaller and technologically outdated refineries, as a result of optimization of assets by European fuel concerns, may be a chance. RISKS OF THE LOTOS GROUP STRATEGIC RISKS FINANCIAL RISKS In 2017, the key risks affecting both current and long-term The activities of the LOTOS Group are constantly accomresults were related to the implementation of strategic and panied by market risks, i.e. the variability of prices of raw development projects, such as the EFRA Project (delayed materials and petroleum products, changes in the exchange coking project), the development of the B8 field or the deverates and in the interest rates. Favorable macroeconomic lopment of the Norwegian resources projects. conditions in 2017 (upward trend in crude oil prices, high margins on petroleum products) allowed to take advantage The regulatory risks at the national and European level are of opportunities and positively influenced the results of the also important from the point of view of LOTOS’s functioLOTOS Group. ning.

It allowed us to negative effects and to take advantage of emerging opportufinance development projects in accordance with strategic nities (i.e. in the field of electromobility development). assumptions, enabling conducting basic and current operations as well as further investing in the development and servicing the long-term liabilities. OPERATIONAL RISKS REPUTATION RISK AND COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS (COMPLIANCE) We constantly monitor risks in every operational activity that we carry out in various areas, including, in particular, all As the LOTOS Capital Group, we operate in the legal risks related to human and environmental safety and technienvironment of many regulations and regulations. In order cal risks affecting the security and continuity of operational to minimize the risk of non-compliance with applicable legal processes. We use the available methods to limit their occuand other requirements, a „compliance” structure was estarrence. Striving to meet the expectations of our clients in the blished in all LOTOS Group companies supporting activities best way possible, we also mitigate risks that could threaten in this area. business, logistics or sales processes and adversely affect the quality of the product, service or customer experience. The good, two-sided and mutually beneficial relations are also very important to us: with the key stakeholders: shareholders and investors, society, environment, employees, suppliers and financial institutions. The way to reduce the relational and image risks is to ensure maximum transparency of our activities. We are constantly improving in conducting dialogue with our environment and within the Group, and we try to report our activities as fully and reliably as possible. 28 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS RISK MANAGEMENT IN LOTOS GROUP G4-2 G4-14 The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system implemented at the LOTOS Group supports the effective implementation of business strategies and processes. We make the most important business decisions based on risk analysis. The principles of identification and risk assessment applied by us allow us to respond to threats in a timely manner and to reduce or eliminate them altogether. We actively shape the business risk profile, minimizing the impact of threats on achieving the set goals, for the entire organization, our social environment and the environment. Our risk management system also allows to identify and use emerging opportunities. The main principles of risk management in our organization are presented in the „Corporate risk management policy at the LOTOS Group”. They are described in detail in the procedure of conduct applicable to all companies in the Group. Active management of opportunities and threats has been defined as one of the strategic objectives for 2017-2022. We implement them through two strategic initiatives: • risk management optimizing value for stakeholders, • building a strong culture of open discussion and early response to the first signals of threats, and in the long term also more effective management of risk appetite. In 2017, we developed directions for further development of the ERM system based on the best market practices. We have introduced changes to the organizational structure of Grupa LOTOS S.A. by appointing, among others, Corporate Risk Management Office. We also made improvements in the concept and operation of the ERM system in the LOTOS Group. As part of the ERM system, our activities focus on key operational risks, in particular on forecasting their impact on the organization’s operations. This allows defining risk scenarios, forecasting the possible impact of risk (the so-called risk exposure) and developing of pre-emptive actions that may affect the reduction or use of risk or its consequences. We are working on further strengthening of this key functionality in the system. In 2017, in the segment of ​​risk management, we introduced: • categories of so-called TOP RISK, that is the most important threats for organizations that are prioritized by the management boards of the group’s companies and additionally analyzed by the Corporate Risk Management Office and reported to the Management Board of Grupa LOTOS S.A., • changes in risk assessment matrices in the scope of financial and reputation assessment criteria, • a new matrix for assessing opportunities, which enables the identification of those opportunities that are most beneficial from the point of view of the strategy being implemented and their use, • we appointed coordinators in the LOTOS Group companies who are developing • and supporting the risk identification and assessment process in subsidiaries. They are also responsible for risk communication in the company, • shortening formal processes and focusing on taking pre-emptive and mitigating actions. Activities implemented as part of the corporate risk management process in the LOTOS Group are supported by an internal IT tool – the ERM Portal, which is subject to constant development and improvement. RISK MANAGEMENT MODEL AT THE LOTOS GROUP Our risk management model is based on three lines of defense. The operational mechanisms of current risk management are embedded in existing business processes (so-called 1st line of defense), which are tailored to the specifics of a given activity and the scale of potential risk effects on the LOTOS Group’s results. Another level of risk management (the so-called 2nd line of defense) is supervision and assessment of the effectiveness of operational ways of managing a given risk, ensured by effective organizational functions of areas: Risk, Compliance and Finance. 29 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS Ultimately, the adequacy and effectiveness of the entire risk management system is periodically verified by the Internal Audit (the so-called 3rd line of defense). 1st LINE OF DEFENSE Business • operational risk management in processes and projects • development of operational procedures • identification and assessment of risk at the stage of business decisions and periodic risk reviews 2nd LINE OF DEFENSE Risk, Finance, Compliance • establishing risk management principles in the LOTOS Group • connecting risk management to the LOTOS Group’s strategy • forecasting and shaping the risk exposures and risk profile of the LOTOS Group 3rd LINE OF DEFENSE Internal Audit • independent assessment of the effectiveness and adequacy of the risk management process in the LOTOS Group STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ERM) We implement the management of opportunities and threats at the corporate level as a part of a process which assumes important stages (in accordance with the guidelines of the ISO 31000 standard): • identification of risks – risks are recognized in the context of strategic and operational (annual) objectives, • risk analysis and assessment – the assessment takes place in two time perspectives: annual and long-term. • The evaluation criteria are both financial and reputation effects, aggregated as an impact on non-financial parameters: image, environment and people, • determining the way of dealing with risk – for each of the material risks, the current management method is determined, control measures and protective mechanisms are indicated. For the most important category of 30 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS threats (so-called TOP RISK) detailed risk management cards are prepared, the actions to reduce risks and take advantage of opportunities are planned, as well as the manner in which risks are materialized, • implementation of risk mitigation and exploitation measures – implementation of tasks defined in the risk management plans and ongoing monitoring of their status, • monitoring the risk indicators – key risks are defined for key risks (KRI – key risk indicator), which allow monitoring the level of exposure to risk and the likelihood of risk materialization, in accordance with the adopted principles, • risk reviews – periodically (twice a year) review and update of the assessment of all defined risks, • communication and reporting – standards for communicating and reporting results of implemented activities were implemented at every stage of the process; The Management Board and the Supervisory Board receive systematically a quarterly report on the risk within the organization and effectiveness of actions taken to limit (concerns risks) or use (concerns opportunities) it, • In the annual cycle, we analyze the effectiveness and adequacy of the risk management system and make decisions regarding the directions of further development of the ERM system. 31 04 SUMMARY OF YEAR 2017 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS YEAR 2017 – TIMETABLE JANUARY Grupa LOTOS S.A. was presented with a special award in “Innovation” category in the “Leader of Technical Safety 2016” ranking.

DECEMBER Grupa LOTOS S.A., for the eleventh time, was included in the RESPECT Index – an index of the most socially responsible companies of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. A meeting of the Pomeranian Cluster of Hydrogen and Clean Energy Technologies, which federates enterprises and institutions operating in this area, took place at the headquarters of Grupa LOTOS S.A. The co-founder of the project is the LOTOS Group, which appreciates the wide range of application of this element. Grupa LOTOS S.A. signed a derivative contract for the supply of American oil to the refinery in Gdansk – minimum 5 tankers in year 2018. 34 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT The LOTOS Group is an active participant in the fuel market, influencing it with its operations, as well as responding to changes in the industry on a regular basis. Therefore, as part of defining strategic directions of development, LOTOS takes into account forecasts and megatrends affecting its business. In 2017, the growth of the global economy by 3.7% and demographic changes in the world positively influenced the results of the global fuel sector. According to fuel market experts, the forecasts for the next years for the fuel industry seem to be optimistic as well. THE CRUDE OIL MARKET IN 2017 The increase in the world’s population (up to 7.55 billion) and the good condition of the global economy in 2017 resulted in the increase in the demand for crude oil. On average, based on available economic studies, it amounted to 97.9 mb/d in 2017, so it is about 1.5% more than in 2016. In 2017, for the first time in over two years, global demand exceeded the global supply of crude oil. Oil consumption in the US, Europe, China and India, that is in the regions and countries responsible for more than half of the global demand for oil, has been growing over the past 4 years. The growing demand resulted in oil price increase: at the end of 2017, the price of Brent Dated crude oil amounted to $66/bbl, which was the highest in three years. On average, the prices of this raw material increased to $54.2/bbl and were higher by $11/bbl than in the previous year. The average price of natural gas amounted to $32/boe, which translates to an increase of almost 25% compared to the average prices recorded in 2016. At the same time, in the last four years, the extraction industry has made significant cost optimization in terms of, among others, drilling and offshore services, lifting costs, costs of development of new fields (standardization of technical solutions, technological progress, improved contracting and purchasing processes for products and offshore services) – the average noted decrease in operating costs amounted to 40% compared to year 2013. CHALLENGES AND GLOBAL FORECASTS FOR THE FUTURE After a series of increases in the first and second quarters of 2018, the economists predict that oil prices in the second half of 2018 will gradually return to the range of $40-70/bbl. The producers have reduced the costs of raw material extraction using new technologies, cooperation models and innovations. Therefore, despite the decline in the valuation of deposits, the sector remains attractive to investors. In the nearest future the industry will face challenges resulting from the introduction of new regulations. The following legislative factors may influence the results of exploration and production: changes in tax regulations regarding hydrocarbon production; changes in environmental protection regulations, including the introduction of stricter regulations and/or an increase in the amount of obligatory collaterals against the possible risk of causing damage to the environment; changes in the licensing system as well as conditions and mode of allocating new permits for exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons. Regulatory changes and meeting new requirements, resulting in more and more stringent standards may require additional capital expenditures and/or increasing operating costs. The challenge of the Polish oil market is still the so-called “grey economy”. Activities of the government administration – so-called “fuel package” – and of oil concerns, counteracting the illegal trade of petroleum products in Poland, contributed to its significant reduction and additionally influenced the increase in registered demand for diesel oil. After three-year long decline in registered consumption, caused by the intensive development of the shadow market, in 2017 the fuel consumption increased by 12%. In 2017, the first „Fuel Package”, implemented on 1 August 2016, was followed by further legal provisions limiting the activity of the grey economy in fuel trade in Poland. A so-called “transport package” was implemented as well. The new regulations subjected the sender, the receiver and the carriers to the obligation to notify the commencement of transport and its termination. The Uniform Control File (JPK – similar to SAF-T) has been implemented, which allows business operation tracking. 35 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS Another of the means limiting the grey economy in the fuel market are the changes that came into force in 2018 (as a part of the amendment to the Act on biocomponents and liquid biofuels), on introducing obligatory fuel blending. The solutions implemented so far and the effective enforcement of them limited the illegal import of diesel oil to Poland and caused a significant increase in the demand for this product. According to JBC data, global demand for refinery products will continue to grow. The continuing development of the economies of Central and Eastern European countries implies further increase in fuel consumption to par with the levels of Western Europe. From the point of view of the fuel producers, the Central and Eastern European market, as it is still growing, is the most promising in the coming years. The expected improvement in the economic situation both in Poland and in the region (increase in GDP, decrease in unemployment, increase in the purchasing power of households) is also going to stimulate demand for oil products. Situation in the sector will be affected by general macroeconomic factors (for example permanent risk of lower economic growth in China, fluctuation of the dollar against other currencies, rate of economic improvement in the euro area) and development of geopolitical situation (for example sanctions imposed on Iran, conflict in Syria, tensions between Iraq and Iran, situation in North Africa). The growing competition from refineries situated in the Middle East will be the source of the basic risks in the downstream segment. It should be expected that the main European market for these refineries will be the Mediterranean area, however, it will affect the total fuel balance in Europe. In addition, the possible decline and low level of product cracks, especially for medium distillates (i.e. light heating and diesel oil) might pose a threat. On the other hand, a high demand for fuels from individual customers may be a chance. The increase in gasoline consumption by retail customers may be supported by a favorable price level (derived from low, stable raw material prices, expressed in US dollars, and the weakening Polish złoty exchange rate against the US currency). Another opportunity may also be the potential closure of smaller and technologically outdated refineries, as a result of assets optimization by European fuel concerns. 36 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS FINANCIAL CAPITAL G4-EC1 G4-EC5 G4-EC8 G4-EC9 The year 2017 was a breakthrough year for LOTOS Group when it comes to financial results. In the last year we have significantly improved our financial results, mainly with favorable prices of crude oil and petroleum products on world’s markets. Thanks to good economic situation the sales income of the LOTOS Group amounted to PLN 24.186 billion, that is a 15% increase compared to year 2016. Moreover, the consolidated nett profit reached historical level of PLN 1.7 billion, thus increasing by over 64% compared to the previous year. 37 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS WE’RE INCREASING POWER AND CONSTANTLY BREAKING OUR OWN RECORDS The good financial results are an effect of consistent implementation of our business strategy “Stability and sustainable growth for years 2017-2022”. Among the most important activities in the series of actions carried out in the last year are, inter alia, diversification of sources of materials, realization of innovative projects, including research on biofuels of 2nd and 3rd generation, hydrogen technology and electromobility. Thanks to them we were able once more to close the financial year successfully and break the existing financial results records. In 2017, the adjusted EBITDA (according to LIFO) amounted to the highest level in history of the company – PLN 3.1 billion. We are also proud of our, another record, adjusted EBITDA for the upstream segment, amounting to PLN 0.9 billion (so above the set objective of PLN 0.6-0.7 billion). In the previous year we have generated over PLN 3.1 billion of cash flow in the business operation (compared to over PLN 2.6 billion in 2016, the growth equals 18%). Our diversified cash flow is guaranteed by, among others, 11*production fields (*onshore fields in Lithuania are treated as one source).

More about our results in Sales and distribution segment HERE INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE Being aware of the developments on the worldwide fuel markets, new laws and regulations adopted as well as because of the need to be competitive, we are consistent in improving our offer and processes supporting our activities in every segment and on every level of our organisation. In 2017, the LOTOS Group incurred investment expenditures in the amount of PLN 1,445 million, of which the largest part were expenditures related to the project of delayed coking unit (EFRA project), crude oil and natural gas extraction, mainly B8 deposit in the Baltic Sea, and also the production in the Sleipner and Heimdal fields in Norway. We also invested in the purchase of catalysts and components, expansion and modernization of the petrol station network, as well as the construction of the Hydrogen Recovery Unit (WOW) installation, which will allow the use of renewable energy sources in refinery processes. To optimize extraction and to take care as much as possible for the energy security, we have invested in exploration and recognition of fields. Capital expenditures in the upstream segment in 2017 amounted to PLN 380.1 million. 41 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS WE FUEL POLISH ECONOMY As the second largest oil company in Poland, we are aware of the impact we are exerting on the economy of our country. Positive impact on the development of the country and local communities, where we operate, have, among others, the taxes we pay. The operations of LOTOS affect the economies of countries in which the company conducts its operations also through a diversified network of suppliers. We support primarily the local entrepreneurs, improving development conditions for small and medium business. An important role in exerting a positive economic impact is played by one of our companies – LOTOS Oil. It cooperates with numerous local suppliers of goods and services for whom establishing business relationships with the LOTOS brand is an unquestionable opportunity for growth. This is also reflected in the creation of more jobs in the regions in which these enterprises operate. Good practice of Grupa LOTOS S.A. – we support local suppliers In 2017, we allocated PLN 5223 million for services provided by local companies from Gdańsk and the surrounding area, which accounts for 25% of the purchase budget of Grupa LOTOS S.A.. We are a significant employer not only in Pomerania, but thanks to the network of our petrol stations, also in other parts of the country. We employ a total of 4897 employees at the LOTOS Group. In respect of the employment in 2017, we paid PLN 736.2 million in employee benefits. Money paid to our employees and suppliers contributes indirectly to improving the economic situation of the regions in which we operate. Their financial turnover supports other local enterprises and improves the quality of life of local communities. With our wide range of products we are also trying to eliminate restrictions in access to consumer goods for citizens having a low income. The LOTOS Oil products are easily available and in various price levels, what allows access for a wide range of recipients – both those affluent and those of lower income. Within the LOTOS Group we also conduct a number of innovative and pro-efficiency activities that reduce the costs of processes and energy. In this way, we try to minimize the negative global trend of price growth of energy factors and, consequently, counteract energy poverty. 42 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS PRODUCTION CAPITAL G4-9 G4-12 OG1 Extraction and processing of crude oil is our primary business. Through continuous improvement of our exploration and extraction activities as well as investments in modern and safe production processes, we strive to deliver highest quality products to the market. Our range of product includes: • fuels (unleaded petrol, diesel oil and light fuel oil) • heavy oil • bitumens • aviation fuel • naphtha • liquefied gas propane-butane (LPG) • base oils PROSPECTING AND EXTRACTION We conduct exploration and extraction activities in the area of ​​the Baltic Sea, the Norwegian Continental Shelf and in Lithuania. In 2017, our hydrocarbon extraction was carried out: in fields located in the Baltic Sea (fields B3 and B8 – crude oil with a small amount of associated gas), from Norwegian fields (gas and condensate – light crude oil), as well as from onshore fields in Lithuania (Petroleum). In 2017, the average daily oil and natural gas output of LOTOS amounted to 22.9 thousand boe/ day, which sums up to the annual potential of 1.1 million toe (tons of oil equivalent). 74% of the total volume, that is 17,000 boe/day, came from Norwegian fields. At the end of 2017, the LOTOS Group had confirmed reserves of crude oil and natural gas of the 2P category (proved and probable) of total 88.2 million boe, including 8.8 million tonnes of crude oil and 3.3 billion m3 of natural gas. In the scope of ​​extraction, our activities are focused on building a balanced and diversified portfolio of assets. We want to increase our involvement in the development of new fields, gradually increase the importance of exploration activities in the portfolio and limit participation of concession for deposits in mature fields. In scope of extraction in 2017, we managed to achieve results consistent with the strategic goals set. The implementation of the company’s strategy for 2017-2022 in the upstream activities focused on using the experience, knowledge and potential of LOTOS Petrobaltic to strengthen and develop operations in the strategic segment of Maritime Power in the Baltic Sea as well as specialization and expansion into the areas of international concessions. The key element of this process was to define the scope and real possibilities of development and expansion of LPB. The potential of LOTOS Petrobaltic allowed the division of the company in terms of specialization as the direction of the adopted strategy for diversifying revenue sources in the segment. Following the reorganization, the strategic tasks of LOTOS Petrobaltic, it’s mission and development strategy were determined, as a result of which LOTOS Petrobaltic becomes a modern company, comprehensively managing the needs of the energy industry, offshore and sea operations in the Baltic Sea basin. It is based on experience, knowledge and on the team of dedicated employees and focuses on its core business, gradually expanding the scope of services to include offshore project management, logistics, transport and operating services. Consistent implementation of the LOTOS Petrobaltic strategy and the interest shown by foreign companies offered by the LPB service makes us to look optimistically in the future also in the aspect of exploitation of the company’s potential not only at the Baltic Sea. LOTOS Petrobaltic is successfully exploiting the B3 and B8 hydrocarbon fields located under the bottom of the Baltic Sea. 43 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS Simultaneously, the further development of exploration and the upstream segment outside the Baltic Sea were entrusted to LOTOS Upstream (LUPS), a subsidiary of LOTOS Petrobaltic. The establishment of LUPS influenced the progressing specialization of operations in both companies, enabling real assessment of the directions of further expansion and development of the segment outside the Baltic Sea. As a result of the transformation, LUPS has become the entity responsible for the development of hydrocarbon exploration and extraction outside the basin of the Baltic Sea, formulating a development strategy dedicated to foreign concessions, business development and supervision over the implementation of the development outside the basin of the Baltic Sea. LUPS was also entrusted with ownership supervision over the B4 and B6 gas fields, which will be operated by LOTOS Petrobaltic in the operational phase. Diversified portfolio of assets The exploration and extraction activities of LOTOS in Norway are carried out through the subsidiary LOTOS E&P Norge AS, situated in Stavanger. At the end of 2017, the company was a shareholder of 26 concessions for prospecting, identification and extraction of hydrocarbon fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. In Poland, our exploration and extraction activities are conducted mainly in the Polish zone of the Baltic Sea, as well as onshore concessions in the north-east and north-west Poland. We have three concessions for exploration, prospecting and extraction of crude oil and natural gas in the areas of Łeba, Rozewie and Gotland, and (including subsidiaries and joint ventures) we have four concessions for extracting hydrocarbons from B3, B8 and B4/B6 deposits. Operations in the onshore area in Poland are carried out on the proprietary “Młynary“ concession and in cooperation with PGNiG on the Kamień Pomorski and Górowo Iławeckie concessions (LOTOS share of 49%). In Lithuania, exploration and extraction are carried out by the subsidiary AB LOTOS Geonafta based in Gargždai. In 2017, Lithuanian companies operated onshore oil fields within 7 concession blocks. 44 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS Production The LOTOS Group has one of the most modern and youngest refineries in Europe with annual processing capacity of about 10.5 million tons. Strategic placement of the refinery gives it a significant logistical advantage in access to raw materials and product sales channels compared to the competition in the region. In the production and trade process, we focus on the technological modernization of the refinery. It has a unique combination of raw material supply channels, ensuring simultaneous access to raw material supplies both by land, from Russia, through the PERN pipeline network, as well as to the supplies of raw materials by sea from many countries as well as from proprietary fields. In the report by Solomon Associates for 2016, the refinery of Grupa LOTOS S.A., as in the previous surveys, obtained an excellent result in energy efficiency. This is important, as energy costs contribute to more than half of all costs of the plant, outside of the costs of raw materials. Also in the majority of other key competitiveness indicators, such as the efficiency of maintenance services, the utilization rate of the installation – the results of Grupa LOTOS S.A. place it among top 25% refineries. The Solomon Associates ranking is the world’s most important benchmark of refineries, in which hundreds of companies from all over the world are compared every two years and it is a prestigious factor for both the refining sector as well as for other associated businesses. The very good technical condition of our refinery has also been confirmed with the highest Nelson Complexity Index in Poland (and one of the highest in Europe), which reflects the intensity of investments in the refinery, potential fixed costs and the potential of generating added value by the refinery. The Nelson Complexity Index for the Gdansk refinery amounts to 10.0. The main investment of the Grupa LOTOS S.A. in 2017 in the production process is the EFRA Project (Effective Refining), which, thanks to the construction of one of the most advanced delayed coking installations, will enable deeper processing of crude oil. The progress of the whole EFRA Project implementation at the end of December 2017 amounted to 90%. Implementation of the EFRA Project, thanks to the combination of new installations with the ones already existing in the Gdansk refinery, will bring more high-margin products produced from each barrel of oil processed by the refinery. EFRA in practice means that: • refining margin for each processed barrel of raw material will increase by approx. USD 2/bbl, • EFRA production facilities will also produce about 900,000 tons of high-margin products annually. This will result in an increase in the EBITDA result by PLN 0.6 billion/year, • after completing the investment and launching new installations, 1 ton of heavy residues will produce approximately 700 kg of fuels and 300 kg of coke, and the Gdańsk refinery will not produce unprofitable heavy fuel oil. 45 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS In 2017, the LOTOS refinery processed 9.6 million tonnes of crude oil, 7% less than the year before. It was the result of the 6-week long maintenance shutdown „Spring 2017”. The predominant types of processed crude oil, similar to the previous years, was Russian Ural oil. Its share amounted to approximately 78.3% and was slightly higher than in the previous years. The other part of the raw material consisted of crude oil imported from other directions, including approx. 201 thousand tonnes of crude oil delivered by the LOTOS Petrobaltic Group. The selection of crude oils for processing was based on the process of production optimization, in order to take advantage of any opportunities of increasing the processing margin of the refinery. Safe supply chain To ensure the production safety of the LOTOS Group, the products are shipped via rail transport from the Gdansk refinery. LOTOS Kolej, a company specializing in this kind of operations, is responsible for the comprehensive implementation of railway logistics for the entire Corporate Group. In 2017, LOTOS Kolej transported 13.3 million tons of goods, of which 7.03 million tons were hazardous materials. Maritime transport is another important element in the logistics chain. Linking the product pipelines at the Gdansk refinery with a liquid fuel trans-shipment base in the Northern Port grants the company significant benefits by reducing transport costs. In 2017, in seaports LOTOS handled about 7 million tonnes of crude oil, petroleum products and fuel components. The location of the LOTOS refinery in the vicinity of the maritime oil terminal allows the diversification of gas supplies, enables the supply of crude oil from proprietary fields in the Baltic Sea and Lithuania, as well as from the North Sea or from other, more distant points of origin. In 2017, approximately 4.3 million tons of crude oil were delivered to the Grupa LOTOS S.A. by sea. SUPPLY CHAIN WITHIN THE REFINERY IN GDANSK MARITIME RAILWAY TRANSPORT TRANSPORT In 2017, Grupa LOTOS S.A. handled in seaports about 7 In 2017, LOTOS Kolej transported 13.3 million tonnes of million tonnes of crude oil, petroleum products and fuel goods. The company constantly develops cooperation with components. The number of serviced tankers amounted to clients outside the LOTOS Group, both in domestic and fo268 units. reign transport. In 2017, the Company continued its 4-year contract with the Polish Armed Forces on the transport of F-34 aviation fuel. The concluded contract is the result of tender procedure won by LOTOS, with strictly defined criteria, such as safety and quality of the services provided. LOTOS GROUP PRODUCT OFFER IN 2017 The marketing activities of the LOTOS Group in 2017 was conducted as part of the Grupa LOTOS S.A. and by its subsidiaries: LOTOS Paliwa, LOTOS Oil, LOTOS Asfalt, LOTOS-Air BP Poland. Grupa LOTOS S.A. carried out marketing activities within the country (sales to foreign concerns) and in export by sea and land. The subsidiaries carried out production and sales for fuel, oil and asphalt industries. In 2017, the LOTOS Group achieved a 31.6% share in the domestic fuel market. The largest share in sales, as in previous years, was diesel oil. The volume of diesel sales in 2017 amounted to PLN 5,198,000 tonnes, thus achieving a 47.5% share in total sales (improvement of 4 percentage points comparing to 2016). The second largest item in the quantitative sales structure of the LOTOS Group was gasoline, with a 14.2% share. Gasoline sales by the LOTOS Group amounted to 1555 tonnes and represented a similar level as in the previous year. The share in the total sales volume of the LOTOS Group of the last item, that is heavy products, amounted to over 10%. 46 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS In 2017, we can proudly announce a 19% increase in domestic sales. The main driving force behind this growth was the sale of motor fuels (diesel fuels and gasolines), associated with effective sales activities both in the retail and wholesale channels on the growing market. Despite the maintenance shutdown, the LOTOS Group was able to fully meet the growing demand for the product on the domestic fuel market. In addition, a significant increase in domestic sales also occurred in the bitumen segment. High sales dynamics was the result of domestic demand, related both to the realization of construction projects and limited product expeditions from domestic and neighbouring refineries. Finally, we are happy with the record amount of fuel sold at each of the five airports, at which refuelling operations take place. The increase in domestic aviation fuel sales in 2017 reached 42%. This increase is the result of the expansion of the subsidiary LOTOS – Air BP Polska on domestic airports. At the end of 2017, 493 petrol stations operated as a part of the LOTOS network (increase by 6 additional stations), placing it in third place among fuel station chains in Poland. LOTOS strengthened its position in the transit stations segment on motorways and expressways with 20 Passenger Service Areas (MOPs), situated at the A1, A2, A4 and A6 motorways as well as S3 and S7 expressways. We also carry out sale of non-fuel products and services, which in 2017 increased by 14% compared to 2016. 47 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS HUMAN CAPITAL G4-10 G4-11 G4-LA1 G4-LA6 G4-LA9 G4-LA11 G4-LA12 G4-PR1 G4-PR5 The essence of our business, the reason why we strive for continuous development as well as for raising our standards and the largest capital are people – both our employees and all other stakeholders, who are our constant source of inspiration and innovative ideas and whose safety, health and satisfaction are our key priorities.

Therefore, we have implemented appropriate regulations at the LOTOS Group, so that the recruitment is conducted in a reliable and objective manner, and the process itself is enjoyable. In our company there is an e-recruitment system, the list of desired employees is available to the public, and all the interested parties can apply for vacancies through our website. We are a member of the Coalition for Friendly Recruitment, established in June 2013, promoting good practices and high standards, and as a member of the Coalition we adhere to the Code of Good Recruitment Practices, which applies, among others, to such issues as communication with the candidate, involvement in the relationship with the candidate, clear formulation of job offers or respect for candidates. We have also introduced guides for those responsible for coordinating recruitment processes ‘Employee Recruitment and Selection Standards at the LOTOS Group’, and we systematically analyze the reasons for the departure of our employees in order to eliminate these reasons. Our efforts in this area do not remain unnoticed – since 2014 we have been proud of the ‘Friendly Recruitment Zone’ certificate. Code of Good Recruitment Practices HERE In the LOTOS Group, we pay particular importance to internal recruitment, which makes the optimal use of our employees’ competences possible, as well as providing them with broad development opportunities. Since 2016, there is sub-page ‘Internal recruitment at the LOTOS Group’ (designed for the LOTOS Group’s personnel). 51 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS We objectively evaluate our employees (evaluation) In our company, there is a joint system of Periodic Employee Evaluation System (PEES), common for the entire corporate group, thanks to which we can easily and reliably compare the results and competences of individual employees, as well as analyze emerging trends. In 2017, we evaluated 89% of the female employees (978 people) and 96% of the male employees (3,528 people) of the LOTOS Group. The subject to the evaluation were the employees employed in 15 companies of the group. The PEES rating is carried out once a year, in most of our companies it starts on 1 July and lasts until the end of August. PEES is a useful tool not only for the HR department and human resources management, but above all provides support for the employees themselves, helping them in planning their professional development, managing their time and competences, and motivating them to improve their own work. This tool is also particularly useful in monitoring the key competencies in force at the LOTOS Group: cooperation, commitment and openness to changes. PEES assessment benefits for employees: • receiving feedback on the results of work, • getting to know the exact needs and expectations of their superiors, • better knowledge of the goals and tasks assigned for the next period, • tips and tools to improve the effects of their own work, • an opportunity to exchange views and opinions on work itself, • identification of development needs. Benefits for organizations resulting from the use of PEES: • getting information, which competences in the organization are at the highest level and which shall be improved, • versatility of the tool gives the possibility to compare employees from different companies and select the ones rated the highest, • source of information on the training and education needs of employees, • opportunity to get to know employees’ opinions about the workplace and management style, as well as their other needs and expectations. TRAININGS AND EDUCATION IN LOTOS GROUP Caring for talents is the strategic goal of the LOTOS Group in years 2017-2022. Providing our employees with the conditions for development and improvement of qualifications not only translates into the competitiveness of our company, but also increases their job satisfaction and gives them a sense of stability. Last year, our employees spent 114,210 hours on various types of training sessions, almost 23.4 hours of training for each employee (25.2 hours for men and 17.1 for women). The employees occupying managerial positions spent almost 22 hours on training, while employees employed at lower levels – almost 24 hours.

What is more, we eagerly use the knowledge and experience of 50+ employees and involve them in activities aimed at development of new employees. The team for operational training, consisting mainly of experienced employees aged 50+, was appointed in the Chief Refining Officer. The team shares with younger employees its extensive technical and technological knowledge gained during many years of work on refinery installations. In addition to mentoring from mature colleagues, newly hired employees might take advantage of the ‘Good Start for Beginners’ adaptive program that helps them learn about the culture and practices at the LOTOS Group, thereby making the process of adapting to a new workplace more efficient and reducing possible stress. Young employees especially appreciate the e-learning training formula, recently promoted by us, which gives them much flexibility. 53 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS We are also constantly improving the activities of LOTOS Academy, our original training and development project, that increases competences and conscious involvement in creating added value by our employees. As part of the LOTOS Academy last year, we implemented, among others, the following talent programmes: • Leader of the Future Programme; • Master Programme; • Manager’s Academy; • Management Skills Development Programme for Technical Personnel; • The LOTOS Group Succession Programme. The rules applicable to the implementation of projects within the LOTOS Academy: • availability: training opportunities are offered to all employee groups; • coherence: the training system takes into account the mission, the strategy and the long-term development plans of the company and is also related to other areas of human resources management; • responsibility: all participants are responsible for training results and development; • continuity: development planning is a continuous process, related to the results of periodic evaluations, career paths, succession plans and development programs for individual groups of employees; • flexibility: planning and implementing of trainings is related to monitoring of the evolving external environment of the company and the desired changes in the qualifications of employees.

In the case of disregarding these rules and non-observance of the requirements in the area of occupational safety, we apply the ‘zero tolerance’ principle. A high safety culture is our strategic goal for 2017-2022. Health and safety goals are also regu56 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS lated by the Policy of the Integrated Management System. In 2017, we continued establishing uniform standards and strengthening the safety culture in the companies of our Group. We strive to achieve the level of the LTIF accident rate (number of work-related accidents per one million man-hours worked by the company’s employees) below the average for European refineries, both using our own ideas for improving safety and drawing global solutions in the field of work safety and process-technical safety. As a result, last year no serious accident in our company occurred. In 2017, only individual accidents occurred, in which 35 men and 3 women were injured. Occupational safety is one of the main pillars of our development strategy. Last year, as a part of the strategic goals implementation in the area of ​​occupational safety, we implemented, among others, the following initiatives: Strategic indicators of occupational safety As a result of the establishment and sanctioning of the importance of occupational safety in the Strategy of Grupa LOTOS S.A. for 2017-2022, work safety indicators have been developed and will be monitored in the future. They have been developed and adapted in relation to the analysis of the current situation and accident trends in individual companies of the LOTOS Group. Occupational safety golden rules of a LOTOS Group employee In July 2017, the Occupational safety golden rules of a LOTOS Group employee came into force. They comprise of a set of rules and attitudes recognized by the Management Board of Grupa LOTOS S.A. as crucial in the area of ​​safety and health. They are based on the applicable laws and internal regulations. They were established on the basis of identified hazards, occupational hazards, accident and hazardous situation analyses that occurred in the LOTOS Group in the last decade. The goal is to build a high level of occupational safety culture, shape appropriate attitudes, reduce the risk of accidents and dangerous situations threatening the health and life of employees. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY GOLDEN RULES OF A LOTOS GROUP EMPLOYEE: • I work safely • I react to threats • I move safely • I drive carefully • I care about order • I use protective measures • I use only efficient tools • I care about my health Maintenance shutdowns ‘Spring 2017’ In April, in accordance with the planned schedule, the biggest maintenance shutdown in the history of the Grupa LOTOS S.A. was finished. Typical maintenance works were connected with cleaning, inspections and repair of apparatus, pipelines and devices, as well as replacement of some of them with new ones. An important task of the maintenance shutdown was to connect the EFRA Project units with the refinery units. About 1,100 apparatuses were renovated – including about 500 pieces of heat exchangers and tanks, reactors, furnaces, columns and over 1,500 pipelines and over 3,000 fittings and automation components. During the maintenance shutdown, about one million man-hours were worked. 8th HEALTH AND SAFETY DAYS Health and Safety Days took place on October 25-26, 2017 at the premises of the Old Central Control Room and the administrative CA2 building. Thanks to such solution, both production and administrative employees were able to enjoy all the prepared attractions. The prepared Health and Safety Days programme was associated with many activities promoting safe attitudes and behaviors related to the application of the Occupational Safety Golden Rules of a LOTOS Group employee. 57 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS Agreement with the Main School of Fire Service In November 2017, an agreement was signed to extend the existing cooperation between Grupa LOTOS S.A. and LOTOS Straż and the Main School of Fire Service [SGSP]. SGSP students have the opportunity to complete apprenticeships at the headquarters of LOTOS Straż and can count on help in preparing diploma theses. Together, we also carry out exercises, workshops and conferences and scientific symposia. Training of the Management Board and Management of the LOTOS Group in the area of re​​ sponsibility for occupational safety In 2017, a series of trainings was organized for the management staff of the Grupa LOTOS S.A. and the Management Board of LOTOS Group in the scope of ​​responsibility for occupational safety. The goal of the training was to raise the management’s awareness of the legal requirements that directly affect the managers of employees. Occupational safety is a topic for us all, every employee, not just OHS service. The key role in building a safety culture is played by the managers of employees who bear special obligations and responsibilities. We want the security culture, just like it is at many of our western competitors, to be part of the professional DNA of every employee – said Jarosław Kawula, Vice-President of the Management Board of LOTOS Group, Production & Sales Officer During the training, issues such as: • duties and responsibilities of the manager in scope of legal provisions, • key elements of the OHS management system, • the role of the manager / leader in the OHS management system, • OHS management through occupational risk. Employee involvement and motivation system in occupational safety Providing a system of motivation and involvement of employees at all levels in the scope of ​​occupational safety is an element of building an occupational safety culture in accordance with the implementation Strategy of Grupa LOTOS S.A. and the Policy of the Integrated Management System. As part of it the following solutions, among others, were implemented: • self-control of health and safety status as a tool for managers of organizational units, in order to confirm their performance in the area of ​​health and safety, • reviews of health and safety at work performed systematically by the management, where the leader is obliged to set an example to other employees with his attitude, • a minute for security (description below). As part of employee motivation: • health and safety goals are set in the Periodic Employee Evaluation System (PEES) and the Quarterly Motivational Prize (KNM), • employees are distinguished for reported dangerous situations and reported actions improving working conditions, • the safest production plant in a given year is distinguished as well. Minute for security Safety first – that is, ‘safety first and foremost’ is a slogan used daily by many companies in different circumstances. In practice, this means adhering to security values ​​as crucial in the organization, both in actions and in making important decisions. 58 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS Every employee should also adhere both by his attitude and behavior to the safety principles as a priority in his daily work. One of the example actions to underline that security values ​​are treated in the organization as priorities is the so-called ‘Minute for security’, that is, starting various types of meetings / trainings / severance payments from the health and safety topic. The responsibility of the manager / employee organizing the internal / external meeting, during which the presentation will be presented (for instance in the MS Power Point), is to include at the beginning of the meeting a presentation and discussion about the ‘minute for security’ topic. Examples of topics that can be addressed during the ‘minute for security’ include: • the benefits of reporting dangerous situations, • how to safely use specialist equipment / devices in the company, • discussing an accident at work of a colleague, a person outside of work, at home, etc. (taking into account the protection of personal data), • dangerous behavior on the road while traveling to work (car, bicycle, etc.), • a potentially accidental event outside work, • work permit/LOTO system, • principles of taking care of health, proper nutrition, • principles of maintaining the balance between work and personal life, so-called work-life balance. Health and safety survey for white-collar employees As part of the activities aimed at improving the working conditions of people employed at office and administration positions, an OHS survey addressed to the interested parties was carried out. Every office employee of Grupa LOTOS S.A. had a chance to express his or her opinion on the health and safety conditions at the workplace. The results of the questionnaire allowed us to see aspects, which OHS services the managers and office shall pay special attention to. The next step will be to start reviews of office positions in scope of health and safety requirements for rooms and office work, with particular emphasis on the problems reported in the surveys. Skin protection program At Grupa LOTOS S.A., a skin protection plan for employees was introduced, mainly for those working in production, which consists of three stages, each with a different task: • skin protection – using skin protection measures before starting work, that shall protect the employee in the event of contact with various substances present in the workplace, that could dry and irritate the skin • skin cleansing – the use of agents intended to remove impurities off the skin after work. Washing shall remove dirt and harmful substances from hands, so that the skin stays clean • skin care and regeneration – usage of skin care lotions after washing hands helps to regenerate the skin, prevents drying out of the skin, helps the skin restore the water-fat balance and accelerates the regeneration of the epidermis. Properly used lotions and soaps keep the skin in good condition, what positively affects the aesthetic appearance of the hand, and reduces the risk of skin diseases. Application of the above-mentioned skin protection measures does not exempt employees from using personal protective equipment, i.e. protective gloves. WE ALSO RECEIVED AWARDS AND DISTINCTIONS IN THE AREA OF S ​​ ECURITY: Grupa LOTOS S.A. as the leader in technical security Last year we received a special prize in the 2016 Technical Safety Leader ranking. We were awarded in the ‘innovation’ category because of our innovative approach to the analysis of the operation of technical devices risk. The competition is organized by the Office of Technical Inspection, under the patronage of the Ministry of Development. 59 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS The safest manufacturing plant and the safest company in the LOTOS Group In 2017, the winners of the competition for the safest production plant and the safest company of the LOTOS Group for the previous year were selected. The Zakład Nalewu Cystern and the LOTOS Asfalt won the contest. The selection of winners takes place after a thorough assessment based on individual, properly scored criteria. Such criteria are statistical indicators, such as, for example, the LTIF index, illustrating the number of work-related accidents per one million man-hours worked by employees of the company, but also elements related to the involvement of the crew, including primarily the management. OUR CLIENTS Safe LOTOS clients The care for the health and safety of customers is especially important to us. For years we have been making every effort to ensure that the products we offer are safe at use and disposal stage. We also take care of safe transport and distribution, and regularly train our employees in the field of transport of hazardous goods. LOTOS Lab has been operating in our Group for fifteen years, that thoroughly examines the semi-finished products, products, components and additives used in the production of fuels, oils and bitumens, as well as water for the production of energy utilities and wastewater. All the products manufactured by us have Product Information or Safety Data Sheets attached, containing information such as the effect of the product on health and the environment, the presence of hazardous ingredients – chemical substances and preparations, handling in the event of fire and release of the product to the environment and handling of waste. Information on the safe use of our products is available both at the point of sale and on the Internet. All categories of products and services of the LOTOS Group are subject to health and safety impact assessment. First of all, it concerns: • lubricating oils and lubricants (evaluation process according to EU REACH directives on chemicals hazards and CLP regulation on product labeling), • bitumens and bitumen products, • marine fuel. More about our products HERE CLIENTS ARE SATISFIED WITH OUR SERVICES Customers’ opinions about our business, the products and the services we offer are a very valuable source of information for us, allowing us to constantly raise our standards of operation and meet such expectations in a better way. We regularly examine the opinions and expectations of our clients and draw conclusions from them. In July 2017, we conducted a research on the customers of LOTOS Oil and Distributor clients (authorized clients of Distributors and Branch Distributors, Direct Clients and Distributor Clients (DPS)). We assessed aspects such as cooperation with LOTOS Oil or the Distributor, competitive advantage, sales representatives’ activities, products, marketing, assets. We also encouraged to express comments and opinions. The results of the research show the level of customer satisfaction and that the loyalty compared to the previous year has increased. In the survey carried out a year before, 56% of clients evaluated our cooperation well and very well, last year it was as much as 79%. Customers perceive our company as caring about ecology, treating their clients honestly, as well as reliable and trustworthy. As the biggest advantages over our competition, the respondents pointed out our wide range of products, product quality, care of traders, a workshop program and technical consultancy. Clients are satisfied with cooperation with LOTOS sales representatives, judging them as competent, quick to act and able to advise. Our price / quality ratio was evaluated good or very good as well (83% – direct, 71% – indirect clients), as well as the availability of our products (96% – DR, 98% – DPS, 94% – direct client). 60 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS We also conducted a similar survey in 2017 among LOTOS Lab customers. It’s purpose was not only to get to know opinions about cooperation, but also about obtaining information that would help in improving the quality of services offered by the laboratory. The respondents assessed aspects such as the scope of the services offered, the ease of contact, the competencies of the staff working in the provision of the services, the time of order completion, reliability and credibility of test results, the readability of test reports and finally the price. According to the survey, the level of satisfaction of LOTOS Lab customers amounted to 91%. The highest ratings given by the respondents were the readiness of test reports and the ease of contact as well as the lowest price. Customers declare that they use LOTOS Lab mainly due to the range of services offered, professional service and short order completion time. The opinion of our clients translates into their attitudes. According to the Polish Quality Service Program, last year, the users’ loyalty rate to the LOTOS brand of the petrol stations increased by 15.8%. We also recorded significant sales increases in many areas of our business, including sales of diesel oils and gasolines (by 19%), what equalled 31.6% share in the domestic fuel market, and 14% sales of non-fuel products and services in the retail segment. 61 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL WE ARE DRIVEN BY INNOVATION The innovative approach to business and its development helps us to respond to market challenges and build our competitive advantage, guaranteeing the high quality of our products and services.

Last year, we were also the sponsor of the Polish National Winter Expedition on K2. Car rallies In 2017, we continued sponsorship activities for motorsports. Competitors of the LOTOS Rally Team, Kajetan Kajetanowicz and Jarosław Baran, won the European Champion title in the European Rally Championship (ERC) for the third time. Tactical nationwide and regional projects In 2017 we supported, among others, Year of Kazimierz Deyna, Summer Stadium and beachball, Summer Polonia Games and Solidarity Marathon. We were also sponsors of speedway events, including Individual International Ekstraliga Championships, Polish Club Pairs Championships and the Team Final of the European Junior Speedway Championships. Last year, we completed a long-term cooperation with the volleyball team LOTOS Trefl Gdańsk. Education of children and young people For years we’ve been involved in sponsoring social-sport events, addressed to children and teenagers. We support, among other, a football program “Football Future with LOTOS” and winter sports – „Szukamy następców mistrza” [“Searching for the next Champion”]. We set a good example In ​14 centers, which were established by LOTOS in years 2012-2015 in cooperation with local football clubs in Pomerania, we are implementing the „Football Future with LOTOS” program. As a part of the LOTOS program and the Football Academy, LG is training about 3.5 thousand players, both girls and boys. Twelve-year-old children training in all centers operating under the program competed in the LOTOS Junior Cup 2017 football tournament. The winning players had the opportunity to watch the match Poland – Kazakhstan, played as part of the World Cup qualification 2018. LOTOS FOR CULTURE AND ART By engaging in the support of projects in the field of culture and art, we take into account their social dimension, long-term nature, as well as the importance for the promotion of the regions in which our companies operate. In 2017, a total of 18 projects sponsoring culture and art were carried out at Grupa LOTOS S.A. and its subsidiaries. We’ve cooperated on such projects as Freedom Jazz Festival, Polish Radio Theater Festival and Polish Television Theater „Two Theaters”, Siesta Festival, Summer Theater – Sopot 2017, Cultural Stage, Ladies Jazz Festival, „Gintrowski – yet something will remain after us”, Lithuanian Week or Hungarian Week. In the southern region, we sponsored such events as the LOTOS Jazz Festival, Jasło Days, Czechowice-Dziedzice Days, Autumn Meetings with the Theater, International Carpathian Folk Festival, Summer with Culture of the Jasło Poviat and Memorial of Major Henryk „Hubal” Dobrzański. Meetings with the theater LOTOS Asfalt supported the IX Autumn Meetings with the Theater organized by the Cultural Centre in Jasło. In last year’s edition of the event enabling the inhabitants of Podkarpacie, 3,000 participants, not only from Jasło and the surrounding area but even from the neighboring Małopolska province, took part in the meeting with the members of leading Polish theaters. 68 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS International Festival of Folklore LOTOS Asfalt supported the 14th International Festival of Carpathian Folklore organized by the Municipal Cultural Center in Jasło, which aim is to save and sustain disappearing folk traditions, including handcrafts, folk art, costumes and music.

It applies to both our employees, employees of subcontractors working for our company, our clients, as well as the natural environment and people living in the vicinity of places where we conduct our business. For many years, we have been using the best practices on the market to minimize the potential risk of a threat. At each stage of the creation and use of our products, we assess their impact on human health and safety. We care about maintaining the integrity of our technical procedure. We carry out research on zero materials and devices, maintain traffic based on predictive and preventive actions, run a program of inspections and surveillance tests, Non Destructive Testing program – tests of apparatus and pipeline wall thickness, Risk Based Inspection (RBI) program and cyclical repairs technological installations. We create annual plans for preventive device inspections, conduct corrosion monitoring, functional tests of security systems and technological blockades. We manage the criticality of devices in terms of response time, as well as the resources of spare parts and the scope of preventive examinations. In 2017, we completed an Overhaul Shutdown of all technological installations at the refinery in Gdansk. During the shutdown, we made all necessary inspections and checks of the equipment technical condition, as well as all repairs and overhauls of the refinery equipment. We place great emphasis on increasing the awareness of our employees in the area of ​​safety and safe work culture, both through training and communication activities. Thanks to our prophylactic activities, carried out on many levels, accidents in our facilities are extremely rare. In 2017, four events related to process safety were registered: one serious violation classified as Tier 1, which occurred in the area of energy utilities and three less serious events, classified as Tier 2, concerning the area of ​​crude oil. We strive to promote work safety also among other entities operating in Pomerania. Since 2016, we have been organizing the Pomeranian Forum of Safety Leaders, aimed at building a high level of safe work culture in Pomeranian institutions of various industries and disseminating global standards in this field. 70 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS NATURAL CAPITAL G4-EN1 G4-EN10 G4-EN15 G4-EN16 G4-EN18 G4-EN20 G4-EN21 G4-EN22 G4-EN23 G4-EN24 G4-EN25 G4-EN28 G4-EN29 G4-EN3 G4-EN31 G4-EN32 G4-EN34 G4-EN6 G4-EN8 OG5 OG6 OG7 OG8 WE ARE REDUCING OUR NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT One of the pillars of our strategic approach to sustainable development is responsibility for the state of the natural environment. The impact of LOTOS on the environment is part of the specificity of our business. Therefore, the pursuit to maximally reduce this impact became one of the most important goals in this scope. We try to constantly monitor and analyze the scope of our impact. Due to the large variety of market segments in which we operate, we influence various components of the ecosystem. In the scope of production, our impact is primarily related to the emission of pollutants into the air, which we try to limit year by year. On the other hand, in the scope of extraction, we try to rationally manage the issue of extraction waste as well as water and wastewater management. Due to the scale of our activity, the issue of the energy consumed by the Group is an equally important environmental aspect for us. We strive to responsibly manage its consumption throughout the entire value chain. We do it by taking care of its rational use, maintaining good technical condition of devices and undertaking effective investment activities. In order to act more efficiently in the scope of environmental protection, in June 2017, we joined the partnership for the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Thus, we have committed ourselves to take actions that will contribute, among others, to protecting the planet, underwater life and life on earth. We are already trying to implement them at every stage of our business operations and we take into account the establishing new programs for environmental protection. WE COMPLY WITH HIGH STANDARDS The main value of the LOTOS Group’s liability towards the natural environment is the purity, understood as a commitment to comply with the highest environmental standards. It is related to our environmental policy, which is mainly focused on the clean production. In the Integrated Management System policy, we have committed ourselves to ‘environmental protection, including minimising environmental footprint and raising environmental awareness of our employees and trading partners’. We are constantly striving to reduce the consumption of materials and raw materials, reduce emissions, manage waste in an efficient way, carry out complete wastewater treatment, as well as create safety in the area of ​​industrial processes in such a way as to effectively prevent failures. As a member of the United Nations Global Compact society we declare, that in our environment policy we follow the established principles: • Preventive approach to the natural environment. • Undertaking initiatives aimed at promoting the attitudes of ecological responsibility. • The use and dissemination of environmentally friendly technologies. Through efficient environmental protection management, we try to ensure that all LOTOS Group companies meet the conditions of environmental consents granted to them. In the scope of ​​reducing energy consumption, we undertake numerous pro-efficiency actions. We identify the savings potential and places where undertaking organizational, renovation or investment activities will bring the best energy and economic effects. Through ongoing activities in all the above-mentioned areas of the organization’s operation, we have been implementing initiatives, bringing measurable energy benefits for a number of years. In 2017, we carried out further preparatory work to adapt the two companies of our Group (Grupa LOTOS S.A. and LOTOS Asfalt) to the, so-called, BAT conclusions for the refining sector, taking effect from October 2018. The BAT conclusions are an EU standard, defining a catalog of the best possible techniques and technologies to be implemented in each of the processes taking place in the refinery, which will limit the impact of a given plant on the environment. The obligation to use 71 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS these solutions is combined with the obligation to comply with rigorous emission parameters, such as pollutant concentrations in waste gases and wastewater. Installations in these companies are in the majority of cases adapted to new requirements, but they still require further adaptations in two areas. The first of which is the obligation to extend the way of monitoring pollutant emissions to air from refinery installations of Grupa LOTOS S.A. So far, national law has obliged the refinery to measure emissions from emitters twice a year – in summer and in winter. These measurements concern four basic energy pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM). Meanwhile, new legal requirements oblige the Gdańsk refinery to introduce continuous measurements of SO2, NOx, CO and PM emissions on two technological emitters; introduction of continuous SO2 emission measurements on exhaust gas emitters of Claus installations and for installing measuring stands for periodical measurements of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and furans (PCDD/F) emissions at outlets from two reforming plants. The second scope regulated by the BAT conclusions and requiring implementation at the Grupa LOTOS S.A. and LOTOS Asfalt refinery is the leak detection and removal program within the production facilities, the so-called the LDAR program (Leak Detection and Repair Program). It will cover all elements of refinery installations where leaks may be caused as a result of operation, in particular pumps, manual and automatic valves, gate valves, flanges, etc. The essence of the program is based on such control of said devices, that will allow the fastest possible detection and removal of leaks created in them, while ensuring the highest possible cost effectiveness of such measures. The biggest challenge in creating this type of program is the inventory of all elements of the installation in which leaks may potentially occur and the organization of collected information in IT databases. It is estimated that there are over 100,000 such devices at the Gdańsk refinery of Grupa LOTOS S.A. and LOTOS Asfalt. For obvious reasons, it was also decided that the requirement to monitor the unorganized emissions described above will be implemented as part of the LDAR program. We feel responsible for our activities, in case of any grievances related to our impact on the environment, we try to understand their reason and eliminate the cause if necessary. Last year, we received 4 formal grievances. All of them concerned the discomfort of the refinery neighbors associated with odors or noise and were quickly clarified. In 2017, we also paid the environmental penalty imposed on us for exceeding the limits for noise at one of our fuel stations (which reports to LOTOS Paliwa). By the decision of the Silesian WIOŚ, it was decided that the penalty should be included in the cost of constructing a acoustic shield next to the station. WE INVEST IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION For many years, we have been conducting activities aimed at actively reducing our environmental impact. The total amount of expenditure on environmental protection in 2017 amounted to PLN 96.1 million. Expenses allocated by the LOTOS Group to environmental protection • PLN 69.5 million – costs and capital expenditures incurred by the LOTOS Group companies to prevent damage and manage environmental protection. • PLN 26.5 million – costs of waste treatment, emission reduction and remediation. ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY EDUCATION Environmental protection and ecology – especially when it comes to ​protection of biodiversity of the Baltic Sea due to the coastal location of our refinery and in relation to valuable natural areas located in the immediate vicinity of the Company. THE „LOTOS HELPS BALTIC NATURE” PROGRAM Since 2009, we have been cooperating with the Development Foundation of the University of Gdańsk and the Marine Station of the Institute of Oceanography at the University of Gdańsk in Hel, implementing the program „LOTOS helps Baltic nature”. Joint actions shall help stopping the process of extinction of the most endangered species of marine fauna living in the Baltic Sea, primarily porpoise called the Baltic cousin of dolphin, which number is currently estimated at 100 pieces, as 72 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS well as the gray seal. We try to increase our positive impact on the environment by cooperating with experts in the field of environmental protection, active nature protection and ecological education. MAIN PARTNER OF THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT „BALTIC PROGRAM” Since 2015, we have been the main partner of the UN Global Compact „Baltic Program”, aiming to ensure the sustainable development of this one of the most heavily-laden maritime areas in the world. More about the Program HERE WE FOCUS ON EMPLOYEE EDUCATION At LOTOS, we also care about the education of employees in the field of environmental protection. We use internal communication to inform our teams about environmental protection issues and individual, company, regional and global activities related to it. We also strive to shape the desired pro-environmental attitudes of employees. WE MINIMIZE EMISSIONS OF POLLUTANTS The most important source of environmental impact resulting from our activity is the emission of gases into the atmosphere. Therefore, we attach great importance to the fact that the processes causing the emission of pollutants into the air are carried out based on the best available techniques and practices, minimizing the impact of the plant in this respect. We have significantly reduced the environmental impact of our refinery. We have achieved this with a series of consistently implemented investment and organizational projects (i.e. Efra project or the leak detection and removal program within production installations). 73 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS In 2017, the LOTOS Group companies did not emit any of the ozone-depleting substances. 74 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS WE REDUCE THE EMISSIVITY OF REFINERIES One of the important activities that we undertook in order to protect the environment in 2017 was the continuation of the investment to bring natural gas to our refinery in Gdańsk, which is the cleanest fossil fuel. Its combustion leads to a significantly lower emission of sulfur oxides and dust than compared to heavy fuel oil. In 2017, refinery furnaces were fueled only with fuel gas, which significantly reduced emissions to air – especially in the field of sulfur oxides and dust. We have been powering the heat and power plant of Grupa LOTOS S.A. in the same way for many years. Thanks to the use of natural gas, as the main fuel in the heat and power plant, as well as other investments reducing the energy intensity, we have kept not only the emissions of pollutants into the air, but also emissivity – emission in relation to CWT (Complexity Weighted Tonne). The coefficient of the carbon dioxide emission by the company is maintained at the level of the most effective refineries in Europe, when compared the emission coefficients. The average emissivity ratio, including renovation, amounted in 2017 to 30.3 kg CO2/CWT, with CO2 emissions of 1.8 million Mg. Refinery – the decision that has impact on the environment In 2017, at the Gdańsk refinery we performed comprehensive cleaning and necessary repairs and/or replacement of equipment within the so-called overhaul shutdown. Prior to this process, we analyzed all possible aspects of the environmental impact of the renovation works. The risks identified at this stage allowed us to take appropriate measures, such as cleaning road surfaces or setting up tents to limit dusting. Overhaul shutdown affected the environment in two ways. On one hand, it resulted in smaller – as a result of the monthly shutdown of the installation – annual CO2 emissions and energy pollution into the air, but on the other hand it produced much larger than usual amounts of waste from maintenance work. 75 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS WE REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION We operate in a systematic fashion, where the primary goal is to optimize energy consumption. We monitor the energy efficiency of installations and their partial processes on an ongoing basis. We analyze individual areas and participate in tasks which goal is to reduce energy consumption. Thanks to the strategic approach in managing the energy consumption, we are one of the most energy-efficient refineries in Europe. In 2017, through diverse operational initiatives, we reduced the total energy consumption in the organization by 7.7% compared to the previous year. 76 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS WE IMPROVE PRODUCTION AND EXTRACTION We conduct our production and extraction activities in accordance with the most strict environmental protection standards. We produce high quality products with the least possible environmental impact, and we care about minimizing the negative impact on the environment as early as at the stage of their creation. In our development plans, we take into account innovative technological projects that provide the rational use of natural resources. An important project of environmental management in 2017 at the LOTOS Group is the implementation of EFRA investment, thanks to which oil processing will be more comprehensive. As a result, the group will cease production of high-sulfur fuel oil. Instead, it will create an additional 900,000 tonnes of motor fuels and coke. The Russian REBCO (Russian Export Blend Crude Oil) crude oil accounted for 78% of all the purchase. The remaining part of the raw material consisted of crude oil imported from other directions, including approx. 201 thousand tonnes of crude oil delivered by the LOTOS Petrobaltic Group. The selection of crude oils for processing was based on the process of production optimization, in order to take advantage of opportunities to increase the processing margin of the refinery. 77 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS 78 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS We use water resources based on our water licences and integrated permits. Analyzes of the water consumption impact on the environment confirm that our activities do not significantly affect the functioning of protected and valuable natural areas, and the amount of water consumed is kept well below the permissible values. 79 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS In 2017, more than 25% of the consumed water was reprocessed or recycled In 2017, we did not notice any significant leaks in the LOTOS Group. However, each of the Group’s production plants is properly prepared for such eventuality. On the production plants there are lots of procedures, designed to effectively prevent leakage and respond appropriately. Chemical Rescue, a specialist team functioning in our company also serves this purpose. Possible waste resulting from the leak (i.e. soils contaminated with petroleum substances) is transferred to specialized companies that deal with waste management in accordance with the law. Our results in year 2017 confirm the effectiveness of the water and sewage system of the LOTOS Group, as evidenced by the average annual values ​​of all (excluding boron) wastewater quality indicators, which amounted to less than 50% of the permissible values. 80 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS In 2017, companies from the upstream segment did not generate cuttings. We prefer the waste management methods that are environmentally most friendly, such as recycling and recovery, while we clearly limit less-ecological methods, such as incineration without energy recovery, storage and other forms of utilization. Therefore, in the area of ​​waste management, we strive to make the largest possible part of it available to external recipients who will subject them to reprocessing or recycling processes. As many as 18,624 tonnes (89.9%) of waste handed over by us in 2017 to external recipients were subject to recovery or recycling processes. 81 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS 82 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS WE SELECT CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBLY We require environmental responsibility from ourselves, but we also expect it from our contractors. We run a company verification policy within the scope of relevant licences regarding environmental protection, and as a part of the concluded agreements we oblige them to conduct operations in compliance with legal requirements concerning environmental protection, such as, for example, waste management or paying appropriate fees for using the environment. While looking for external suppliers for tasks that are directly related to the impact on the environment, in justified cases we subject them to an additional environmental criterion. In 2017, 6 of our 1,852 new suppliers were obliged to meet these additional requirements. 83 05 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT G4-2 G4-15 G4-16 G4-24 G4-25 G4-26 In all areas of our activity, we are guided by the principles of sustainable development, which dictate our concern for the needs of people in our closer and distant surroundings and the responsibility for our impact on the natural environment. Going beyond the compliance with the law, we have committed ourselves to comply with strict ethical standards in accordance with the Ethics Programme implemented by us in 2014. We treat our adopted value system as a long-term commitment to all stakeholders of the LOTOS Group.

G4-28 G4-29 G4-30 G4-31 G4-32 It’s already our ninth time publishing the Integrated Annual Report of the LOTOS Group, recapitulating the activities of our organisation in year 2017. This publication brings closer the information about the modes of functioning of the LOTOS Group, its business model, strategy, value creation process and financial results, as well as achievements from the perspective of all the capitals involved, but which also describes risks and impact of the individual stakeholder groups. Since the beginning of our data reporting practice, we have been doing it, convinced that the transparency of the activities undertaken by us is the crucial issue in developing our business further and further. The process of collecting and issuing pertinent information is also an important part of the LOTOS Group business strategy, as well as the CSR strategy, which presuppose the active dialogue with its stakeholders. The information included in the report refers to the period from 1 January to 31 December 2017 and describes the state as at the end of the year. In isolated cases, marked in the report specifically, the information refers also to other periods. Reporting is managed on an annual basis. The last Integrated Annual Report of the LOTOS Group was published in 2016. The report for year 2017, apart from the Grupa LOTOS S.A., covers also the direct, wholly-owned subsidiaries: • LOTOS Upstream Sp. z o.o. • LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. • LOTOS Oil Sp. z o.o. • LOTOS Asfalt Sp. z o.o. • LOTOS Serwis Sp. z o.o. • LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. • LOTOS Lab Sp. z o.o. • LOTOS Infrastruktura S.A. • LOTOS Terminale S.A. • LOTOS Kolej Sp. z o.o. • LOTOS Ochrona Sp. z o.o. • LOTOS Straż Sp. z o.o. Moreover, given their particular importance, nature of business and impact on the closest neighbourhood, for the purposes of reporting some of the above-mentioned indicators, following indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries were included in the data collecting process:​ • AB LOTOS Geonafta • LOTOS Biopaliwa Sp. z o.o. • RCEkoenergia Sp. z o.o. • Energobaltic Sp. z o.o. • LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS.* • SPV Baltic Sp. z o.o. * The scope of reporting for LOTOS E&P Norge AS company is limited, compared to others, given the fact that this company is a licensee, therefore all the environmental issues (and other operational matters) are reported by the operators. REPORTING GUIDELINES This year’s Integrated Annual Report of the LOTOS Group reflects the guidelines recommended by IIRC (International Integrated Reporting Council), guidelines for the international reporting standards Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G4) and the corresponding supplement for the fuel and gas industries ‘GRI 4 Sector Disclosures Oil & Gas’. The report also takes into account the directions of the latest EU legislation regarding the disclosure of non-financial and diversity information. 123 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS HOW THE REPORT WAS CREATED G4-18 G4-23 G4-27 The process of defining the content of this year’s report was built based on 3 stages recommended by the GRI G4 standard: identification, prioritization and validation. In addition, when preparing the individual content, we also tried to rise up to the four principles set by the standard: • the significance of the presented information, • including the stakeholders of the LOTOS Group in the process of creating the report, • showing the wider context of sustainable development and • completeness of the presented content. In the first stage of the process, we have created a list of topics that are most closely related to the areas of our economic, social and environmental impacts and at the same time are important for our stakeholders. We have also analyzed the trends and challenges of sustainable development as well as the guidelines of the strategies of government agencies and the European Union in this area. To find out which of the identified topics are the most important for LOTOS stakeholders, for the first time in the history of our reporting, we conducted an online survey among a selected group of over 200 stakeholders of the LOTOS Group and among fans of Grupa LOTOS S.A. on Facebook (a post with a link to the survey). In such a way, we chose the initial list of topics for reporting. In the next step the team from LOTOS, responsible for overseeing the reporting process, undertook a preliminary prioritisation of topics. Two key aspects were taken into account: the significance of the topic for the functioning and impact of the LOTOS Group and the significance for assessment and decisions of the stakeholders. The applied criteria allowed to identify reporting aspects of different levels of significance for LOTOS and for the environment. These aspects were divided into three groups: low significance, medium significance, and high significance. Aspects that were included in the group of the most significant issues were finally validated, and thus the impact of LOTOS on the inside and on the environment was verified. A full list of aspects assigned to significance groups is presented in the significance matrix. Subsequently, each of them was assigned with the aspects indicated in the GRI – G4 standard and in the corresponding sector supplement. The final list of the report topics has been approved by the Management Board of Grupa LOTOS S.A. The process of identifying and validating important aspects of the report and developing its content involved: representatives of the Management Board of the LOTOS Group, a team of several dozen employees representing key impact areas of the LOTOS Group from all companies and entities subject to reporting, including several dozen representatives of key groups of external LOTOS Group stakeholders, who took part in the online survey. As part of the survey, our stakeholders not only assessed which of the topics proposed to them are important from their perspective but they also reported their own proposals of threads, that in their opinion should be addressed in the integrated report. Preparing the content of this year’s report, we have attempted to answer the majority of the proposals they made. Among them were: • impact on the development of the Polish economy • customer service at petrol stations • supporting Polish athletes and other sponsorships • system supporting development of employees • status of innovative and investment projects • LOTOS operations strengthening the energy security of the country • research and development in the field of alternative fuels, including advanced biofuels • activities in the field of circular economy. We would like to thank all those involved in the preparation and publication of the report for their extremely valuable contribution to the entire process. 124 Integrated Annual Report Grupa LOTOS CONTACT INFO The additional information on the economic activities as well as social and environmental aspects of the LOTOS Group’s operations are available on the Grupa LOTOS S.A. website www.lotos.pl Correspondence should be sent to the address of the main office of the Company: Grupa LOTOS S.A. ul.

Property, plant and equipment are classified as exploration and evaluation assets until the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the discovered resources are demonstrated. Due to significant market volatility, in particular with respect to oil and gas prices, the adopted assumptions may be subject to justifiable changes, and such changes may necessitate a revision of the carrying amounts of the Utgard field’s assets in the future. To determine the effect of key factors on the test results, the Group carried out an analysis of sensitivity to a -15%/+15% change in oil and gas price, -15%/+15% change in production volumes, -15%/+15% change in the USD/NOK exchange rate, and -0.5pp/+ 0.5pp change in the discount rate.
