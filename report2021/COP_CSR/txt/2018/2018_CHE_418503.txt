We are committed to making the UN Global Compact and its principles part of the culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engaging in collaborative projects which advance the Sustainable Development goals. Chubb will make a clear public statement of this commitment. We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the UN Global Compact is the annual submission of a report that describes our companyâ€™s commitment to the Ten Principles. We will submit our first report within one year of joining the UN Global Compact, and annually while we continue as a member of the Compact. Sincerely yours, Evan Greenberg Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Chubb Limited 2
