There, they then contribute towards increasing efficiency and conserving resources. Metal bellows are used as flexible sealing elements in vacuum technology. The main areas of application include the sealing of vacuum valves and vacuum switches. Vacuum bellows are characterised by a low spring rate and long service life. 9 AEROSPACE  AEROSPACE Extreme resilience and maximum reliability are The material titanium exemplifies this. the requirements for the components in astroIt is very suitable for applications that require nautics.

LIGHT GIANTS The flexible adapter with titanium bellows connects the auxiliary tanks in the cargo hold of planes with the rigid jet fuel pipelines. Titanium has the greatest strength among light metals and is heat resistant.. 22 Pure titanium hardly ever occurs in the earth and is extracted from titanium iron ore. Ti The manufacturing process is very costly. Of particular note is the high strength with relatively low density. For this reason it is very suitable for applications that require high corrosion resistance, strength and low weight such as in aerospace. TITANIUM 47,867 10 BUSINESS DIVISIONS RESIDENTIAL BUILDING VENTILATION  BUSINESS RESIDENTIAL BUILDING VENTILATION DIVISIONS JUST TAKE Colourless gas and ubiquitous elixir of life Accounts for approx. 21 % of the air. 8 48.9 % of the earth's crust consists of oxygen At about 30 %, it is the most frequent O element of the earth's crust.. Almost all living beings need oxygen to live. Plants A BREATH generally emit more oxygen than they need during the photosynthesis process. Oxygen is involved in many combustion and corrosion processes. OXYGEN 15.999 Energy-efficient construction is not possible without modern ventilation systems. They enable aeration and ventilation of the rooms as needed and energy-saving waste heat recovery from the exhaust air. Furthermore, they ensure a healthy indoor climate not only in passive buildings. The Witzenmann Group ranks among the pioneers in Germany in matters involving flat ducts for exhaust air. The flat design allows optimum routing of the ventilation systems in buildings and technical advantages compared with other designs. Continuous improvements and certifications have allowed the Witzenmann Group to become the technologically leading manufacturer in this segment. The flat ducting component programme enables flexible, space-saving assembly in walls, floors, and ceilings. The range of dimensions and designs have been selected so that optimum adjustment to the corresponding required air volumes is achieved and zeta values/current losses are as low as possible. 12 GLOBAL COMPACT  GLOBAL COMPACT 6 C CARBON 12.011 Is present as hard diamond or soft graphite.
