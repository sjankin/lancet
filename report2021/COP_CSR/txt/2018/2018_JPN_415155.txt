Tackling societal issues and contributing to society’ s sustained Activities development so that in 30 years customers, and their children and grandchildren as well, can live comfortable lives with safety and security is both our mission and meaning of our existence.

ERM  G4-14 1–1 Promotion of ERM Approach ERM stands for Enterprise Risk Management and refers to a strategic method of corporate management that seeks to maximize corporate value and profits while ensuring the soundness of business through integrated management of profit, risk and capital. As opposed to conventional approaches designed primarily to avoid risks (losses), ERM takes a strategic stance with respect to risks, viewing them as a factor to be actively taken on in order to increase return (profit) and, as such, not something that should necessarily be reduced or eliminated. Using this new method, businesses can quantify profit, risk and capital on a uniform evaluation standard, helping manage these elements in an integral fashion and incorporate them into management decision-making, thereby allowing pursuit of growth in profitability while maintaining sound management of business operations. The T&D Life Group has established the Group ● PDCA Cycle ERM Committee to implement ERM as a Group-wide initiative. With the committee providing leadership in promoting ERM throughout the Group, we will PLAN DO enhance the Group’ s corporate value in a stable and Formulating Implementing continuous manner while maintaining a sound busimanagement planned plan initiatives ness foundation.

The T&D Life Group promotes the integrated risk management approach to achieve the management objectives by quantifying the risks affecting the Group by type of risks and assessing the impacts when making losses, and also by controlling all the risks associated with its operations, including unquantifiable risks. 2. Risk Management  G4-14 DMA 2–1 Basic Concept for Risk Management At the T&D Life Group, T&D Holdings has formulated a Group Risk Management Policy setting forth the Group’ s basic approach to risk management and, based on this policy, the three life insurance companies and other Group members have developed their risk management system that covers their affiliates as well. T&D Holdings has established a Group Risk Management Committee and manages risks within the Group. The committee receives reports, regularly and as required, on risks assessed using uniform economic value-based risk management indicators, from the three life insurance companies and other Group members, in order to identify and manage the various types of risks faced by Group companies.

The ESR is calculated by dividing surplus, an economic value based net asset, by economic capital, which is the economic value-based risk Responsible volume computed by an internal model on the basis of insurance underwriting risk, investment risk, operational risk, etc. We implement economic value-based risk management by controlling EC within a certain range of surplus.

To complement the risk quantification model, stress tests are conducted with multiple scenarios reflecting long-term macroand micro-economic projections. 2–7 Cyber Security Initiatives The T&D Life Group recognizes that one of the important tasks of management is appropriately protecting and managing information assets in compliance with laws and regulations. This specifically involves protecting information assets from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. To fulfill our social responsibilities as a company engaged in the life insurance business, we have made engagement in cyber security mandatory for all executives and employees. In particular, in order to provide even safer services to customers, we utilize security tools to conduct round-the-clock monitoring of cyber threats that target financial institutions, which have increased in recent years in both frequency and sophistication. We have also established the cross-organization Group Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) along with company-level CSIRT teams, which collect information, conduct analysis and implement measures in connection with cyber attacks. In addition, we conduct Groupand company-level drills and participate in industry-wide drills and training. Issues identified through these drills are reflected in our response procedures and manuals to strengthen our real-world responsiveness. Along with conducting multi-layered security measures (entrance, exit, and internal), we regularly receive diagnostic security evaluations from independent institutions and promptly implement the necessary measures. All of the Group’ s corporate officers receive training with outside experts on the most recent trends in cyber security to raise their risk awareness.

Moreover, the T&D Life Group has compliance programs and manuals to ensure that all Group executives and employees thoroughly understand the importance of preventing bribery and corruption through measures to prevent money laundering, embezzlement, and diversion of funds. The Group’ s reward and punishment regulations stipulate bribery and corruption as being subject to the highest level of disciplinary action in view of the significant maliciousness and grave impact involved. All acts of wrongdoing (and concerns about possible wrongdoing), including bribery and corruption, are reported to the Board of Directors. In addition, items on preventing bribery and corruption have been added to the risk assessment checklist for new business investments to ensure they are screened appropriately. As of fiscal 2016, there have been no scandals or legal actions related to bribery and corruption. 〈Extract from a Compliance Manual〉 ［Risks Related to Bribery and Corruption］ In today’ s world, bribery and corruption impede the development and economic growth of the country or region in which they occur. Bribery and corruption not only have an undue negative impact on poor regions, they also give rise to serious legal and reputational risks for companies. Many of the acts that involve corruption, such as bribery, are not only illegal in the place where a company performs them, but there is an increasing number of cases where these acts are also illegal by the laws of the home country of the company. As regards reputational risks, even if a company is judged to not be involved with corruption by the final judgment of the court concerned, there are many cases in which the reputation of the company has been damaged merely because it was suspected of corruption. A company must also pay attention to the fact that they not only take responsibility for their own actions but also for the actions of any agents that are conducting business on their behalf in other countries. 3–5 Tax Policy G4-HR12 Strict compliance with laws and regulations is clearly stated by the T&D Life Group in its T&D Life Group CSR Charter and T&D Life Group Compliance Code of Conduct.

The helpline provides a venue for reporting actions that are problematic as regards compliance, that are violations or suspected violations of internal rules, or that damage the credibility or prestige of the Group. ● T&D Life Group Helpline As a rule, our executives and employees who report information through the T&D Life Group Helpline shall not suffer negative consequences for having done so. To ensure the effectiveness of the system, the Group has made it possible for executives and employees to report information to a contracted third-party company by phone, via website, and through other channels, and to do so anonymously as well. ● Number of Calls Received by the T&D Life Group Helpline FY2014 FY2015 FY2016 130 188 186 * Numbers shown above include inquiries about the system and reports on workplace issues that reporters may find difficult to discuss with superiors, such as harassment concerns. 32 Ⅴ Priority Areas Top Message/ (1) Providing Better Products and Services Organizational Profile 1.

The company has set up white boards and communication boards in branches to facilitate communication with customers (2) Respect for Human Rights who have hearing or speech difficulties. In August 2016, the company established a call center in Osaka to strengthen the call center structure and strengthen BCP (business continuity plan) measures. The company is now able to assist customers from two locations (Tokyo and Osaka), as well as handle an increase in the number of inquiries from customers. Moreover, the company is now able to respond more quickly than ever in the event of a major disaster or other significant event. 《Initiatives for making improvements reflecting customer feedback》 Priority Areas T&D Financial Life collects and analyzes feedback from customers regarding the various forms it sends out and the skills of communicators at its call centers. Each year, it conducts a Customer Satisfaction Survey to help improve (3) Global Environmental customer service and operational quality. According to the results of the fiscal 2016 survey, more than 90% of customProtection ers gave a positive rating to the way forms were to be filled out and to the response of call center communicators. At the same time, many customers also responded that it was difficult to understand how to fill out forms and apply their seals when requesting paySocial Contribution ment, and the company subsequently began relaxing the requirements for documentation to be submitted with various procedures and simplifying the procedures by accepting unregistered seals and so on. Activities T&D Financial Life will continue to listen to its customers as it works toward achieving an even more customer-oriented operation. 2–4 T&D Asset Management’ s Initiatives 《Products that contribute to the formation of a sustainable society》 Responsible T&D Asset Management has established and manages the T&D Japan Equities Institutional Investor ESG Research Fund. This fund selectively invests in companies with outstanding ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) performance through ESG research. In doing so, the fund seeks to generate investment returns that outperform the mediumto long-term market average. Moreover, by investing in Others companies that seek to reduce environmental impact and help achieve a sound society, the fund aims to play a part in forming a sustainable society. 35 《As a responsible institutional investor》 T&D Asset Management believes that the essence of CSR is to contribute widely to society through asset management, its original field of business, and to that end engages in a vigorous exchange of opinion and the communication of information. In fiscal 2016, the company has participated in the proof of concept under the Ministry of the Environment’ s project to build a system for environmental information disclosure, and is active as a member of an expert working group. 2–5 P  et & Family Small-amount Short-term Insurance’ s Initiatives 《Providing for an important part of the family》 Against a background of social issues such as an advance in low birth rates and an aging population, as well as an increase in one-person households, pet ownership has remained stable. Changes in the way pet owners view their pets as a member of the family have also brought increased interest in issues such as medical care for pets and the associated costs. Given this background, Pet & Family Small-amount Short-term Insurance is responding to pet healthcare costs by offering products that cover a certain portion of the cost of veterinary care for pet illness and injury, including Genki Number One and Genki Number One Slim, ensuring peace of mind for both pet owners and their pets when treatment is needed. 《More convenient procedures》 In November 2015, Pet & Family Small-amount Short-term Insurance began offering new tablet-based contract procedures through its pet shop agencies. While traditional paper-based procedures and application forms often resulted in inadequate documentation, the introduction of tablets has led to shortened times for contract completion and reduced the burden on customers. 2–6 Best Senior Service Based on the social situation that the aging of society is progressing, we are carrying out Group-wide efforts to improve the convenience and satisfaction of our elderly customers. At Taiyo Life and Daido Life, this initiative was named the Best Senior Service, and through this initiative, we are developing a variety of service improvements. 《Main Initiatives of Taiyo Life》 ① Home visit service From July 2014, we began our customer support activities to give security and relief to seniors, those who are 70 years old or older, by visiting their homes more than once every year. Through this activity, we explain insurance matters carefully and comprehensively, including confirmation of policy details and examination of missed insurance claims, in order to deliver security and relief to each individual senior customer. ② Development of new products for senior customers In March 2016, Taiyo Life launched Himawari Dementia Treatment Insurance, the life insurance industry’ s first product to offer coverage for predetermined states caused by dementia, available for seniors with health concerns. In addition to dementia, the product provides coverage for the diseases and illnesses to which seniors are particularly vulnerable, making it popular among elderly customers. The cumulative number of policies sold exceeded 250,000 as of September 2017. ③ Efforts to provide greater peace of mind during contract signing and renewal In addition to strongly encouraging family members to be present during contract signing for senior customers, Taiyo Life sales representatives carry mobile devices and utilize video conferencing to enable head office staff to reconfirm the customer’ s intent to enter into the contract and verify matters for declaration (offered with some products). Taiyo Life has introduced a Family Registration Program, and encourages family members to sign up for this program under which family members of the policyholder can register their contact information in advance, in case the policyholder cannot be contacted in the event of a major disaster or other event. Registered family members can also inquire about coverage and claims procedures on behalf of the policyholder. ④ Kaketsuke-Tai Service The Kaketsuke-Tai Service is a service whereby staff with specialist knowledge visit customers and their families directly when they claim insurance benefits to relieve the burden of claims procedures and to provide pinpointed services that only staff with specialist knowledge can offer. Many customers, including elderly customers, have spoken highly of the service, which has been used more than 30,000 times since it was launched in April 2016. In addition, by making the process for claiming benefits paperless, customers are now able to check their claims and complete the necessary procedures simply by providing their signature on a dedicated mobile device. 36 Top Message/ Organizational Profile 《Main Initiatives of Daido Life》 CSR ① Establishment of a system by which customers can perform necessary procedures reliably and quickly regardless of the environment <Designated proxy application option> Management We propose the addition of a designated proxy application option to an insurance policy, under which a person who has been designated in advance (a preregistered proxy) may file claims for payment, etc., if the insured person eligible for Governance and receiving insurance benefits is unable to make claims due to an illness or accident. <Family Registration Program> Internal Control We propose that our individual customers register their family members in the Family Registration Program, under which a family member registered in advance may make an inquiry about policy details or request dispatch of claim forms when the policyholder is unable to do so. Furthermore, we also send out a copy of the Daido Life Guide sent to policyholders to their families as well if the policyholders request it. Management ② Provision of easy-to-read, easy-to-understand guidance and procedural documents We have reviewed our internal standards for guidance and procedural documents, and are making improvements such as increasing font sizes. Through these efforts, the Company has obtained the“Tsutawaru Design”certification (from the UCDA). Control (UCDA Certified Documents) 2015: New policy application procedure screen, notification of policy details, pension payment claim form, and claim leaflet Priority Areas 2016: Specification [policy overview], premium account transfer notification, premium payment information, benefits payment claim documents ③ Improvement of treatment of customers and hospitality (1) Providing Better Products In order to provide courteous and careful service in response to customers’situations, we formulated and use a service manual taking into account the general characteristics of our senior customers, such as changes in physical abilities and and Services psychological aspects, as well as visual aides. Through these means, we are striving to provide an environment in which our customers can complete necessary procedures with peace of mind. 3. Improving Customer Satisfaction  G4-27 G4-PR5 DMA Priority Areas 3–1 Initiatives to Respond to Customer Feedback ● Obtaining Customer Feedback through Daily Business Activities (2) Respect for Human Rights To respond to society’ s changing needs by providing better products and services, the Group’s three life insurance companies collect a variety of feedback from their customers in the course of daily business activities. By establishing a multitude of customer contact points through their sales representatives, agents, call centers (Customer Service Centers), the Internet and so on, they work to collect as much customer feedback as possible. They also work to proactively confirm our customers’ satisfaction through regular, as well as ad hoc, surveys and other means. Priority Areas ● System to Reflect Customer Feedback in Operations The Group’ s three life insurance companies have set up dedicated departments and committees with external members in (3) Global Environmental charge of customer satisfaction management.

Translation The following is an English translation of an independent assurance report prepared in Japanese and is for information and reference purposes only. In the event of a discrepancy between the Japanese and English versions, the Japanese version will prevail. September 8, 2017 Independent Assurance Report TO: Mr. Tetsuhiro Kida Representative Director and President T&D Holdings, Inc. Kenji Sawami Partner Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC Tokyo We, Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC, have been commissioned by T&D Holdings, Inc. (hereafter the “Company”) and have carried out a limited assurance engagement on the Key Environmental Performance Indicators (hereafter the Indicators ) of the Company and its major subsidiaries for the year ended March 31, 2017 as included in the Environmental Performance Data and Group-wide Targets and Results of the Company’s Corporate Responsibility Report 2017 (hereafter the “Report”). The scope of our assurance procedures was limited to the Indicators marked with the symbol ★ in the Report. 1. The Company’s Responsibilities The Company is responsible for preparing the Indicators in accordance with the Company’s own criteria, which it determined with consideration of Japanese environmental regulations as presented in the Scope and Calculation Methods of Environmental Performance Data and Group-wide Targets and Results of the Report. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are estimated using emissions factors, which are subject to scientific and estimation uncertainties, given instruments for measuring GHG emissions may vary in characteristics, in terms of functions and assumed parameters. 2. Our Independence and Quality Control We have met the independence requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants in March 2013, which is based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectiveness, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behavior. In addition, we maintain a comprehensive quality control system, including documented policies and procedures for compliance with ethical rules, professional standards, and applicable laws and regulations in accordance with the International Standard on Quality Control 1 issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board in April 2009. 3. Our responsibilities Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Indicators included in the Report based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements: Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (“ISAE 3000”) (Revised), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board in December 2013, Practical Guidelines for the Assurance of Sustainability Information, revised in December 2014 by the Japanese Association of Assurance Organizations for Sustainability Information and, with respect of GHG emissions, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (“ISAE 3410”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board in June 2012. The procedures, which we have been performed according to our professional judgment, include inquiries, document inspection, analytical procedures, reconciliation between source documents and Indicators in the Report, as well as the following: • Making inquiries regarding the Company’s own criteria that it determined with consideration of Japanese environmental regulations, and evaluating the appropriateness thereof; • Inspecting relevant documents with regard to the design of the Company’s internal controls related to the Indicators, and inquiring of personnel responsible thereof at the headquarters and one major subsidiary visited; • Performing analytical procedures concerning the Indicators at the headquarters and one major subsidiary visited; and • Testing, on a sample basis, underlying source information and conducting relevant re-calculations at the headquarters and one major subsidiary visited. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are more limited in nature, timing and extent than a reasonable assurance engagement. As a result, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is lower than would have been obtained if we had performed a reasonable assurance engagement. 4. Conclusion Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Indicators included in the Report have not been measured and reported in accordance with the Company’s own criteria that it determined with consideration of Japanese environmental regulations. 60 Top Message/ Organizational Profile 4.

Daido Life Insurance Company Minoru Yoneda Akane Kumagai Teppei Iwamoto and Services Investment Planning Section, ESG Analyst, Responsible Investment Fund Manager, Planning Department Group, Institutional Investors Division Asset ­Management Department Position as of July 2017 Priority Areas Signing the Principles for Responsible Investment Yoneda: Taiyo Life in 2007 became the first Japanese life insurance company to sign the UN’ s Principles for (2) Respect for Human Rights Responsible Investment (PRI). The PRI declare that as an institutional investor we will incorporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes. One of our important social roles as a life insurance company is faithfully paying out insurance money and benefits, but we also have a social role to play as a long-term institutional investor. The insurance industry as a whole in 2007 had been shaken by problems involving the Priority Areas payment of insurance benefits, and so the obvious course of action at the time for an insurance company was strengthening payment systems, but we also became a signatory to the PRI out of a (3) Global Environmental desire to contribute to society as an institutional investor. Kumagai: T&D Asset Management began conducting surveys in 2011 with the aim of utilizing ESG factors in Protection asset management. The PRI were in accordance with the thrust of our initiatives, and based on the fact that they also match the long-term interests of our clients, we became a signatory in 2012. Iwamoto: Daido Life signed the principles in 2016. We had long been involved in initiatives that helped solve Social Contribution social issues and became a signatory in order to actively play a role not only in the area of life insurance but also in asset management. Activities Yoneda: PRI signatory institutions report the performance of initiatives with respect to the principles each year. The framework for the report is published by the end of the year, so we confirm the contents and conduct self-evaluations for each asset class. Each year we formulate a PRI action plan and finalize it at the upper management level, but the process presents a good opportunity at the stage preceding Responsible this for managers of each asset class to conduct self-evaluations on investment processes and performances. Through issues indentified through this process, changes in reporting items and other inforInstitutional Investor mation, we confirm trends in global ESG investment and formulate the activities plan based on this. Others 67 Kumagai: In addition to that, we have monitoring from asset owners, and it is necessary to provide even more detailed information on PRI initiatives. The PRI reporting area I’ m involved in is shareholder voting and engagement (dialogue with companies receiving investment), and we have to show the extent to which engagement is being conducted effectively and with clear goals. For investment clients, we are required to report activities in specific terms. On this point, due in part also to revisions to the Stewardship Code, I think a further level of depth is needed. Yoneda: The PRI and the Stewardship Code require the same things regarding voting rights execution and engagement activities. Approach to Responsible Investment Iwamoto: I’ m currently in charge of foreign and domestic corporate bonds. In making investment decisions, I consider both investment returns and the return to society. I think one of the roles society seeks from institutional investors is contributing to social returns. However, since we are institutional investors and not philanthropists, one of the things we have to do is consider how to integrate social returns with investment returns. Kumagai: Empirical studies continue to be conducted on ESG factors and investment results and partial correlations have been found with G, Governance. Regarding E, Environmental, and S, Social, there are a variety of opinions, but consideration of ESG factors is essential to investment decisions. It is generally thought that when the investment timeframe is longer, non-financial information and intangible assets become more important as investment decision factors than financial information. We also believe that with long-term investments, ESG factors, which are a type of non-financial information, are important factors in the formation of corporate and share value. Yoneda: This is a bit of a different perspective, and while I used the expression earlier of the social role of a life insurer and the social role of an institutional investor, as a basic concept, I think the aims of a life insurer and the aims of ESG investment are the same. The PRI require that ESG initiatives be promoted throughout the entire company, including upper management, and not only by employees in the asset management division. I feel that when explaining to people outside the company that we engage in ESG investment through company-wide systems, it won’ t be adequately conveyed unless we start from this basic concept. Iwamoto: Europe is the leader in this area. For example, institutional investors are required by law to declare their commitment to CO2 reduction, etc., and disclose the results; various regulations also underpin ESG investment. I think that it will be difficult to approach Europe’ s level with investors alone taking the lead; I think society as a whole needs to move forward. In this sense, GPIF initiatives* can be seen as an activity aimed at promoting ESG initiatives throughout society, including corporations. Yoneda: I think it is exceedingly difficult to generate results in voting rights execution and engagement over the short term. Japan and Europe are different not only in terms of laws and regulations but in the way the society as a whole is viewed and understood. We won’ t simply imitate countries in the lead or get on board with temporary trends; we plan to be a long-term institutional investor that makes an ongoing contribution to the progression of society as a whole. * Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF): Japan’ s public pension investment organization, referred to as the world’ s largest institutional investor, announced that in the future it would begin ESG investment on a scale of ¥3 trillion. Specific Investment Decision Processes That Incorporate ESG Yoneda: We have created a system based on the PRI for always considering ESG in the asset management process. All our asset management regulations stipulate consideration of ESG issues, and based on these regulations, departments that manage assets create responsible investment checklists and confirm conformance in all investment and financing decisions. We also conduct negative screening and incorporate a method in which points accrue when standards are met. Equity investments are re-evaluated each year and an investment universe is built. Ten years have passed since the initiatives were started and I think they have steadily become firmly established. 68 Top Message/ Organizational Profile Iwamoto: When Daido Life invests in corporate bonds, we evaluate investment targets while also considering CSR ESG issues, from the standpoint of mitigating the risk of sudden changes in the company’ s creditworthiness due to governance problems or other issues. Like Taiyo Life, this is also stipulated in regulations and manuals. In addition, we actively consider initiatives for social bonds as well, a type of Management themed investment, based on a social returns standpoint. Kumagai: Taking the example of T&D Japan Equities ESG Research Fund, we first do a basic industry evaluation. We set key indicators for each industry, make evaluations centering on these key indicators of the Governance and company’ s business model and stakeholder relations, and assign an ESG rating. There are five rankings and the lower rankings are not eligible for investment. The most important part of this process Internal Control is direct interviews with the companies. We make requests to the companies being evaluated and conduct direct interviews on ESG. In addition to the information that comes out of the interviews, we also research and analyze the company’ s CSR reports, integrated reports, environmental reports and Management other such information and make adjustments to our evaluation. We have discussed the lack of significant correlation with the evaluations of major ESG ratings agencies, but the evaluations of each Control rating agency have certain characteristics, and we think our evaluations are also distinctive. Priority Areas Future of ESG Investment (1) Providing Better Products Yoneda: ESG investment is a global trend, and I think it will continue to expand going forward. While formerly there was the view that responsible investment was something done from a social contribution and Services standpoint by companies with the leeway to do it, now the idea has become fairly well established that investment returns are pursued through ESG investment and that this contributes to society. Given the prevailing low interest rate environment, I think ESG investment is a field that will garner attention from the standpoint of increasing investment sophistication and diversity as well. Priority Areas Iwamoto: When I talk to people outside the company at banks or securities companies, I get the sense there is a high level of interest in ESG investment performed by institutional investors like pension funds and life insurance companies. I believe that institutional investors will drive the expansion of the ESG (2) Respect for Human Rights investment market. Kumagai: This is from the perspective of an analyst, but in the future I think that the quality of ESG will become more of an issue both for companies and for investors. Companies will be expected to consider closely whether they should truly be engaged in the key issues and goals they themselves have Priority Areas decided on. Investors will have to consider how to incorporate ESG factors into investment decisions from the standpoint of raising the sustainable growth potential of the company as well as society as (3) Global Environmental a whole. In the past, simply performing ESG investment was perhaps sufficient, but I believe we are now at a new stage in which further improvement is needed from a quality standpoint.

Taiyo Life Insurance Company In order to further fulfill its social responsibility as an institutional investor, Taiyo Life determined that it was essential to exert its influence for the betterment of society and the global environment through investment and lending activities to a greater extent, and to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society. In line with this thinking, in March 2007, Taiyo Life became the first Japanese life insurance company to sign the PRI. Based on these principles, Taiyo Life gives due consideration to ESG issues, namely, environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) issues, and promotes asset management to achieve a sustainable society. Daido Life Insurance Company Daido Life supports the objectives of the PRI and became a signatory institution to them in November 2016. The company has long carried out initiatives that contribute to solutions to social issues through business activities, and by promoting financing and investment that takes into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in the area of asset management as well, it is contributing to the formation of a sustainable society. T&D Asset Management Co., Ltd. T&D Asset Management, to fulfill its responsibilities of being entrusted as an institutional investor that manages investments, endorses the concept of the PRI, and signed them in March 2012. In accordance with these principles, T&D Asset Management tackles ESG issues in a manner consistent with meeting the long-term interests of customers, fully grasping the status of investee companies. Accordingly, the company is also committed to pursuing the sustained growth of these companies, particularly through holding constructive dialogues with them and through the exercise of voting rights, with the aim of increasing the mediumand long-term investment returns on the funds entrusted to it by customers. The status of each Group company’ s PRI initiatives is reported in RI Transparency Report. WEB http://www.unpri.org/signatories/signatories/ * The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) are a code of conduct for the global financial industry that was proclaimed by Kofi Annan, the secretary-­ general of the United Nations in 2006. A commitment to these principles has been signed by over 1,700 financial institutions worldwide, and by 59 in Japan (as of July 2017). 1–2 Policy of Socially Responsible Investment and Investment Decision-making Taiyo Life, Daido Life and T&D Asset Management have incorporated the viewpoint of socially responsible investment in their investment and lending processes. Taiyo Life Insurance Company · Daido Life Insurance Company Taiyo Life and Daido Life handle the insurance premiums entrusted to them by customers, and conducts asset management founded on these insurance premiums, from the viewpoints of profitability, stability, and the public interest. As institutions signing their commitment to the PRI, Taiyo Life and Daido Life have adopted another basic attitude of considering ESG issues in the form of the rules applied to asset management. In line with this basic attitude regarding this type of asset management, Taiyo Life and Daido Life reflect their PRI thinking in investment and lending processes when they invest in stocks and real estate, or lend to companies. T&D Asset Management Co., Ltd. As an institutional investor engaged in the asset management business, T&D Asset Management tackles ESG issues in a manner consistent with meeting the long-term interests of customers. T&D Asset Management believes that environmentally friendly, socially conscientious companies with excellent corporate governance are superior companies from the viewpoint of sustainability. Based on this belief, T&D Asset Management has assigned dedicated ESG survey staff to conduct ESG surveys of companies in Japan. ESG information is provided to personnel in charge of handling domestic shares and domestic industrial bonds as materials for making investment judgments. Furthermore, T&D Asset Management cooperates with the major US SRI company Domini Social Investments LLC to grasp overseas ESG trends by means of information exchanges. 70 Top Message/ Organizational Profile 1–3 The Principles for Responsible Institutional Investors (the Japanese Version of the Stewardship Code) CSR Three of the Group’ s companies, Taiyo Life, Daido Life and T&D Asset Management, endorsed and expressed their Management commitment to the Principles for Responsible Institutional Investors (the Japanese version of the Stewardship Code) in May 2014.

Moreover, the two companies foster the sustainable growth of investee companies by conducting purposeful dialogue with those companies on a daily basis. Based on this basic approach, the two companies exercise their voting rights strictly in accordance with the Guidelines for Exercising Voting Rights established to ensure the appropriate exercise of voting rights. In order to Priority Areas further enhance measures to exercise voting rights, those guidelines were revised in June 2015 in line with the purport of “Japan’ s Corporate Governance Code—Seeking Sustainable Corporate Growth and Increased Corporate Value over the Midto Long-Term.”In June 2017, an in-house committee on exercising voting rights was established and governance and conflict of interest management structures were strengthened in regard to all aspects of stewardship activities, including (2) Respect for Human Rights exercising of voting rights. 《Main Focal Points for Carefully Examining Proposals, Engaging in Dialogues and Making Voting Decisions》 ▶ Has the investee company decided to pay no dividends despite having ample funds for dividend payments? Is the dividend payout ratio extremely low (or high)? ▶ Does the investee company face problems in connection with any activities against public order and common decency Priority Areas (willful tax evasion, collusion, bribery, etc.) and/or antisocial activities such as environmental destruction (actions deemed questionable in light of ESG problems)? (3) Global Environmental ▶ From the standpoint of requesting investee companies to ensure corporate governance is functioning effectively in management, does the investee company present problems in terms of any of the following: • Level of ROE Protection • Number and independence of outside directors • Attendance rate of corporate officers at meetings of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board • Length of service of Audit & Supervisory Board members • Eligible recipients of retirement benefit payments Social Contribution • Eligible recipients of stock options T&D Asset Management Activities T&D Asset Management believes that exercising voting rights is an effective means for shareholders to increase the corporate value of investee companies by giving the shareholders a say in corporate governance, which has a pivotal impact on corporate management. Based on this belief, T&D Asset Management has clearly codified guidelines in its internal rules for expressing its voting intentions on proposals put forward to the Ordinary Shareholders’Meeting. This is to fulfill the company’ s fiduciary responsibility as an asset management institution. Moreover, T&D Asset Management carefully examines all proposals Responsible put forward based on the Guidelines for Exercising Voting Rights. 1. Appointment of corporate officers (directors, Audit & Supervisory Board members, and audit and other committee members) 2.

Through proactive dialogue with investee companies, Taiyo Life and Daido Life work to verify the circumstances faced by management and share an awareness of issues while continuously taking steps to help increase shareholder value. ▶ Examples of companies with whom Taiyo Life and Daido Life engaged in dialogue • Companies whose ROE fell below a certain threshold • Companies issuing dividends despite having reported a net loss • Companies not paying dividends despite having adequate resources • Companies proposing an increase in internal directors without adequate explanation for the reasons or background • Companies proposing to reappoint directors despite not having paid a dividend • Companies raising officer compensation without persuasive explanation • Companies that have proposed deploying or continually instituting antitakeover measures without sufficient explanation of their background or objective • Companies planning to reappoint outside directors who had a low attendance rate at Board of Directors Meetings • Companies planning to reappoint Audit & Supervisory Board members who have served for extensive periods of time • Companies proposing officer retirement bonuses without disclosing individual payment amounts • Companies that have been involved in misconduct or other such incidents 《Status of Exercising Voting Rights》 Taiyo Life and Daido Life reject proposals in cases where problems are not rectified despite constructive dialogue, cases where shareholder value is highly likely to be impaired and in certain other circumstances.

This dialogue seeks to foster sustained growth principally from the Management viewpoints of business strategies, capital efficiency and shareholder returns, as well as from ESG perspectives. From July 2016 to June 2017, T&D Asset Management engaged in dialogue with 38 companies. Examples of such dialogue undertaken with companies are as follows: Governance and (1) T&D Asset Management indicated to the companies that in information disclosed in convocation notices for general meetings of shareholders, it wanted the companies to provide descriptions of appointment policies and Internal Control reasons for director candidates, and when there was an extended term of office, the reasons, etc., for the longer term. The companies disclosed this information as requested. (2) T&D Asset Management encouraged initiatives related to officer and employee diversity. With the deepening Management problem of personnel and labor shortages, all operating companies recognize the importance of hiring women, foreign nationals and people with disabilities, and T&D Asset Management received responses on current meaControl sures and targets. Priority Areas (3) T&D Asset Management called on operating companies to reduce use of alternative CFCs. It confirmed that some products use natural refrigerants and that companies are engaged in the development of products with the lowest possible environmental impact while also fully taking into account product safety. (1) Providing Better Products 《Status of Exercising Voting Rights》 T&D Asset Management has established an internal Voting Rights Exercising Committee to discuss and decide on and Services required matters related to the exercise of voting rights. The committee is chaired by the chief investment officer, and comprises members in charge of the Investment Management Department and the Legal & Compliance Department. Meetings are held from time to time as required. Guidelines for exercising voting rights are determined by the committee chairperson after discussion among committee members. The individual in charge of the committee’ s secrePriority Areas tariat then prepares the draft directions for exercising voting rights, with the executive officer in charge of investment making the final decision. Under this procedure, from May to June 2017, T&D Asset Management announced that it intended to reject 941 proposals submitted to the company (13.4% of the total number of proposals).

(3) Global Environmental (3) With regard to shareholder proposals, T&D Asset Management approved proposals that it judged would improve management transparency through the disclosure of information. Protection Social Contribution Activities Responsible Institutional Investor Others 73 Third-party Opinion 1. Examining T&D Holdings’Business Model First, I’ d like to express my respect for T&D Holdings’consistent and sincere commitment to addressing social issues through its core businesses. With this in mind, this year I’ d like to take a look at T&D Holdings’efforts from the ­perspective of its business model. In simple terms, the general business model of a life insurance company is to allocate funds generated through insurance premium income and investment income to four areas: the payment of insurance claims, expenses needed to maintain the company’ s daily operations, provisions for risks, and shareholder returns. In the short term, returns of profits to shareholders could be increased by curtailing the payment of insurance claims, and internal costs. However, I don’ t think the profits generated in these ways could be sustained over the long term. In other words, life insurance companies cannot be successful by focusing merely on short-term ROE. How is T&D Holdings’unique business model structured in this respect? In this report, T&D Holdings articulates its commitment to the well-being of its workers through activities such as initiatives for health and productivity, support for work-life balance, and the promotion of active participation by female employees. In my view, T&D Holdings’emphasis on these areas will increase employee satisfaction, thereby enhancing the quality of service too. In practice, T&D Holdings is providing value above and beyond the amount of insurance claims paid out. This is being done through such means as developing products in line with social needs, such as nursing care and dementia risks; providing clear and easy-to-read information, as recognized with an award from the Universal Communication Design Association (UDCA); taking creative steps to make it easier for customers to file insurance claims; providing after-sales services such as Kaigo Concierge, a free nursing care consultation service; and diligent risk management. Through these and other initiatives, each operating company will seek to become an“insurance company of first choice”for customers. This, in turn, will enable T&D Holdings to meet the expectations of shareholders over the long term. While this entire report suggests that T&D Holdings indeed possesses this sort of business model, it might be a good idea for T&D Holdings to articulate this idea more directly and clearly in future reports. 2. Relationships between CSR Priority Areas and ESG Investing This year’ s report presented the frank views of T&D Holdings’frontline staff on ESG investing through a discussion with managers from each of the Group’ s three core life insurance companies on ESG investing initiatives. The report showed that each company is addressing ESG investing in earnest based on their respective approaches. That said, I’ m slightly concerned about the extent to which the CSR priority areas derived from the Group’ s corporate philosophy are recognized in ESG investing activities. For example,“Respect for Human Rights”is one of T&D Holdings’priority areas. Human rights issues in the supply chains of investee companies are one theme that has been attracting considerable public attention in the field of ESG investing. In regard to“Global Environmental Protection,” another priority area for T&D Holdings, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has issued their final report, recommending that companies analyze climate-related scenarios with respect to climate-related risk. The report thus takes the position that climate change issues have already become a financial risk. Judging from T&D Holdings’CSR report, it is not necessarily clear how these specific environmental (E) and social (S) themes are treated in the context of the Company’ s ESG investing activities. In the aforementioned discussion, a participant noted that the quality of ESG investing will be put to the test in the future. I wholeheartedly agree. In particular, universal owners, such as T&D Holdings that undertake passive investments, simply addressing ESG issues not only leads directly to stronger investment performance, but by protecting the environment and society that are the foundations of economic activity through engagement, it is ultimately helping to safeguard the returns of their entire portfolios. This would also be consistent with the Top Message, in which the president states that the T&D Life Group will directly address social issues to ensure that people can continue to live comfortably with security and peace of mind, through to the generations of their children and grandchildren. This year, Japan’ s Stewardship Code was revised, and it has been made clear that collective engagement will be permitted. I expect T&D Holdings to accelerate its efforts in step with these advances and changes in institutional frameworks.
