Now, 99 years later, our insulators are helping support the electrical power infrastructure of the entire world. Not only that, we have capitalized on—and continue to capitalize on—the ceramics technology, which we cultivated over many years of insulator manufacturing, adapting it to the production of a vast array of products that have made NGK a prominent contributor in a diverse range of industries. 1919 High-voltage insulators Electrification gradually began to gain traction at the end of the 19th century. At the time, Japan relied on imports for high-voltage insulators. “To make a contribution to the country, and not merely for our own profit, we must provide Japan with its own, domestically manufactured insulators.” (Kazuchika Okura, founding president of NGK) With this sense of mission, NGK managed to get hold of a piece of an American-made insulator, which it began studying in order to develop its own high-voltage insulators. The desire to contribute to people’s lives and the development of industry was integral to our founding and continues to be the cornerstone of our corporate philosophy. 03 Electric energy storage system NAS® battery systems A product of NGK’s proprietary advanced ceramic technologies, the NAS battery was the world’s first commercialized battery system capable of megawatt-level electric power storage. It is increasingly being utilized in stabilizing output from wind and solar power generators while proving useful to the spread of renewable energies and the establishment of smart grids. 2018 Ceramic substrates for automotive catalytic converters HONEYCERAM® Ceramic catalyst carriers neutralize the harmful substances in automotive exhaust. For maximum exhaust cleaning efficiency, HONEYCERAM was designed with minimum weight and wall thickness: the 0.05 mm walls minimize loss of engine power. World’s first vehicle-mounted NOx sensors This sensor is able to measure the concentration of NOx (nitrogen oxide) contained in automotive exhaust at the ppm (parts per million) level. Measuring real-time NOx concentrations and feeding back that information to the engine controls enables precise control of the exhaust purification system to reduce NOx emissions. 04 History of the NGK Group Preserving the Founding Principles of NGK Business Diversification, Global Business Development, Quality Improvement Since its founding, NGK has offered products boasting the highest quality and reliability thanks to the incorporation of exceptionally reﬁned ceramics technology. At the same time, NGK has actively sought opportunities for business diversiﬁcation and global development. This tradition of exploring new ﬁelds and seeking new challenges remains alive and well at NGK as we continue to pursue sustainable business growth. 1900 1925 1950 1975 Energy 1908 (Nippon Toki era) Diversification Starts production of insulators Ecology 1931 Starts production and sales of acid-resistant equipment for the chemical industry 1976 Starts production and sales of HONEYCERAM® ceramic catalytic converter substrates for automobile exhaust Electronics purification 1958 Starts production and sales of beryllium-copper products Asia 1935 Starts export of suspension Global business development insulators to India North America, Europe 1973 Establishes Locke Insulators, Inc. as a joint venture with the American company, General Electric; begins production overseas 1965 1977 Establishes first overseas subsidiary, Establishes NGK Insulators of America, Ltd.

I offer my deepest apologies to our customers and all other affected parties for the great inconvenience and concern which this caused. We used the annual corporate reorganization carried out in April 2018 to perform a systemic review to ensure this sort of incident never happens again. In order to strengthen our quality management and quality compliance foundations, we are rolling out quality-focused activities for work quality as well as for product quality; we are building a quality compliance program led by top management and carrying out thorough audit; I myself provide direct guidance at a Quality Committee that heads quality-focused activities company-wide; and we are working to strengthen the quality assurance departments in our business divisions. Furthermore, we are developing rules, strengthening management and encouraging management to demonstrate their commitment at every chance they get in order to establish a corporate climate which is uncompromising with regard to compliance. 16 Financial Performance of the NGK Group Results for the Financial Period Ending March 2018 The total consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended March 2018 increased by 12.4% year on year to 451,125 million yen. In addition to the volume of automotive ceramics increasing mainly due to an increase in sales of trucks in the Chinese market and tighter emissions regulations in Europe, the quantities of beryllium copper products and components for semiconductor manufacturing equipment rose. In terms of earnings, despite increases in costs for items such as depreciation and research and development, operating income increased by 10.8% year on year to 70,027 million yen and ordinary income increased by 9.4% to 70,615 million yen as a result of factors such as increased consolidated net sales and a weakened yen. With respect to extraordinary income and loss, while posting an impairment loss totaling 3,768 million yen under extraordinary loss, a gain on sale of investment securities of 1,286 million yen was recorded as extraordinary income. In addition to these, in the previous period, the fiscal year (Billion yen) ended March 31, 2017, 11,213 million yen was posted 2014/3 2015/3 2016/3 2017/3 2018/3 Year-on-year for income taxes for prior periods.

While focusing on an ROE level of 10% or more from the mediumto long-term perspective through efficient investment of business resources to expand core current businesses, launch new businesses, and in other ways improve its earning capacity, the NGK Group will seek to achieve further improvements in capital efficiency. Capital Policy The NGK Group implements its capital policy from the perspective of contributing to sustained enhancement of its corporate value based on communication with its shareholders and investors. The NGK Group will work to realize both financial soundness and securing of profitability that surpasses capital cost, while actively returning profits to shareholders from the mediumto long-term perspective. With items such as ROE, dividend payout ratio, and dividend on equity ratio as important indicators, the NGK Group will aim to maintain profit margin, capital turnover, and financial leverage at sound levels in accordance with business strategies. Measures for Returning Profits to Shareholders NGK views the return of profits to shareholders as one of its most important management policies. As a basic policy, we strive for shareholder-oriented management that emphasizes ROE, and distribute the benefits of successful management with a medium-term target consolidated payout ratio of approximately 30% after consideration of a comprehensive range of factors, including business performance, financial position, and future business development. Meanwhile, NGK plans to utilize retained funds primarily to extend its existing core business and capital investments in new business projects, with a view to enhancing its corporate value. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities for the current consolidated accounting year was 50,554 million yen. Net cash used in investing activities totaled 49,414 million yen. This was mainly due to capital investment of 71,714 million yen (up 19.3% from the previous period) spent mainly on automotive-related ceramics production facilities and semiconductor manufacturing equipment-related production facilities; and cash inflow from the sale and redemption of marketable securities.

currently working on enhancing the production capacity of its state-of-the-art NGK Ceramic Device Ishikawa Plant (referred to hereinafter as the NCDK Ishikawa Plant). The plant, which manufactures the ceramic elements that represent the core technology of NOx (nitrogen oxide) sensors, went on line in April 2017 and is currently being ramped up to its maximum production capacity. Last year the NGK Group began implementation of a planned 300 billion yen in capital investment over three years, and the NCDK Ishikawa Plant is a key, early priority of this plan. Manufacturing state-of-the-art ceramics via an automated production process The NCDK Ishikawa Plant occupies 32,100 m2. It is comprised of two buildings: a Tape Building and an Element Building. The plant manufactures ceramic elements (shown at right) which detect NOx concentration in automobile exhaust. A ceramic material primarily comprised of zirconia is created into long thin rods by bake-hardening, and then equipped with multiple exhaust-absorbing cavities and various electrodes. Voltage is applied to the electrodes to break the NOx into N2 and O2, and the oxygen concentration is then Ishikawa Plant, NGK Ceramic Device 25 The mostly automated printing process forms the electrodes and insulators measured according to the principles used for oxygen pressing the tape. Due to the thin, pliable nature of the sensors, thus allowing the volume of NOx in exhaust to tape, and the fact that even the slightest misalignment is be ascertained in real time. unacceptable, this is an extremely difficult process. Element production begins by stretching out a After this is done, the laminated sheet is cut and zirconia slurry into tape form. This is done in the Tape fired at least 1,000°C, its electrical characteristics and Building. A multitude of automated production machines other properties are checked, and then it is packaged work to produce this zirconia tape. Each part of this up and sent to another plant where assembly is process requires an advanced level of expertise in order performed to create the finished product. uct. to ensure uniform thickness is achieved. The finished tape is then sent to the Element Building where it undergoes a printing process which incorporates electrodes and insulators onto its surface. This process is also automated. Given the sheer number In-vehicle high-accuracy NOx sensor of times the electrode-forming paste must be printed PM filter NOx sensor Diesel particulate filter (DPF) onto the tape and dried, such automation is of great benefit as it enables a higher level of productivity. Engine Muffler Next, a laminating process is performed to create the element shape. This is done by layering and Large HONEYCERAM (LSH) Large HONEYCERAM (LSH) 26 Special Feature Kilns for high-temperature firing of ceramic laminates Careful inspection prior to firing Addressing the need for personnel and creating leaders from locally hired employees Plant Manager, NGK Ceramic Device Ishikawa Plant Kazuhiro Hasegawa The biggest difference between the NCDK Ishikawa Our biggest struggle thus far has been with time Plant and conventional plants is the degree to which we constraints. In order to ensure the plant went on line by incorporate automation. By introducing state-of-the-art the scheduled date, members from engineering automation equipment, we are able to achieve vastly departments, quality assurance departments, and other improved productivity with high cost efficiency. departments met together daily for regular meetings and, somehow, we all managed to fulfill the plan without any delays. Also, as we were completely unfamiliar with this area, we reached out to the local residents and government to engage in real communication that helped us integrate the Ishikawa Plant into the community. The plant is situated within a rural environment, so any discoloration in our wastewater or change in a nearby spring would be immediately noticeable. This keeps us particularly attentive to the environmental aspects of the plant. Our primary goal is establishing mass production and supply stability. The idea from day one has been for the NCDK Komaki Plant, which is situated close to the head office in Nagoya, to serve as a research and development hub, while the NCDK Ishikawa Plant serves as a BCP (business continuity planning) and 27 production hub. We plan to more than double our expanding the size of our recruitment area, and even current production volume to overtake the Komaki Plant outsourcing some processes to contractors. in 2019, becoming the largest mass-production site for My hope is that, in time, we will be able to run the elements. plant with locally recruited personnel. We will choose 15 The biggest challenge we face in achieving this is members out of the initial hiring group and carefully train securing the necessary personnel. Thus far we have and equip them with the expertise to make ceramic been proceeding according to schedule; however, we electrode components as well as provide them with a will need to double our current number of employees if deep understanding about the manufacturing process. we are going to take the plant to full operation. We are Once they have this, we will work on training them as considering a number of options, including financially leaders who can steadily rise up through management. compensating employees who commute via the I can envision all of this taking about 10 years to expressway, providing support with accommodations, achieve. Talking with Key Team Members Ishikawa Plant Growing production capacity and reaching even higher levels of productivity I was assigned to the Ishikawa Plant when it was built countless other tasks within the short deadlines in July 2016. I have had a hand in everything from provided. starting up production equipment to overseeing mass Now I am helping with the additional investments production operations and handling quality-related that are being made into the plant. My current goal is to issues. From the planning phase to the design and enable the Ishikawa Plant to handle greater production selection of equipment, as well as contributing to volume and achieve even higher levels of productivity. decisions about machinery numbers and installation, By the time we begin our expanded production in I have an intimate knowledge of the entire Ishikawa January 2019, I want to see the same buildings Plant. housing even more equipment, which all run smoothly. As we are a fully integrated production plant for ceramic elements, my focus has been on tailoring the floor layout and production flow to optimize element production. For example, I have sought to increase productivity by taking three processes that have traditionally been distinct from one another and combining them into one. Start-up was a challenge due to the particularly tight time frame we had to work with. We had very little time from when the building went up until when we had to start manufacturing elements. All of the arrangements associated with the equipment and Element Engineering Group Ishikawa Team, facilities kept me racing against the clock as I hurried to Process Engineering Department, coordinate the installation of machinery and perform Sensor Division, NGK Insulators Kota Iwasawa Improving product quality through the work I do I grew up in Ishikawa, went to university in Ishikawa, and now I am employed at the Ishikawa Plant. I joined the company in the spring of 2017 and, since October, have been responsible for analysis operations. My job is to check product quality by examining cross-sections of element test products under a microscope. I use a digital microscope which allows me to enlarge and examine the internal structure of elements. Sometimes I also use an electron microscope. Through experience, I am learning more and more about this internal structure. I get a great sense of satisfaction from the fact that I am improving product quality through my work. I am keen to think up new analysis approaches Product Quality Management Group, Ishikawa Plant and, in time, handle the same quality control duties as Sensor Element Manufacturing Department, the senior analysts in my group.

Business in insulators was sluggish as a result of Japanese electric power companies reducing capital investment. With regard to NAS® battery business, 1.2-megawatt NAS batteries were delivered to Dubai to help in meeting the time-shift power consumption needs of large-scale solar power plants being constructed in the Middle East; however, due to a lull in construction activity, no other major shipments were made. In fiscal 2018, net sales are projected to be 56.0 billion yen with operating losses of 4.0 billion yen, meaning a continuation of deficits despite a slight increase in revenues compared with the previous period. For insulator business, demand within Japan is expected to continue its sluggish trend, while overseas demand in the Middle East and North America is expected to be slow as well. With regard to NAS battery business, while demand will increase mainly for users in Japan to meet the rapidly spreading adoption of renewable energy, the total number of shipments remains low and figures will remain in the red.

Up until now, thermal and nuclear power were the generation, transmission and distribution starts, the demand base load power sources; however, as part of the fight of insulator for transmission and distribution will be sluggish against global warming we are increasingly moving away for the time being. from coal-fired thermal power and shifting the base load For overseas markets, the continued stagnation in oil more towards natural gas and renewable energy. One of the prices is prolonging austerity measures in the Middle East, needs that is becoming more acute as a result of this while in North America investment is shifting towards IT transition is the need to shift the large amounts of solar measures and distribution area; thus, overall market power and other power generated during the day to the conditions are expected to remain harsh. peak consumption periods during the night. Energy storage Amidst all of this, in fiscal 2017 the NGK Group began systems like NAS batteries are essential to achieving this. restructuring North American business and scaling down the Insulators have been the foundation of NGK business for production system at the Komaki Plant, while in fiscal 2018 100 years, but NAS batteries will be what carries it through this scaling down will be extended to the Chita Plant, which the next 100 years. Although the immediate future looks will move to single-shift operation. Despite ongoing, positive difficult, we are pushing ahead towards the flood in demand results, such as securing OEM* status for some NGK that is coming. products aimed at the North American market, the market Another trend we are anticipating is the continued shift conditions are more severe than were anticipated, and towards “local production for local consumption” for supplemental initiatives are being discussed. electricity as communities seek to reduce the distribution In January 2018 we confirmed that, in some cases, costs, which comprise so much of their power production insulators and related products did not undergo appropriate and supply costs.

Each year, we verify the achievement status of each objective in an attempt to continuously improve these efforts. Process for Identifying Materiality In establishing the CSR promotion items that constitute an integral part of our core values and principles along with the Corporate Philosophy and the Guidelines for Corporate Behavior, we took social trends and needs into consideration and developed systems for information disclosure and promotion. In line with this policy, we will address the needs of the times appropriately, based on feedback from our stakeholders. CSR Promotion Framework To promote CSR activities, the NGK Group has established the CSR Committee, the Environmental Protection Committee, the Quality Committee, the Safety and Health Committee, and the Internal Controls Committee. In terms of legal and corporate ethics compliance activities, the CSR Committee discusses items necessary to assist decision-making by the president and CSR Committee chair. It also conducts a wide range of activities, including providing support in matters determined to potentially have a substantial impact on the company, reviewing and evaluating the promotion plans of each subcommittee, and deliberating CSR-related items, determined to be important by the Committee chair. CSR Committee Compliance Subcommittee Helpline Chair: Director and Senior Vice President Members: Executive Vice President, Group Executives, and other members appointed by the Committee chair Security Subcommittee Environmental Protection Committee Social Contribution Chair: Director and Senior Vice President Subcommittee President Quality Committee Chair: Director and Senior Vice President Safety and Health Committee Chair: Director and Senior Vice President Internal Controls Committee Chair: Director and Senior Vice President Position on SDGs The NGK Group is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, which advocates for independent action on the part of companies. We believe that addressing a broad range of social problems through our business activities, while measuring progress against indicators such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the UN, is an important corporate social responsibility. Human Rights Initiatives Having established respect for humanity in its Guidelines for Corporate Behavior, the NGK Group uses its intranet, which is available to all domestic Group company employees, to promulgate the United Nations “Universal Declaration of Human Rights” and “Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.” NGK also actively spreads awareness for protecting human rights by holding seminars on the subject. Procuring Resources and Raw Materials Responsibly The NGK Group conducts procurement activities that consider impacts on regional communities stemming from the use of raw materials (e.g. conflict minerals*) with the potential to cause social issues such as human rights violations and poverty, and takes steps to avoid using such materials when there is risk of adverse impact. *Minerals including tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold produced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries, and used as a source of funding for armed conflict in the area. 46 Preservation of the Global Environment NGK’s Core Policy on the Environment Recognizing that protecting the environment is a vital issue that all of humanity must face, the NGK Group formulated its Core Policy on the Environment in April 1996 based on Environmental Philosophy and Environmental Action Guidelines in order to bring its corporate activities into harmony with the environment. On the basis of this policy, the NGK Group works to reduce the environmental impact of business activities, and actively strives to help protect the environment by developing products and technologies to that end. Environmental Philosophy Given its corporate philosophy—“NGK products and technologies must create new value and contribute to the quality of life”—NGK will contribute to tackling environmental issues through its “Triple-E” business segments of ecology, electronics, and energy to create a comfortable environment for future generations.

Five-Year Environmental Action Plan The NGK Group has established the Fourth Five-Year Environmental Action Plan (2016–2020). To achieve the goals of the Plan, we are promoting environmental activities, setting annual targets. Outline of the Fourth Five-Year Environmental Action Plan (2016–2020) The NGK Group organizes environmental initiatives by creating five-year action plans. The Fourth Five-Year Environmental Action Plan, initiated in fiscal 2016, has been formulated to broadly encompass major global environmental challenges that businesses are expected to take, and to select two key issues each for two groups of themes, namely, priority themes and focus themes. The two priority themes are: environmental/social contribution through products; and reducing CO2 emissions and discarded materials. The first priority theme directly reflects the core concept of the corporate philosophy, while the other theme closely relates to NGK’s mediumto long-term initiative of New/Reformed Manufacturing Structures for increasing competitiveness. For focus themes, we have also set two issues: biodiversity conservation and water resource risk management/response, both being major challenges for which socially responsible corporate action is required with greater urgency. Mediumto long-term Socially important Corporate philosophy management strategies environmental issues NGK products and technologies Commitment to biodiversity conservation New/Reformed Manufacturing Structures (Involvement in the Aichi Targets) must create new value and (Creating resilient and efficient Commitment to water resource contribute to the quality of life. manufacturing sites) risk management Incorporated into the Fourth Five-Year Environmental Action Plan Priority theme Priority theme Focus theme Environmental/ Reducing CO2 Actions for social contribution emissions and biodiversity conservation through products discarded materials (Cutting energy and raw Actions for water (Development and distribution of products contributing to material costs) resource risk environmental protection) management 47 Five-Year Environmental Action Plan Progress Report The initiatives planned under the Fourth Action Plan and their progress (targets and results for fiscal 2017; targets for fiscal 2018 and 2020, the final year) are summarized in the table below. In fiscal 2017, the annual goals for nearly all of the cumulative quantitative goals were achieved, while progress on other items proceeded according to the plan established at the start of the period. In particular, the efforts undertaken by NGK’s business groups produced results for basic unit per net sales for discarded materials that significantly exceeded the annual goal. Progress on the current five-year plan is proceeding steadily at a pace above that anticipated at the time of the plan’s creation. Notably, the target reduction rate against BAU for CO2 and discarded materials was achieved ahead of schedule and was, therefore, adjusted upwards. For fiscal 2018, as well, the NGK Group is working in concert to undertake environmental activities that will enable target goals to be met.

In fiscal 2017, despite undertaking a number of activities which increased environmental load, such as bringing a new, large-scale factory on line overseas and beginning mass production of new products, the cumulative effect of reduction measures, as well as measures to minimize startup loss, enabled NGK to meet its annual goals. A new factory is being brought on line in Japan in fiscal 2018 as well, but initiatives are underway to ensure we do even better in hitting our Five-Year Action Plan goals.

Protecting Biodiversity In the NGK Group, we view the challenge of protecting biodiversity as an integral part of achieving a sustainable society, and towards that end we are undertaking the following activities. Activities for Achieving the Aichi Targets Aichi Targets NGK Activities The NGK Group has been pushing forward with activities Target Employee environmental education, next-generation Spread education, cooperation with suppliers, promoting pursuant to the Aichi Targets (international goals for １ awareness participation in My Action Declaration initiative biodiversity) agreed upon at the 10th Meeting of the Target Sustainable Expanding sales of products contributing to Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological production and environmental protection, CO2 reduction, effective use 4 consumption of resources, cooperation with suppliers Diversity (COP 10).

Red text shows NGK activities that started in fiscal 2016. Risk Management of Water Resources and Response Within the NGK Group, we perform water risk assessments for all of our production sites, as well as promote more efficient water usage according to independently established guidelines. With regard to water risk, we utilize public tools to carry out self-assessments at all production sites, and at sites where there are water shortage concerns, we bring in third parties to perform detailed analyses. Although no serious water-related risks have been identified to date at any of our facilities, we will continue to monitor the situation and stay abreast of regulatory trends to ensure stable operations in the future. 50 Coexistence with Society NGK Work Style Reforms In April 2017, we implemented a broad array of changes greater flexibility in their work style, such as being able within the NGK Group’s personnel system, including to choose to work from home in situations that would raising the mandatory retirement age to 65, increasing traditionally require an employee to take a leave from salaries for younger employees, and improving the work. By working to improve personnel systems and terms of employment for non-regular employees. productivity, we are providing support for our As we push ahead with global business expansion employees to build up their expertise and become and the introduction of new products and business, the independent professionals who are capable of roles and expectation on younger and mid-level succeeding globally. employees who play a central role will grow more than ever. Our aim is to provide employees with an environment that challenges and motivates them while allowing them to perform to their highest potential. At the same time, however, in order to maintain competitiveness by increasing the productivity of indirect departments, we have invited outside experts to come and perform business analysis for improving the efficiency of on-the-job time management. From the latter half of 2018 onward, we are promoting cloud service-based telecommuting and Vice President; General Manager, other initiatives. These initiatives provide employees with Human Resources Department Tadaaki Yamada Human Resource Development At NGK, people are our most precious management resource. With respect for employee motivation and ambition, we engage in the cultivation of human resources who will lead the next generation. In recent years, NGK has concentrated efforts on the enhancement of training to develop future leaders to take management positions as well as globally minded personnel to support our overseas business expansion. Systematized Personnel Development in Four Areas In fiscal 2017, we accompanied our reforms of the personnel system, such as raising the mandatory retirement age and promoting Management Manufacturing Global Business greater work-life balance, with programs aimed at fostering greater Training Training Training Skills Training employee motivation and activity. Specifically, we offered training to promote autonomous career design for older staff, career path lecture Career Education courses aimed at fostering greater diversity, and training in how to (Training conducted at specific milestones such as perform interviews with subordinates. when employees join the company or are promoted) Promoting Systematic Education through Nearly 120 Programs Using the major career milestones, such as joining the company or getting a promotion, as opportunities for career training, we have instituted and are systematically implementing such training in the four areas of “management training,” “manufacturing training,” “global training,” and “business skills training.” In addition to required job grade-specific training, we have introduced around 120 different types of programs that run during the year. Within the area of management training, examples of the programs we run are the “Management Basics” training seminar, which teaches employees about the essential aspects of management, and the “Career Design in Your 50s” training seminar, which promotes autonomous career design among older employees. Manufacturing training programs include those that fall under the category of worksite capability enhancement and supervisor training, as well as ongoing training programs aimed at equipping young employees with the basics of ceramics manufacturing, such as materials, molding, working, drying, and firing ceramics. Within the area of global training, in tandem with foreign language instruction, we instruct employees in understanding different cultures, in how to give effective presentations, in business skills related to international law and labor management, in health and safety management, and in compliance-related matters. In business skills training, we not only provide training in skills essential to the company’s needs, we provide a variety of growth opportunities that employees cannot experience in the course of their normal duties, such as opportunities for exchange and interaction with outside employees via training conducted in collaboration with other companies. 51 Quality Improvement Training for Number of Participants in Quality Manufacturing Improvement-Related Training in FY2017 In line with a younger workforce and an increase in Leader training for worksite capability enhancement 10 mid-career hires coming from a variety of backgrounds, it is necessary to create training programs that cover a variety of Leader training for worksite capability enhancement 7 needs. Given these conditions, we provide quality at the Ishikawa Plant improvement training for employees in manufacturing Follow-up training for worksite capability 144 divisions in five categories of content corresponding to job enhancement type and professional background.

In addition to the 13 employees already trained, the total Fiscal number of instructors reached 25. We held training to brush up skills of trained instructors. As of fiscal 2013, a total of 21 employees had participated in Fiscal 2014 instructor development training. To further enhance skills, improvement activity examples were shared and examples from all plants were collected to create in-house case studies. Employees who had completed in-house instructor development training served as lecturers. The contents of training Fiscal 2015 programs were formulated by the instructors in charge of each program, and they incorporated their worksite experiences as instructors. Using case studies, they taught things such as cost reduction methods. Fiscal 2016 The content of leader training for worksite capabilities was revised by the in-house instructors to enhance individual guidance. The revised textbooks were also shared with Group companies. The companies of the NGK Group collaborated together to invite outside instructors, conduct on-site training, and Fiscal 2017 offer opportunities for interaction and mutual learning amongst companies. We also began trialing instructor-led training overseas. 52 Coexistence with Society Diversity It is NGK Group’s basic policy to recruit human resources and offer stable employment and equal opportunities regardless of race, nationality, creed, gender, or physical abilities. Also, in an aim to promote autonomy and independence, NGK maintains the human resource systems necessary to provide employees with fair compensation commensurate with their degree of contribution to the company.

Regarding human rights issues, NGK strives to educate employees by distributing booklets on human rights on such occasions such as training for the recently promoted employees. A helpline is also available for consultation on these issues. Promoting the Success of Women The NGK Group strives to increase opportunities for motivated and skilled people to enhance their skills regardless of gender. We are also engaged in creating comfortable working environment for women. The number of female key personnel (management staff) of NGK in fiscal 2017 was 17. Establishment of a Career Consultation Helpdesk In March 2016 we established a career consultation helpdesk for female employees to discuss career-related concerns. At the helpdesk, certified career counselors provide support and consultation services to employees, while strictly observing confidentiality. Since May 2017, we have expanded the service to make it available not only to women but to all employees.

My room at the NGK International House has a big desk and is good for studying. When I get tired, I go out onto the balcony to get some air. Also, I love nature, so the sight of the forests and flowers makes me feel happy.” The speaker is Edwin Akandwanaho, a student from Uganda (right). He is studying road traffic at Nagoya University’s Graduate School of Environmental Studies. Alexia Fabiani is from Italy (left), and she is studying physics at Nagoya University’s School of Science. “It’s safe and quiet here, and all the residents are nice people. When you live on your own it’s hard to make friends, but that’s not the case here. I can meet friends easily.” On days off the international students gather in the common kitchen area and cook. “I make a lot of Italian food like pizza and pasta. But I’m a vegetarian, so I don’t use any eggs or meat.” The students often share what they cook with one another. NGK established the NGK Foundation for International Students in order to facilitate the cultivation of individuals who will contribute to the development of the international community. It is through the Foundation that NGK is helping to provide housing and scholarships to overseas students visiting Japan. The impetus for the Foundation’s establishment stems from gratitude for the warm community support and hospitality shown to NGK’s first employees and families posted overseas at the time of its initial overseas expansion. In addition to the individual rooms for the residents, the NGK International House has a dining area which can accommodate a large number of people, a study room which is freely accessible even at night, a hall which can be used for events, and Wi-Fi for the entire building. The International House provides a safe and secure living environment and optimal study environment for overseas students, as well as fosters interaction with the local community through language classes and intercultural events run by the students.

Systems are in place to ensure that accidents or problems, even at overseas plants, are reported to top management immediately, as well as to the Board of Directors. I view this as compliance-minded business operation. And yet an incident involving a delivery test discrepancy occurred recently. This unfortunately shows that a gap yet remains with regard to compliance-mindedness between top management and those on-site. Having said that, however, in a large organization, gaps in awareness are inevitable and preventing such incidents will Hiroyuki Kamano Outside Director require preventive systems be put in place in addition to awareness-raising efforts. In April 1971 Joins Ministry of Foreign Affairs the case of delivery tests, we are separating the inspection department from the April 1981 Becomes registered attorney business division; however, the construction of this sort of system is the October 1988 Becomes representative attorney of Kamano Sogo Law Offices responsibility of management. Also, I feel that improving the awareness gap that (present position) June 2007 Appointed as Outside Auditor of exists between management and those on-site will require further personnel Komatsu Ltd. exchange and interaction between business divisions within Japan and overseas. July 2007 Appointed as Outside Director of Sumitomo Life Insurance In addition, there are three lines of defense that are essential to ensuring strict Company April 2009 Appointed as Vice President of compliance within a company whose operation is becoming increasingly globalized. Tokyo Bar Association The first line is the compliance activities undertaken on-site; the second is the June 2011 Appointed as Director of NGK (present position) support system comprised of the legal department, finance department, quality June 2015 Appointed as Outside Auditor of House Foods Group Inc. (present control department, and other functional departments working together across position) borders; and the third is internal auditing performed by the auditing department. A single mistake in compliance can be all that is needed to upend the management of a company. If you are not strict about compliance, it will end up costing you a lot more than if you were. I believe the issue of how to efficiently maintain the three lines of defense while finding ways of further raising on-site awareness is a challenge for management to address and the Board of Directors to verify. Concentrating on robust communication and improved decision-making This is my seventh term as Outside Director, and over that time I have developed a strong understanding of NGK’s operations and business practices and have brought an outside viewpoint to meetings of the Board of Directors to ensure more robust discussion. Following every meeting of the Board of Directors, I talk with representatives from each division to hear their opinions as well as offer my own. The larger an organization becomes, the greater the need for internal and external communication. When the divisions and departments within a company do not communicate with one another about what challenges exist, how company policies are working, etc., they will become insular and cut off from one another. It is Toshio Nakamura Outside Director not uncommon to find that the seeds* of new business, as well as possibilities for April 1970 Joins Ministry of International Trade technologies that employees have, are to be found outside of a given business and Industry (now Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) division’s immediate domain. New awareness and perspectives gained from sharing June 1998 Appointed as Director for Policy experiences often leads to great leaps in business. I, too, endeavor to use the Coordination of Minister’s Secretariat June 2000 Appointed as Director-General of Small opportunity which the Board of Directors’ meeting affords me to pursue more robust and Medium Enterprise Agency November 2007 Appointed as President of Japan communication with those inside NGK. Chamber of Commerce and Industry, What is also important, from the standpoint of corporate administration, is paying and Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry attention to the discussions and decision-making that take place prior to big June 2011 Appointed as Director of NGK (present position) decisions, as this makes it possible to perform reviews and verification after the fact. *Technologies and know-how that can lead to the development of new business and products. 57 March 2016 Appointed as Chairman of National Association of Trade Promotion for By ensuring that the points of discussion, and the arguments made surrounding Small and Medium Enterprises those points, are recorded in a manner which allows them to be explained later, they (present position) May 2016 Appointed as Outside Director of Aoki can be reviewed to see whether something was forgotten or unanticipated or Super Co., Ltd. (present position) June 2016 Appointed as Outside Director of SMK whether the risk decisions made were appropriate. The results of this review can Corporation (present position) then be applied to the benefit of future decisions. Amidst increasing uncertainty about the future, performing reviews and verification after the fact is essential for improving the quality of decision-making, and within NGK and elsewhere people are becoming increasingly accountability-conscious. As for myself, I see my role as providing ongoing input and feedback to ensure the thoroughness of this process. Expectations for further growth in NGK technology New products are not created in a year or two. They are the cumulative result of many years of research trial and error. It is from that perspective that I am quite impressed with the achievement in this financial period of the Challenge 30 initiative, as well as the road map for steady roll-out of new products in the coming financial periods. Still, though, I feel that NGK’s material development strengths could be showcased even better. While it is good that NGK maintains a serious and professional corporate culture, I feel it still has challenges to overcome in terms of communicating its appeal. By making changes in how it communicates information, Emiko Hamada Outside Director in particular changing how it presents itself so as to increase outside interest, NGK April 1984 Joins Taiyo Yuden Co., Ltd. can facilitate more open innovation, through which the potential value of NGK December 2001 Appointed as General Manager, Quality Assurance Control R technology can surely be enhanced even further. At present, all of the innate Technology Division, Engineering Group, Taiyo Yuden potential of NGK’s technology is not being utilized. More proactive efforts to September 2003 Appointed as Chief Engineer, Basic communicate this information is needed. Research Division, General Research Laboratory, Engineering Group, Taiyo During Board of Director meetings and new product briefings, I make sure to Yuden draw on the B2C experience I have accumulated to allow me to steer discussion November 2008 Appointed as Associate Professor, Center for Social Contribution and around to what the appeal of a new product is from a customer’s perspective. I also Collaboration, Nagoya Institute of Technology (NITech) make a point of asking whether the components and technology of the product can April 2011 Appointed as Professor, Center for Social Contribution and be put to use in even broader applications that meet customer needs, and whether Collaboration, NITech, and Professor this can be developed into an entire business package rather than just parts supply. for Master of Techno-Business Administration, NITech Graduate All of this has an impact on the future of NGK’s business portfolio. NGK’s high School April 2012 Appointed as Professor, Center for profitability is due to a lack of competition and an extremely good market position. I Research on Assistive Technology for Building a New Community, NITech believe that action is needed for the future which will increase the range of products May 2015 Appointed as Third-Area Program NGK offers in order to build up its business portfolio, and I intend to keep having this Officer, A-STEP (Adaptable and Seamless Technology Transfer discussion with the Board of Directors.

Basic Policies Guidelines for corporate behavior and thorough observance of behavioral guidelines To ensure appropriate operations and transparent management, NGK has set its sights on establishing and maintaining an organization capable of swiftly responding to changes in the business environment, and a fair and open management system emphasizing the interests of shareholders. These components make up NGK’s basic approach to corporate governance. To put this approach into practice, NGK has chosen a corporate governance structure anchored by an Audit & Supervisory Board. In addition to the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors, and the Audit & Supervisory Board, NGK corporate governance includes the Executive Committee and several other committees established to assist the president in management decision-making. These bodies help to enhance governance efficacy by deliberating and reviewing important matters. In recognition of needs to execute swift and optimal decision making and respond promptly to changes in the operating environment, NGK introduced an executive officer system, thus separating the management decision-making and supervision functions from business execution functions, and clearly defining the responsibilities of both. Furthermore, to strengthen the supervision and monitoring functions of the Board of Directors, major committees among those tasked with mitigating the various risks surrounding NGK are obligated to report to the Board of Directors. NGK has also established a committee scheme, including a Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee, a Corporate Council, a Conference of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and a Business Ethics Committee to ensure the effectiveness of the Corporate Governance Code. Corporate governance enhancement Ongoing structural enhancements aimed at strengthening corporate governance include the introduction of an executive officer system and an outside director system to improve the management supervision and monitoring functions and facilitate recommendations with respect to overall management. Formulated Guidelines for Corporate April 1999 June 2010 Appointed independent directors Behavior Revised NGK Group Guidelines for Major revision to NGK Group Guidelines for April 2003 July 2011 Corporate Behavior Corporate Behavior Introduced an executive officer system April 2015 Signed on to UN Global Compact June 2005 Introduced a stock option June 2015 Established the Global Compliance Office Introduced an outside director system December Established committees for corporate July 2005 Established the CSR Committee 2015 governance April 2007 Established the CSR Office June 2017 Appointed one additional outside director 59 Corporate Governance Structure Scheme To ensure lawful business activities and management transparency, respond quickly to changes in the management environment, and create and maintain a fair management system from the shareholder’s perspective, NGK has created the following systems. NGK implements all of the individual principles of Corporate Governance Code. Authorization, supervision, election/dismissal, Report, proposal, presentation of agenda, Whistle-blowing, business execution delegation, audit, etc. findings, deliberation, recommendation, etc. consultation, etc. General Meeting of Shareholders Accounting Auditors Audit & Supervisory Board Board of Directors Opinion exchange/enhancement of information collection Nomination and Business Ethics Corporate Council Compensation Advisory Committee Conference of Outside Directors and Committee Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members Hearing convened by Audit & Supervisory Board Members and Outside Directors Outside lawyers Business execution functions President Executive Committee Outside lawyers Strategy Development Committee CSR Committee Internal contact Auditing Department Committee point Facilities Committee Internal Controls Committee Education Council, etc. Environmental Protection Helpline Hotline Committee, etc. Head Office, domestic/overseas group companies Business execution divisions Main Committees NGK has further strengthened and enhanced its corporate governance structures by establishing committees to bolster the supervision and monitoring functions of the Board of Directors. Board of Directors The Board of Directors, comprising 12 members, deliberates matters prescribed in the Companies Act, as well as other important management issues, providing oversight for the execution of duties by directors. The Board of Directors includes three outside directors to create a system enabling management monitoring based on professional knowledge and decision-making from a wider perspective. As of June 26, 2018, the current Board of Directors comprises 12 members (11 men and one woman). Audit & Supervisory Board The Audit & Supervisory Board consists of four members, each of whom attends Board of Directors meetings and conducts other activities to audit the execution of duties by directors. The Audit & Supervisory Board includes two external members, each possessing significant business experience and extensive insight. The Audit & Supervisory Board members, including these highly independent outside members, conduct audits on the execution of duties by directors, business operations, and the company’s financial position. Executive Committee Comprising the president, directors, Audit & Supervisory Board members, and executive officers and division heads designated by the president, this body deliberates the matters necessary to help the president with decision-making. As of June 26, 2018, the current Executive Committee comprises 16 members (15 men and one woman). 60 Corporate Governance Business Ethics Committee Comprised of outside directors and one internal director responsible for compliance, this committee monitors for fraud or illegalities involving senior management, as well as for compliance with the Competition Law and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and reports directly to the Board of Directors. As a mechanism to prevent fraud or legal violations, in addition to the Helpline, an internal reporting system (Hotline) linked directly to outside lawyers was established with the aim of strengthening NGK’s compliance structure. Corporate Council The meeting enables outside directors to exchange opinions with representative directors and others when proactive recommendations for senior management are sought from outside directors regarding various management-related issues. Conference of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members Comprised exclusively of outside directors, these meetings facilitate an exchange of opinions regarding NGK management issues, with the intent of proactively contributing to discussions at Board of Directors meetings. Hearing convened by Audit & Supervisory Board Members and Outside Directors Comprised of Audit & Supervisory Board members and outside directors, these hearings gather information from internal sources regarding the business environment and issues surrounding NGK. Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee Comprising a majority of outside directors, this committee attempts to ensure fairness and increase transparency related to determining the appointment and remuneration of board members and officers by deliberating matters related to the appointment and remuneration of board members and executive officers, Chief Executive Officer succession planning, and other matters, the results of which are reported to the Board of Directors. Internal Control Systems The Board of Directors and the executive bodies overseen by the president are responsible for establishing and operating NGK’s internal control system. The Auditing Department, a specialized internal audit body, is responsible for assessing the status of business execution at each operating division. Moreover, NGK has established the Internal Controls Committee to manage its reporting system for internal controls pursuant to Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The NGK Group Guidelines for Corporate Behavior were formulated as a policy embodying the Group’s corporate philosophy. These guidelines specify the Group’s fundamental stance with respect to business activities and corporate behavior. The CSR Committee, under which the Compliance Subcommittee, Security Subcommittee, and Social Contribution Subcommittee are organized, is responsible for a range of activities that include formulating NGK Group Guidelines for Corporate Behavior, ensuring compliance with laws, regulations and corporate ethics is fully entrenched throughout the Group, and developing responses to incidents and accidents which it believes could significantly impact the Company. The Committee’s actions are designed to maintain and improve the level of the Group’s internal control system. Please note that the “Resolution for the Development of Systems to Ensure the Appropriateness of Operations” was amended at a Board of Directors meeting held in March 2017. Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members NGK appoints individuals who possess outstanding achievements and a wealth of experience from a variety of industries to monitor director business execution in an attempt to realize stronger, more efficient management. Additionally, in terms of outside director independence, overall determinations are made with consideration for the Tokyo Stock Exchange “Guidelines for Listing” to avoid conflicts of interest with general shareholders. Our three outside directors are professionals able to make objective, rational decisions, while our two Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members provide opinions mainly from social and financial perspectives. 61 Activities of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members (fiscal 2017) Name Attendance at Board of Main activities Directors meetings Mr. Kamano provides opinions regarding compliance structure Attended 15 out of the 15 enhancement and management approaches for management Hiroyuki Kamano meetings held. planning, utilizing his substantial experience and specialization as an attorney.

In addition, each year lectures are held, targeting all directors and executive officers, related to compliance with the Competition Law, focused on the expanding scope of Competition Law enforcement and practical business risks. In addition, with regard to outside directors, we provide regular opportunities for the provision of individual explanations by personnel from relevant business divisions concerning mainly proposals presented to the Board of Directors meeting as well as information and exchange of opinions pertaining to business environment and related issues. 62 Corporate Governance Policies for Determining Remuneration of Directors With the aim of incentivizing the realization of NGK’s corporate philosophy and management policies, as well as to heighten the transparency, fairness, and clarity of their responsibilities, the remuneration of NGK directors is comprised of three components: (1) a position-based, fixed annual salary as basic remuneration, (2) a performance-based bonus to further clarify the fulfillment of responsibilities of each director, and (3) stock-related remuneration designed to boost motivation and morale toward enhancing corporate value over the mediumto long-term and increasing their sensitivity to NGK’s share prices. In terms of the ratio of fixed annual remuneration to variable remuneration, from the perspective of emphasizing performance over the mediumto long-term, NGK sets the performance-based variable remuneration at an appropriate level. The Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee comprising a majority of outside directors decides on policies for determining remuneration, proposals on the total amount of remuneration for directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members, and proposals on the amount of remuneration for individual directors and executive officers, the results of which are reported to the Board of Directors. Outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members receive only basic remuneration based on their supervision of management from an independent perspective and role as monitors.

The results were reported at the Board of Directors meeting, after an analysis and evaluation by an external organization. In addition, the secretariat of the Board of Directors conducted initiatives in fiscal 2017 to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. Such initiatives included interviewing directors and audit & supervisory board members individually, getting opinions on specific measures that can improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, and based on results of the interview, enriching discussions regarding themes related to long-term strategies. As a result, the Board of Directors was evaluated as effective, with its strength in how, under the leadership of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, each Director participates to conduct sound and transparent discussions while complying with governance requirements. We were evaluated by the external organization as having continued to retain this strength from the previous fiscal year. On the other hand, the following were raised as issues that needed to be further examined for their status or to be further discussed at Board of Directors meetings: a succession plan for the chief executive officer, cultivation of senior management, and understanding of risks for important, large-scale projects. Based on these results, NGK will work to continue to maintain and strengthen the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. Policy on Cross-Shareholdings NGK continuously holds shares of listed companies, which contribute to long-term business development, as cross-shareholdings, primarily in order to maintain and strengthen business relationships. NGK holds the shares of Morimura Group, which was established by the same founders of NGK, to enhance the brand value of the NGK Group. At its Board of Directors meeting, NGK determines the necessity of the continuous holding of shares as cross-shareholdings by regularly reviewing the significance of holding, stock prices, dividend yields, ratings, and so forth, and NGK gives specific explanations on the purpose and rationality of holding of shares as cross-shareholdings in its annual securities reports. 63 For voting rights pertaining to cross-shareholdings, NGK exercises voting rights focusing on factors including whether the content of proposals adversely affects the interest of shareholders and, from a mediumto long-term perspective, whether the investee company implements management that emphasizes the enhancement of corporate value and the interest of shareholders. Compliance and Risk Management Viewing compliance as the foundation of CSR, the NGK Group positions enhancing trustworthiness as the most important initiative and strives to create specific systems to inculcate this view among employees, prevent corruption, and comply with laws and regulations. In line with business expansion, the NGK Group is also engaged in minimizing risks related to globalization and diversification while augmenting our risk management structure. President Compliance Promotion Structure We established the Compliance Subcommittee under the CSR CSR Committee Committee to ensure strict observance of laws, regulations, and Chair: Director and Senior Vice President Members: Executive Vice President, corporate ethics within the Group.

Manager General Affairs Division Manager and Regulations Pertaining to Business Transactions Members: Members: Dept. managers Dept. managers In addition to mandating compliance with the Antimonopoly Act in the NGK Group Guidelines for Corporate Behavior, we have Helpline established Competition Laws Compliance Rules, set forth to comply with international standards, which are strictly enforced by All departments Group companies NGK both in Japan and its overseas locations. We have established these policies and procedures in order to eradicate unfair business practices and maintain fair and equitable business relationships with our business partners. We also provide education and training aimed at ensuring widespread awareness and thorough compliance with the Competition Laws Compliance Rules and the Competition Laws Compliance Handbook. Furthermore, since fiscal 2015, we have contracted PwC Advisory LLC (renamed from Pricewaterhouse Coopers Co., Ltd. in March 2016) as our independent compliance professional to annually review the implementation status of the NGK Group’s Competition Law compliance program per the Competition Law Compliance Rules as well as assessing the overall oversight and reporting structures in place for NGK Group companies, both in Japan and overseas locations. On top of this, starting in fiscal 2017, PwC has also conducted interviews with the directors overseeing NGK’s various business groups to assess the tone of each director’s approach toward competition law compliance as well as to further enhance their awareness of these efforts. The results of these reviews are being leveraged for a variety of purposes, such as improving the Competition Law compliance program. Anti-Corruption Activities In order to ensure compliance with anti-bribery laws as well as ethical standards for business conduct, we have instituted anti-bribery rules for dealing with foreign public officials. Moreover, we have also progressively enacted the same sort of anti-bribery rules at all of our overseas group companies, and in fiscal 2017, our Auditing Department performed a review of overseas money transfers and entertainment expenses. Import and Export Control As part of its full compliance efforts, NGK is engaged in strictly observing laws and regulations related to import and export control. NGK establishes the observance of security export control-related regulations as part of Behavioral Guidelines within the NGK Group Guidelines for Corporate Behavior, and makes sure to control import and export operations by training its employees based on internal rules and the Export/Import Handbook. Risk Management System Risk Analysis and Response There are six types of risk which are viewed as common to all companies within the NGK Group, including compliance, information, and employment/labor. We make an effort to avoid and prevent these risks through deliberation of budgets and plans and overall examination and analysis in the course of execution and settlement processes at Strategy Committee and Executive Committee meetings. Business continuity planning (BCP) was formulated to ensure the continuation of critical business functions in the event of large-scale natural disasters including wind and flood damage and earthquakes, massive transportation accidents or other emergency situations, which will be addressed by the Central Disaster Prevention and Control Headquarters and BCP Countermeasures Headquarters. Refer to the NGK Sustainability Data Book 2018 https://www.ngk-insulators.com/en/sustainability/booklet.html for risks related to business and other matters. 64 Corporate Governance Business Continuity Planning (BCP) Initiatives The NGK Group is developing company-wide business continuity planning (BCP) through the establishment of the BCP Headquarters, an organization for leading business continuity and quick recovery in the event of a large-scale natural disaster, led by the President. Countermeasure initiatives include the establishment of multiple manufacturing bases and procurement sources, damage mitigation measures related to buildings and equipment, and employee safety assurance. We conduct emergency drills assuming a natural disaster as a field exercise of the BCP. In the drill, participants are instructed to take real actions faithfully according to the plan, through which we identify in detail issues related to each process and procedure and use the findings to improve the BCP. Information Security Structure The NGK Group CSR Committee’s Security Subcommittee takes responsibility for supervising overall information security, and supports the General Affairs and Information Systems divisions based on the Basic NGK Group Information Security Policy, in an attempt to properly manage and operate information assets. Every year, personnel of NGK’s Information Technology Department visit several Group companies to conduct on-site checks and provide guidance on their implementation of IT security measures. Privacy Policy and Structure The NGK Group has established internal rules for privacy policy management in an effort to handle, manage, and protect personal information provided by customers. In fiscal 2015, NGK formulated and made public our Basic Policy on Specific Personal Information in response to the enforcement of the Act on the Use of Numbers to Identify a Specific Individual in Administrative Procedures. Moreover, our policies are fully compliant with the revised Act on the Protection of Personal Information, which came into effect on May 30, 2017. As for Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect on May 25, 2018, NGK’s affiliated companies in Europe have formulated internal rules in response. Protection of personal information Basic policy on specific personal information (Japanese) Reference URL https://www.ngk-insulators.com/en/utpolicy/ https://www.ngk.co.jp/mynumber/ Whistle-Blowing System Helpline We have established a helpline to receive inquiries and reports from employees aimed at curtailing and preventing activities contrary to the spirit of the NGK Group Guidelines for Corporate Behavior and to facilitate the quick resolution when issues occur.

Among overseas economies, developed economies, such as the U.S. and Europe, continued on a moderate recovery, and China and emerging countries were also robust with a sign of pick up. The NGK Group saw sluggish shipments of both insulators and NAS® (sodium-sulfur) batteries in the Power Business Segment. In the Ceramics Business Segment, the volume of automotive ceramics increased mainly due to an increase in sales of trucks in the Chinese market and tighter emissions regulations in Europe. In the Electronics Business Segment, whereas the quantity of ceramic packages for mobile phone base stations in China fell, the quantities of beryllium copper products and components for semiconductor manufacturing equipment rose. As a result of the above, the total consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended March 2018 increased by 12.4% year on year to ¥451,125 million. In terms of earnings, despite increases in costs for depreciation, research and development, etc., operating income increased by 10.8% year on year to ¥70,027 million and ordinary income increased by 9.4% to ¥70,615 million as a result of increased consolidated net sales and a weaker yen, etc. With respects to extraordinary income and loss, while posting impairment loss totaling ¥3,769 million and a ¥2,146 million provision for loss related to competition law under extraordinary loss, a gain on sale of investment securities of ¥1,286 million was recorded as extraordinary income. In addition to them, in the previous period (the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017), ¥11,213 million was posted for income taxes for prior periods. As a result of the above, profit attributable to owners of parent increased by 25.9% to total ¥45,814 million.

Although demand for power distribution equipment contracted in light of domestic electric power companies reducing capital investments mainly to cope with sluggish demand for electricity, shipments for China and the Middle East increased. As a result, sales of insulators increased. Sales of NAS® batteries were sluggish due to a lack of large shipments. In terms of earnings, operating income recovered from a loss of ¥6,622 million in the previous fiscal year to a loss of ¥4,715 million. Ceramics Business Net sales of the Ceramics Business Segment increased by 9.2% year on year to ¥267,830 million. Sales volumes of automobile ceramics, such as ceramic substrates for catalytic conversion (large-size HONEYCERAM), rose due to an increase in truck sales in the Chinese market. In addition, the quantity of sensors increased as the number of applied units per vehicle grew, accompanying tighter emissions regulations in Europe and China. Revenues from industrial process apparatuses, especially industrial heating systems, were up due to increasing capital investments related to automotive lithium-ion batteries by Chinese customers. In terms of operating income, although volumes of automotive ceramics and industrial process apparatus rose, costs for launching equipment for production expansion increased in addition to increases in depreciation and development costs. As a result, operating income fell by 10.1% year on year to ¥58,086 million. Electronics Business Net sales of the Electronics Business Segment increased by 24.6% year on year to ¥128,955 million. Sales volumes of components for semiconductor manufacturing equipment grew as capital investments of semiconductor manufacturers remained high in response to the trend toward multi-layering and microfabrication of semiconductors. The shipments of metals, such as beryllium copper products, rose primarily for industrial equipment in the Chinese market. The sales volumes of electronic components, such as composite wafers and piezoceramic actuators for HDD, increased whereas demand for ceramic packages declined. Soshin Electric Co., Ltd., our consolidated subsidiary, marked sales growth due to vibrant demand for components for industrial equipment. Operating income surged by 217.2% year on year to ¥16,656 million primarily due to a sales increase in components for semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

Current assets increased by 7.8% from the previous fiscal year-end to ¥472,473 million, mainly reflecting increases in cash and bank deposits, notes and accounts receivable trade, and inventories, etc., despite a decrease in securities. Non-current assets increased by 13.3% from the previous fiscal year-end to ¥363,862 million, mainly due to an increase in tangible assets. Current liabilities decreased by 1.2% from the previous fiscal year-end to ¥126,906 million. This was mainly due to decreases in provision for loss related to competition law and income taxes payable. Long-term liabilities increased by 16.3% from the previous fiscal year-end to ¥236,566 million, mainly due to increases in long-term borrowings and issuance of bonds payable. Total net assets stood at ¥472,863 million, up 10.6% year on year, due to increases in retained earnings and foreign currency translation adjustments. As a result, the ratio of net worth to total assets as of March 31, 2018 was 55.1% (compared with 54.9% at the previous fiscal year-end), with net worth per share standing at ¥1,432.67, up ¥137.01 from the previous fiscal year-end.

This reflected ¥50,554 million in net cash provided by operating activities, ¥49,414 million in net cash used in investing activities, and ¥22,546 million in net cash provided by financing activities. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was total ¥50,554 million. This was mainly attributable to posting an income before income taxes and non-controlling interests of ¥65,772 million and depreciation and amortization, despite cash outflows mainly due to increases in income taxes paid, inventories, and notes and account receivable trade. In comparison with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by ¥29,618 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was total ¥49,414 million. This was mainly due to purchases of property, plant and equipment, and marketable securities, despite cash inflows due to proceeds from sales and redemption of marketable securities. In comparison with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities decreased by ¥7,039 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was total ¥22,546 million. This was mainly due to proceeds from long-term borrowings and issuance of bonds payable, despite cash outflows due to cash dividends paid and repayment of long-term borrowings. In comparison with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by financing activities increased by ¥35,559 million. 69 (100 million yen) 2014/3 2015/3 2016/3 2017/3 2018/3 Cash flows from operating activities 326 730 594 802 506 Cash flows from investing activities (212) (395) (478) (565) (494) Cash flows from financing activities 20 (260) (4) (130) 225 Cash and cash equivalents 1,198 1,286 1,361 1,447 1,699 Capital Investment Overview For the current consolidated accounting year, capital investment for the NGK Group totals ¥71,714 million. For Power Business, ¥3,566 million in capital investment is being spent primarily on insulator production facility upgrades. For Ceramics Business, ¥46,038 million in capital investment is being spent primarily on production facilities for automotive-related ceramic products. For Electronics Business, ¥16,137 million in capital investment is being spent primarily on production facilities for semiconductor manufacturing equipment-related products. For Headquarters, ¥5,973 million in capital investment is being spent primarily on equipment and facility upgrades and new business equipment and facilities. Basic Policy for Profit Sharing and Dividends for the Current and Next Fiscal Years NGK views the return of profits to shareholders as one of its most important management policies. As a basic policy, we strive for shareholder-oriented management that emphasizes return on equity (ROE), and distribute the benefits of successful management with a medium-term target consolidated payout ratio of approximately 30% after consideration of a comprehensive range of factors, including business performance, financial position, and future business development. NGK paid a year-end dividend of ¥23 per share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This and the interim dividend of ¥21, which had already been paid, brought the total annual dividend per share to ¥44. Taking forecast of increases both in sales and earnings into consideration, NGK expects to raise both of the interim and the fiscal year-end dividend per share to ¥25 respectively for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. The total annual dividend per share will result in ¥50. Meanwhile, NGK plans to utilize retained funds primarily to extend its existing core business and capital investments in new business projects, with a view to enhancing its corporate value. 2014/3

I admire the fact that it has been able to consistently fulfill society’s expectations for stable production, all while continuing to grow over so many years. I specialize in CSR research, which looks at the various management systems that underlie corporate sustainability, and it is from that perspective that I read the NGK Report 2018. Based on this, I would like to discuss the CSR operational strengths and challenges of the NGK Group. The first area to consider is corporate governance. Although NGK has an Audit & Supervisory Board, it also has a Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee that has a majority membership comprised of outside directors and where executive personnel and Professor, Ph. D. in Law (LL.D.), Graduate School and Faculty individual compensation matters are discussed outside of the Board of Directors. Also, of Safety Science, Kansai University; Executive Director of Japan Society directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members are given a survey, which is used in for Business Ethics; Senior Researcher of Business Ethics evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. These factors ensure free and open Research Center discussion takes place among the Board of Directors. In addition to all of this, hearings are Mr. Kazuhiko Takano convened by Audit & Supervisory Board members and outside directors in order to glean information from relevant people within the company, a hotline has been established to receive information about unethical or illegal behavior involving company executives, and a Business Ethics Committee is in place to oversee its operation. All of this and more contributes to outstanding corporate governance, which is more robust than any other leading company. The second area to look at is compliance and risk management systems. The NGK Group is truly a global enterprise, with an overseas sales ratio of 72.6%, and as such, faces major risks from various competition and anti-corruption laws and regulations, which are applied extraterritorially and which stipulate large fines and punishments. The NGK Group thus operates a PDCA cycle that involves the Compliance Subcommittee underneath its CSR Committee drawing up various rules and regulations based on the NGK Group Guidelines for Corporate Behavior, and these are then taught to employees, monitored, and revised as needed. Also, with regard to major risks, the Group as a whole has formulated business continuity planning (BCP) and conducts regular operational training. The compliance and risk management systems in place are very thorough, and I feel that the incorporation of a PDCA cycle keeps these systems within a positive feedback loop. The third area to look at is communication with employees. When employees are kept aware of important issues and a healthy and transparent corporate culture is fostered, I believe companies can handle any risks which might arise. The NGK Group carries out an extremely diverse range of employee training, with compliance training being particularly emphasized. In addition, the Group undertakes serious efforts to foster a healthy and transparent corporate culture through such initiatives as CSR Talk Live, where top management and employees are able to engage in direct dialogue with one another. The fourth area to consider is social contribution activities. Here, special attention needs to be given to the NGK International House and scholarship fund which, for many years, have helped enable students from around the world to come and study in Japan. This demonstrates strong human concern and generates significant goodwill. The NGK Group does have challenging areas, however, where more work is needed, as is made evident by an incident in January 2018, which involved a delivery test discrepancy. I would like to see NGK use this as an opportunity to improve its management systems and structures even further. While this of course will involve quality-related challenges, there are other areas where further improvements should be expected, including compliance with overseas laws and regulations like the EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) that will need to be addressed as the NGK Group expands further overseas, and response preparations for massive compound disasters that will accompany projected megathrust Tokai earthquakes and Nankai Trough earthquakes. If it maintains steady improvement of its compliance and risk management systems, I believe this will help the NGK Group continue its growth for the next 100 years. 78 External Evaluation In September 2017, NGK was selected for the second consecutive year for the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, a major index for socially responsible investment.
