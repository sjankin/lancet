O U R S T O R Y S O FA R . . . Our journey began in the early 1970s when Graham ‘Skroo’ Turner and his friend Geoff ‘Spy’ Lomas created Top Deck from very basic building blocks – a sense of adventure, an eye on a growing business opportunity, and one double decker bus they called ‘Argus’. The number of buses kept on increasing and by the early 80’s Skroo returned to Australia as the Top Deck Travel director. Then the first Flight Centre shop opened in Sydney in 1982 and the business rocketed in the mid 1990s, with Flight Centre Limited (now Flight Centre Travel Group – FCTG) listing on the Australian Securities Exchange in December 1995, the first travel agency group to do so. By this stage, the cornerstones of the company’s future success were in place; a successful business model, and ten core philosophies that OUR CORE VALUES helped shape a global travel group that today is worth over $20 billion with a family in excess of 20,000 people globally.
