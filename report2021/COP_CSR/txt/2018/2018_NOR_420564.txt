Even though the minimum age requirement may be two, four and six years, respectively, the average age is usually much higher. An XO cognac may have elements that go 20-30 years back, or even longer. Cognac is actually a highly versatile drink. If you go to Cognac in France in the summer, you would probably be served a cognac with tonic – neat – or garnished with ginger, lime and/or a slice of cucumber. The youngest qualities are best in cocktails, and an extra special drink is a couple of centilitres of cognac topped with champagne. Enjoy! VS = Very Special: The youngest element must have matured for at least two years. VSOP = Very Superior Old Pale: The youngest element must have matured for at least four years. XO = Extra Old: The youngest element must have matured for at least six years. For XO, the producers have decided that as from 2018 the youngest age must increase to at least ten years.

Choosing Responsible alcohol consumption ­environmentally-­smart packaging means choosing products with a small CO2 Good energy economy Bag-in-Box is environmentally smart footprint. The less the packaging weighs, the less energy transport will require. Glass production also requires a lot more energy. At both Systembolaget and Vinmonopolet the “environmentally-smart packaging” label can be picked out. All products with packaging ­weighing less than 450 grammes are defined as environmentally-smart. This makes it easy to pick a green solution. Bag-in-box wine, bottled at Arcus in Norway, has two clear advantages to reduce the CO2 footprint: 1. Wine is shipped from foreign producers in 25,000-litre tanks, before bottling at Arcus. This eliminates unnecessary ­packaging. 2. The wine is bottled in environmentally-smart, lightweight packaging. Bag-in-box packaging requires little energy for production and for recirculation. The bottled products’ short route to the consumer has a third advantage: the wine stays fresh, which safeguards the good taste.

Foreign currency risk In view of the company’s international activities, there is some exposure to foreign currency risk. As a general rule, currency is purchased in the spot market, but also to some extent in the forward market, in order to continuously offset net cash positions. The accounting treatment of financial derivatives is ­described under “Accounting policies”. The company makes some purchases in foreign currency (mainly EUR), while the functional currency is NOK.
