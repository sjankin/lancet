During 2017, we trained 1,000 entrepreneur ready to invest in technology and equipment. retailers (700 women and 300 men) from different regions in Quito and Guayaquil in areas such as finance, sales and customer This training with curricular value was approved by different service, business organization and presentation, and community universities and is imparted according to the customer’s level action work. Also, we carried out the “Reemprende” program, of development (new, in development or developed). It includes 2,584 clients (1,940 women and 644 men). topics such as business management and the use of new sales tools and techniques, to help customers to respond better to the BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT SCHOOL IN PERU market demands and increase their sales. Since 2008, the Business Development School has given marketing and finance workshops to our retail customers We offer continuous training across the seven Mexican regions in Peru. The objective of the program is to establish longwhere we operate, because our customers rate this program as term relationships and develop our product portfolio in their the most practical and efficient they have attended. businesses.

In order to improve our efficiency in the use of water, we have implemented several initiatives and projects at our operation centers: implementing new technologies, offering training to our associates, recovering water across the industrial processes, eliminating leaks, creating water-saving committees, and communicating a culture of continuous improvement, among others. In 2017 we consumed 1.68 liters of water per liter of beverage produced, which translates into a reduction of more 100% than 16.7% with respect to the 2010 baseline.

STRATEGY FOR ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE [201-2] As well as having various goals that contribute to climate change mitigation, our Human Capital and Sustainability Committee has designed a strategy to adapt our operations to the changes we are already experiencing. For example, we have identified regions where the effects of climate change represent a significant risk from water shortage, and have begun to prepare scenarios for adapting our operations in those regions, taking into consideration not only production activities but also the local communities. Our evaluations have identified a plant that is particularly vulnerable to the physical effects of climate change and we are currently designing a plan that will enable us to react in the face of extreme natural events and help affected local communities.

Economia y Compromiso Empresarial (ECOCE), a non-profit organization, is one of our allies in reducing our waste footprint and disseminating the importance of recycling in the communities around our operating centers in Mexico. During the 2016-2017 school year, ECOCE implemented the Eco Challenge Program in 1,964 schools in 16 different cities in our territories. With a participation of more than 470 thousand students, it collected 1,570 tons of PET, 124 tons of HDPE and more than nine tons of aluminum. IPASA recycles HDPE to produce soft-drink cases for Coca-Cola, thus contributing to our circular economy strategy. RECYCLING CULTURE In order to support our efforts to create a culture of proper waste disposal and recycling, ECOCE has installed containers in our offices and main operating centers so that our associates and visitors can dispose of their bottles correctly and expand the recycling culture inside and outside the organization. Waste containers were also donated to Universidad Católica de Salta (UCASAL) in Argentina, in order to facilitate and promote solid waste separation. Pioneering in the Coca-Cola System worldwide, the Ciel bottle is now made entirely out of food grade recycled PET, as are the Sprite and Sangría Topo Chico bottles.

A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L 57 HUMAN RIGHTS OVERSIGHT Our Code of Ethics stipulates that all company associates are obliged to consistently and comprehensively respect the Human Rights of those with whom they come into contact. It makes it quite clear that we must never discriminate on the basis of age, gender, marital status, nationality, political affiliation, or religious beliefs and traditions. ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORTS As part of our fight against corruption, our new Code of Ethics clearly stipulates that “associates, directors and shareholders are strictly forbidden from carrying out acts of corruption, bribery, collusion and, in general, any illicit activity during the performance of their duties, and will abstain from participating directly or indirectly in any bids or tenders in which there are signs of corruption. These guidelines extend to our business partners (suppliers and intermediaries) and their activities.” In 2014, we set up our Supplier Portal, where suppliers wishing to register in our system in order to offer their services must read and agree to comply with and respect our Code of Ethics. As a result, 100% of our suppliers are aware of, and committed to supporting, our efforts to act against corruption and bribery.
