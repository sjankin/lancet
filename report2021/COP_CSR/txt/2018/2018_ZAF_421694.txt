Woolworths, in partnership with ‘Style by SA’ local fashion designers Rich Mnisi, Thebe Magugu, Selfi, and AKJP, used SA Fashion week in October 2017 to showcase a capsule collection made from Better Cotton. The cotton, sourced from the SADC region and dyed with processes that use only eco-friendly chemicals, was transformed into a range of fashion items aligned with key seasonal trends. Alongside this, Woolworths created an immersive installation featuring sustainably sourced cotton sheeting which was donated to The Clothing Bank, an organisation that Woolworths supports, which helps empower unemployed South African women.

Suppliers are ranked according to their performance with a Red, Bronze, Silver or Gold Rating.

WHL and its suppliers are no exception – relying on a constant supply of clean water to produce the goods we sell. As a southern hemisphere retailer, we operate in some of the most water-stressed regions on earth, and are acutely aware of the risks we face from short-term drought and long-term climate change. The threat of a ‘Day Zero’ in Cape Town has only served to remind us of this. 95 An overarching component of our overall Good Business Journey strategy, water influences every operational WATER STEWARDSHIP IN OUR COMMUNITIES aspect of our business right from the drinking and cleaning water used in our own stores to the water used to grow the cotton in our t-shirts. Beyond this, we continue to have a strong focus on water use efficiency in agriculture by virtue of the fact that agriculture uses approximately 60% of water resources in South Africa. We also continue to look deeper into how we can contribute to the resilience of others, including our suppliers and communities through collective action initiatives and by promoting sustainable production methods. Collaboration with suppliers and key strategic partners such as WWF-South Africa, the National Business Initiative and the United Nations CEO Water Mandate remains crucial. 96 See our water position statement PUBLIC POLICY ALIGNMENT AND TRANSPARENCY M A N AG I N G P E O P LE A N D SOCIAL H E A LTH A N D ETH I C A L S U STA I N A B LE WA STE WATE R E N E RGY A N D S U STA I N A B I LIT Y TR A N S FO R M ATI O N D E V E LO PM E NT W E LLN E S S S O U RC I N G FA R M I N G C LI M ATE C H A N G E The Woolworths Educational Programme has, over the last four years, presented over reaching more than and in 4 500 water conservation lessons 190K learners 1 559 educators 410 primary schools R1.5M committed towards water conservation 54% relative water in under-resourced schools reduction in SA Stores WATER SUMMARY LOVEH2O fund launched 530 MILLION LITRES of freshwater have been replenished through Woolworths 89% 100% real-time water monitoring of Woolworths internal buying Alien Clearing partnership with WWF-SA across all SA stores and technical teams through basic and advanced water training WHL 89 / 2018 GOOD BUSINESS JOURNEY REPORT 2018 GOOD BUSINESS JOURNEY REPORT / WHL 90 M A N AG I N G P E O P LE A N D SOCIAL H E A LTH A N D ETH I C A L S U STA I N A B LE WA STE WATE R E N E RGY A N D S U STA I N A B I LIT Y TR A N S FO R M ATI O N D E V E LO PM E NT W E LLN E S S S O U RC I N G FA R M I N G C LI M ATE C H A N G E WATER CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY O U R OWN O PE R ATI O N S C A S E ST U DY We continue to drive new innovations across our real estate, including water-efficient design, rainwater CAS E STU DY: DAY ZE RO harvesting and use of alternate water supplies such as I N CAPE TOWN groundwater across our operations.

Demonstrating initiative in environmental leadership, this is an industry first in South Africa for a distribution centre. With a total area of 33 920 m2, warehouse lighting is the biggest consumer of energy for the distribution centre. The centre runs on 300 kWh of photovoltaic solar power, which provides 500 MWh of energy annually. In addition to this, highly efficient LED lights with intelligent digital lighting system “DALI” (Digital Addressable Lighting Interface) controls were installed. More than 5 000 m2³ of building rubble from demolition was recycled on site, diverted from landfill and used as base layers for the warehouse floor. With water efficiency a topical issue in the Western Cape, a focus on water-wise indigenous coastal fynbos vegetation and landscaping around the distribution centre was important. Other water saving features include the retention of topsoil for reuse, as well as storm water attenuation on site to minimise run-off. LO O KI N G FO RWARD In 2013, we installed the first closed door refrigeration at our Palymra food store as a trial. In the first three months of the trial, energy usage in the store decreased by 27%. The success of this has enabled us to build the business case to expand this innovation to help us save more energy. We will be rolling out closed door refrigeration to an additional 22 food stores.
