We will continue to work to realize fast-paced management from the frontlines of business, and create and expand of “clusters of revenue-generating businesses.” Since its founding, Sojitz has never ceased to pursue new challenges and further growth, while learning from the past. In recent years, we have worked to create businesses with stable revenue, or “clusters of revenue-generating businesses” by constructing earnings foundations with market resilience—a challenge faced by trading companies—and implementing a nine-division framework in April, 2015 to achieve value creation more swiftly. We have also achieved greater speed in management decisions made at the front lines of the business, which has increased our earnings capacity, and allowed us to establish an unprecedented strong earnings foundation over the course of the previous medium-term management plan. Sojitz announced its “Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 ~Commitment to Growth~” in May 2018 with the aim of accumulating greater clusters of revenue-generating business. We plan to build on our past initiatives to expand Sojitz’s earnings capacity to achieve stable growth, and focus on new challenges aimed at further development. This approach is expressed in the plan’s subtitle, “Commitment to Growth.” Continuing to take on new challenges is integral to the Sojitz spirit. In doing so, we seek to maximize our two types of value—“value for Sojitz” and “value for society”—to realize sustainable growth and create a more prosperous society.  August, 2018 Masayoshi Fujimoto Representative Director, President and CEO Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 1 Who We Are Aiming to Maximize “Two Types of Value” Sojitz Group Statement The Sojitz Group creates value and prosperity by connecting the world with a spirit of integrity.

What is your assessment of Sojitz’s Q corporate governance framework? Drawing on our experiences of A guiding the Company through a difficult time, I am confident that we now have a solid framework that meets all the necessary benchmarks. It has now been 15 years since the establishment of Sojitz. At the time of the merger, both Nichimen and Nissho Iwai were suffering from a difficult business environment. Looking back, I consider the original cause to be the lack of stringent risk management and systems to support the management structure, as well as an excessive focus on P/L-based management. In other words, we acknowledge that one of the factors was insufficient governance with regards to execution. Our companies ultimately could not cope with changes in the business environment, and we were forced to suffer monetary losses greater than what we could bear. Our understanding of the crisis led us board members at the time to devote ourselves to setting up a system for governance that met necessary benchmarks and secured a certain level of effectiveness from the start. We invited Outside Directors to join us early on in order to bring new life into the Board of Directors and ensure Company rules were strictly applied. In the time since they joined the Board, I truly feel that the Company’s direction has been decided by lively debate between its members, with the Outside Directors helping us to realize more wide-ranging discussion. Nowadays, we often see even globally successful enterprises sapped of their corporate value due to slip-ups in governance; thinking about the kind of corporate governance we need today, I believe that it is important we figure out how to cascade a governance mindset throughout the Group. As Sojitz continues to actively involve itself in investments and loans in pursuit of further growth as a corporate group, it is vital we enhance transparency across the entire Sojitz Group. I hope we can meet society’s demand for transparency by further deepening the mutual exchange of information and bidirectional discussion between the Sojitz head office and Group companies.

Since Sojitz’s founding, we have not had a system to offer bonuses to officers. Without systems for rewarding good work, however, it can be difficult to motivate people. Furthermore, our Outside Directors had often pointed out that from the perspective of shareholders, we really should have a performance-linked compensation system. Recognizing the need for change, we thus implemented a new compensation system alongside the launch of MTP 2020. This will help to enhance corporate value by enabling management which better reflects the same perspectives and sensibilities held by our shareholders. Specifically, this means we have added bonuses and share remuneration on a per-year basis into officers’ regular monetary compensation. I believe that with this, we have been able to construct a highly transparent compensation system for corporate officers, which will increase our mediumto longterm corporate value.

Basic Policy on Dividends As a basic policy, Sojitz’s top management priorities include paying stable dividends on an ongoing basis while enhancing competitiveness and shareholder value by increasing internal capital reserves and using them effectively. Under this policy, the consolidated payout ratio during the Medium-Term Management Plan 2017 will be approximately 25%. Sojitz decided to pay a year-end cash dividend as follows after comprehensively considering factors including results for the fiscal year and total equity. As a result, the consolidated payout based on profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) was 24.2%. Year-end cash dividends paid totaled ¥7,505 million. Including the interim dividend of ¥6.00 per share paid on December 1, 2017, cash dividends per share for the year ended March 31, 2018 totaled ¥11.00 per share, and dividends paid totaled ¥13,760 million. The effective date of dividends from surplus was June 20, 2018. Under the newly anounced Medium-Term Management Plan 2020, Sojitz will target a consolidated payout ratio of 30% in accordance with the aforementioned basic policy. Sojitz’s Articles of Incorporation permit the payment of interim cash dividends by resolution of the Board of Directors as stipulated by Article 454, Paragraph 5 of the Companies Act of Japan. As a result, Sojitz’s basic policy is to pay dividends twice annually, with the interim dividend being approved by resolution of the Board of Directors and the year-end dividend being approved by the Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting.

Material carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to cash-generating unit groups were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2017 2018 2018 Chemicals Parent company’s chemical business ���������������������������������������������������������������������� 7,460 7,460 70,377 Consumer Lifestyle Business Domestic subsidiaries’ food sales business ������������������������������������������������������������� 8,090 8,090 76,320 The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated was calculated based on its value in use founded on the five-year forecast that was approved by management. The five-year forecast of cash flows is based on budgets reflecting past performance. In addition, the main assumption used to determine such forecast was the growth rate of gross profits through such terms, such growth rate being consistent with the forecasts of the nominal GDP growth rate or the like of the countries in which such cash-generating unit groups are situated. The discount rates before tax and ultimate growth rates that were used in calculating the value in use of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated for the years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively, were as follows. (a) Discount rate before tax 2017 2018 Chemicals Parent company’s chemical business ........................................................................................... 6.7% 7.6% Consumer Lifestyle Business The domestic subsidiaries’ food sales business ............................................................................ 6.8% 6.4% (b) Ultimate growth rate In regards to cash flows for the terms beyond the five-year forecast period that was approved by management, the value in use is calculated with a growth rate of 0% for each such term. With respect to goodwill that has been allocated to cash-generating unit groups, the recoverable amount of such goodwill sufficiently exceeds its carrying amount. Thus, even if major assumptions are changed to a reasonable extent, the probability of such recoverable amount becoming less than the carrying amount is unlikely.

Customer-related assets are included in the carrying value in the category of “Others” on March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018. The value of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives included above were 4,936 million yen on March 31, 2017, and 6,618 million yen (U.S.$62,433 thousand) on March 31, 2018. Such assets consisted primarily of franchise agreements. These franchise agreements were mainly acquired through business combinations and were expected to exist as long as business continues. Therefore, management considers the useful lives of these assets to be indefinite. There were no internally-generated intangible assets as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Amortization expenses are included in “Cost of sales” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

These appraisals are calculated based on either the public offering price, a sales comparison approach or discount cash flow approach. Upon an acquisition from a third party or at the time of the most recent appraisal, if there is no significant fluctuation in the index, which is believed to reflect a certain appraised value (market or assessed price) or appropriate market value, the fair value is adjusted using such appraised value or index. As set forth under “2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION (4) Use of estimates and judgments,” fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. Investment property is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3. 126 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (2) Profit or loss relating to investment property Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2017 2018 2018 Rental income from investment property .................................................................... 4,902 5,146 48,547 Expenses arising from investment property ................................................................

The Company uses net DER* and risk assets ratio** as main indices for managing the Company’s equity. FY2017 was the final year of the “Medium-Term Management Plan 2017”, which aimed for a net DER of 1.5 times or less. In the same period, the target was to manage the risk assets ratio to within 1.0 times. These targets were reached due to improved asset efficiency caused by asset replacement coupled with suppression of increased borrowings. In the “Medium-Term Management Plan 2020”, with FY2020 as the final year, the aim for net DER is also 1.5 times or less. Further, in FY2018 the target is to manage the risk assets ratio to within 1.0 times. These will be achieved through continuing investment initiatives for further growth, and strengthening functions for upholding financial discipline and growth. These indicators are periodically reported and monitored by management. * Net DER = (Interest bearing liabilities Cash and cash equivalents Time deposits) ÷ Own equity (Own equity = Total equity amount less non-controlling interests) ** Risk assets ratio = Risk asset (such asset amount calculated based on assessment of such risk in correspondence to the size of such risk) ÷ Own equity Net DERs and Risk assets ratios as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively, were as follows. 2017 2018 Net DER...................................................................................................................... 1.1 times 1.0 times Risk assets ratio........................................................................................................... 0.6 times 0.5 times Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 133 (2) Number of authorized shares, issued shares and shares of treasury stocks Shares 2017 2018 Authorized: ordinary shares .............................................................................................. 2,500,000,000 2,500,000,000 Issued: ordinary shares Balance at beginning of year .......................................................................................... 1,251,499,501 1,251,499,501 Increase or decrease for the year ................................................................................... — — Balance at end of year .................................................................................................... 1,251,499,501 1,251,499,501 Treasury stock: ordinary shares Balance at beginning of year .......................................................................................... 484,859 516,753 Increase or decrease for the year ................................................................................... 31,894 11,994 Balance at end of year .................................................................................................... 516,753 528,747 In addition to the above, as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, Fuji Nihon Seito Corporation, one of its Entities subject to Equity Method, owned 200,000 shares of the Company.

(f) Expected contribution to the plan for the year ending March 31, 2019 The Group expects to contribute 596 million yen (U.S.$5,622 thousand) to plan assets for the year ending March 31, 2019. 3) Defined contribution plan Expenses recognized for the defined contribution plan for the years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 were 1,649 million yen and 1,752 million yen (U.S.$16,528 thousand), respectively. 4) Multi-employer plans Nissho Electronics Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company, is a member of the Tokyo-to Electric Industry Corporate Pension Fund Organization, which is a multi-employer plan. The contributions for this fund are calculated as a fixed percentage of the average salary or the like of participating employees. In addition, each fund ensures future solvency by revising the contribution a minimum of every five years in accordance with relevant regulations. If the funds are dissolved and liquidated, they will charge participants to cover deficits or distribute residual assets calculated by minimum funding standards based on regulations or the like. In addition, companies that elect to withdraw from the funds are subject to a charge to cover any liabilities and deficits projected to result from their withdrawal. This fund is a defined benefit, multi-employer plan. The Group accounts for its contributions to this fund as a post-employment benefit expense because the plan assets that correspond to the contribution of Nissho Electronics Corporation cannot be reasonably calculated.

Because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of such temporary differences, and it is probable that such temporary differences will not be reversed within the foreseeable future, the Group did not recognize deferred tax liabilities with respect to such temporary differences. (2) Income tax expenses 1) Breakdown of income tax expenses The breakdown of income tax expenses was as follows.

Its headquarters includes business sections that handle merchandising, trading, product manufacturing, services, project planning and management, investments and financing activities, both domestically and internationally. Such businesses are inherently exposed to various risks. The Group defines and classifies risks per risk item and manages each of them in accordance with its nature. (3) Credit risk management The Group assumes credit risk by extending credit to many domestic and foreign customers through a variety of commercial 146 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements transactions. The Group mitigates such credit risk by objectively assigning credit ratings to the customers to which it extends credit based on the Company’s credit rating system. The Group also controls credit risk by setting rating-based credit limits on a customerby-customer basis and enforcing the credit limits thus set. The Group employs other safeguards (e.g., collaterals and guarantees) as warranted by the customer’s creditworthiness. Additionally, the Group has a system for assessing receivables, in which customers are extracted based on a certain criteria, then assessed for their creditworthiness. With respect to such selected customers, the Group also checks for existence of any receivables, protection measures or the like. Through the above, the Group endeavors to more rigorously ascertain credit risk and calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts for each account receivable. Please note that the Group does not carry any excessive credit risk with respect to any specified customer. In regards to derivative transactions, the Group only deals with financial institutions with high credit ratings, as assigned by internationally-acknowledged rating agencies, so as to minimize the credit risks. The Group also periodically reviews the credit ratings of counterparties to such derivative transactions and re-evaluates credit limits so as to minimize credit risks based on non-performance by such counterparties. 1) Maximum exposure to credit risk Other than guaranteed obligations, the Group’s maximum exposure with respect to credit risks without taking into account any collaterals held or other credit enhancements is the carrying amount of financial instruments less impairment losses under the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. On the other hand, the Group’s maximum exposures to credit risks concerning guaranteed obligations as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 were 21,320 million yen and 26,820 million yen (U.S.$253,018 thousand), respectively. 2) Financial assets that are past the due date The analysis of aging of trade and other receivables that were past the due date but not impaired as of the end of the year was as follows. The amounts below include amounts expected to be collected through acquisition of security, insurance coverage or the like. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2017 2018 2018 Within three months past due date ��������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 8,478 10,591 99,915 Between three and six months past due date ����������������������������������������������������������������� 658 1,820 17,169 Between six months and one year past due date ����������������������������������������������������������� 1,264 1,023 9,650 Over one year past due date ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 1,832 1,742 16,433 Total ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 12,233 15,177 143,179 3) Financial assets of which impairment has occurred The Group establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts for each major customer by reviewing, among other matters, such customer's financial condition and credit ratings, status of collection of receivables with respect to such customer, amendments to payment conditions, industry trends and state of affairs of the country/region in which such customer was situated. Trade and other receivables that were individually determined to be impaired as of the end of the year were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2017 2018 2018 Trade and other receivables �������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 55,042 59,176 558,264 Allowance for doubtful accounts ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� (46,637) (49,928) (471,018) Total ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 8,404 9,247 87,235 4) Changes in allowance for doubtful accounts When financial assets are impaired, the Group does not directly deduct such impairment losses from the carrying amount of such financial assets. Instead, the Group accounts for such impairment loss under the allowance for doubtful accounts. Changes in allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2017 2018 2018 Balance at beginning of year �������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 50,043 47,407 447,235 Increase for the year ��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 2,897 9,413 88,801 Decrease for the year (incurred and charged against the allowance) ���������������������������� (2,783) (1,657) (15,632) Decrease for the year (unused amounts reversed) ������������������������������������������������������� (1,859) (2,182) (20,584) Exchange translation differences �������������������������������������������������������������������������������� (891) (1,602) (15,113) Balance at end of year ����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 47,407 51,378 484,698 In this consolidated fiscal year (ended March 31, 2018), 7,358 million yen was recorded as the allowance for doubtful accounts in terms of the finances of an equity-method associate with oil and gas interests. Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 147 (4) Liquidity risk management The Group raises funds through borrowings from financial institutions or issuance of bonds. Accordingly, in the event of a disruption to the financial system or financial/capital markets or a significant downgrade to the Group’s credit rating by one or more rating agencies, the Group’s ability to raise funds may become more restricted, and consequently the Group may not be able to make payments on debt by the due date. To provide additional financial flexibility and liquidity, the Group maintains long-term Commitment Lines of 100 billion yen (not used) and 1.9 billion U.S. dollars (760 million U.S. dollars used). The Group maintains good relationships with financial institutions, including the counterparties to these commitment line agreements. 1) Non-derivative financial liabilities The breakdown of

The Group’s basic policy is to minimize such market risks by matching assets and liabilities (e.g., long and short commodity exposures) and through hedge transactions, such as forward exchange transactions, commodity futures/forward transactions and interest rate swaps. Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 149 1) Exchange rate fluctuation risk 1. Content of, and policy for managing, exchange rate fluctuation risk The Group engages in import and export transactions and offshore transactions, both denominated in foreign currencies, as its principal business activity. Whereas the revenues and expenditures associated with such transactions are mainly received/paid out in foreign currencies, the Group’s consolidated reporting currency is Japanese yen. The Group is, therefore, exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the yen’s value against foreign currencies. To prevent or limit losses stemming from such risk, the Group hedges its foreign currency exposure through forward exchange transactions or the like. 2. Sensitivity analysis of exchange rate fluctuation risk In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, that would result from 1% appreciation of yen against each of the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant. In addition, such analysis does not include the affected amounts based on translations (into Japanese yen) of financial instruments denominated in functional currency, income and expenses denominated in foreign currency and assets and liabilities of foreign operations.

Content of and policy for managing interest rate fluctuation risk The Group raises funds by borrowing from financial institutions and issuing bonds to acquire fixed assets, invest in securities, and extend credit (e.g., through trade receivables). Asset and liability items are categorized based on whether or not they are sensitive to interest rate changes, with the difference between the value of sensitive assets and sensitive liabilities used to determine an interest rate mismatch value. Based on this amount, the ratios of funds procured from fixed-rate sources and variable-rate sources are adjusted to better manage interest rate fluctuation risks. 2. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate fluctuation risk In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amount affecting profit before tax, as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the case that the interest rate increases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant. Under such analysis, the amount affecting profit before tax is calculated by multiplying the net balance of the financial instruments affected by the interest rate fluctuation at the fiscal year-end by 1%. Please note that other than financial instruments with floating rates (excluding those that are considered to be financial instruments with fixed rates in substance due to interest rate swaps), the Group deals with, among others, the following financial instruments that are also affected by interest rate fluctuations: trade notes and accounts receivable; and, trade notes and accounts payable. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2017 2018 2018 Profit before tax ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� (672) (1,822) (17,188) 3) Commodity price fluctuation risk 1. Content of, and policies for managing, commodity price fluctuation risk As a general trading company, the Group deals in a wide range of commodities through its various businesses. As such, the Group is exposed to commodity price risk due to price fluctuations or the like. For market-traded commodities, the Group manages exposures and controls losses by setting (long and short) position limits and stop-loss levels per internal organizational unit. The Group also prescribes and enforces stop-loss rules (i.e., an internal organizational unit must promptly liquidate losing positions and be prohibited from initiating new trades for the remainder of the fiscal year if losses, including valuation losses, exceed the stop-loss level). Even with such controls, however, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid commodity price risk. The Group's management performance and/or financial conditions may be adversely affected by unanticipated market movements. With respect to commodity inventories, the Group implements measures, such as monthly monitoring by business or the like, in order to control inventory levels. 150 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 2.

(a) Trade notes and accounts receivable Each receivable is categorized by period, and its fair value is the present value of future cash flows discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to maturity and credit risk. (b) Trade notes and accounts payable Each payable is categorized by period, and its fair value is the present value of future cash flows discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to maturity and credit risk. (c) Bonds and borrowings The fair value of bonds payable is the market price when available. The fair value of long-term loans is the present value of total principal and interest discounted using an assumed interest rate on equivalent new borrowings. Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 2. 2) Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 1. Analysis of fair value by hierarchy level The following tables provide analysis by level reflecting the significance of inputs used when measuring fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position that are measured at fair value.

(a) Other investments The fair value of listed shares is the quoted price on an exchange, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. The fair value of unlisted shares is calculated using valuation methods including discounted future cash flow, market prices of comparable companies, net asset value, and other valuation methods, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3. Measuring the fair value of unlisted shares involves the use of unobservable inputs such as discount rate and valuation multiples, as well as any necessary adjustments including discounts for a lack of liquidity or a non-controlling interest. The Group’s corporate departments determine the policies and procedures for measuring the fair value of unlisted shares, and validate their approach to measuring fair value, including the valuation model, by periodically confirming issues such as the operating circumstances associated with particular equities, the availability of relevant business plans, and data from comparable public companies. (b) Derivative financial assets and liabilities Currency-related derivatives The fair values of foreign exchange transactions, spot/forward transactions, currency option transactions and currency swap transactions are calculated based on the forward exchange rate as of the closing date. Interest rate-related derivatives The fair value of interest-rate swaps is the present value of future cash flow discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to settlement and credit risk. Commodity-related derivatives The fair value of commodity futures transactions is calculated using final prices on commodities exchanges as of the fiscal year-end. The fair values of commodity forward transactions, commodity option transactions and commodity swap transactions are calculated based on the index prices publicly announced at the fiscal year-end. Commodity futures transactions are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. All other derivative financial assets and liabilities are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 2. 2. Recurring fair value measurements categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3 The increases/decreases in financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3 were as follows.

Such cumulative other comprehensive income totals (net of taxes) that were reclassified to retained earnings for the years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 were losses of 1,229 million yen and 828 million yen (U.S.$7,811 thousand), respectively. (8) Hedge accounting 1) Types of hedge accounting (a) Fair value hedges A fair value hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. The Group designates commodity futures and commodity forwards as hedging instruments to hedge the changes in fair values of firm commitments or inventories. With respect to a fair value hedge, gains or losses from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value are recognized as profit or loss, and gains or losses on hedged items attributable to hedged risks are also recognized as profit or loss. Gains or losses recognized as profit or loss relating to hedging instruments included net gains of 154 million yen and net gains of 21 million yen (U.S.$198 thousand) for the years ended March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, respectively. Gains or losses on the hedged items or less corresponded to the gains or losses on the hedging instruments. (b) Cash flow hedges A cash flow hedge is a hedge of exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a scheduled transaction that is most likely to occur. The Group designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows relating to floating-rate borrowings and designates forward exchange transactions as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows concerning firm commitments in foreign currency. With respect to a cash flow hedge, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income. For the years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, accumulated amounts of other comprehensive income that were expected to be reclassified to profit or loss within one year due to cash flow hedges (before tax effect adjustments) were losses of 661 million yen and 665 million yen (U.S.$6,273 thousand), respectively. (c) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The Group designates forward exchange transactions and foreign currency borrowings as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of change in exchange rate concerning net investments in foreign operations. With respect to a hedge of net investments in foreign operations, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income. 2) Fair values of hedging instruments by type of hedge accounting Fair values of hedging instruments by type of hedge accounting were as follows.
