Being a scope 3, depending on the level of control the company has over company in the wind industry, we saw a clear case for doing the emissions. Scope 1 emissions cover the emissions that are a more to facilitate the transition to a decarbonized sustainable direct consequence of a company's own operations, for example economy. Carbon neutrality refers to having a net zero carbon emissions resulting from company vehicles or company facilifootprint by balancing emissions with an equal amount of reducties. Scope 2 emissions include the indirect emissions from purtions and offsets. The pathway to carbon neutrality chased electricity, heating, cooling or steam. Scope 2 emissions are considered to be indirect emissions, since the emissions The pathway to carbon neutrality physically occur at the site where the electricity is generated instead of at a company-owned site. Scope 3 emissions include other indirect emissions, such as business travel and waste disposal. Despite the emissions taking place elsewhere, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions are a consequence of a company's operations at it should therefore share responsibility for them. Greenhouse gas accounting The first step we undertook to go carbon neutral was to measure our emissions. Before mapping our emissions, we had to decide Reduce Offset on the boundary of our carbon neutrality pledge, or which emissions to include and which to exclude. We decided to go for a broad scope, including not only our scope 1 and 2 emissions but Account also several scope 3 emissions (fuel and energy-related activities, upstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, business travel and employee commuting). During the process of mapping our emissions, we realized that The program to deliver the pledge is named “CleanLM” and almost anything we do at LM Wind Power has an associated carbon consists of four workstreams: footprint.

This year they installed an Energy Management System (EMS) to monitor power consumption on all key plant equipment. They also installed LED lighting in offices and the canteen. And finally, they improved ventilation control, sometimes by simply switching off the ventilation manually when it wasn’t needed. “Our energy efficiency program has reduced our CO2 emissions by 40 percent and we’ve saved $320 thousand by purchasing green wind and solar electricity,” said Balaji R, Associate Maintenance Manager at the Dabaspet plant. “So, saving energy and going green is not just good for the planet in terms of lower emissions: It also makes good business sense.” As 2019 sees the further expansion of our operations in Dabaspet, the energy efficiency team is busy planning their next moves: incorporating rooftop solar panels to power the plant, installing a thermal resistance coating on blade workshop roofs to prevent heat loss and reusing residual heat energy from compressors. Balaji is convinced that scrutinizing our business from an emissions perspective allows him to identify cost-saving opportunities. “Once you start looking into saving energy, you realize there are so many different measures you can take, specific to your business, that can have a positive impact,” he said. “Every day brings new opportunities to make a difference to the environment and our profit!” 3 2 | L M W I ND POWER COP A ND G R I REP ORT 2017 Technology 25% 25% Total Total compared waste forfor waste comparedto 28% recycling, recycling, to 28% in 2016 in 2016 €€3.0 3.0million million savings, €5.5 savings, €5.5 compared in 2016 in 2016 comparedto to 66 NewNew blade compared compared blade designs designs launched, launched, to 8toin8 2015 in 2015 4.5%4.5% Revenue Revenue compared compared invested invested to 3.0% to 3.0% in R&D, in R&D, in 2016 in 2016 Why is this important?

When purchasing carbon credits, we choose to invest in projects that also support the Sustainable Development Goals by creating jobs, training health workers, empowering young women and providing clean water. The Mytrah Energy project in India is a stand-out example of how environmental and community benefits can go handin-hand. On the surface, Mytrah is a wind project, totaling 233.1 MW of wind power capacity, which prevents 479,448 tonnes of greenhouse gasses from entering the atmosphere every year. Through increased access to clean energy, the project inherently benefits surrounding communities by avoiding the negative impacts on air quality and health associated with fossil fuels. However, surrounding communities feel the impact of the Mytrah project much more directly. This project created 150 permanent jobs and 210 jobs during the construction phase. Mytrah also established a store with donated items for disadvantaged community members. To empower young women, the project created two community camps which have already taught 500 girls about gender rights, health and soft skills. Health benefits from the project also go beyond the clean energy itself. The project has invested in training 100 volunteers who can help improve the health of people living in surrounding slums. Mytrah also set up a safe water project that provides clean water, sanitation education and improved latrine services. In fact, 12,000 people have benefited from the establishment of seven safe drinking water plants in three states. As we continue to find ways to reduce emissions from our business, we’re proud to also support projects like Mytrah Energy – creating clean energy, while also developing reliable infrastructure, strong economies and healthy communities worldwide.
