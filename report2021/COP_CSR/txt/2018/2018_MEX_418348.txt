Under the privatisation scheme, an initial stake of 15% in the company’s capital stock (the BB series shares) was sold to a strategic partner, Inversiones y Técnicas Aeroportuarias, S.A. Figure 2: Structure, Holding Company and Subsidiaries de C.V. (ITA), with expertise in Mexican business operations and in the international airport industry. The remaining 85% of the company’s shares (the B series) began trading on the stock exchanges of Mexico City and New York in two public offers in September 2000 and March 2005. ASUR is therefore a onehundred-per-cent privately owned company, subject to a series of national and international regulatory frameworks. 2.3 Shareholder Structure In June 2007, the strategic partner ITA reduced its st shareholding in the company from 15% to 7.65%. As of the 31 of December 2017, ITA is owned by Fernando Chico Pardo, a Mexican investor, who has a 50% stake in the company; and by Remer Soluciones a la Inversión, S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of the Mexican bus transport company Grupo ADO, S.A. de C.V., which also has a stake of 50%. The 92.35% of ASUR’s shares that are not held by ITA are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: ASR) and the st Mexico City Bolsa (BMV: ASUR). As of the 31 of December 2017, Fernando Chico Pardo directly or indirectly owns a stake of 16.41% in ASUR (including the stake held via ITA); and Grupo ADO, S.A. de C.V. directly or indirectly owns a stake of 16.13% in ASUR (including the stake held via ITA). 2.4 Organisational Structure st As of the 31 of December 2017, ASUR directly employs a total of 1,019 people. Our organisational structure may be summarised as follows: each of the nine airports of ASUR is a subsidiary of the holding company, Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, S.A.B. de C.V. In addition, there are two subsidiary service companies, one that directly employs the Group’s unionised staff (RH ASUR, S.A. de C.V.) and another that directly employs all the Group’s non-unionised staff (Servicios Aeroportuarios del Sureste, S.A. de C.V.). 3 2017 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2.5 Operating and Financial Data In 2017, a total of 31,052,569 passengers passed through ASUR’s Mexican airports (not including private aviation or transit passengers), of which 16,741,841 (54%) were international and 14,310,728 (46%) were domestic passengers. The total passenger figure for 2017 increased by 2,645,518 (9.3%) compared to the year 2016. The company’s largest airport is the one located at Cancún, which accounted for 76% of total passenger traffic in 2017 (up from 75% in 2016).

Among the most important of these are: contractors hired to carry out construction work for the maintenance, extension or remodelling of airport infrastructure; technical supervision services to ensure that construction work is completed on time and in accordance with specifications; suppliers of equipment for airconditioning, security and check-in systems, and so on; and the providers of certain services, such as cleaning, security and surveillance, passenger inspection, and refuse collection. The vast majority of the companies in ASUR’s value chain are based in Mexico, with the notable exception of some suppliers of airport-specific equipment such as boarding bridges, specialised vehicles, and baggage-handling equipment. All contractors and subcontractors are required to adhere to ASUR’s Code of Ethics. Their employees have access to the company’s internal reporting system, and are encouraged to report any instances of unethical behaviour or violations of their fundamental rights. The company’s Internal Auditing Department also carries out random inspections to ensure that subcontractors adhere to the provisions of Mexican labour legislation, especially with regard to payment of social security contributions for their employees. During 2017, of the 20 biggest contracts for goods and services entered into by the company, eight were for general services, six were for construction services, and six were for the acquisition of equipment. 6 2017 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 3.

The water that is recycled is mainly used for watering green areas, which helps to reduce the demands placed by the airports on local resources. Any water that cannot be stored and used for this purpose is released into either the subsoil or into local wetlands, in accordance with the permits issued by Mexico’s National Water Commission (CONAGUA). ASUR also takes care to ensure that the quality of the storm water that runs off our airport facilities is in full compliance 3 with local regulations.

They do not take into account fuel consumed by the airports’ subcontractors, or that consumed by aircraft for takeoff and landing procedures. While ASUR recognises that this information may be of interest to our stakeholders, at this time no systems are in place for us to obtain these data. 6.2.6 Biodiversity Issues ASUR has several programmes in place that are intended to promote and protect the rich biodiversity in the areas that surround many of our airports. Local species of plants and animals that are vulnerable or endangered have been identified, along with natural habitats that are of special value. In recent years, the company has implemented projects to relocate endangered plant species during construction work and to carry out reforestation projects with local species. The company also implements wildlife-management measures to reduce the risk of impacts between animals and aircraft at our airports, both on the ground and in the air. One of the most significant risks is that of bird strike, which may 6 cause significant damage to aircraft. ASUR counters this risk by using trained hawks to scare away other species of birds and prevent them from nesting on airport grounds; the method causes no damage to the bird populations themselves, while guaranteeing aviation safety. 6 Bird-strike incidents that cause damage to aircraft are reported to the Mexican civil-aviation authorities by the airlines, as the directly affected parties. ASUR does not compile data on the numbers of bird strikes at or within the vicinity of its airports. 17 2017 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 6.3 Environmental Management System taken into consideration in ASUR’s environmental protection programme. The full details of the environmental objectives ASUR has an Environmental Management System that is established in 2017 for the nine airports in the Group, as well applied in all nine of the Mexican airports the company as performance against those objectives, can be consulted in operates. The purpose of the system is to establish Appendix A. environmental objectives for each airport, as well as a framework for the achievement of those objectives. The The Environmental Management Systems in each of ASUR’s system creates a series of parameters that can be used to airports are certified according to ISO 14001. The following monitor and assess each airport’s performance in relation to tables provide an overview of the performance in all nine of the environmental objectives established, providing the ASUR’s airports with regard to some of the most relevant company management with valuable information for the environmental parameters established by the System: decision-making process.

During 2017, the 1,019 permanent employees of ASUR worked a total of 2,827,680 hours, equivalent to 353,460 days (eight-hour shifts). In the period in question, there were in total just five cases of accidents in the workplace, affecting 0.5% of staff members, with no cases of occupational disease and no fatalities. During the year, the total number of lost days resulting from these accidents was 62, equivalent to 0.02% of total days worked. In accordance with the system used by the Mexican Social Security Institute, accidents in the workplace are defined as incidents leading to an injury that requires the staff member in question to miss one or more days of work. The total number of lost days includes all calendar days between the initial accident and the date on which the employee returns to work, even when these days are not working days. The date on which the accident occurs is counted as day one for this purpose. Minor accidents requiring first-aid treatment only are not included in the number of accidents in the workplace. In the same period, the absentee rate (defined as the total number of days that employees were absent from work due to general, non-work-related illness or when no justification was presented for the absence) corresponded to a total of 2,185 days, or 0.62% of total days worked. These data refer exclusively to the 1,019 direct, full-time employees of ASUR as of the 31st of December 2017. At this time, there are no systems in place that require subcontractors, service providers or other parties with employees working at the airport to provide ASUR with accident, injury and absenteeism data. 22 2017 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 8. Community Involvement and Support 8.1 Direct Economic Benefits The table below provides a breakdown of the economic value generated, distributed and retained by ASUR in 2017. The contribution that ASUR makes towards creating decent living standards for its employees and their families is one of the most significant ways in which the company provides support for local communities.

These projects are selected and administered by each airport individually, to respond to local needs and to promote a sense of ownership and greater commitment. Support is provided monetarily and in the form of donations of goods and services, as well as volunteering. The total value of cash donations, donations in kind and man hours in 2017 is estimated at approximately $63.7 million pesos. During the period, the projects supported fell under four main categories: public health services, care for people with disabilities, education and culture, and the environment. The organisations that received support from ASUR in the healthcare sector included the Mexican Red Cross. For the ninth year running, a fundraising 5K and 10K race was organised at Cancún Airport, and the proceeds were donated to a local charity that raises awareness and provides support for sufferers of breast cancer. Awareness campaigns were implemented throughout the company to promote healthy eating and a healthier lifestyle. In the field of assistance for people with disabilities, upgrades were made and equipment acquired to continue to improve disabled accessibility in several of the group’s airports, and an awareness campaign was provided throughout the year for all company employees. In relation to education, the various airports in the group continued to organise guided tours of their facilities for local educational establishments, as well as children’s workshops on a range of subjects such as environmental protection.
