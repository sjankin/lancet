Principle 8 Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principle 9 Business should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Our commitment We actively contribute to environmental awareness and are committed to minimizing the negative environmental impacts of our day-to-day work. Amongst others the location of our headquarters in Freiburg in a “plus-energy building” shows our environmental commitment. Plusenergy buildings are characterized by on average generating more energy than its inhabitants spend. We kept on our policy, that no employee is provided with an own company car. The company owns one car that is at everyone’s disposal for business purposes. In exchange, Particip provides Bahncard50 a German Rail loyalty card that offers a 50% discount to all travelling employees. Travels within Europe are therefore mainly undertaken by train.
