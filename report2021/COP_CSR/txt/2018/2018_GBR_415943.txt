Reduced dependency on Rand Water Board (RWB) supply to the Lonmin operations is set to be an ongoing strategic drive. Impact Supply constraints in respect of energy or water could impact our ability to operate effectively and meet our production targets. Furthermore, cost increases in respect of these utilities impact our margins. Water availability is becoming a critical component of any business to survive and still remains a basic human need. The risk associated with water is higher than the risk associated with electrical supply. RWB supply is forecast to run dry in Gauteng during 2019. ESKOM is currently in an oversupply, and with the continued low to no economic growth, this is set to continue. The risk regarding electricity is the potential spiralling cost escalations to try and compensate for less power sales year-on-year. Changes in peak and non-peak power rates are also a real threat and peak power rates could be increased signiﬁcantly going forward. Opportunities and mitigation Ongoing implementation of the electricity conservation programme as well as water optimisation through demand management are in place. An integrated water management plan for Lonmin has been developed with the goal to reduce RWB reliance as far as possible within the operations, and to maximise the recovery and re-use of all other sources of water. Longer-term plans to treat some streams of these alternative sources to potable level to make the business more independent of RWB. Lonmin is exploring further opportunities to supply communities out of such streams. As part of ensuring optimal electricity usage, Lonmin is a member of the ESKOM energy-intensive user groups (EIUG), as well as conducting monthly and daily electricity consumption and reporting. 01 / 02 / 03 / 04 / 05 / 06 / Our Sustainability Approach Corporate Our Leadership Reporting According to Employee and Material Matters Profile Strategy Overview Our Material Focus Areas Relationships Sustainable Development Report 2017 / 39 At our salvage yard our boilermakers assist in refurbishing equipment for reuse. 07 / 08 / 09 / 10 / 11 / 12 / Safety and Community Relationships Managing Environmental Constructive Engagement: Governance Annexures Health and Investment Impacts and Opportunities Government, Regulatory and Other Stakeholders / 40 Lonmin Plc Material Focus Area I Employee Relationships Investing in employee relationships and development Lonmin’s human resources comprises our employees and the contractors that work at our operations.

Union relations AMCU United Association of South Africa (UASA) Our employees have rights to collective bargaining, and No trade union Chemical Energy Paper Printing freedom of association and representation. National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) Wood and Allied Workers Union Solidarity (CEPPWAWU) We show our respect and support of these rights by continuously interacting with unions at different levels within the Company. We engage through the various union structures and management interactions with union representatives to share information on Lonmin’s performance and important issues. These include Future Forums; fortnightly and quarterly operational meetings with AMCU branches and operational management; monthly shaft/plant committee meetings; monthly health and safety meetings; and various other statutory meetings such as employment equity and skills development forums. The Company trains shop stewards on their responsibilities, legislative matters and business skills. Our Relationship Charter and ‘rules of engagement’ in place with AMCU are being reviewed. The Charter includes aspirations, expectations, accountability and commitments from both parties. Implementing the terms of the Charter and regular and constructive engagements strengthened Lonmin’s relationship with trade unions. This was evident in the successful workforce restructuring in 2016, reduced work stoppages and successful 2016 wage negotiations. Union rivalry continues to complicate our relationships with unions, as labour dynamics at other companies can inﬂuence union attitudes in our workplace. We are impacted by internal rivalries in individual unions. Lonmin is re-assessing the rights of the employee representative structures outside AMCU. At year-end, 22,914 employees (92.72%) were members of various organised trade unions. 01 / 02 / 03 / 04 / 05 / 06 / Our Sustainability Approach Corporate Our Leadership Reporting According to Employee and Material Matters Profile Strategy Overview Our Material Focus Areas Relationships Sustainable Development Report 2017 / 53 The week that changed our lives This year marked the ﬁfth anniversary of the ‘week that changed our lives’. This tragedy has shaped us all and continues to inspire us to be the catalyst for change. Our primary concern remains to take care of the families of the Lonmin employees who died that day. Our Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO) travelled to meet with each widow in local communities, in villages, and in their homelands to express our deepest condolences. Lonmin understands that the lives lost can never be replaced. We provided counselling services to families of the deceased. A member of each of the 41 impacted families was provided with a permanent employment opportunity and accommodation to ensure continued income. Each family received statutory payouts from pension and life funds, and goodwill payments from Lonmin to cover funeral costs and additional contributions. In 2012 Lonmin established the 1608 Memorial Education Trust (1608 Trust) to provide ﬁnancial support for the educational needs of the children who lost fathers who were Lonmin employees in the Marikana tragedy. This was subsequently extended to include the children of contractors who passed away during the tragedy. Number of beneﬁciaries Female Male Age 1 – 10 Age 11 – 20 Age 21+ 141 67 74 39 66 36 The Trust’s ﬁrst graduate, Mr Mandla Yawa, completed his BSc degree in agriculture and animal science (masters) at Fort Hare University in 2016. The 1608 Trust provides the cost of attending school or other education facilities (inclusive of boarding fees), including registration costs and fees, books, uniforms, transport, extramural activities and school trips, and other educational costs approved by the independent trustees. To date, costs incurred by Lonmin amount to R12.37 million. Our CEO has made numerous visits to these schools. Lonmin will honour its commitment to provide education support of the beneﬁciaries until the last child completes tertiary education. Through the 1608 Trust, Lonmin completed infrastructure improvements at the New Millennium School in Lesotho, where 10 of the 1608 Trust beneﬁciaries attend school. These improvements were completed in 2017 at a cost of R768 000, and included improving the supply of potable water, installing hot water facilities for boarding units, and improving sanitation facilities. In August 2017 we unveiled the concept for a memorial park in Marikana. The park will be designed around the visual representation of a green blanket, the garment worn by one of the strike leaders in 2012. The ‘blanket’ will be a green space planted with indigenous trees that will serve as a social gathering space for the community and will stretch over three koppies (hills) to signify new hope. The design will be ﬁnalised with input from Lonmin employees, families that lost loved ones in the tragedy, and other key stakeholders. Later additions to the site may include an amphitheatre and a museum showcasing the history of platinum mining and detailing the events of the tragedy.
