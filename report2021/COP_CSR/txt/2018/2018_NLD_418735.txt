Imres is a medical wholesaler who’s aim it is to provide global access to quality medical care. Our mission implies that we explicitly aim on improving people’s lives, while keeping the ten principles as a guideline doing so. What we found over the past year is that by signing the UN Global Compact in 2016, the journey to a sustainable business model has started by creating awareness in our company on the ten principles and the 17 SDGs. We are only at the beginning of our journey, but with a strong desire to incorporate sustainability in our DNA and day-to-day business. This report is our Communication On Progress and reflects the progress we made over the last year and our concrete plans going forward.

As an organisation, we are large enough to make a difference but small enough to give our customers personal attention. We care about the difference that we are making in lives and communities, and in our partners’ health projects. As a supplier, we do not make promises that we cannot keep. If we commit to a project and specific deliverables, it is because we really can deliver, as promised. Similar to the projects that we are proud to be part of, Imres has heart. We are good at what we do, but we also feel good about what we do. We feel responsible for our partners’ projects until each one ends successfully. Then we move onto our next challenge; our next opportunity to turn humanitarian dreams into concrete solutions and decisive action that saves lives.

Human rights within our own operation Our own operation is located in the Netherlands. We recognize that the employees within the company are the most important asset of the company. We therefore have a set of rules and guidelines to ensure they can work and develop themselves and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Concrete measurements within our own operation to ensure human rights are safeguarded: • We have installed a Privacy Protection Officer who is responsible for the privacy of our employees and will make sure their personal data will not be compromised in any way • We have a confidential counsellor where employees can go to when they encounter issues at work with colleagues or management Imres complies to all national and international regulations and laws, and will not tolerate any breach with these regulations and laws. Human rights in the supply chain Human rights do not stop at our backdoor. We have a thorough Code of Conduct. Every supplier or sub-contractor who has a business relationship with Imres is obliged to sign off this Code of Conduct if they want to do business with Imres. Our Code of Conduct can be found on our website, as well as in our intranet and is known to all our employees. It is our aim to further intensify our audits with regards to the compliance of our suppliers with our code of conduct. Furthermore we encourage our suppliers and customer to become signatories to the UN Global Compact by mentioning it in our contacts with them and by showing it on our website. In 2017 no incidents regarding human rights were reported. For 2018 and further, we will include the compliance with our CoC when we audit suppliers. 10% of our customers are signatory to the UN Global Compact 5% of our suppliers are signatory to the UN Global Compact Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Principle 3: We uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the rights to collective bargaining.

All employees are free to participate in a trade union. As a result of our signatory to the UN Global Compact we have installed a works council in which employees have a vote on certain topics regarding working conditions. Elimination of child labour, forced and compulsory Labour It is forbidden by law to have any form of compulsory, forced or child labour in the Netherlands. At Imres there are no employees under the age of 18, nor do we have any kind of compulsory or forced labour. Employee diversity We believe that every person, no matter what background or gender should have equal opportunities. Imres is an international orientated company and therefore understands the value of a diverse work force. The total work force is around 92 people of which approximately 40% is female. 25% of the managing board is female. Our employees are a representative reflection of the society, which means the age varies from 18 year until 64 years and the people are from different countries and continents. Age structure Gender structure Length of employment LABOUR LABOUR RIGHTS IN OUR OWN OPERATION Safety and health at work All Imres employees have a fundamental right to a safe and healthy working environment. The working spaces of the employees are up to all relevant Arbo legislation standards. There is sufficient attention from the management board for requests related with the working circumstances such as air conditioning, specific chairs, etc. We have a Inhouse Emergency Response team that can be called upon in case of an accident or other medical related events. Education and development We have several internal and external training programs that help our employees to grow in their daily work. Apart from that we have an education budget in place for employees. If an employee wants to develop in a certain direction they can sit with their manager to discuss and see if this fits within the company strategy. Concretely, we have started the “5 choices” course for our employees to help them in their life / work balance. Internal communication Engagement and involvement between the management and our employees is key in order to create optimal working conditions . We have an ‘open door’ policy in which employees are always welcome to express their questions or concerns towards their colleagues or management. We inform all employees on a regular base through email, we have internal meetings and a regular newsletter. LABOUR LABOUR RIGHTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN Code of Conduct Every suplier that wants to do business with Imres is obliged to sign off our code of conduct. In our Code we have the labourstandards according to principles three to six layed-out that our suppliers must comply with. Audits So far when we perform an audit with a supplier, we signal any serious breaches with principles three to six. Untill now we did not explicitly include the outcome in our audit report. For 2018 and further we will include compliance with our CoC as part of the audit report. During an audit we will ask for their continued commitment on principles three to six. In 2017 no labour rights related incidients were reported In 2017 no safety related incidients were reported Principle 7: Support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmental friendly technologies ENVIRONMENT It starts with the awareness that all actions we take have an impact on the environment. We therefore have started to see where we as a company can make the biggest impact on reducing our footprint. We are only at the beginning of this journey, which has started by the process of identifying what we do now in terms of environmental sustainability both in our own operations as well as in our supply chain. In our own operation: • Identify our yearly energy use • Identify our yearly use of natural resources and (raw) materials • Identify our yearly waste and means of recycling • Identify any other means with which we can reduce our footprint. E.G. traveling, use of (IT)techniques to reduce waste, etc. In the supply chain: • Identify our yearly energy use of transport • Identify the environmental policies our suppliers have in place • Identify if and how our suppliers report on energy use Concrete actions already taken: Imres has already been active for years on the measurements to reduce waste and increase environmental sustainability. These are: • Recycling, Imres recycles all paper, plastics and glass • Pharmaceuticals and medical consumables with a shorter shelflife, are being donated to charities. This prevents these goods from being destructed which reduces the pressure on the environment • Commuting, employees who live within a cycling distance from our offices got an offer to buy an (e) bike with a discount • Contracts with transporters, Imres has put a contract in place for most of her shipments with shipping companies that have the protection of the environment at heart of their sustainability policy. Principle 10: We work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery ANTI-CORRUPTION Imres is against all forms of corruption. We believe that the only way to achieve sustainable succes is by acting integer both in our own company as in the supply chain. We focus on continued quality for the best price, innovative sollutions for our customers and adding value to their lives. In our own operation We have an anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy in our Quality system that has to be read, and agreed upon by all our employees. We have a zero tolerance policy on corruption and have yearly audits, both from our accountants and from key NGO customers. In the supply chain We are aware that anti-corrupution and anti-bribery control in the supply chain is less visible than in our own operation. All our Agents need to sign our anti-Bribery and anti-Corruption Policy and the fees charged need to be market conform. Also here we have a zero tolerance policy in place. From 2018 and further we will randomly check with our agents if their operation complies with our policy. Furthermore we will make an inventory of the percentage of our customers that have a code of conduct or anti corruption policy in place which they state publicly. In 2017 no corruption related incidients were reported OUTLOOK Imres is growing at a steady pace. With this growth our responsibility for sustainable business in the future also grows. We have started our journey and are pleased that we are well on our way. We have identified or are in the process of identifying concrete measurements that will help us further in our journey towards sustainability. For 2018 those measurements are: Environment, Identify our footprint, both in our own company as well as in our supply chain Human rights: When we perform audits with our suppliers, check if they are compliant with our Code of Conduct Labour: When we perform audits with our suppliers, check if they are compliant with our Code of Conduct We invite all stakeholders like customers and suppliers to communicate with Imres on all sustainability topics.
