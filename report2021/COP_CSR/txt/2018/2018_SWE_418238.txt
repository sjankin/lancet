PROPERTY PORTFOLIO The company’s assets consist mainly of properties whose growth in value, composition and technical state may constitute a risk. VALUE CHANGE IN PROPERTY PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT The value of the property portfolio is affected by both internal and external factors. To reduce the risks of high fluctuations in value, the company maintains a well The internal factors are linked to our ability to refine the portfolio, increase the diversified portfolio of properties concentrated in central locations in northern Sweden’s attraction and return of the properties and also to value the properties. growth areas. The well-balanced lease structure reduces the risk of high vacancy rates The external factors are linked to the state of the overall economy, which and loss of rental income, with the property valuations being conducted according to determines supply, demand and the required return on the rental market. established and revised methods. PROPERTY PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION RISK MANAGEMENT Risks that affect the portfolio composition are the geographical location of the As a way of reducing these risks, the business model is based on the company’s properties, their position within the city, the mix of premises and the technical urban development strategy; the starting point here is to concentrate the wellstatus of the properties. Operations in locations with a limited future outlook can diversified property portfolio on central locations in growth areas. The result is constitute an exit risk when the limited basis for long-term tenant relations can reduced fluctuations in value and a low vacancy rate thanks to demand being higher make it difficult to dispose of non-desirable property holdings. Market trends than supply. similarly constitute a risk that affects the demand for certain types of premises. An outdated or substandard portfolio or one that is difficult to develop represents a risk affecting the opportunities to fill vacant spaces. ACQUISITION OF COMPANIES AND PROPERTIES RISK MANAGEMENT The objective of our acquisitions is to add value in excess of the purchase price. By following our established acquisition strategy, we reduce the risk of making The planned acquisition strategy cannot always be guaranteed, given that external incorrect decisions and encountering surprises. In connection with each acquisition, factors such as raising capital, stock market sentiment and political decisions may extensive financial, legal and property inspections are performed in order to analyse make it more difficult to execute. The risk inherent in acquisition is making and discover hidden risks and opportunities. We develop competence in our incorrect assessments of the added value and synergies, and of the technical employees and bring in external expertise if necessary. This is why we carry out status. regular macroand micro-analyses of the city in question. INVESTMENTS RISK MANAGEMENT The purpose of making investments is to improve the quality of the property Performing quality assurance on the contractors engaged provides predictability portfolio and to achieve a higher occupancy rate and thereby improved cash flows and and security.

RENTAL INCOME RISK MANAGEMENT Contracted rental income is highly dependent on the ability of tenants to pay. Deficient In order to reduce the risk of suspension of payments, in certain cases the tenant’s internal processes and commitments may result in dissatisfied tenants and increased obligation is guaranteed by a parent company or through a bank guarantee. Employees vacancies. The economic growth of the economy in general and that of the town or with a local presence and solid expertise in regard to their location create opportunities for city, the construction of new premises and homes, other competition and the level of building long-term tenant relationships. A relatively large and diversified property portfolio demand all have an impact on the occupancy rate and thus the rental income. with a well-balanced tenant structure reduces the risk of significantly lower rental income if a particular tenant, industry or area should face economic setbacks. The risk of extensive renegotiations is handled by ensuring an even distribution of lease maturities. The majority of all leases include index compensation based on term. An active and close customer dialogue makes it possible to identify and deal with any dissatisfaction. PROPERTY COSTS RISK MANAGEMENT Tariff-based costs that are not regulated in the lease and unexpected repair and The risk of increased costs is managed by conducting ongoing reviews of the ability to maintenance costs represent obvious risks. This also applies to seasonal pass on costs and/or perform lease indexation. Increasing the occupancy rate spreads expenses that affect the property costs between quarters and years. the fixed costs across multiple tenants.

Other changes to RFR 2, which is not yet in effect, are not expected to have any Classification and measurement: When first recognised, financial assets must be significant impact when applied for the first time. IFRS 9, the new standard for financial classified as fair value via the income statement, and as amortised cost or fair value via other instruments, deals with the classification, valuation and accounting of financial assets and comprehensive income. liabilities. RFR 2 contains exceptions from applying IFRS 9 as a legal entity, and introduces • The classification assessment for debt instruments is based on two criteria: provisions for presentation of financial instruments in RFR 2 which must be employed by the (a) The company’s business model for managing the financial asset. companies who choose to apply the exception. The change must be applied for financial (b) The instrument’s contractual cash flows. years beginning 1 January 2018 or later. • The classification of equity instruments is fair value via the income statement, except when the company has elected to present such instruments at fair value via other comprehensive income. • The rules for classifying and measuring financial liabilities are largely unchanged compared to IAS 39. Impairments: removes the requirement to identify a loss event and introduces a model for expected credit losses. The model establishes a three-stage classification based on whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk. For financial assets for which no significant increase of the credit risk has occurred, a credit loss relating to the loss that is expected to occur within 12 months will be reserved. For financial assets for which a significant increase of the credit risk has occurred and for those where this is uncertain, a credit loss relating to the loss that is expected to occur during the remaining term of the asset will be recognised. Hedge accounting: The rules permit companies to better reflect the company’s risk management activities in the financial statements and introduce less detailed rules on how the efficiency of the hedges should be assessed. The Group conducted a project during the year to identify differences between the previously applied principles for the recognition of financial instruments and the IFRS 9 requirements. The new principles for classification of financial assets are based on an analysis of the business model on the basis of which the asset is managed and the asset’s cash flow characteristics. The areas where Diös believes the standard could have an impact are impairment testing of trade receivables and the assessment of future bad debts. The analysis and Diös’ application of the new model for impairment testing pursuant to the simplified model show that the transition will have no material impact on the reported values. Senior management’s general assessment is that IFRS 9 will have an immaterial impact on the Group’s financial reporting. The Group will not be restating comparative figures.

The financial operations must be conducted so that the costs for financial risk management are minimised. This means that financial transactions are based on an estimate of the Group’s requirements for funding, liquidity and interest rate risk. An inter-company transaction, such as an internal loan, does not therefore necessarily mean that an identical external loan transaction is also carried out. External loans are taken up once the Group’s aggregate borrowing requirements have been assessed. A group accounts system enables net management of the Group’s payment flows. The Group’s interest rate risk is managed costeffectively by assessing the interest rate risk that arises when an individual loan with a short fixed-interest term is raised. Interest-rate derivative transactions will subsequently be carried out as needed to achieve the desired fixed-rate term for the Group’s overall loan portfolio.

These financial measures should therefore not be viewed as not been defined in accordance with IFRS. The company considers that these substitutes for IFRS-defined measures. The following table presents non-IFRS measures provide valuable additional information for investors, analysts and the measures unless otherwise stated. Definitions of these measures are found on company’s management, as they enable the evaluation of relevant trends and p. 117. the company’s performance. As not all companies calculate financial measures Figures refer to SEK million unless otherwise indicated. in the same way, these are not always comparable with the measures used by 2017 2016 12 mths 12 mths Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Number of shares at end of period, thousands (balance sheet KPIs)1 134,512 95,290 Average number of shares, thousands (income statement-related key ratios)1 132,041 95,290 1Historical data for the number of shares has been restated to factor in the effect of bonus issues (i.e. the value of the subscription rights) in issues of new shares, and has been used in all KPI calculations for SEK per share. The conversion factor is 1.28. There is no dilutive effect, as no potential shares (such as convertibles) exist. OPERATING RESULTS The company governs its operations based partly on the objective of generating capital growth by increasing the surplus ratio and thereby the operating cash flow, i.e. increased income from property management. The target for the year is a surplus ratio in excess of 63 per cent. The income from property management is also the basis for what is distributed annually to the shareholders – around 50 per cent of the profit for the year after tax, excluding unrealised changes in value and deferred tax. Diös also reports the alternative performance indicators property management income, EPRA earnings and surplus ratio, as these are deemed to be relevant for investors and analysts, and provide additional information on the company’s operating results. The indicators provide a picture which excludes factors that are partly beyond the control of the company, such as changes in the value of properties and derivatives. 2017 2016 12 mths 12 mths Property management income Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Profit before tax 1,261 957 Reversal Change in value, properties -412 -327 Change in value, derivatives -27 -91 Property management income 822 539 EPRA earnings (property management income after tax) Property management income 822 539 Reversal, current tax property management income -88 -42 Minority share of earnings -2 -7 EPRA earnings / EPRA EPS 732 490 EPRA earnings / EPRA EPS per share 5.54 5.14 SURPLUS RATIO Operating surplus as per income statement 1,080 806 Rental income as per income statement 1,700 1,323 Surplus ratio, % 64 61 110 DIÖS FASTIGHETER ANNUAL REPORT 2017 KEY RATIOS AND DEFINITIONS FINANCIAL KPIS CONT. NET ASSET VALUE Net asset value is the total capital which the company manages on behalf of its owners. Based on this capital, Diös aims to generate returns and growth while maintaining a low risk. Net asset value can also be calculated on a long-term and short-term basis. Long-term NAV is based on the balance sheet after adjusting for items which involve no near-term outgoing payments, which in Diös’ case refers, for example, to the fair value of financial instruments (derivatives) and deferred tax on temporary differences. The current net asset value consists of equity according to the balance sheet after adjusting for the market value of the deferred tax liability. EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV are designed to show the size of the company’s equity in case of a liquidation in the short and long term. These performance indicators can be compared with the company’s share price to obtain a picture of how the shares are valued in relation to equity. 2017 2016 12 mths 12 mths Net asset value Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Equity as per balance sheet 6,887 4,313 Minority share of equity -45 -43 Reversal Fair value of financial instruments 16 43 Deferred tax on temporary differences 1,175 1,023 EPRA NAV (long-term net asset value) 8,033 5,336 EPRA NAV (long-term net asset value) per share, SEK 59.7 56.0 Deductions Fair value of financial instruments -16 -43 Estimated actual deferred tax on temporary differences, approx. 4%1 -209 -180 EPRA NNNAV (short-term net asset value) 7,808 5,113 EPRA NNNAV (short-term net asset value) per share, SEK 58.0 53.7 1 Estimated actual deferred tax has been calculated at approx. four per cent based on a discount rate of three per cent. The calculation is based on the assumption that the property portfolio will be realised over a period of 50 years, with ten per cent of the portfolio being sold directly subject to a nominal tax rate of 22 per cent, and the remaining 90 per cent being sold indirectly through companies subject to a nominal tax rate of six per cent. It is expected that it will be possible to use the tax losses during the year. FINANCIAL RISK The company’s strategy is to own, develop and manage properties in a value-creating sustainable manner that promotes development while maintaining a stable financial risk. This is expressed in the ambition to ensure that the loan-to-value ratio does not exceed 60 per cent over extended periods and to maintain an equity/assets ratio in excess of 30 per cent. The loan-to-value ratio and equity ratio show the company’s financial stability while the interest coverage ratio shows the company’s ability to pay interest. These key ratios are deemed to be relevant for investors and analysts from a financial risk perspective. They also constitute covenants from the company’s lenders and the Board has defined targets for these key ratios, which are used to govern the company’s activities. 2017 2016 12 mths 12 mths Loan-to-value ratio Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Interest-bearing liabilities 11,104 8,013 Investment properties 19,457 13,683 Loan-to-value ratio, % 57.1 58.6 Equity/assets ratio Equity 6,887 4,313 Total assets 19,708 13,920 Equity/assets ratio, % 34.9 31.0 Interest coverage ratio Property management income 822 539 Reversal Net financial items 191 204 Total 1,013 743 Financial costs 191 206 Interest coverage ratio, times 5.3 3.6 DIÖS FASTIGHETER ANNUAL REPORT 2017 111 KEY RATIOS AND DEFINITIONS FINANCIAL KPIS CONT. OTHER KEY RATIOS Other key ratios refer to a number of measures of return which the company uses to describe various aspects of the statement of financial position and to give investors and analysts further information about the operations. The company reports return on equity, equity per share and cash flow per share, as these performance indicators show the company’s results and profitability, equity on a per share basis, and the company’s ability to fulfil its obligations and pay dividends to the shareholders. These alternative performance indicators supplement the picture given of Diös’ financial performance and enable investors and analysts to gain a better understanding of the company’s return and results. Yield is a measure of the results generated by the properties in relation to their market value. It shows the profitability of the properties and is considered to provide supplementary information for investors and analysts concerning the risk in the portfolio. The debt/equity ratio is presented in order to supplement the picture of Diös’ financial situation. It shows the ratio of interest-bearing liabilities to equity. The measure is considered to enhance investors’ and analysts’ ability to assess the company’s financial stability. 2017 2016 12 mths 12 mths Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Return on equity, % 18.3 20.6 Equity per share, SEK 51.2 45.3 Rental income, SEKm 1,700 1,323 Cash flow per share, SEK Profit before tax 1,261 957 Reversal, unrealised change in value Properties -402 -337 Derivatives -27 -91 Depreciation and amortisation 2 2 CURRENT TAX -43 -26 Total 791 504 Number of shares at end of period (‘000) 132,041 95,290 Cash flow per share, SEK 6.00 5.29 Earnings per share, SEK 7.78 8.66 Debt/equity ratio, times 1.6 1.9 OTHER INFORMATION Diös also reports data for economic occupancy, rental value and net leasing, as these performance indicators provide a more in-depth picture of the company’s financial performance with regard to revenues in the properties and thus also in the company.
