More than 30 years of experience in the field, taught us that the best way to ensure students efficiently benefit from our grants, is to closely follow up on their educational journey, therefore limiting the number of schools towards a better management of the distributed funds. This improved way of looking at the recipients of our financial contributions, led us often to increase selectively the amount of individual grants in favor of a more effective and efficient impact.
