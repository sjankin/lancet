Due to the active involvement of its teams, the MHA Division also worked on the design of several new products. A new 22-metre high aerial work platform (220 TJ) was presented at the APEX trade fair in Amsterdam, and two rotating telehandlers (MRT 2470 & MRT 3050) at an innovative “Keynote” presentation streamed on all the group’s digital media worldwide. The other ranges were refreshed with new heavy-load models (MHT), 4W truck-mounted forklifts, and a roughterrain forklift truck (MC18), strengthening the group’s pioneering leadership on this market segment. These innovative products are a result of working closely with users, whether in the agricultural, construction or industrial sectors. Maintaining the image of reliability of its product ranges is the Manitou group’s primary objective. With its new Easy MANAGER app for smartphones and tablets, the Manitou group offers a connected solution allowing real-time access to the machine’s key data such as the fuel consumption or engine temperature. This tool makes it possible to perform remote diagnostics on the machine and to geolocate it before a technician arrives to work on it, thus performing faster maintenance. The spare parts business also grew in 2017 with the launch of the new Reman offering for the refurbishment of original parts. By committing to a circular economy policy, which recycles waste, the group enables its users to reduce the total cost of ownership of their machine with tested, verified and refurbished parts under warranty. Currently, 128 telehandler parts are included in this offering. Already available in France, Germany, Italy and the UK, the offering will be available to other European countries in 2018. Due to an unprecedented number of launches, the Compact Equipment Products Division saw a record level of business for its Gehl and Mustang brands. Some of the new models being marketed are: telescopic loaders, excavators, articulated loaders, skid-steers and track loaders for the rental market. With the incorporation of a site dedicated to compact models in India, the Manitou group is adding a range of backhoe loaders to its offering and expanding its production of skid-steers to emerging markets. All of the Gehl & Mustang products are engineered and designed according to the requirements of each customer.

The group is active in 140 countries. MHA DIVISION – MATERIAL HANDLING AND ACCESS The MHA division designs, assembles and distributes telehandlers (fixed, rotating, truck-mounted and heavy-load), masted forklift trucks (rough terrain, semi-industrial and industrial as well as truck-mounted), aerial work platforms and warehousing equipment. FIXED TELEHANDLERS With a range of 6 to 18 metres and a lifting capacity of up to 6 tons, fixed “PERFORMANCE” HEAVY-LOAD FORKLIFT TRUCKS telehandlers have applications in the construction industry as well as agriculture. The high-performance, rough terrain equipment allows us to offer specialised handling solutions for the environmental, mining and industrial sectors, as well Manitou offers the most complete product range to meet all of these sectors’ as to institutional customers such as the armed forces, and organisations such needs. as the UN, civil protection bodies, etc. Within the construction industry, end-users are mainly tradespeople (masons, This equipment, with attachments such as tyre clamps or cylinder handlers, roofers, etc.) and regional, national or international rental companies. They work can be used to maintain large, heavy machinery. in the residential, non-residential and renovation industries. These users are looking for straightforward, multi-purpose products, whose handling capabilities The highest-performing equipment can lift loads of over 35 tons to a height of make them ideal for efficiently distributing materials on construction sites. up to 14 metres. A large number of attachments (bucket, jib, winch, etc.) are available for our telehandlers, enabling them to be used for a broad range of applications. The equipment utilisation rate is around 500 hours a year. Equipment made for the agricultural sector is engineered to withstand intensive daily use. It consists of 6 to 10 metre telehandlers, which can be equipped with a multitude of attachments (bucket, mixing bucket, clamp, etc.) for performing common day-to-day tasks (mucking out, cleaning, feeding cattle, unloading silos, handling bales of straw, loading and unloading materials, etc.). For example, stockbreeders use telehandlers at a rate of around 1,500 hours per year, which is more than they use their tractors. 8 AERIAL WORK PLATFORMS TRUCK-MOUNTED FORKLIFTS The platforms designed and marketed by the group include articulated, The “Manitransit” forklift trucks are compact forklifts that use telescopic booms telescopic and vertical platforms.

RISK INSURANCE COVER The group has taken out insurance policies with top-ranking insurance companies to cover its strict liability and property damage, including operating losses. The group has strengthened coordination of its insurance policies by the parent company in order to optimize the total premiums and improve cover. In particular, the group has established a Master strict liability policy which encompasses almost all its subsidiaries, including Manitou Americas. This Master policy tops up the cover provided by the policies taken out locally. On the date on which this report was signed, the insured sum for strict liability was €50 million per claim and per insurance year. Property damage policies are generally of the ‘all-risks except’ type for insured sums that correspond to the risks identified. Other insurance contracts have been taken out by the group, in particular to cover credit risks, the vehicle fleet and personal injury, as well as environmental damage. 38 3.5.

AREA 1: A GROUP THAT CREATES SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS In our products and our activities, we have responsibility for our environmental, economic and social footprint. FACTORING IN PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OUR CHALLENGE: ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT ON THE LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF A MACHINE THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE CYCLE (2013) In order to understand more clearly where the hot spots of our activity are end of life located, we conducted several specific studies: • A multi-criteria life cycle analysis, in 2012-2013, looking at the life cycle 15% of a benchmark agricultural machine from our product range, the MLT 840. • An assessment of the company's carbon footprint covering its entire emissions scope(1) in 2012. Raw materials manufacturing • Each year, an assessment of the carbon footprint as per the regulatory emissions scope(2). The scope includes the three emissions Scopes defined by the Greenhouse Gas 80% (1) (GHG) Protocol: Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from electricity consumption) and Scope 3 (other indirect emissions throughout the value chain). 5% (2) The regulatory emissions scope concerns Scopes 1 and 2 only; measurement is only Use mandatory once every four years, but we undertake the assessment each year.

However, the group is concerned about this issue and is proposing alterations to its products from the design stage in order to facilitate end-of-life management of its equipment. OUR CHALLENGE: PRODUCT-SERVICE SYSTEMS The Manitou group operates in a society in which the consumption of goods, which was once the norm, is gradually shifting towards economy of use. The used, leasing and all-inclusive services markets makes it possible to sever the ties between value creation and the use of non-renewable resources and energy consumption. This change in model as regards machine ownership should promote the durability and pooled use of our machines. This calls for innovation in supporting end customers, because the value of our products no longer resides solely in the quality of our machines, but also in the economic value that our services can provide. In partnership with our network of dealerships, the Services & Solutions division is developing solutions that meet these new needs in order to support individual customers more effectively in the use of their equipment: ●● The network of 1 500 Manitou dealerships spread throughout 140 countries and the 2 000 regularly-trained expert technicians offer support to users, from purchase of the equipment through to after-sales service. ●● Maintenance contracts help keep machines in good working order and retain better value for money for the machine. ●● Financing offers and long-term leases with associated services, “ALL-IN” deals facilitate investments, regardless of the activity of the customer. ●● Warranty extensions provide added value, protecting the equipment beyond the contractual warranty. 2017 Registration Document Part 4.

This new feature of the MHA division will have a major impact on hood reliability and durability. 50 SUPPORT USERS IN REDUCING RISKS: The group would like to raise awareness of best practices for using equipment in complete safety, and make it easier for users to get to grips with our machines. To this end, 300 video clips on machine handling were recorded in 2017 and will be made available in the media library of the new website reduce-program.com. These clips include instructions and best practices, covering a large number of ? topics related to the use of all the machines in our range. It will also be possible to download Basic Instruction Sheets (BIS), to make it easier for for users to understand the basics, as well as all the instruction handbooks. USER HEALTH AND SAFETY: Prevention posters on how to use machines safely will also be downloadable. It is also planned to develop, with the help of the relevant stakeholders, REDUCE Risks tailor-made offers and options, addressing specific safety issues with respect to our products.

HEALTH AND SAFETY AT OUR SITES OUR CHALLENGE: THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES Every day, more than 1 500 operators work in our factories manufacturing mechanically welded structures (chassis, booms and masts), assembly or in paint booths. These various positions come with risks for the operators: handling heavy loads, unsuitable work postures, the dangerous nature of the machines used, etc. The other main risks stem from: • The workstation: mechanical or manual tools, welding and grinding devices, etc. • The workstation environment: movement of people and machines, risks of eye injuries, noise and vibrations, etc. • The use of chemical products. We therefore ensure that prevention and training are among our priority actions. 2017 Registration Document Part 4.

They contribute to acidification, eutrophication and high concentrations of ground-level ozone. In 2015, at the Ancenis site, the paint finishing shop, which alone accounts for 45% of the ENERGY MANAGEMENT site's solvent emissions, was equipped with electrostatic spray guns, delivering Across the entire scope covered by environmental reporting, an 11% reduction in an improved application rate for parts. This led to a significant drop in paint energy consumption (electricity and gas) per unit of output was recorded in 2017: consumption and, as a result, a fall in VOC emissions. ENERGY CONSUMPTION (KWH/TRUCK EQUIVALENT) WASTE MANAGEMENT Our main action drivers in terms of waste management lie in the quality of at2500 source sorting (the quantity of waste generated is linked to the level of our activity 2130 and the packaging received from our suppliers). Furthermore, non-hazardous 1931 2000 1717 waste is almost all re-used, recycled or recovered. Only the Beaupréau site sends this kind of waste to a local landfill site, after an overall environmental 1500 assessment concluded that it was better in this specific case to favour proximity 1000 over recovery. Of our ordinary industrial waste, 72% is recycled, 17% is turned to energy, 7% is reused and 4% sent to landfill (as compared with 6% in 2016). 500 In 2017, a 9% reduction in the volume of industrial waste generated was observed. 0 2015 2016 2017 As part of its involvement in a European project, STEEEP (Support and Training for an Excellent Energy Efficiency Performance), for reducing energy consumption, the group committed to reducing energy consumption at the Aubinière site by 15% over a three-year period (2015-2018). The target level set for 2017 of reduction of 5% (i.e. equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of 550 homes) was almost achieved (4.1%). 2017 Registration Document Part 4.

PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY In 2017, the construction of the new R&D Tests Centre (the first RT 2012 industrial building at Ancenis) took into account the environmental impacts from its design stage. This made a possible in particular to put in automatic test benches in an area away from water, to install retention tanks and a concreted area to prevent oil leaks coming into contact with a storm basin. This building, close to Marais de Grée, also complied with a number of criteria linked to revegitation of the site. Pollution of a pond on one of our sites at Ancenis was rapidly controlled and contained locally. The exact origin of this oil pollution was identified and the necessary measures taken by the teams, in close cooperation with the Ancenis town hall, the fire brigade and the Amicale des Pêcheurs professional fishermen’s association. This pollution was assessed as “minor” by the Regional Department of the Environment, Planning and Housing (Direction Régionale de l’Environnement, de l’Aménagement et du Logement DREAL). In 2016, five piezometers were installed at the Aubinière site. This project enabled us to meet the requirements for the operating permit, awarded by the local Prefecture on 09/10/2015, relating to the groundwater monitoring programme. The locations of the piezometers were chosen following completion of a hydrogeological study that enabled us to identify the direction of flow of the underground aquifers at the site. The purpose of these piezometers is to monitor the quality of groundwater at various locations on the site. This ensures, therefore, that no pollution occurs that affects the aquatic environment of the site. These indicators are monitored twice per year. 60 4.4. AREA 3: SOLUTIONS IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN The Manitou group places particular importance on the dialogue it maintains with its stakeholders, throughout the regions in which it operates. The CSR strategy is based on the creation of shared value with all of the key players, developed here through: -Suppliers, through a responsible Purchasing policy; -Regional players, with whom interactions ensure that a strong local presence is established. -Civil society, by taking part in socially-responsible actions and managing contracts as ethically as possible. OUR CHALLENGE: CSR SUPPLIER RATINGS STRENGTHENING THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND PARTNERSHIPS Since 2016, the performance assessment criteria for suppliers of production items have been were improved and five CSR criteria added: Responsible offer, The sustainability of the group rests largely on the strength of our network Health and Safety, Sourcing and Suppliers, Environment and HR Development of suppliers.

Through this new report on the programme, the students took part in a French Education system sponsorship policy, the group wishes to invest in education to support the new competition, “Je Filme le Métier qui me Plaît ( I film the job that I like ). The reward generations with their personal and professional development. obtained was showcased during the 2016 Elevation Days to all employees at the sites involved. The partnership continued in 2017 with support for a new intake of students. One of the major areas of our involvement in schools is a competition created specifically for students called the Handling the future , based on the name of the group strategy. This competition is intended to promote and encourage innovation in industry, whilst developing our local partnerships with the region's engineering schools and technical colleges. Aimed at engineering or design students, the principle behind the first edition in 2016 was to come up with an innovative handling solution that improves the practical use of a machine and makes a contribution in terms of Sustainable Development. The edition launched at the end of 2017, proposes that future engineers imaging and propose a workstation for a Manitou operator for the year 2020. A platform devoted to this competition will become available in 2018. 62 ETHICAL PRACTICES AND FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION In 2010, the group decided to adopt an ethical charter promoting values of integrity and responsibility, that applies both to the company as a legal entity and to all employees: ●● Compliance with the core conventions and laws (Human Rights Charter, ILO convention and OECD guidelines); ●● Principles of integrity with regard to all stakeholders. Protection of the health and safety of employees, customers and other stakeholders; ●● Observe the rights of employees as regards mutual respect, equality, confidentiality, freedom of expression and skills development; ●● Respect for the environment through a facility management and improvement policy. In 2015, the signature of the United Nations Global Compact replaced this ethical charter, creating a clearer commitment, more accessible to everyone. Over the past two years, several key actions have been launched: The audit and corporate governance area was strengthened, with the drafting of an internal audit manual and a subsidiary governance manual. The Corporate Governance report (see section 5) provides more details on this matter. All of the group Executive Committee members received training at end of 2016 on topics related to business ethics and ethical practices. A working group was set up to implement the measures and procedures deriving from Law 2016-1601 of 9 December 2016 (the so-called Sapin II law). This working group was composed of officers from the Internal Audit, Legal, HR and Finance Departments and the group’s Corporate Secretary. These measures encompassed the following: ●● The methodology for identifying risks linked to corruption was examined, and a risk-mapping exercise was undertaken by an external consultancy firm; ●● The group finalised implementation of a Gifts policy; ●● An Ethics Committee charter was drawn up with a view to this Committee being set up; ●● The working group also took note of the recommendations of the French Anticorruption Agency (Agence Française Anti-corruption AFA). The Manitou group is also a member of the “Anticorruption Editorial Service Working Party” set up by Middlenext, the French association representing listed SMEs and midcaps. The principal aim of the working party in 2017 was to draw up an anticorruption code and guidelines on its application. This code was adopted by the group's Board of Directors and will be deployed shortly in all the group’s subsidiaries. 2017 Registration Document Part 4. Our commitment to corporate social responsibility 63 4.5. MEASURING AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE Thanks to its level of commitment, the Manitou group has been regularly rewarded by external bodies for its CSR performance. In this section, we also provide information about the methodology used to calculate indicators and the tables of correspondence with the key standards. PRIZES AND REWARDS Group performance on CSR has gained acclaim and been rewarded by the presence of the group in the most significant CSR indices and through winning several awards. In particular: The Manitou group, responding for the fifth year running to the Gaïa Index questionnaire, had a rating in 2017 of 85/100, unchanged from the previous year. We are in 18th place (out of 230) in the general classification and and in 16th place (out of 87) in the classification of companies with Revenue > €500 m . Following its award of the Grand Prix Entreprises et Environnement (Business and Environment Award) by the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy in 2014, the Manitou group was one of the finalists for the 2016 European Business Award for the Environment (EBAE Award) for its REDUCE programme and its overall CSR performance. In September 2016, the Manitou group received the Gouvernance d’or award in the Midcap Corporate Governance category of the Grands Prix du Gouvernement d’Entreprise (Corporate Governance Awards) presented by AGEFI (Agence économique et financière), France's business and financial information agency. This prize was in part related to the group's performance in the Gaïa Index. For the second consecutive year, the group was rewarded by the Purchasing sector at the 11th edition of the Trophées des Achats (purchasing awards) on 19 June 2017, in Paris, being awarded the Business Innovation prize for its suppliers think tank project within the Mechanical Welding ecosystem. METHODOLOGY GUIDE Implementing an annual non-financial reporting system within the Manitou group PROCEDURE is intended to meet several goals: ●● Manage the social, environmental and societal performance of the group; The follow-up procedures are deployed through three main tools: ●● Communicate transparently about the group's major CSR challenges; ●● A methodology guide, which clarifies how the reporting is organised (roles and tasks) and makes it possible to standardise procedures and definitions; ●● Comply with the regulatory requirements of article 225 of the French Law setting out the National Commitment to the Environment (the so-called ●● Two data collection tables for each topic (environment and social) that Grenelle II Act) and the non-financial performance statement (French Decree automatically display any inconsistencies or input errors; of 9 August 2017 on the publication of non-financial information by certain ●● An internal audit table, which is used to follow up the validation procedure. major companies and corporate groups). In order to gradually integrate all the subsidiaries, all the procedures and data In this regard, Manitou drew inspiration from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) collection tools have been translated into English. guidelines and complies with the principles of the UN Global Compact. Each of the indicators is followed up on a half-yearly or yearly basis and is SCOPE reported on by the topic managers. Since the first reporting exercise in 2012, the group has acquired reporting Consistency (indicator scope and definition) is checked by the topic leaders, to procedures and put in place a suitable organisation for gathering the information for whom the data is sent. Lastly, an internal auditor, independent of the procedure, publishing. The scope of the information, initially restricted to France (Manitou BF), is appointed to approve or challenge indicators, by linking them with the action has been gradually extended. The 2017 scope covered: plans rolled out throughout the year or comparing them with source data. For the environmental indicators: all our French and Italian sites. This reporting In order to meet the requirements set out in article 225 of the Grenelle II Law scope therefore covers five of the group's eight production sites (including and its implementing decree of 24 April 2012, the Manitou group commissioned the group's largest manufacturing site) and the spare parts logistics centre. the FINEXFI firm of independent verifiers to certify the presence and fairness of Moreover, Manitou Americas, where the remaining three production sites are the social, environmental and societal information published in its management based, will trial environmental reporting for its scope in 2018 and feedback is report. expected the same year. For the social indicators: since 2015, the scope for social reporting has covered all the Manitou group subsidiaries as regards social information related to headcount. Only Manitou BF, for France, Manitou Americas for the United States and Manitou Italia (covering 87% of headcount) have included the indicators relating to compensation and safety training within the scope of their CSR reporting. The training, workplace accidents and absenteeism indicators only cover France and Italy (65% of headcount). The scope for France excludes LMH (33 employees) and CFM Ile de France (creation in 01/01/2017). The Internal Audit Department conducts (HR) audits for all the subsidiaries. The companies acquired by the group in 2017 (Manitou Equipment India MEI) and Marpoll Pty Ltd (LiftRite) have not been incorporated into this reporting. With regard to overall management of the CSR strategy, indicators could be improved to report more effectively on progress with action plans and to reflect more accurately the reality within the group on the various topics. 64 CLARIFICATIONS REGARDING METHODOLOGY – Operator: any member of staff whose main activity is to contribute directly to the production processes.

The group has decided not to make asset group to which it belongs (cash-generating unit). Cash-generating units use of this option. are coherent subsets that produce independent cash flows. DEPRECIATION is calculated according to the estimated useful lives of the At Manitou Group level, the main cash-generating units (CGUs) identified different categories of assets, using the straight-line method. The amortisable correspond to the manufacturing and marketing of handling equipment, the amount is the difference between the cost of the asset and the residual value, manufacturing of masts, the marketing of spare parts and attachments, and the which is considered to be zero for all amortisable assets. financing of sales of handling equipment to end users. The CGUs are part of the operating sectors defined by the group. The main depreciation periods are as follows: -patents: 5 years, The recoverable value of an asset or an asset group is its fair value less disposal costs or its expected useful value, whichever is greater. The expected useful -computer software: 3 years, value is the expected discounted cash flow from the use of the cash-generating -complex information systems ERP: 7 years, unit under consideration. -development costs: 5 years. The estimated cash flows are derived from 5-year plans approved by Group management. The assumptions underlying the preparation of these plans Note 1.9.

DERIVATIVES In order to secure a maximum level of financial costs, the group has set up, in line with the new financing agreement, interest rate caps and swaps. These derivatives are described as future cash flow hedging instruments. They are considered highly effective at 31 December 2017. The characteristics of the Caps and Swaps at 31 December 2017 are as follows: CAP Fair value at in thousands of euros Average rate of CAP Notional 31.12.2017 Less than one year 0 1 to 2 years Q4 2021 0.50% 25 0 SWAP Average rate of Fair value at in thousands of euros SWAP Notional 31.12.2017 Less than one year Q3 2018 0.325% 25 0 1 to 2 years 0 0 0 At 31 December 2017, the group also holds forward sale contracts for currencies designed to cover future GBP, AUD, RUB and ZAR cash flows in euros for an amount of €130m. The group also holds forward purchase contracts for currencies designed to cover future USD and PLN cash flows into euros for an amount of €9.4m. These hedges are considered effective within the meaning of IFRS. The change in fair value of these instruments is therefore recorded in the balance sheet liabilities for €2.1m, in the balance sheet assets for €1.9m with shareholders’ equity as offset for €1.2m, with the valuation of forward points being recorded under financial income for -€0.8m and +€0.3m under operating income. 2017 Registration Document Part 6.

This change has no significant impact on the company’s net income. The period began on 1 January 2017 and ended on 31 December 2017, spanning 12 months. The Notes (or tables) below are an integral part of the annual financial statements. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PERIOD LITIGATION In May 2017, action was taken against the Manitou BF by J.C. BAMFORD Excavators Limited (JCB) for infringing two European patents regarding certain features related to the control system of the overload cut-off of certain telehandlers marketed in the European Union. Financially, the claimant is seeking preliminary damages (subject to further evaluation) of €20 million before the French court. The legal proceedings are ongoing. The legal proceedings continued in the second half of the year. However, no significant event occurred during that period. In terms of the progress of the proceedings, the financial risk liable to be incurred is difficult to estimate. Moreover, payouts in respect of these claims seem to be unlikely in view of the evidence put forward by Manitou to defend itself. As a result, no provision in respect of these claims has been recognised in the company’s financial statements. SHARE INVESTMENTS TEREX On 8 May 2017, Manitou BF purchased 100% of the shares of Terex Equipment Private Limited (TEPL) in India. Created in 2003, TEPL is specialised in the design, manufacture and distribution of construction equipment, primarily backhoe loaders and skid-steers. In 2016, TEPL generated sales of €30m essentially in the Indian sub-continent. The company’s new name following its consolidation is Manitou Equipment India (MEI). 2017 Registration Document Part 6.
