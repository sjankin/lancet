It is not about mitigating harm, but rather adding real value to all those who interact with us. We see ourselves as a company that nourishes the lives of our customers, our employees, our customers, the communities in which we operate and our planet. Which is why at the end of every day we will ask ourselves: what role did I play in nourishing the lives of our customers? In what ways did I nourish the lives of my colleagues? How did I nourish the communities in which we operate? And how did I nourish the earth on which we live? Our Sustainability Policy, Nourishing Life, guides all of BMMI’s employees in each of our countries of operation. It is driven by 75 commitments, which are continuously reviewed and revised, under three over-lapping themes: Truth, Zero Waste, and Wellbeing. ZERO WASTE TRUTH To be wasteful and to squander BMMI’s first corporate value resources when many are in is Honesty. This means need is a terrible thing. While communicating respectfully, our Sustainability Policy tackles truthfully and transparently with traditional waste, we also our customers, our colleagues, view waste differently. Wasted and with governments in each talent. Wasted opportunities. endeavour that we undertake. Wasted time and energy. Wasted It also means being true to potential. WELLBEING ourselves, our values, and our purpose as a business. As a business, we believe we should play a role in nourishing and improving the quality of life for all who are associated with BMMI. This includes our employees, our customers, communities, and the planet. 10 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY We understand that in order to manage our environmental, social and economic aspects, we also need to look at our stakeholder relationships, whether that is through our workplace, supply chain, community engagements or so forth. With our highly globalised economy, we will continue to adopt selective CSR programmes that make business sense and support our core values as we scale up. BMMI strives each and every day to give back not only to the local communities where we operate, but also to ensure, first and foremost, that our employees are prioritised and that their basic needs are met. As such, we have adopted a comprehensive Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program which implements strategic initiatives across our countries of operation. One example is our work with the Bahrain Society for Children We’re proud of our history of contributing positively with Behavioral & Communication towards the communities in which we operate, and Difficulties as the first business host we always aim to create a sustainable impact that for an Employment Facilitation Training Service (EFTS) programme for will have a lasting effect. individuals with disabilities – there is a massive need from the community The initiatives outlined in the next section provide a in the area of inclusive employment series of examples of our commitments during the generation and we can play a key part reporting period. in making a real difference to people. 11 | THINK LOCAL ‘Think Local’ continues to be our guiding principle as far as CSR is concerned, and towards this end, we will continue to invest in the local industry, local food produce and local talent across the territories where we operate. In 2016 and 2017, we were actively involved in providing tactical support to local charities such as the Alia School for Early Intervention, the RIA institute and the Aisha Yateem Family Counselling Centre, to name a few. In Bahrain and Saudi, BMMI operates Alosra supermarket. Originally importing all fresh fruits and vegetables via twice-weekly airfreight deliveries from Europe. BMMI identified and mentored a small, but growing, number of local farmers in greenhouse growing techniques and fertiliser use. Between 2016 and 2017 alone, BMMI purchased over BD500K in locally grown herbs, fruits, and vegetables from Bahraini farmers, which was able to expand the normal produce supply in BMMI’s grocery stores by 20 percent. The produce was then marketed under BMMI’s own ‘Think Local’ brand – appealing to greenconscious consumers and also reducing the costs of importation. Alosra also continues to support other local producers and entrepreneurs including fishmongers and food artisans the majority of which are women. 12 | Young adults with austism gain valuable work experience through BMMI and Alosra supermarket We take inclusivity and diversity very seriously at BMMI. It has been very encouraging and motivating to see how much the trainees have grown and developed throughout the year, and how supportive our customers have been with them as part of the team. The trainees spent a year gaining a multitude of skills in two Alosra stores, Saar and Janabiya, and quickly became some of the team’s favourite employees. It is thanks to our Alosra team for all the effort they put into making sure the students were In April 2017, BMMI was the first organisation well supported and primed for success. It has been approached to become a business partner rewarding to witness the trainees learning skills that for the launch of the Employment Facilitation empower them, as well as prepare them for future Training Service Program (EFTS), conducted in job opportunities at our supermarket and other collaboration with the Bahrain Society for Children businesses. with Behavioural and Communication Difficulties (BSCBCD).

Proper support and an encouraging environment for individuals with disabilities has resulted in productive engagement in society and an opportunity for beneficial inclusion for all those involved. 13 | BMMI supports local non-profit Conserving Bounties to help tackle food waste in Bahrain In an effort to meet our commitment of achieving Being a responsible corporate citizen is at the core zero waste and to directly reach out to the of how business is done at the BMMI Group.

We strive to build a business case for each initiative – in other words, identifying a business need which can be addressed through a CSR initiative. We believe that this makes CSR sustainable in the long run, and drives the business forward in a productive manner. 15 | South Sudan U.S. Embassy English language staff training program The literacy rate of South Sudan, generally, is In the spring of 2017, with the support of Embassy approximately 32% one of the lowest in the world. personnel, training took place three days per week While able to effectively succeed in their job duties during a slow period for Embassy activities (8am through training and effective mentoring, as well as to 10am).

Unfortunately, because the cost of eyewear is expensive in Djibouti, a number of employees joined the team without eyeglasses. This presented a huge risk to their own livelihoods and jeopardises the safety of others. Because we always put the wellbeing of our employees first, and in order to facilitate their daily tasks, we provided employees suffering from impaired vision with the eyeglasses they need. 18 | Capacity building The BMMI Djibouti team has been working That said, the infrastructure for managing the import diligently in full coordination with the World Health of highly temperature sensitive medications and Organization, UNICEF, the United Nations Logistics vaccines was not a specialty of the Government.

Owing to these factors, Djibouti has a modern port, thriving free zone, and sizable transportation fleet along the Ethiopian corridor. However, there are always delays and significant red tape associated with customs and the administration of cargo. Djibouti also has a developed humanitarian logistics sector due to the fact that BMMI manages a food aid preposition warehousing and logistics program in Djibouti for the Horn of Africa, including Yemen, and stores up to 30,000 metric tons of basic food aid commodities at any given time for re-export and distribution. 19 | HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLE 1: SUPPLIERS Businesses should support and respect the Suppliers are evaluated for quality, ISO protection of internationally proclaimed human certifications for Quality Management (9001) rights; and Occupational Health & Safety (18001), Environmental Management (14001), and Food PRINCIPLE 2: Safety Management (22000).

The Talent function is tasked with making sure our culture is sustained and carried forward with new generations of leaders, as well as ensuring that they foster and practice continuous growth, in order to adapt to our evolving customer and business needs. We want to be able to recognise and engage all the hard workers and others who display promising potential through development, which of course comes in many forms. 29 | ENVIRONMENT PRINCIPLE 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; PRINCIPLE 8: Undertake initatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and PRINCIPLE 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.
