This annual review reports our continued commitment to corporate responsibility initiatives across the firm. I am sure I have said this before, but even if I have, I make no apologies for repeating myself: because I need to say again that I never cease to be extremely pleased about the extent of our firmwide CR engagement and this year is no different. I am quite stunned by the sheer amount of CR activity undertaken by so many colleagues at all career levels across the network and I am very grateful for their contributions to such an extraordinary range of innovative activities. COLIN PASSMORE This review encapsulates the highlights of another year when many individuals have given SENIOR PARTNER their time and professional service to support communities, organisations, and people across the world. We continue to measure the impact of our business operations within our workplace and within the local communities in which we operate across the key strands of: pro bono; social inclusion; diversity & inclusion; charitable giving and environmental sustainability. We have made good progress in recent years and I believe strongly that continued collaboration with our clients, suppliers and external organisations will further accelerate progress. I would like to highlight a few of our significant achievements this year. The increased participation and success of our Access to Justice Programme under the UK Collaborative Plan on pro bono. Launched in 2015, the programme delivers end to end case work for welfare benefit appeals, focusing on disability, an area of law no longer covered by legal aid. The programme has captured the interest of our partners, our colleagues and our clients who have given their time to support this important work which has impacted so positively on a number of vulnerable individuals. We are hugely encouraged to have been ranked in The Times Top 50 Employers for Women for the fifth year. We remain committed to improving the gender diversity of the firm, striving to provide the best platform for female progression. We know that it will take time to change the overall composition of the partnership but I am confident that the steps we are taking to improve and strengthen the pipeline of talented women at each career stage, will lead to long-lasting progress and positively benefit the inclusive culture of our firm. The eradication of a number of single use disposables from our London office. We have entirely removed plastic cups, straws and vending machine coffee cups throughout the office, with plans in place to eliminate all single-use disposables over the next year. We continue to support the UN Global Compact and confirm our commitment to the initiative and its principles as demonstrated in this Communication on Progress. Over the coming year we will continue to challenge ourselves to achieve more to support the firm’s objectives in relation to CR. Please take the time to look at the inspiring work captured in this annual review and my thanks again to everyone who has contributed to our programme this year. Page 1 INTERNATIONAL PRO BONO PROGRAMME Eighteen of our 22 offices are currently involved in pro bono work and in 2017/18 we carried out 16,145 pro bono hours. Pro bono is governed by an International Pro Bono Committee, chaired by Pro Bono Partner Richard Dyton, which meets monthly to set the direction of the Pro Bono Programme and approve new pro bono clients. Our programme focuses on providing advice to individuals and organisations in the following areas: RICHARD DYTON CHAIR OF INTERNATIONAL Access to Justice and advice to individuals: PRO BONO COMMITTEE Disability benefits appeals. At clinics including the Battersea Legal advice centre, the Queen Mary Legal Advice Centre and De Klinik (Netherlands). To prisoner’s through the Prisoner’s Advice Centre letter writing scheme.

She was too unwell to deal with the process alone. A Simmons & Simmons volunteer lawyer successfully challenged this decision at the Tribunal and the client was awarded a backdated payment of £7,150 with an advance weekly award equating to £6,500. This was an immense relief for the family. Clinical Programmes We continue to support other UK Access to Justice Initiatives including the Queen Mary Law Centre Law for Forces Clinic, the Battersea Legal Advice Centre Clinic and assistance to prisoners through the Prisoner’s Advice Service. In our Netherlands offices we provide student run legal aid entities in Utrecht, Amsterdam and Leiden with educational support on aspects of consumer law.

Page 7 OUR WORKPLACE We have a longstanding commitment to improving diversity and providing our colleagues with an inclusive working environment which supports people to maximise their potential, and where opportunities are genuinely open to all. Workplace diversity We continue to support, on a pro bono basis, charities which focus on the arts and diversity and inclusion, in line with our Corporate Responsibility strategy. Our London Employment, Pensions and Incentives department has worked with a number of charitable organisations including Macmillan, London’s Air Ambulance, Central London Samaritans and Women for Women International over the last year. We have provided a range of legal advice to these organisations including: general advisory work drafting contractual documentation for both employees and consultants working on sensitive employee relations issues defending Employment Tribunal claims, and advising on redundancies. Our commitment to Principle 6 of the UN Global Compact (to eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation) underpins the complete cycle of all our employees and we are proud supporters of Stonewall, Working Families, OUT Leadership, and the Timewise Foundation. The firm also hosted Timewise’s Partners Round Table on the Taylor Review. Firmwide Inclusive Leadership & Unconscious Bias Training In the last year we delivered training to all our people in Amsterdam, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, London, Milan, Munich and Paris. Training is delivered in person and includes discussion on unconscious preferencing, developing work relationships, parity in work allocation, challenging non-inclusive behaviours, harnessing diversity and the importance of being able to bring ones whole self to work. Page 8 Gender balance “We are committed to becoming ‘the’ law firm for women to progress; redefining opportunities for women of future generations to come.” MAHRIE WEBB, UK Gender Balance Partner Improving our gender balance remains a key business priority. We are striving to provide the best platform for female progression. We are committed to improving the representation of women in the partnership and in senior management roles. To achieve this, we have implemented a number of programmes and processes to support career development for women and to provide every opportunity to enable them to progress through our career structure. The combination of sponsorship and mentoring, formal accountability, stretching targets, mandatory training, client collaboration and open communication assists us to reach our goals. We know that it will take time to change the overall composition of the partnership but we are confident that the steps we are taking to improve and strengthen the pipeline of talented women at each stage, will lead to long-lasting progress. “I find the mentoring and coaching programmes incredibly beneficial, as they allow me to understand that other people can feel as you do. Thus, it is notably possible to exchange in a caring environment – the different ways to handle the issues we are all facing on a daily basis”. JENNIFER BESSI, Associate, commenting on the Paris mentoring initiative Flexible working Formal and informal flexible working is offered to all colleagues. We are the first international law firm to implement flexible hiring. We are increasingly seeing candidates join us with a formal flexible working arrangement in place and agreed at the start of their employment with the firm. We were named in the Times Top 30 employers for women for the fifth year. “Making the request for flexible working was very easy. The hard bit was actually deciding to make the request! I made the decision while on my sabbatical at the beginning of 2016. I felt that there were a number of things that I wanted to do, but just wasn’t getting the time to do any of them. The reaction I got, from clients, from other partners and within the team, was very positive and supportive, in some cases surprisingly so.” NICK BENWELL, Partner, Head of the Crime, Fraud & Investigations group.
