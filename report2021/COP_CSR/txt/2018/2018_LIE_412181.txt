January 2018 United Nations Global Compact Annual Communication on Progress 2017 CEO Statement – UNGC Business Commitment We as VP Bank are committed to the principle of corporate sustainability – consistently and wholeheartedly. For this reason, we joined the worldwide largest movement of sustainable companies in 2016, the United Nations initiative (UNGC). We drive our business according to the ten UN Principles on human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption, and we take measures to achieve social objectives. As an international private banking group, we do not only focus on one area, but on a diversified portfolio of niches that complement each other in an ideal way and offer valuable synergies. Sustainability as a holistic approach also includes the responsible management of the funds entrusted to us. Moreover, sustainable investment solutions and investment concepts become more and more popular. The basic idea is the consideration of sustainability criteria in the selection of the financial investments in an ecological and social point of view. We emphasise respect and sense of responsibility. This is reflected in the social interaction of our employees as well as in the cooperation with our clients and partners. At the same time, we are committed to use resources sparingly to preserve our environment. We would like to thank our employees and partners, whose extraordinary commitment will enable us to reliably and comprehensively achieve our visions and goals of a sustainable and responsible bank in the years ahead.

Code of Conduct violations are met with uncompromising disciplinary measures and consequences in accordance with labour law. No violations occurred in the year under review. VP Bank is committed to diversity on every employee and executive level. For example, the Board of Directors has intensively dealt with this issue and developed a competence analysis regarding the future challenges. With two new female members of the Board of Directors from Legal/Compliance and HR/Business Development, the missing competences could be perfectly combined. Since 2017, the Executive Board has a female member. Physically and/or mentally challenged persons are also among the VP Bank Group employees.

Since April 2017, VP Bank offers a flexible investment solution in the field of sustainability, which can be customised to the client’s individual requirements. The investments are selected according to the ESG approach in consideration of ecological, social and business management factors. VP Bank’s Code of Conduct (CoC) requires that the bank and its employees conserve natural resources as much as possible. On all business decisions, the overall environmental impacts are taken into account during the decision-making process. For many years, VP Bank has endeavoured to reduce its energy, paper and water consumption while also reducing the amount of waste generated. Energy conservation measures focus mainly on initiatives in the construction and renovation areas, heating and cooling systems and lighting at the Liechtenstein site. At that location, a separate energy report is prepared that also includes a carbon balance sheet. This report is available on the VP Bank homepage. VP Bank suppliers are also urged to come up with environUN Global Compact · VP Bank · January 2018 13/17 mentally friendly alternatives on their own and required to supply only merchandise and goods that meet the Liechtenstein environmental laws. Volunteering Day is a key CSR initiative. Employees are given the opportunity to perform volunteer work at a social institution, training programme or environmental organisation one day out of the calendar year. In 2017, there were 25 approved volunteering opportunities. In order to offer an alternative to motorised transport and promote environmentally sustainable transport, VP Bank has made four e-bikes available to its employees in Liechtenstein since 2016. The bicycles are used primarily to travel back and forth between the Vaduz and Triesen sites, but also for other work-related trips. Five free bus season tickets are available for the same route. With a donation for the project “Drink & Donate”, VP Bank promotes the sustainable handling of tap water and thus supports drinking water projects in developing countries. “Drink & Donate” is a non-profit association who supports the consumption of tap water instead of bottled water, which must be carried on roads. This way, the environment is protected, the carbon footprint is improved and energy is saved.

For its head office in Vaduz, VP Bank has developed a mobility concept that has proved to be very successful: The goals – to reduce automobile use, foster environmental awareness and promote public transport – were met. The concept is exemplary for the region and in 2011 won the “Zurich Climate Award”, which honours measures to improve energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions.

Measures include regular training of client advisors and the monitoring of regulations included in the Staff Regulations and Code of Conduct. In addition to the values and management principles, the Code of Conduct sets forth VP Bank’s commitment to an ethically correct management policy. VP Bank pursues a vision of inspiring through exceptional client experiences and winning new clients through favourable recommendations. This vision requires close client relations and trust. VP Bank promotes both through voluntary commitments to align its business practices with fundamental ethical values and by creating a solid foundation of business principles. The CoC makes VP Bank’s ethical principles binding and serves as a guide to proper business conduct. VP Bank’s Staff Regulations provide additional guidance on proper conduct as regards banking secrecy, confidentiality, data integrity, equality, social media guidelines, conflicts of interest, insider information and data protection. The Staff Regulations constitute instructions and are integral part of every employment contract. They apply to all VP employees. We are not aware of any violations of anti-corruption laws or directives in 2017 and therefore the bank did not have to take any corrective action. UN Global Compact · VP Bank · January 2018 15/17 9.
