SEK Annual Report 2017  5 The positive trend for Swedish exports was reflected in SEK’s lending. Looking back, 2017 was an eventful year for Swedish exports and for SEK. Many companies were able to win export contracts with the help of our financing solutions and, internally, we focused on laying the foundations for further broadening our offering. We have satisfied clients and a committed staff, which is a good starting point for continued positive expansion of our operations.

From a historical perspective, the 100 largest exporters have been SEK’s clients and, in the last few years, we have also worked actively to reach medium-sized companies. We “It is gratifying to note that Sweden have visited many new potential clients, both alone and in is holding pace with the macro collaboration with banks. We have also expanded our existing environment as regards exports to partnerships with the Swedish Export Credits Guarantee Board and Almi in the form of collaborative client offerings emerging markets.” and activities. An analysis published by Business Sweden showed the export trend from the start of the millennium and compared the “We have completed a number of new trend until 2015 with the performance in 2016. Given the recruitments to strengthen client targets in the government’s export strategy, the analysis is interesting since it shows that Sweden is on track for relations both in Stockholm and in recapturing market shares. Gothenburg.” The positive trend for Swedish exports was also reflected in SEK’s lending. During the year, SEK’s new lending Together with other organizations, SEK has endeavored to amounted to Skr 89.3 billion (2016: Skr 54.8 billion). This identify financing solutions for Swedish environmental was one of the highest figures ever, if one excludes the two technology exports for areas including smart cities.

A large part of growth and job opportunities is created by medium-sized companies, which “In other words, this has been an active in all likelihood means that the demand for export credits, year for our lending and just as active which was previously mainly the domain of large companies, internally at SEK.” will also include medium-sized companies in the future.

Due to opportunities for most companies. Our aim is for the new 6 SEK Annual Report 2017 opportunities provided by digitalization to lead to simpler Stockholm, February 22, 2018 solutions for our clients. Therefore, SEK recruited two new members to its executive management during the year: an IT Manager and a Head of Marketing & Business Development. SEK is a state-owned company with a far-reaching and vital mission. We are a stable partner with a substantial contingency for new lending and we will continue to strive to develop together with our clients. In this way, our Catrin Fransson vision — to strengthen the competitiveness of the Swedish Chief Executive Officer export industry, and thereby contribute to creating jobs and sustainable growth in Sweden — can be realized. SEK adheres to the UN’s sustainable development goals and has chosen to integrate the SDG’s most closely related to SEK’s operations together with SEK’s own goals and strategies. SEK Annual Report 2017 7 A business environment with both challenges and opportunities SEK is impacted by factors in its macro environment. Some of the events worldwide create new opportunities to develop the offering and to identify new business opportunities. There are also challenges that require SEK to refine its operations and how it works. Low interest rates The recovery of the industrialized economies is progressing well and they no longer need stimulus packages. Central banks are therefore starting to normalize monetary policy, which in practical terms means scaling back their bond-buying programs and raising interest rates. Despite interest rates being on the rise, low interest rates will prevail for a good while yet. Urbanization Urbanization is extensive and is transforming the entire world. More than half of the world’s population live in urban areas. By 2050, this proportion is expected to have risen to 70 percent. This rapid, mass movement of people to cities requires new investments. SEK works together with other facilitators in Team Sweden to be able to offer financing for sustainable cities and system export. Technological development, digitalization and fintech The pace of technological development is rapid and digitalization has made major inroads and changed many industries and exporters’ business models. SEK is also affected by this and works closely with its clients to gain insight to be able to adapt its offering and its own business model. The clients’ needs guide SEK in its own digitalization. 8 SEK Annual Report 2017 Climate change Climate change remains in focus. There is a considerable international need for investment over the next 15 years if Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement are to become reality. A market for green financing is being developed to mobilize private capital for climate change projects at the same time as the interest in green bonds is growing among international investors. SEK promotes achieving global sustainability goals with green loans aimed at reducing GHG emissions. Exports to emerging markets In the years ahead, growth will probably be low in the more mature markets that currently account for the majority of Swedish exports’ business. Asia, the Middle East and several African countries will account for most of the growth. SEK, together with the other state export promotion agencies, will help strengthen the Swedish export industry in order to reach new markets. Sustainability work is of the utmost importance and SEK has extensive experience of working in complex markets. Growth comes from small and medium-sized enterprises SME’s are where many of tomorrow’s export successes will be found, and this is primarily where the new jobs will be created in Sweden. In its export strategy, the government states that the growth and internationalization of these companies is crucial for Sweden’s welfare. The government’s exportpromoting activities also need to be able to help these companies, regardless of where in the country they conduct their operations. SEK works together with regional export centers and business partners to ensure it can reach even the smaller companies.

Comments on target attainment SEK gained 13 new clients in 2017, which was a shortfall of one from the target. In 2018, client processing will be further intensified and the target has been raised to 18 new large and medium-sized clients. New lending that qualifies as green loans did not reach the target for 2017. The raised target remains firm for 2018. The aim was to raise SEK’s sustainability rating by one rung in 2017. The outcome was an unchanged rating. SEK will continue efforts to raise its sustainability rating even though the rating is not included in SEK’s strategic targets for 2018. Capital adequacy is above the capital target, but should be viewed over a longer horizon with regard to regulatory changes and growth in business. 12 SEK Annual Report 2017 Follow-up of the public policy assignment The fact that SEK is to administrate the officially supported export credit system (CIRR-system) is a specially commissioned public policy assignment by the Swedish parliament. The socioeconomic value of this assignment should be evaluated in part by measuring the added value that SEK generates in terms of export credits (of which CIRR’s comprise a part) and in part through the stakeholder dialogue. The stakeholder dialogue is presented on page 26. SEK follows up the public policy assignment using a biennial client survey, which will be conducted next in 2018. The results of the 2016 survey included the following: 1. “How SEK’s export credits contribute to execution of the clients’ export transactions” 63 percent of clients who had engaged SEK’s services for export credits stated that SEK’s credits had contributed significantly or very significantly to the execution of their export transactions. 2. “The reason why the exporters decided to collaborate with SEK” The responses are shown as open replies and include the fact that SEK is customer-oriented, that the clients appreciate SEK’s ability to assist medium-sized companies, and that SEK offers long maturities and access to CIRR. 3. “Did the collaboration match the clients’ expectations?” 73 percent of clients stated that the collaboration exceeded their expectations. 18 percent responded that the collaboration significantly exceeded their expectations. 4. “How SEK can further improve its offering of export ­credits” Approximately two thirds of the clients considered SEK as proactive, but that it had improvement potential in this respect and scope to increase its proactivity. 5. “How the clients perceived the Swedish export credit system compared with corresponding systems in key ­competing countries” 87 percent of the client companies consider the Swedish export credit system to be better than the systems in key competitor countries.

SEK divides its work into the areas of anti-corruption and business ethics, environmental and climate concerns, and human rights and labor conditions.

During the year, the work resulted in a joint support from SEK and the EKN for system export. Green bonds SEK’s green loans are financed by issuing green bonds in international capital markets. Green bonds help to diversify SEK’s investor base. Metrics for climate-related risks associated with lending By taking into account the risks linked to climate change in the lending portfolio, SEK creates awareness of how credit ratings and the companies’ business models are affected by measures. Position paper on green bonds impact reporting In 2017, SEK participated in a working group with Nordic public sector issuers of green bonds. At an OECD green financing conference in Paris on October 24, the group launched a framework for how to report the effects of green bonds. The aim is to create a reporting platform for the group’s participants and other Nordic public sector issuers with the aim of making the framework usable for other green bond issuers and investors. Climate change Risks and opportunities for SEK Climate change leads to climate risks, which can affect physical assets when average global temperatures continue to rise resulting in, inter alia, gradually rising sea levels and increased average rainfall. When climate measures are taken, for example in the form of COP21, transition risk arises for governments and companies. Transition risk is defined as non-physical climate-related risks that can impact the value of assets and companies’ business models. Risks include legislative and regulatory changes, raised climate-related taxes, changed production and consumption patterns, and new technology as well as climate-related reputational risks. SEK could potentially be exposed to financial losses due to transition risk if clients’ business models are not adapted to the new conditions. This could entail future credit losses for SEK. Climate-change measures make it possible for SEK to finance exports of Swedish environmental technology. Scenario analysis Climate-related risks are included in sustainability risk, which means that the country, counterparty and transaction are analyzed in the same way as other sustainability risks, which are reported in Note 27. The ongoing risk reporting to the Board includes a scenario analysis that consist of an estimate of SEK’s transition risk exposure and the impact of expected credit losses for various scenarios. Outcome of scenario analysis shows limited impact on SEK. 30 SEK Annual Report 2017 An attractive employer SEK possesses a committed, client-centric culture driven with a focus on solutions, collaboration and professionalism.

Those liquidity investments that were previously classified at fair value pursuant to the fair-value option are also classified at FVTPL due to the portfolio’s business model. Certain fixed-rate liquidity investments were already subject to hedge accounting and, from January 1, 2018, these hedge accounting relationships have been terminated since liquidity investments are now measured at FVTPL. 2 SEK previously applied its own classification for derivatives in its hedge accounting.

The structures are represented both in the security and the derivative hedging the bond. The sensitivity analysis is based on a shift in the interval for correlation between 0.1 and –0.1. The correlation is expressed as a value between 1 and –1, where 0 indicates no relationship, 1 indicates maximum positive relationship and -1 indicates maximum negative relationship. The maximum correlation in the range of unobservable inputs can thus be from 1 to –1. The table presents the scenario analysis of the effect on Level 3-instruments, with maximum positive and negative changes. 2 Of the total impact on profit or loss, the sensitivity effect of SEK’s own credit spread was Skr 211 million (year-end 2016: Skr 244 million) under a maximum scenario and Skr -208 million (year-end 2016: Skr -244 million) under a minimum scenario.

The minimum requirements, which were implemented in Sweden without a transitional period, are 4.5 percent, 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent for Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total own funds, respectively. The minimum requirements apply in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 26, 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (CRR). The change in capital ratios compared to year-end 2016 is primarily due to SEK applying the internal rating-based (IRB) approach to exposures to central and regional governments and to multilateral development banks. 2 Minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement, expressed as a percentage of the total risk-weighted exposure amount. 3 The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio less the statutory minimum requirement of 4.5 percent and less 1.5 percent, which comprises Common Equity Tier 1 capital items used, since SEK lacks other Tier 1 capital, to meet the difference in the minimum requirement between Tier 1 capital and Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Accordingly, at year-end 2017, the capital ratio shows the availability to meet buffer requirements after deducting the minimum requirement. The value at year-end 2016 has been restated due to this change in the calculation method. 4 The minimum requirement is 8.0 percent.

Currency risk excluding unrealized changes in fair value is kept low by matching assets and liabilities in terms of currencies or through the use of derivatives. In addition, accrued gains/losses in foreign currency are regularly converted to Swedish kronor. At the end of 2017, the risk amounted to Skr 2 million (year-end 2016: Skr 2 million) and the limit for currency risk was Skr 15 million (year-end 2016: Skr 15 million).

While all structured cash flows are matched through a hedging swap, there could be an impact on earnings. This is because measurement of the bond takes account of SEK’s own credit spread, while the swap is not affected by this credit spread, and also because of changes in expected maturity for the structured borrowing. Interest-rate volatility risk also arises from other transactions with early redemption options. These risks are calculated and limited. At the end of 2017, these risks and limits were low.

SEK measures the indirect environmental impact of green loans, in terms of emissions, based on the method stated in the International Financial Institution Framework for a Harmonized Approach to Greenhouse Gas Accounting, November 2012 and in accordance with SEK’s Framework for Green Bonds, September 2014. The estimated reduction in reported carbon dioxide emissions is based on calculations received by SEK from project owners, exporters or from environmental reports prepared in connection with the project. The estimates are prepared on a project basis, using a typical year once the project has been completed, and are reported in proportion to SEK’s share of the total project financing. Reporting of the direct environmental effects of SEK’s operations, in terms of emissions, are measured according to the GHG Protocol and apply operational control as the consolidation method. The method states how the emissions should be categorized and ranked (based on SEK’s control over the emissions source).
