During 2016, we applied extensive merger and acquisition transactions that created new strong partnerships in our business development, as well as portfolio enrichment and diversification. Partnerships require strong commitment to shared values, which need to be clearly articulated and promoted.

Figures for 2016-2020 are estimates. Amounts in billion euros. However, not all jurisdictions are on the same stage of their development cycle and they have their own distinct dynamic The main drivers of their development cycle include: `` The introduction of stable and clear regulatory regimes, which aim to improve the gaming perception as an entertainment activity and provide additional security and responsible gaming frameworks to players. `` The product innovation, which focuses to integrate mobile into the retail playing experience, innovate and optimize retail operations, create seamless player journey towards the omni-channel model, as well as innovate game content and business processes. `` The market’s liberalization, which forces companies to comply with different requirements in each country, such as tax rates, license fees and technical solutions against unlicensed operators. This is more evident for online 12 gaming, where a wide range of restrictions and requirements accompany each new online market. `` The privatization of activities, which follows the increasing trend from governments to outsource their lotteries’ operation or management. Currently, state-run lotteries account for approximately 78% of global lottery sales (including instant tickets and excluding KENO) and privately-managed or licensed operators account for the remaining 22%. Within the last few years, the industry has witnessed a significant increase in interactive gaming, which includes desktop, mobile and iTV (mainly due to the continuously increasing penetration of smartphones worldwide) and the total interactive gaming GGR is expected to reach €53.2 billion in 2020 (approximately 13.2% of the total global GGR).

Currently, betting generates 70% of the global mobile gaming GGR with €8.6 billion, while mobile gaming will account for 32.6% of the total interactive gaming by 2020, with a 15.5% estimated CAGR 2016-2020.

Maintain leadership in technology innovation and streamline technology development INTRALOT continuously invests in innovative solutions and adopts proven methodologies and practices in its designs and implementations, in order to develop leading technology. As part of its “asset-light” strategy, the Company streamlines its technology development model and intends to generate higher margins and facilitate lower capital expenditure, which will result in enhanced cash flow resilience. INTRALOT aims to capitalize on its global technological and operational capabilities to minimize customization requirements and utilizes new distribution channels, including self-service terminals and mobile capabilities. The Company also offers new sports betting services, which are expected to be significantly strengthened through the strategic partnership with AMELCO, as well as VLT monitoring services. Focus on establishing strong partnerships INTRALOT focuses to establish strong local partnerships in certain markets, instead of funding its expansion, distributing and providing its products and services on its own in new markets. Through partnerships, the Company aims to: `` Benefit from local partners’ relationships, knowledge of regulatory constraints and the local industry. `` Utilize dividend streams and cost and operational synergies. `` Share financial and operational risk, reduce capital expenditure and improve access to local funding. The Company selects well capitalized local partners with an established presence in their respective markets, substantial experience in the local industry and the ability to offer an extensive distribution chain, with indicative examples being Inteltek in Turkey, Eurobet in Bulgaria and Gamenet in Italy. Focus on increasing cash flow generation and revenue visibility INTRALOT aims to improve its cash flow through synergies and efficiencies realized from partnerships and management of its long-term contracts. The Company seeks to selectively maintain and enter into contracts which match its cash generation targets (such as providing technology or managed services) and continuously 14 evaluates the profitability of existing contracts, in order to selectively disengage from less profitable contracts if necessary, such as the contracts in the Czech Republic, Australia and Suriname. At the same time, INTRALOT aims to enter into long-term contracts or renewable licenses to provide revenue stream stability. It must be noted that approximately 85% of the revenues in 2016 were generated through multi-year contracts or renewable licenses available to INTRALOT until 2021 (although actual revenues that may be generated in the future from those contracts may increase or decrease). Deliver and optimize capital structure INTRALOT seeks to utilize partnerships with local partners to reduce its capital expenditures and obtain assistance to access local financing on more favorable terms while, at the same time, receive dividends from the joint venture entities. Furthermore, INTRALOT aims to maintain a conservative financial policy focused on strong liquidity, without any material medium-term acquisitions or dividends to its shareholders until the Company has achieved its target leverage. As a result of the Company’s global presence, proprietary technology and track record of innovation, INTRALOT: `` Is a global leader in the supply of integrated gaming systems and services, with a balanced presence in both developed and developing markets, as well as a leading market position in licensed gaming in the majority of the highly regulated markets in which the Company operates. `` Has developed leading technology and Research and Development (R&D) capabilities to effectively compete with other technology providers and developers and reduce capital expenditures, upfront costs and maintenance costs. `` Utilizes economies of scale and create standardized products which can later be individually adapted for distribution, in order to further reduce its costs. 15 25 YEARS F GROWTH O History INTRALOT was established in 1992 and its headquarters are located in Athens, Greece (64 Kifissias Ave. & 3 Premetis Str., 151 25, Maroussi, Greece).

The Board of Directors regularly review the main risks faced by the company and the effectiveness of the internal audit system regarding risk management. The Internal Audit Unit examines and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal control, enterprise risk management and corporate governance processes, in accordance with its policies and procedures, as well as the applicable legislation, operating standards and corporate governance principles, in order to ensure that the Group: `` Identifies and manages arising risks. `` Protects and efficiently uses its resources. `` Provides accurate, credible and up-to-date financial and management reports. `` Maintains employee compliance with the Company’s policies, procedures and standards `` Complies with the regulatory framework governing its operation.

Identifying and managing risks INTRALOT follows a holistic approach to identify, assess and manage risks related to achieve its business objectives. In order to balance risk and value at all times, the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework considers parameters related to the Group’s strategy, including INTRALOT’s financial status, operations, people, technology, compliance, products and reputation. INTRALOT has designed its ERM Framework according to the specifications of COSO (Committee of Sponsorship Organizations of the Treadway Commission) and ISACA (COBIT for RISK) and incorporates the following components: 1. Objective setting: Objectives are clearly defined in order to be used as a reference point for the identification of risks. 2. Risk assessment: Risks are analyzed in relation to the objectives and the likelihood of an impact from an adverse event actually happening. 3. Risk response: Management selects risk responses (avoid, accept, reduce or share risk) and develops a set of actions to align risks with the entity's risk tolerances. 4. Event identification: Internal and external events affecting the achievement of objectives are identified. 5. Internal environment: The internal environment sets the basis for how risk is viewed and addressed, including risk management philosophy, integrity and ethical values, as well as the environment of operations. 6. Control activities: Policies, procedures, strategies and action plans in general are established and implemented, in order to ensure that risk responses are effectively carried out. 7. Information and communication: Relevant information is identified, captured and communicated properly and within a specific time frame. 8. Monitoring: Risk is monitored either through ongoing management activities or separate evaluations or both and modifications made as necessary. 51 Significant Risks and Uncertainties Source Impact Policies and Practices Financial Risks `` Pursue wide dispersion of customers `` Set credit limits through signed contracts Credit risk Not significant `` Set limits on credit exposure to any financial institution. `` Adopt an internal rating system on credit rating evaluation, using relevant financial indices. `` Develop certain policies to monitor liquidity, in order to hold liquid Liquidity risk Not significant assets that can cover Group’s liabilities. `` Achieve diversification in the currency portfolio.

GOOD PRACTICE Report a Security Incident or Event All employees are obliged to report any security incident (defined as any violation of the Information Security Policy which has impact on the business) and security event (defined as any violation of the Information Security Policy which has no impact on the business) through a digitally signed e-mail to the local security function members and security@intralot.com for INTRALOT and describe the incident or event in detail. In case employees do not have access to corporate email at that time, they can file their report through telephone and send an email as soon as possible. At all times, they are obliged to follow the appropriate security guidelines and do not disclose security information incidents to unauthorized persons at any circumstances. Within 2016, there were no security events reported by employees, either by email or by telephone according to the respective procedure. 54 Combating corruption The Company implements an integrated framework to detect and prevent corruption, which includes the following three procedures: `` Management controls and Internal Control measures. `` Financial Control, Security, Quality, Risk Management and Compliance. `` Internal Audit.

Overview Responsible Gaming is a concept according to which gaming operators, technology and software suppliers and associated service providers need to ensure that their products and services provide a fair and safe gaming experience that enables players to be protected from the adverse consequences of gaming. Whether players buy a lottery or scratch ticket, place their bets, play bingo or on a gaming machine or casino game, players have to view their activity as a form of entertainment in a balanced way. Thus, Responsible Gaming means that operators must aim to keep their games and gaming services profitable and reliable while, at the same time, ensure that all steps are taken to eliminate excessive behaviour and protect vulnerable groups, which include: `` Individuals under legal age of play. `` Individuals with low income. `` Retailers, lottery employees and contractors. `` Individuals with a gaming addiction. `` Individuals with other psychiatric disorders, such as substance abuse and alcoholism. `` Individuals with a family history of problem gaming. `` Individuals not aware of risks of problem gaming. Besides being an ethical and a regulatory requirement, Responsible Gaming is a business imperative for gaming companies, who are required to comply with applicable Responsible Gaming frameworks and implement specific measures and procedures to protect society and Stakeholders. Responsible Gaming Approach An ethical & regulatory requirement expected by our Customers & by society in general 65 did you know? The Rising Need for Responsible Gaming The rising need for Responsible Gaming has emerged due to a changing gaming environment, especially within the last few years, since: `` Online gaming has changed the traditional Points of Sale. `` Gaming is more accessible with the proliferation of new media, such as internet, smartphones, tablets and mobile applications. `` Various channels feature sports betting advertising. `` There is increased availability of different games and gaming services, as well as increased sports betting advertising. It is important that anyone who participates in games of chance understands the possible risks of the entertainment that they are buying and how they vary from one type of games to another. Players must make their choices based on aspects of the game or the gaming service, know and accept the odds and never overestimate the chances of winning or try to recover losses by persisting to game beyond their means. As an Associate member of WLA, INTRALOT abides by the WLA Responsible Gaming Framework, whose purpose is to integrate the Responsible Gaming Principles into the day-to-day operations of member lotteries. The Framework consists of: `` The 7 Responsible Gaming Principles, to which WLA members commit themselves to:  Meet their objectives while, at the same time, protect their customers’ and vulnerable groups’ interests and uphold their respective commitments within their own jurisdiction.  Ensure their practices and procedures reflect a combination of government regulations, operator selfregulation and individual responsibility.  Develop their practices concerning Responsible Gaming on the best possible understanding of relevant information and analysis of documented research.  Work with Stakeholders to share information, develop research and promote Responsible Gaming as broadly as possible and encourage a better understanding of the gaming’s social impact.  Promote Responsible Gaming in all activities, including development, sale and marketing of their products and other activities and ensure the same on behalf of their agents.  Provide information to public in an accurate and balanced manner, in order to enable informed choices about gaming activities within their jurisdiction.  Monitor, test, and revise as appropriate the activities and practices related to Responsible Gaming and publicly report their findings. `` The 10 Responsible Gaming Framework program elements, which are described below: 66 Responsible Gaming Framework Program Elements Element Description Identify, understand and integrate interests of decision-makers, decision influencers and Stakeholder Engagement other society members into key Responsible Gaming related business decisions and Responsible Gaming program development.

It must be noted that the exclusion becomes definitive for players who repetitively exclude themselves (e.g. five times) across a certain period (e.g. one year). `` Players can opt to close their accounts immediately. `` Include self-assessments questionnaires for players who are concerned about their gaming behaviour. Examples of Responsible Gaming Alerts 80 GOOD PRACTICE Private Data Protection and Data Breach Reporting Within the content of its Information Security Management System, INTRALOT is committed to systematically address security issues. There, the Company implements specific rules and controls to protect personal data in the following areas: `` Organizational controls (e.g. there is a Data Privacy Officer in all Group companies with over 250 employees). `` Risk assessment and data identification (e.g. risk assessment of products and operations based on ERM. `` Technical controls (e.g. maintain encrypted backup of personal data). `` Operational controls (e.g. strictly prohibit transfer of personal data outside of a jurisdiction, unless authorized upon written consent from the Group Legal Counsel and the Group Information Security Officer to justify as legally compliant). `` Contractual (third party and employee) controls (e.g. data processing according to a contract or other legal act).

The breach is reported to the Group Information Security Department and the controller coordinates with the Group Legal Department, the Group Information Security Department and the Data Protection Officer for any further reporting actions within 72 hours. The controller informs the persons affected by the data breach about the nature of the personal data breach and the recommended actions to mitigate potential adverse effects. Responsible Gaming Pre-Commitment System In gaming industry, pre-commitment systems introduce restrictions on electronic gaming machines (EGMs), in order to prevent players from spending more money than they originally intended. The Group includes a Player Pre-Commitment System in an EGM monitoring system and has developed the Responsible Gaming Module for its iGEM Monitoring System, which is used to monitor, manage and control large networks of EGMs. Within the context of this module, players can register via web or in any gaming venue and get a player card with credentials to access their account, which allows them to set personalized game limits or self-exclusion options. The system also allows anonymous player cards for pre-commitment purposes, in case players wish to play anonymously, and offers various options to players, including: `` Selection of either a Voluntary Scheme (where non-registered players can play in EGMs) or a Mandatory Scheme (where player cards from registered players with player-set limits are necessary to activate the games). `` Support of anonymous or named Registration. `` Configuration to stop game play when a limit is reached or to allow game play after that limit, either with warnings or with no warnings. `` Access to real-time information about the players’ gaming activity before and after the set limits. 81 GOOD PRACTICE Information Security Assessment According to a formally established procedure, INTRALOT utilizes an Information Security Compliance Questionnaire to conduct an Information Security Assessment prior to adopt a third party product, through which third parties are requested to elaborate on their processes, practices and mechanisms in the following areas: `` General security controls `` Fraud prevention `` Internet gaming security `` Responsible gaming `` Player management compliance with regulations At the same time, the Company has developed an Information Security Compliance Questionnaire for Cloud Service Providers, which is structured around the following areas: `` Infrastructure `` Encryption and Key Management `` Assurance and Compliance `` Network Security `` Business Continuity Management `` Incident Reporting. `` Data INTERNATIONAL GOOD PRACTICE Roll out of Pre-Commitment System in Australia INTRALOT Gaming Services Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of INTRALOT Australia Pty Ltd, has rolled out the first Voluntary Pre-commitment Scheme branded ‘YourPlay’ for a network of 28,500 electronic gaming machines (EGMs) across the State of Victoria, including the Melbourne Casino.

Since 2010, Intralot/DC09 has supported a wide range of programs and organizations that have a significant impact on the community, resulting in over $640,000 in contributions and donations in the District of Columbia, with indicative examples being: `` The Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington DC, which helps boys and girls of all backgrounds to build their confidence, develop character and acquire the necessary skills to become productive and responsible adults. `` The DC Fight For Children organization, which aims to improve quality of early childhood education for Washington, DC students. `` The Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, which seeks to advance the global black community and explore economic development, civil and social justice, public health and education issues impacting African Americans and the global black community. `` The Knock Out Abuse Against Women organization, which promotes awareness and raises contributions to combat domestic abuse and support victims of domestic violence through supporting shelters for abused, poor and homeless women and children. `` The United Negro College Fund (UNCF), which is the USA's largest and most effective minority education organization and helps over 60,000 students each year to attend college and acquire quality college education. `` The Unity Health Care organization, which provides primary medical care and social services support to the working poor, uninsured and least served residents of Washington, DC. `` The Marriott Foundation for People With Disabilities for the Bridges from School to Work program, which offers learning and development opportunities to over 1,000 young people with disabilities each year and supports them to find a job. `` The Voices for a Second Chance organization, which empowers prisoners to create, maintain and strengthen family and community ties, in order to better prepare them for successful transition back into community and rebuild their lives. GOOD PRACTICE Supporting Youth Entrepreneurship and Innovation As a follow-up to the 3-day ‘Panorama of Entrepreneurship and Career Development’ initiative, one of the most important youth entrepreneurship and career building events in Greece, organized for the 6th consecutive year by the Athens University of Business and Economics, INTRALOT organized a Business Day Conference at the Company's Innovation Centre in Athens in 2016, where over 100 university students and graduates: `` Were informed about the Company’s products and services, as well as its international expansion and global operations. `` Exchanged ideas with INTRALOT executives. `` Participated in an interactive workshop featuring a gaming business case study. 135 Caring for the impact of operations Local communities constitute an important Stakeholder of INTRALOT, as they are directly related with the Company and its activities. Therefore, the Company aims to remain aware of its operations’ effects and identify their impacts on local communities. To this day, the Company has not identified any operations with significant actual or potential negative impacts on local communities. It must be noted that within 2016: `` Approximately 75% of INTRALOT’s premises are accessible by people with disabilities. `` There were no significant investment agreements and contracts with clauses on human rights. `` There were no significant investments on infrastructure to provide a public service or good rather than for commercial purpose (e.g. road, school, water supply and power lines/facilities). `` There were no accidents with significant impact on the local communities. `` There were no complaints about impacts on society filed through formal grievance mechanisms and no fines or non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations were imposed by the respective authorities. 3. Materials and Waste Environmental Policy policy The Company is committed to minimize its potential environmental impacts, conserve energy and natural resources and fulfill its obligations related to environmental legislation. According to the provisions of the Code of Conduct, INTRALOT is committed to being an environmentally accountable corporate citizen and strives to conserve resources and reduce waste and emissions through recycling and other energy conservation measures. For this reason, INTRALOT has established an Environmental Management System (EMS), fully compliant with the requirements of ISO 14001:2015, with the following key points: `` Exploit state-of-the-art technology to establish environmentally friendlier and efficient operations, which minimize waste, pollution, health and safety risks, as well as enable safe waste disposal. `` Be an environmentally responsible Company and address incidents or conditions that threaten health, safety or the environment. `` Meet or exceed the environmental legislation that relates to its operations and processes (i.e. national legislation, European regulations, legislation and non-normative directives). `` Minimize emissions through appropriate selection and use of vehicle fleet and employee travel methods. `` Actively promote recycling, both internally and amongst customers and partners. `` Set and evaluate achievable environmental performance goals to continuously improve the EMS. `` Use materials and technologies that comply with environmental standards and recycle old equipment in an environmentally responsible way. INTRALOT’s Top Management is responsible to ensure that the Environmental Management System incorporates all mandatory legal requirements and the Environmental Risk Officer monitors risks related to the environment, proposes changes to the Environmental Management System and ensures that all changes have been understood and are followed. 136 GOOD PRACTICE Environmental Management System According to a formal corporate procedure, INTRALOT is committed to protect the environment from the potential impact of its activities. As part of its commitment, the Company identifies and evaluates the environmental impact of its activities, structured around 4 steps: `` Identify the environmental aspects which INTRALOT can control or influence, through:  Formal risk assessments.  Materiality Analysis, as part of the annual Corporate Responsibility Report.  Review of environmental legislation.  Compliance obligations and agreements with interested parties.  Corporate business decisions.

It must be noted that the Company has reduced its paper and toner consumption to produce bid documents and distribute press monitoring hard copies compared to previous years, as it only uses central printers to scan and electronically disseminate copies. At the same time, INTRALOT has installed centralized MPS printers and employees use their access cards to print any documents, in order to monitor and control printing volume. 137 Materials consumption 2014 2015 2016 Wood (kg) NR NR 3,000 Plastic (kg) NR NR 1 Paper (kg) 13,550 10,425 6,800 Toners (units) NR 419 239 NR = Not reported It must be noted that manufacturing of gaming terminals complies with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive 2002/95/EC, which limits or bans specific substances in new electronic and electric equipment (e.g. lead, cadmium, PBB, mercury, hexavalent chromium, PBDE flame retardants). At the same time, INTRALOT requires that its suppliers located in Europe comply with the RoHS Directive, as well as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive 2002/96/EC. GOOD PRACTICE Designing eco-friendlier Products The Company uses 3D design techniques and simulation software products, in order to minimize the prototype re-design stag, reduce costs and efficiently utilize materials. As a result, INTRALOT: `` Integrates NFC technologies (and generally footprint. cashless payment services) in vending machines. `` Uses category 6 external power packs in all `` Promotes the use of digital solutions, in order to terminals (the latest efficiency standard), in order reduce paper consumption. to ensure the lowest energy footprint during `` Develops products that allow game participation operation and stand-by mode. in a total paperless environment, where neither `` Has designed 40% of its gaming terminals fancoupons nor tickets are needed. less, in order to achieve higher reliability. `` Has introduced the LOTOS™ Horizon multimedia `` Has fully replaced conventional CCFL (coldplatform to deliver information to digital signage cathode fluorescent lamp) technology monitors displays inside the retailer shops, which allow with LED monitors, which are more energy-efficient players to access constantly updated information, and environmental friendlier, as they use 30%-50% with no need to print anything. less power than conventional monitors and do not `` Has adopted the use of cameras in terminals, in contain mercury, halogen or lead. order to replace page scanners, which leads to `` Uses plastic and metals that can be recycled in its using fewer materials and parts. terminals, which is also the case for most of the `` Has introduced ARM technology processors in its electronic components. full range of retailer terminals, which combine high `` Uses recycled paper for the packaging carton computing power and low energy consumption boxes of its terminals and all packaging material and result in more reliable, long lasting and is reusable and durable, in order to be re-used to environmental-friendlier terminals. transport equipment. `` Uses the most efficient techniques to balance `` Encourages customers to recycle the the computing power required for demanding decommissioned terminals and participates in the applications and retain the terminals’ low energy recycling scheme in all operating specific markets. 138 Recycling materials In order to further reduce its environmental footprint, INTRALOT follows the relevant legislative framework concerning waste disposal and does not directly send any waste to landfills. Instead, all waste is systematically collected and sent to a licensed recycling partner, who handles waste disposal in an appropriate and environmentally friendlier manner. At the moment, INTRALOT does not use recycled or FSC certified paper or any other recycled materials. It must be noted that the Company is responsible to remove hazardous waste included in hardware produced or traded by INTRALOT according to environmental procedures in cases of leased equipment that is removed after the expiration of the agreement. Recycling bins In order to collect and convert waste materials into reusable objects, INTRALOT has placed recycling bins, which include: `` Green recycling bins for paper on each floor. The Company has assigned specialized employees to handle collected paper and regularly sent it to a partner recycling company. `` Blue recycling bins for aluminum cans on each floor. `` Clear recycling bin for batteries at the main entrance. Electronic equipment The Company re-uses telecommunication devices and IT equipment (such as personal computers and mobile phones) if they are in working condition and re-assigns them to another user. In case they cannot be re-used, the Company stores certain components as spare parts (such as memory discs, batteries and hard discs) and forwards the remaining materials for recycling.

NR = Not reported 139 GOOD PRACTICE Memberships to Organizations INTRALOT is a member of the Hellenic Recovery Recycling Corporation (HE.R.R.Co.) and has been listed in the organization’s registry of companies that have recycled materials in 2016. Furthermore, in compliance with Law 2939/2001 and the Presidential Decree 117/2004, INTRALOT is also a member of Appliances Recycling S.A., the official organization that organizes, operates and controls the collective system for the Alternative Management of the Waste of Electrical and Electronic Alternative Equipment (WEEE) in Greece. Monitoring water consumption Water scarcity is highlighted as an extremely important environmental aspect which requires urgent action, as the needs and demand for this precious resource have been intensified during the last years. INTRALOT is aware of its relative scarcity and therefore strives to reduce water consumption, where feasible, and therefore: `` Monitors water consumption in its premises in Maroussi and Peania. `` Water supply is performed exclusively through the public water supply network and water utility companies, therefore no other water sources are affected. `` All liquid waste is directed to the public waste network. `` Does not use hazardous cleaning materials. `` At the moment, does not recycle or reuse water for its operations. `` Has implemented control mechanisms to respond to potential water supply failures and water leakages. `` Repaired the cooling towers for the air conditioning system in its building in Maroussi, in order to handle water leakages that were noticed. `` There were no planned or unplanned water discharges and no significant spills of chemicals or fuels or any other material. Water consumption 2015 2016 Water consumption (m3) 4,816 9,676 The increased water consumption for 2016 can be attributed to the volume required to fill the cooling towers for the air conditioning system in INTRALOT’s building in Maroussi. 140 4. Energy and Emissions Analyzing energy impact Although INTRALOT’s operations are not energy intensive, the Company consciously seeks to reduce energy consumption, which is linked to global climate change. The main sources of its energy consumption are electricity (entirely purchased from the Public Power Corporation – Hellas) and heating petrol. Energy consumption and intensity 2015 2016 Heating petrol (lt) 65,000 60,000 Electricity (KWh) 2,101,838 3,408,380 Data refer to all buildings of INTRALOT S.A. The increased water consumption for 2016 can be attributed to the volume required to fill the cooling towers for the air conditioning system in INTRALOT’s building in Maroussi. In order to reduce its energy consumption and air emissions, INTRALOT: `` Has implemented an energy saving program in all facilities. `` Complies with the necessary technical and maintenance requirements of petrol tanks used for heating. `` Regularly checks the electromechanical equipment (boilers) for heating and hot water, air conditioning systems, as well as computer and other office equipment according to global acceptable standards and practices. `` Monitors the fuel consumption of corporate leased vehicles, through corporate credit cards issued to users. `` Complies with the Euro 5 (2009/9) standard for light passenger and commercial vehicles for all corporate leased vehicles. `` Utilizes company buses from major public transportation stations to transport employees from/to Peania premises. `` Encourages car pooling of employees in Peania premises. `` Uses LED lamps in its building in Maroussi, while approximately 85% and 10% of lamps installed in Maroussi and Peania premises respectively are energy-efficient lamps. `` Has installed photoelectric cells in garage areas, in order to ensure that lights are turned off when no employee is in the garage areas. `` Has instructed the Building Security guards to perform regular inspections during their shifts (including late night shifts), in order to ensure that lights and the heating/cooling are turned off in workspace areas where no employee is present during late evening and night hours. `` Has installed and operates a Building Management System (BMS) in its building in Peania, which allows operations to automatically halt in case of malfunctions. 141 GOOD PRACTICE Transition to Cloud INTRALOT steadily progresses towards environmentally friendlier IT solutions, as it expands the use of virtualized environments and cloud solutions for certain IT and development services, in order to replace standalone servers. As a result of its NEFOS (Novel, Extensive, Flexible, On-Demand, Secure) cloud solution successful roll-out, INTRALOT’s IT Department has moved the new software configurations testing, as well as development and consolidation of production servers to virtualized environment. The NEFOS cloud solution significantly reduces INTRALOT’s environmental footprint, since it reduces energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions and allows significant cost savings for the Company. Within 2016, INTRALOT replaced 21 physical servers by migrating to virtual infrastructure and achieved significant energy savings, as indicated below. The migration was supported by low-power new servers, who feature high processing power.

Despite the fact that INTRALOT operates in a non-energy intensive industry with limited greenhouse gas emissions compared to other industries, the Company systematically measures and reports its greenhouse gas emissions due to its extensive operations and the issue’s importance worldwide. Greenhouse gas emissions 2015 2016 Greenhouse gas emissions (tons CO2) 1,686.6 2,374.1 Due to petrol consumption for heating (direct emissions) (tons 173.3 160.6 CO2) Due to electricity consumption (indirect emissions) (tons CO2) 1,513.3 2,213.5 Data refer to all buildings of INTRALOT S.A. Sources of conversion factors: GHG Protocol GHG emissions from stationary combustion Calculation Tool V 4.1 May 2015 (Heating Petrol), IEA CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion 2015 edition 1 (Electricity) Using environmentally friendlier refrigerants The Company mainly utilizes chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) free refrigerants to cool its servers, use in air-conditioning and fire suppression systems, as well as for its coolers, in order not to harm the ozone layer. Within this context, the Company replaced the R22 used in two coolers in its headquarters with the environmentally friendlier R407C within 2016. Air Travel INTRALOT strives to reduce the impact of its business operations on climate change. Because the climate impact of air transportation is currently not sufficiently regulated by national or international laws, the Company voluntarily commits to minimize air travel and travelled air miles. Therefore, INTRALOT: `` Uses other modes of regional travel, where possible. `` Utilizes remote session technologies (such as Skype, WebEx and conference calls), in order to reduce the number and frequency of business travels. `` Extensively uses e-learning training programs. `` Monitors the number of flights and greenhouse emissions due to employee air travel. `` Combines trips and activities, in order to minimize the number of flights required. `` Uses the most direct routes possible, since take-offs and landings increase the amount of fuel consumed. `` Prefers to utilize flights during the daytime, because relevant studies have showed that flying during nighttime increases the overall environmental impact. 143 `` Encourages employees to fly economy seats, because more people per plane mean fewer emissions per person. `` Encourages employees not to carry heavy baggage during flights, because lighter planes mean less fuels consumed. Air miles and CO2 emissions from air travel 2015 2016 Flights (number) 783 810 Long flights (>4 hours) 180 320 Short flights (<4 hours) 603 490 Travelled air miles (million miles) 3.5 1.4 CO2 emissions (indirect emissions) (tons)* 549.6 585.1 *Estimation based on ICAO Carbon Emissions Calculator and EPA 430-R-08-006. Promoting environmental awareness INTRALOT seeks to promote environmental protection issues and encourages initiatives that relate to environmental protection. Therefore, the Company: `` Promotes employee environmental awareness through measures, which include the use of a dedicated reminder in corporate e-mail signatures to consider the environment before printing an e-mail. `` Briefs newly hired employees on recycling through the Corporate Induction Program. Protecting biodiversity Due to its negligible influence of activities and operations on biodiversity, INTRALOT does not have a separate policy on biodiversity. However, the Company takes this important environmental issue into consideration, as: `` All buildings are located in established industrial or residential areas, with no facilities located near protected NATURA or RAMSAR areas. `` All operation sites are not located near ecosystems and habitats or other areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas. `` There are no IUCN Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations. 144 145 146 147 148 1.
