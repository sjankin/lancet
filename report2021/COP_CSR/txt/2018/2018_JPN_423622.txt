The COSO model is the de facto world-standard tool for evaluating the effectiveness of internal control systems. Under the model, the objectives of an enterprise’s internal control fall into three categories: 1) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, 2) reliability of financial reporting, and 3) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To achieve these, five elements are incorporated into day-to-day work processes for each objective: 1) control environment, 2) risk assessment and response, 3) control activities, 4) information and communication, and 5) monitoring. These five elements have to function effectively.

To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2018 66 CORPORATE DATA Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements OBAYASHI CORPORATION For the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the accounts maintained by OBAYASHI CORPORATION (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Companies”) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial ­statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan. Certain amounts in the prior year’s financial statements were reclassified to conform to the changes made for the latest fiscal year. 2. U.S. Dollar Amounts The accounts of the consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen by rounding down to the nearest million. The U.S. dollar amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto were translated from the original Japanese yen into U.S. dollars on the basis of ¥106.24 to US$1, the rate of exchange prevailing at March 31, 2018, and were then rounded down to the nearest thousand. These U.S. dollar amounts are not intended to imply that the Japanese yen amounts have been or could be converted, realized or settled in U.S. dollars at this or any other rate. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (1) Scope of consolidation and application of the equity method The Company had 93 subsidiaries at March 31, 2018. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 included the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Investments in all affiliates (25 companies for 2018) are accounted for by the equity method. (2) Business year for consolidated subsidiaries Certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries (33 companies) have a fiscal year that ends on December 31 and a domestic consolidated subsidiary has a fiscal year that ends on January 31. The consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the financial statements as of the same date. Necessary adjustments for consolidation were made on significant transactions that took place during the period between the fiscal year-end of the subsidiaries and that of the Company. Consolidated subsidiaries other than those referred to above have the same business year as the ­Company, which ends on March 31. (3) Goodwill Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 5 years. However, goodwill that is not material is charged to income in the year of acquisition. Differences between the cost and underlying net equity of investments in affiliates accounted for by the equity method are immaterial and charged or credited to income as they occur. (4) Foreign currency translation Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The balance sheet accounts of the foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding non-controlling interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Differences arising from the translation are presented as foreign currency translation adjustments and non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. (5) Cash equivalents All highly liquid investments, generally with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are so near maturity that they represent only an insignificant risk of any change in value are considered cash equivalents. 67 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2018 To Contents (6) Short-term investment securities and investment securities About Obayashi Group Securities are classified into two categories: held-to-maturity and other securities. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving ­average method. (7) Inventories Real estate held for sale, costs on uncompleted construction contracts, costs on real estate business, inventories for PFI and other projects and costs on other business are all stated at cost determined by the specific identification method. Raw materials and supplies are stated at cost determined by the first-in first-out method. Toward the Realization of a Sustainable Society The net book value of inventories in the consolidated balance sheets is written down if the net realizable value declines. (8) Property, plant and equipment The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries mainly calculate depreciation by the declining-balance method, while straight-line method is applied to the buildings excluding building fixtures, acquired on or after April 1, 1998 and facilities attached to buildings and other non-building structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries mainly apply the straight-line method. The useful lives and residual values of depreciable assets are estimated mainly in accordance with the Corporate Tax Law. (9) Intangible assets Business Overview Intangible fixed assets are amortized by the straight-line method. Computer software for internal use is amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 5 years. (10) Leased assets Depreciation of leased assets under finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the leased assets to the lessee is calculated by the straight-line method over the lease period with a residual value of zero. (11) Allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on the historical experience with respect to write-offs for the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and based on an estimate of the amount for specific uncollectible accounts Corporate Data for the Companies. (12) Provision for warranties for completed construction The provision for warranties for completed construction is provided to cover expenses for defects claimed concerning completed work, based on the estimated amount of compensation to be paid in the future for the work completed during the fiscal year. (13) Provision for loss on construction contracts The provision for loss on construction contracts is provided at the estimated amount for the future losses on contract backlog at the balance sheet date which will probably be incurred and which can be reasonably estimated. (14) Provision for loss on Antimonopoly Act The provision for loss on Antimonopoly Act is provided for the estimated surcharges and other based on the ­Antimonopoly Act. (15) Provision for stock payments for directors The provision for stock payments for directors is provided for stock award debt based on predetermined regulations for awarding stock, which is prepared for future awards of the Company shares to its directors and executive officers. (16) Provision for loss on real estate business and other The provision for loss on real estate business and other is provided for the estimated losses to be incurred in liquidating real estate and restructuring the real estate related business. To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2018 68 CORPORATE DATA (17) Provision for environmental measures The provision for environmental measures is provided based on an estimate of costs for disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) waste, which the Company and its domestic subsidiaries are obliged to dispose of by the Act on ­Special Measures Concerning Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Waste. (18) Retirement benefits In calculating retirement benefits obligations, the benefit formula method is used to allocate expected retirement benefit payments in the period until the end of the current fiscal year. Actuarial differences are amortized commencing in the following year after the differences is recognized primarily by the straight-line method over periods (5 years to 10 years) which are shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees. Prior service cost (PSC) is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years which is shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees, while PSC of certain subsidiaries is expensed as incurred. (19) Derivatives and hedge accounting (a) Method of hedge accounting Hedging instruments are valued at fair value and accounted for using the deferral method of accounting. The monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, for which foreign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge the foreign currency fluctuations, are translated at the contracted rate if the foreign exchange forward contracts qualify for hedge accounting. The interest rate swaps, which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria, are not remeasured at market value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is charged to income (short-cut method). (b) Hedging instruments and hedged items To hedge foreign exchange risks related to the monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and projected future foreign currency transactions, foreign exchange forward contracts and non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts are employed as hedging instruments. To hedge the interest-rate risks related to loans payable, interest rate swaps are employed as hedging instruments. (c) Hedging policy The Companies utilize derivative financial instruments only for the purpose of hedging future risks of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates in accordance with internal rules. (d) Assessment of hedge effectiveness Hedge effectiveness is not assessed when substantial terms and conditions of the hedging instruments and the hedged transactions are the same. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted for interest rate swaps as they meet certain criteria under the ­short-cut method. (20) Recognizing revenues and costs of construction contracts Revenues and costs of construction contracts of which the percentage of completion can be reliably estimated are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage of completion is calculated at the cost incurred as a percentage of the estimated total cost. The completed-contract method continues to be applied for contracts for which the percentage of completion cannot be reliably estimated. Revenues from construction contracts and the related costs of the overseas subsidiaries are mainly recorded on the percentage-of-completion method. (21) Revenues and expenses associated with finance lease transactions Sales and cost of sales are recognized upon receipt of lease payment. (22) Consumption taxes Consumption tax and local consumption tax are accounted for under the tax-exclusive method. 69 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2018 To Contents (23) Income taxes About Obayashi Group The Companies apply deferred tax accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of income taxes by the asset/liability method. Under the asset/liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. (24) Consolidated taxation system The Companies adopted the consolidated taxation system. Toward the Realization of a Sustainable Society 4.

Financial Instruments (1) Overview (a) Policy for financial instruments The Companies raise funds by borrowing from banks and issuing commercial paper or corporate bonds. Also, the Companies restrict temporary excess fund management to highly secure assets, time deposits and other short-term investments. The Companies use derivatives in order to avoid the risks, fluctuations of particular assets and liabilities, and fluctuations of interest rates. The Companies do not use derivative transactions to gain short-term profits or for speculative purposes. (b) Types of financial instruments related risks and risk management “Notes and accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other,” “Electronically recorded monetary claims” and “Accounts receivable—other,” which are operating receivables, are exposed to the credit risk of customers. In order to mitigate the risk when orders are received, the Companies conduct a strict screening and determine project plans so that potential risks are minimized. 77 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2018 To Contents “Short-term investment securities” and “Investment securities” mainly consist of stocks. While “Short-term investAbout Obayashi Group ment securities” and “Investment securities” are exposed to market risk, the Companies monitor market prices of these securities. “Notes and accounts payable for construction contracts and other,” “Electronically recorded obligations” and “Deposits received,” which are operating liabilities, are due within one year. “Short-term loans payable,” “Long-term loans payable,” “Commercial paper” and “Bonds payable” are used for operations or capital investment. “Nonrecourse loans” are used for enterprise funds related to particular PFI projects and other. The floating rate loans are exposed to fluctuation in interest rates. In order to hedge against the interest rate risks and fix the payment of interest, the Companies utilize derivative transactions (interest rate swaps) for each contract of certain long-term loans payable. Regarding the evaluation of hedge effectiveness, it is omitted by the judgement of the short-cut method because the interest rate swaps meet the certain criteria under the short-cut method. Toward the Realization of a Sustainable Society The transactions of derivative financial instruments are carried out in accordance with the Companies’ internal rules, and the status of the transactions is reported regularly to the Board of Directors. The Companies trade derivative transactions with major financial institutions and therefore consider there is no credit risk underlying those transactions. While operating debt and borrowings are exposed to liquidity risk, the Companies manage the risk mainly by ­preparing quarterly and monthly cash management plans. (c) Supplementary explanation of fair values of financial instruments Notional amounts of derivative transactions, disclosed in “(2) Fair value of financial instruments,” do not indicate market risk in derivative transactions. Business Overview (2) Fair value of financial instruments The following table shows the carrying values and fair values of financial instruments as of March 31, and any differences.

The carrying value is the same as fair value. Notes and accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other and Electronically recorded ­monetary claims The carrying value of the items that will be settled within a year approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value.

Short-term investment securities and investment securities The fair value of stocks is determined based on quoted market price and the fair value of debt securities is determined based on either quoted market price or prices provided by financial institutions making markets in these securities. Information on securities classified by holding purpose is disclosed in Note 13 “Securities.” Accounts receivable—other Since “Accounts receivable—other” is settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value.

Liabilities Notes and accounts payable for construction contracts and other, Electronically recorded obligations, Short-term loans payable, Current portion of nonrecourse loans, Current portion of bonds and Deposits received Since these accounts are settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Bonds payable The fair value of bonds issued by the Company is based on the present value of the total principal and interest discounted by an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of bond and current credit risk. 79 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2018 To Contents Long-term loans payable and Nonrecourse loans About Obayashi Group For fixed rate loans, the fair value is based on the present value of the total principal and interest discounted by an interest rate to be applied if similar new loans were entered into. For floating rate loans, since the market interest rate is reflected in the interest rate set within a short period of time, the carrying value is the same as the fair value. The fair value of loans qualifying for special hedge accounting treatment of interest rate swaps is based on the present value of the total principal and interest hedged by interest rate swaps, which is discounted by an interest rate to be applied if similar new loans were entered into.
