While 2017 marked the year that Rainy River achieved commercial production, the site already had a special tradition well established – annual spring and fall ceremonies. These ceremonies started in 2011 when Rainy River team members were gifted with a teaching by local Anishinaabe Elders, who advised on the importance they place on ceremony during the mining process. Signaled by a high sun and the first strawberries, each spring an Elder from one of the local Anishinaabe communities shares their wisdom with the Rainy River team. The spring ceremony celebrates the earth gently waking up, with new growth on trees and plants, water flowing after the ice has melted, and the birth of local animals. Fall ceremony focuses on the rest period which will come with the winter months, when the land has the opportunity to rejuvenate. With guests from surrounding communities and the onsite operations team present, the ceremonies mark a time to renew friendships and enjoy a meal together. Over the years, Rainy River has been honoured to receive wisdom of Elders from numerous communities through these ceremonies, with each offering special advice that has enhanced our understanding of the Anishinaabe nations and the culture, heritage and values. These ceremonies have left a lasting impression on how our team members operate within the context of that heritage and values. 26 Wildfire Support at New Afton During the Elephant Hill fire, which began in July 2017 and was finally declared as contained on October 2nd, New Gold offered considerable support and resources to the Skeetchestn and Tk’emlups te Secwepemc First Nations. As the fire’s risks to local communities became apparent, the New Afton Emergency Response team went out to visit Skeetchestn and offered Fire Smart initiatives to help reduce fire hazards. When the fire was 4 km from the edge of the Skeetchestn reserve, New Gold, in partnership with Brentwood Construction, provided equipment which was used to build a firebreak around the community. During the Skeetchestn evacuation order in August, community members were directed to Tk’emlups te Secwepmc, where an Emergency evacuation centre had already been set up. The Tk’emlups te Secwepemc hosted members of four other evacuated First Nations communities in addition to Skeetchestn. New Gold also provided specialized equipment for Tk’emlups to use to store food for the evacuees. Throughout the fire, New Gold’s Senior Advisor for Indigenous Relations provided support at the Skeetchestn Emergency Operations (EOC) Centre and helped coordinate any others resources that were required during the fire. 27 Inauguration of the Todos por Cerro de San Pedro Foundation The Todos por Cerro de San Pedro (All for Cerro de San Pedro) is a civil association that works to promote local economic development actions under the Socioeconomic Strategy of the Cerro San Pedro Integrated Closure Plan. The Foundation was created by its Board of Directors, who are representatives of New Gold, and initially the Foundation will receive its funding from New Gold. The Foundation has created a seed fund and aims to provide advice to strengthen economic development initiatives in the area. The Foundation has been created with the objective of supporting a local economic development plan for the thirteen communities and three ejidos (communally-owned land holdings) that comprise the Municipality of Cerro de San Pedro. As a collaborator, the Municipality of Cerro de San Pedro will rely on a council that represents members of the various communities who will be active participants in the Foundation’s operations. In October 2017, the Foundation unveiled the 2017-2020 Strategy Plan before members of the various Cerro de San Pedro communities and Municipal council, Cerro San Pedro mine personnel, as well as representatives from local and regional public institutions, universities and civil society organizations. Also during the event, a group of entrepreneurs shared their experiences working with the Foundation to develop training and resource management skills in their respective businesses. The event included the participation of the Venado Youth Symphony Orchestra (Music for Life Foundation A.C.), who delighted those present with a concert. 28 Mining Matters ROCKS at Rainy River Mining Matters is a charitable organization dedicated to bringing knowledge and awareness about Canada’s geology and mineral resources to students, educators and the public. The organization provides current information about rocks, minerals, metals, mining and the diverse career opportunities available in the minerals industry. Mining Matters offers exceptional educational resources that meet provincial curriculum expectations, created by educators and Earth science experts. With sponsorship from New Gold Rainy River project, Mining Matters partnered with four local schools in the Rainy River District to deliver the Mining Rocks Earth Sciences Program. While New Gold had partnered with Mining Matters for the previous five years, this year was especially exciting because of all the activities with the construction of the Rainy River project. Over a four-day period, 162 participants between the ages of 8 and 17 years of age had a “rocking” experience with teams from Mining Matters and New Gold. In meeting Mining Matters objectives to engage youth with innovative mineral resources education programs and information about careers in the industry, the Mining Rocks programs were structured as interactive half-day classroom sessions. Each session was customized for age level with a series of meaningful hands-on learning activities focusing on a wide range of topics, including rocks and minerals, mineral exploration and mining, mineral resources in society and careers in the minerals industry. 29 ENGAGING WITH OUR COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST DESCRIPTION OF IMPACTS MANAGEMENT APPROACH 30 31 2017 ENGAGEMENT SPOTLIGHT 32 New Afton 2 0 0 4 Mesquite 0 0 0 0 Peak Mines 4 11 5 1 Cerro San Pedro 3 3 0 6 Blackwater 0 1 1 0 Rainy River n/a 49 56 21 Total 9 64 62 32 33 CONTRIBUTING TO SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS1 ($ MILLIONS) DESCRIPTION OF IMPACTS MANAGEMENT APPROACH TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT 34 35 Mineral revenues 712.9 683.8 774.9 Expenditures for materials, products and services2 689.8 790.3 833.8 Exploration expenditures3 4.0 7.4 8.7 Employee wages and beneﬁts (includes payroll taxes paid to governments) 137.4 160.3 196.3 Payments to providers of capital (interest paid and standby fees) 52.3 55.3 63.7 Payments to governments4 (royalties, property, production and income taxes) 26.6 15.5 32.05 Community investments6 7.3 7.4 16.0 COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS 36 2017 ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS PERFORMANCE SPOTLIGHT 37 OUR SUPPLY CHAIN Local1 9.9 20.3 0.3 28.7 20.1 1.7 81.0 Local Aboriginal2 25.1 64.3 0.5 – – – 84.9 Regional 25.2 77.6 4.9 21.5 55.7 9.5 194.4 National 27.1 117.8 0.4 56.0 16.3 38.8 256.4 International 3.3 10.4 0.1 0.5 – 1.5 15.8 Total3 90.6 290.4 6.2 106.7 92.1 51.5 637.5 38 WORKING WITH INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES DESCRIPTION OF IMPACTS MANAGEMENT APPROACH 39 INDIGENOUS RELATIONS STRATEGY Engagement Goal: Carry on respectful and meaningful engagement with Indigenous Peoples throughout the mine life cycle.

This was New Afton’s first win of the Environmental Stewardship Award and is a testament to the site’s efforts to continuously improve environmental performance. Represented by a three-person committee who visited site for a tour and employee interviews, the judging panel reported it was impressed with the site’s proactive approach toward environmental stewardship. The Environment team credits a portion of its success to an increased focus across all departments on identifying, reporting and mitigating environmental hazards. For example, seventy-four environmental hazards were reported in 2017, in comparison to thirtyfour in 2016. The higher number of reported environmental hazards in 2017 is attributed to improved reporting rates, rather than an increase in actual hazards. Additionally, eighteen site-wide Environmental Bulletins were issued in 2017, highlighting a specific environmental topic for site teams to discuss. The Environment department also implemented an acknowledgement initiative in Q4, called Super E. This new initiative celebrates actions of individuals or departments that go over and above to ensure continual improvement of environmental performance. Congratulations, New Afton! 46 Restoration of Mine Waste Dumps at Cerro San Pedro As part of the Integrated Closure Plan at Cerro San Pedro, work is underway on the Environmental Restoration Program which provides strategies for restoration of lands and vegetation cover to the operation areas, like waste dumps, heap leach, and auxiliary infrastructure during the course of the mine’s operation. Under the Environmental Restoration Program, there is a subprogram for reforestation activities to be implemented in areas where a land use change was made, such as Cerro San Pedro waste dump areas. Reforestation will improve the current state of ecosystem components such as fauna, soil and subsoil, balance of biogeochemical cycles, water and air, among others. In consideration of flora and fauna listed as protected in Mexico, twelve listed species have been selected for inclusion in revegetation activities. In compliance with the environmental license, over 39 hectares of the waste dumps area have been restored by end of 2017. 47 Collaborating to Safeguard Endangered Desert Tortoises at Mesquite As part of a long-term effort to preserve endangered desert tortoises, the Mesquite Mine collaborated with state and federal regulatory agencies in 2016-17 to relocate tortoises from the mine site to more suitable habitat. To support the project, Mesquite contracted a team of 25 biologists to survey 1,808 acres of the mine site identified as potential tortoise habitat by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Three adult and two sub adult tortoises found were moved to temporary pens on the mine site while health assessments were conducted and the Bureau and Department completed a comprehensive translocation plan. Based on this plan, biologists moved the five tortoises to the Milpitas Wash area, an important habitat linkage for the species, where the agencies identified a population of about 12 tortoises. This collaborative effort, which includes five years of monitoring the tortoises, will enhance understanding of translocation as a management technique for the species. Mesquite also implemented programs to treat areas of invasive species on federal land. Another important biodiversity program includes biological clearance surveys, before work commences in any new area, to search for nesting areas and sensitive species. In March 2015, we had the opportunity to put into practice one of the requirements of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which offers federal-level protection of listed birds and their eggs from any harm or harassment. After two red-tailed hawks were noticed occupying a nest within an active mining area, we quickly took action by withdrawing mining equipment from the area to create a buffer zone around the nesting area to ensure the birds were not disturbed by our mining activity. We immediately engaged a specialist biologist to make periodic visits to the site and track the birds’ activities. For two months, a buffer zone around the nest was created. Normal mining operations in that area were only allowed to resume when our biologist confirmed that the hawk had fledged and the nest was deserted. 48 ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENTS AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
