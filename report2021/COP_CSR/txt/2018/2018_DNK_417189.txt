Based on increasing demand the mill has ever, now that we are to publish a new report, a year gone by been able to meet the budgeted requirements for sales volume seems like a very short period of time. and utilisation of the production capacity, respectively. First, I would like to give readers a general tour of the market When we then turn to look at the current year of operation, development in which we operate. We take our starting point market prospects may change relatively quickly in several direcat the end of 2016: the year ended with positive trends towards tions. From the perspective of Skjern Papirfabrik the immediate increasing demand in most markets. During the year gone by expectations for 2018 are very positive, with opportunities for this trend has stabilised and even intensified in just about all the development of existing product types as well as new ones. the segments of Skjern Papirfabrik’s field of business. The most evident explanation for the increasing demand is found in the At the mill in Skjern, 2017 did not see major expansion of general improvement of global economy. Furthermore, for machinery nor substantial renovation works. The primary some of our products it is due to increasing internet trade, reason for this is found in a so-called five-year plan that was which leads to an increasing need for different types of packdrawn up to make sure that the mill goes through continuous aging. developments in capacity and quality improvement, respectively. The main components of this plan consist as a first step of a replacement of the existing hood over the drying sections and furthermore a replacement of part of the paper machine drive. This refurbishment is expected to take place during the summer holidays of 2019. UN Global Compact The UN Global Compact is a strategic initiative for companies committed to running a business in accordance with ten universally accepted principles within the areas of human rights, workers’ rights, environment, and anti-corruption. Skjern Papirfabrik acknowledges the growing importance of companies’ corporate social responsibility, and as a reflection of this the mill has since 2013 been a member of the UN Global Compact, the world’s largest initiative for propagation of corporate social responsibility CSR. Page 4 Environmental segments A major part of the company’s focus areas are related to the mill’s occupational health and safety. Occupational health and safety is a combination of staff members’ safety and the physical and mental impacts that they are exposed to in their daily work. In this field, an external consultant has conducted a total risk assessment of all production facilities. The result of these assessments will be used in the future by our occupational health and safety organisation as a tool for enhancement of issues with scope for improvement. Speaking of the mill’s impacts on the internal and external It will not come as a surprise to you that recycled paper used in environment, we definitely must mention our wood chip fired the mill as a raw material in our production contains many boiler plant that now ensures steam production in replacement impurities such as wood, styrofoam, glass, stones, plastics, etc. of our natural gas fired boiler. We wish to emphasize a number Naturally, these materials cannot be used in the production of of very important issues in connection with the wood chip fired paper, so input materials are cleaned before the recycled paper boiler’s operation. First of all, CO2 emissions from the producenters the production. The waste that remains is as far as tion have been reduced by more than 4,000 tonnes. Secondly, possible delivered to facilities able to recover it for various the mill has utilised and supplied waste heat from our own propurposes. A statement of our recovery of waste in 2017 shows duction to the district heating facility of the nearby City of a rate of recovery of some 93%. Skjern. The volume of heat corresponds to the typical consumption of approx. 2,500 households. And thirdly, the City of Skjern All the above issues are results of the past; however, we generhas reduced its total CO2 emissions thanks to the supply of heat ally take a larger interest in the future and what we can expect from the mill to the district heating grid. from it. Paper production is generally known for being very energy Nobody can predict the future. However, with the prevailing intensive, also using large volumes of water in the production. economic and other conditions that seem to have stabilised for Evidently, these are fields in which the mill invests many efforts a long period of time, I do expect that the markets in which the in view of avoiding any unnecessary use of these resources. company does business will keep up the positive trend and Thanks to focused work for many, many years we have been develop favourably throughout the current year. able to reduce our water consumption by almost 33% over a five-year period.

This includes the reduction of energy consumption and other environmental impacts caused by our paper production. The products are delivered in large rolls, in narrow cut reels, or in sheets delivered on pallets. In 2015, the installation of a new large wood chip fired boiler was initiated, replacing the existing natural gas consumption The products are produced with a high respect for the with wood chips. In 2017, steam for drying of paper has surrounding environment, and Skjern Papirfabrik has been primarily been generated at the wood chip fired boiler plant. environmentally certified under ISO 14001 since 1998. Since then, this certification has been expanded with ISO 50001: After commissioning of the wood chip fired boiler, total specific Energy management certification. CO2 emissions have decreased by 89.2%. In a comparison with other European paper mills, Skjern Papirfabrik has very low Meeting customers’ expectations and requests has high priority specific CO2 emissions today. at Skjern Papirfabrik. As a consequence, it has been decided to work towards an ISO 9001 quality certification, and we expect Furthermore, Skjern Papirfabrik supplies large volumes of to have it implemented by the end of 2018. district heating generated from waste heat from the drying ” section of the paper machine and residual heat in the flue gas from the boiler.

In addition, the safety work is an ongoing process with, among others, registration of near-miss incidents will continue to be in focus continuous activities to implement the proposals from the in 2018. workplace assessments. Occupational health and safety is a combination of staff members’ safety and the physical and mental impacts that staff members are exposed to. Again in 2017 much focus was on the safety of staff members, and many measures relating to occupational health have been implemented. For example, a total risk assessment of the entire production was conducted, under which an external consultant in cooperation with internal staff members went through all production facilities. As a follow-up, reports were prepared over issues with scope for improvement. These reports are a key tool for the occupational health and safety organisation. In addition, efforts relating to the registration of nearmiss incidents have been improved, and it will also be a focal point in 2018. In 2017, two notifiable accidents were registered. Thereby, the target of zero accidents was unfortunately not achieved for 2017. On the company’s info board the number of days since latest accident is presented. Skjern Papirfabrik Page 11 Environmental impacts Paper production is known to be a most energy intensive Total CO2 emissions from the City of Skjern have been reduced method of production. Therefore, at Skjern Papirfabrik we are drastically thanks to the district heating contribution generated proud to use primarily wood chips for the steam production. The from waste heat at Skjern Papirfabrik. steam mainly feeds the drying section of the paper machine, which is the main consumer of energy in the form of drying of The paper production, however, also causes other environmenthe paper web. tal impacts. The most significant environmental impacts have been evaluated on the basis of approvals, legislation, and the NOx emissions will go up as a result of using wood chips as a largest possible potential impacts on the external environment fuel. In return, CO2 emissions are reduced radically through the and the immediate surroundings. substitution of fossil fuels with biomass. For Skjern Papirfabrik the most significant environmental This CO2 reduction gains even more value since Skjern impacts are: Papirfabrik supplies a large volume of district heating • Energy consumption generated from waste heat. The largest volume of district • Consumption of auxiliary materials heating is produced by utilising energy contained in waste heat • Water consumption in the exhaust from the drying section of the paper machine. • Discharge of wastewater From the wood chip boiler district heating is also generated • Waste management from the residual heat contained in the flue gas system as well • Noise as from excess steam that is utilised in an excess production heat exchanger for district heating in connection with minor It is a natural consequence of Skjern Papirfabrik’s 20 years of unplanned stops of the paper machine. environmental certification that we have a good grasp of the above environmental impacts. Therefore, it is assessed that we We have worked actively with projects aiming at the supply of have a very low risk of causing a significant negative impact on district heating and thereby the utilisation of waste heat during the environment. the past five years, and large investments in the facilities have been made.

Examples of NGOs are associations supporting labour is an integrated part of Danish mentality, and Skjern vulnerable groups or people suffering from various diseases, or Papirfabrik considers this a natural part of operating on an local sports associations. international market. Skjern Papirfabrik complies with Danish law, thereby supporting the above-mentioned issues. This is also substantiated by Transparency International, as this organisation for several years has rated Denmark as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. Skjern Papirfabrik is a partner company with Green Network, thereby demonstrating our desire to continuously develop our efforts within CSR/sustainability by sharing knowledge with other companies. This partnership means that Skjern Papirfabrik has a third party who is ready to provide critical opinions and input for our present activities. Skjern Papirfabrik has a continuous dialogue with Green Network about our own efforts, and our staff members participate in seminars focusing on CSR and sustainability. As a substantiation of the above-described issues, Skjern Papirfabrik has prepared a CSR policy.

It is seen that the consumption ” of auxiliary materials in the production is higher than in 2016. This is due to changes of the production mix deciding which 0.05% used consist of the of auxiliary materials Only auxiliary materials must be used, and in which amounts. undesirable A substances The consumption of auxiliary materials for maintenance and boiler facility has gone up compared with 2016. This is due to Again in 2017, the relative share of A substances is at a remarkthe fact that the new wood chip fired boiler has had ably low level.

Waste Waste generated at Skjern Papirfabrik mainly consists of The term »reject for soil improvement« is a waste product segregated impurities from paper raw materials containing a primarily consisting of paper fibres mixed with a minor part of number of non-usable materials, such as plastics, paper clips, styrofoam and plastics. This waste fraction is subjected to textile residues, etc. These residual products are segregated in controlled composting, before it is used for soil improvement. several cleaning units. Thanks to its high fibre content this fraction can contribute to a better soil structure in agriculture. In addition, the wood chip fired boiler generates a considerable amount of waste. The bottom ashes from this facility, which The fraction of »suspended solids« is the residual solid matter constitute the largest fraction, comply with requirements remaining in wastewater when it is led for wastewater treatstipulated in the Statutory Orders on Bioashes and Sludge, ment. Suspended solids primarily consist of paper fibres too respectively, and can thereby be recovered. small for being retained in the mill’s vargo filters. ” 92.6% of the waste was recovered in 2017 By contrast, contents in the fly ash of primarily heavy metals are at such a level that this fraction must be managed separately by landfill disposal. Waste going to landfill amounted in 2017 to 0.9 kilograms per net tonne of finished product. This is far below figures published in CEPI’s latest Sustainability Report from 2013 giving figures on sustainability in the Pulp and Paper industry. It appears from this report that the industry as a whole generates 14.3 kilograms of waste for landfill per tonne of finished product. Skjern Papirfabrik Page 21 Input and output of materials (continued) Overall, waste arisings have increased from 2016. This is due to Total waste arisings are expected to remain at the same level in a larger consumption of paper raw materials in 2017 compared 2018. with 2016. However, it is also assessed to be due to higher quantities of impurities in paper raw materials received. Part of the explanation is to be found in a change in the amount of various waste paper types. This again is due to variations in the type of finished products sold, which determines the consumption of the different types of paper raw materials. An increase in the generation of ashes has been seen from 2016; this is a natural consequence of a major part of the natural gas consumption for steam generation being substituted with wood chips in 2017.
