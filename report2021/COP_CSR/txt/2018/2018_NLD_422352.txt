This Code of Conduct is also published on the company’s website and can be found here: http://www.nunner-logistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Nunner-Code-of-Conduct.pdf Concerning human rights it explicitly states that NUNNER respects the opinion of other persons and their personal dignity, privacy and personal rights.

Every single employee of NUNNER Logistics receives a minimum of 80 hours of training per year. 2.2 Implementation Since 2012 every staff member on all levels is trained in the NUNNER Total Performance Academy (warehouse staff, office staff, managers and directors). All office and warehouse employees have completed the course and have reached the level of MBO (Middelbaar Beroeps Onderwijs; middle level applied education”). Employees that are already qualified for MBO have the opportunity to complete the HBO-level (Hoger Beroeps Onderwijs; higher professional education ) This qualifies them for a professional master program in the Netherlands. The company offers for all employees regularly professional, specific work-related training courses that are held during or right after office hours in the company offices. All employees get updated new causes to stay aware of new developments and knowledge. In autumn 2018 a new training started on the newly implemented agile scrum structure in the company (see 2.3) New employees are offered the same educational opportunities. 2.3 Agile Scrum On 2018 January 1st NUNNER Logistics HQ started to work via the agile scrum method.The company has been restructured in socalled squads, chapters and tribes.

We must never offer or accept bribes or kickbacks, and must not participate in or facilitate corrupt activities of any kind. This prohibition on offering or paying bribes also applies to third parties acting on NUNNER’s behalf, such as contractors or consultants. We must never engage a third party who we believe may attempt to offer a bribe to conduct company business.” It addresses detailed guidelines on related topics, such as e.g.: Direct and indirect bribery Gifts and invitations Expenses, donations, charitable benefits and sponsoring Money laundering Market abuse or manipulation 4.2 Implementation The Compliance Office contact details are applicable for questions concerning any part of the Code of Conduct. As check for appropriateness, NUNNER advises employees to ask themselves the following questions when in doubt: Are my actions legally permitted and are they in line with the objectives of NUNNER group? Does my “subjective feeling” tell me that my actions are correct? Would I be able to justify my actions before the board of NUNNER or before authorities? Special emphasis is made on business brokers, intermediaries and other third parties who act on behalf of NUNNER Logistics, to ensure that these principles are communicated and applied by them accordingly. 4.3 Measurement of outcomes NUNNER Logistics has agreed Codes of Conduct with many business partners and customers, that often include clauses about anti-corruption and are always accepted and signed by the management. National rules of anti-corruption are strictly monitored by Dutch tax authorities. NUNNER Logistics has never been involved in any investigations or cases of corruption or bribery. Until now, no suspected breach of rules has been reported to the NUNNER Compliance Office.
