A common software supported the collection of data from 20 production plants in 2017. The Group has applied the GRI Standards (Global Reporting Initiative) since the beginning of its sustainability reporting in 2007 and for 2017 the new standards are applied. GRI published its new guidelines on sustainability reporting called GRI Standards in 2016, with the aim to replace the GRI G4 guideline the world's most widely used framework in this area with more than 1,000 users in more than 90 countries by July 2018. The principles and reporting process remain unchanged. However GRI Standards is now a framework of three general and 33 thematic standards designed to be used by organisations to report their impacts on economic topics (series 200), environmental topics (series 300) and social topics (series 400). Each topic standard is designed to be used together with GRI 103: Management Approach. The full set can be downloaded at www.globalreporting.org/standards/. This Sustainability report has been prepared following the GRI Standards: Core option. It is also intended for COP reporting as part of the Group’s membership in the UN Global Compact and also includes a short summary of yearly results for the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) where reporting is done on their platform.

In order to achieve this, AR Packaging places special emphasis on fair and secure working conditions, on training and development of the people, and on fostering a corporate culture locally and across the Group. AR Packaging is a growing group of companies, and this is high at 72%, with a slight decrease from 2016. The Nordic rate was 8% (10% in 2106) and the fluctuation rate was 6% reflected in the total number of employees. With the Indonesian plants generally have a higher percentage of female employees, (7% in 2016). plants fully incorporated in 2017, the number of employees but one of the Indonesian plants enters the top 6 list in 2017. increased to 3 386 at the end of the year, which means the Most of the 46% women in Semarang work with a complex The main age range continues to be 30-50 years, but in 2017 number of employees has doubled since 2014.

The main goal of the engagement is not to get attention, but to engage socially with long-term measures. These activities are mainly promoted by the plants themselves, often in cooperation with local organisations and authorities to keep, maintain and increase a good relationship with them. Two examples of activities in 2017 are: GRAZ, AUSTRIA, SUPPORTED THE RED CROSS FLEXTRUS, LUND, SPONSORING ACTIVITIES CHRISTMAS DONATIONS • A school in Africa receives financial support used locally At Christmas time the local Red Cross organisations start donato buy food and utilities and thereby maintain and develop tion initiatives in schools asking for food donations in order to schools and motivate parents to send their children to school. support local families in need of even the most basic products like • Forwarding the rest value of replaced mobile phones to the noodles, rice or canned food.

It is also to observe anticipated workflows at workplaces and to analyse where physical and adverse workloads can be reduced. In 2017 such analysis with a focus on ergonomics was made, for example, at the plant in Cholet, France, showing that often small ideas with less cost impact can make a difference. The following examples are from Cholet: PRE-PRESS STORAGE INK STATION RISK ASSESSMENTS IN AUGSBURG The varnish plate storage in the pre-press department was With the purchase of an automatic ink dosage station and ink To build a sustainable health and work culture, workers must improved.

With support of the Safety managers, each department leader with their employees had to work out risk factors and do assessments before and after measures taken to reach low risk factors. The risk assessments will of course be followed up regularly.

A main advantage of all our carton-based products several initiatives are already implemented e.g. green electricis the closed carbon cycle when it comes to the cartonboard. ity from renewable sources, no waste going to landfill, inhouse As an industry based on the renewable resource of the forest, recycling of APET material side trim, use of recycled bottle cartonboard has a unique advantage as a packaging material. It grade incorporated in materials and many more. Customers can be claimed that the raw material derived from sustainably are guided on material choices, including bio-polymer alternamanaged forests captures and stores carbon, that cartons in use tives and, where possible, with minimized material usage and continue to store carbon, and that recycling cartons keeps the optimised product shelf life. carbon locked up and prevents it from returning to the atmosphere: the Cartonboard Life Cycle. Pro Carton (the European Association of Carton and Cartonboard manufacturers) has published many explanations on sustainability of carton-based folding boxes as well as background to the carbon cycle, which can be found at www.procarton.com/sustainability. CDP ENGAGEMENT Several of the Group’s larger customers are engaged in the reduction of carbon emissions and also disclose their performance on platforms such as Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) or in company specific regular sustainability reports. Looking at the supply chain, they request comparable ways of reporting and ongoing actions to reduce the CO2 footprint from their suppliers. In some cases AR Packaging is also directly involved in concrete customer projects, e.g. on reduction of emissions from transport which started with one customer at the end of 2017.

Waste from sewers, forest, industry and food residues and manure are taken care of and become valuable products as renewable energy and fertilizers. The remaining residues that arise in biogas production can be returned to agriculture as organic manure and thereby reduces the need for mineral fertilizer and the withdrawal of the finite resource of phosphorus. Bio based fertilizer improves soil quality, reduce the leakage of nitrogen from agriculture and is important for meeting the demand of products produced in organic agriculture. By using biogas, AR Packaging contributes to a sustainable circular economy.

CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, is an international nongovernmental organization that collects and discloses environmental information related to companies and cities. Acting as a representative for institutional investors across the globe, CDP encourages major companies worldwide to disclose information regarding climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, water management, and other environmental concerns and also evaluates such companies.
