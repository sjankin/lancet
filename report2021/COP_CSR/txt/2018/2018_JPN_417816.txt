Since its establishment, NRI has made “Discerning new social paradigms and assuming the role of implementing such paradigms” and “Building client’s trust and prospering together with clients” its corporate missions, and has expressed its enthusiasm in continuously creating new business models in its corporate statement “Dream up the future.” NRI has made numerous recommendations for society and policy, developing unique businesses that include shared online services. NRI is currently promoting its long-term management vision “Vision2022,” which spans a period of eight years (from the year ended March 2016 to the year ending March 2023), as well as the first half of this vision, the Medium-Term Management Plan (from the year ended March 2017 to the year ending March 2019). Through promotion of the Vision and the Plan, NRI will work toward sustainable growth as well as mediumto long-term improvement of its corporate value with unchanging aspirations.

Shingo Konomoto To realize the long-term management vision, “Vision2022” (from the year President & CEO and ended March 2016 through the year ending March 2023), NRI is striving to Representative Director, achieve the goals of the Medium-Term Management Plan (from the year Member of the Board ended March 2017 through the year ending March 2019), which makes up the first half of the Vision. The year ended March 2017 was a solid first step as the opening year of the Medium-Term Management Plan. Under this plan, NRI is aiming for sustainable growth, solidifying its core Corporate IT business, which helps to improve the quality and efficiency of clients’ back-office work, while developing global business and Business IT business, which contributes directly to the expansion of client’s business. The year ending March 2018 marks the 30th anniversary of the merger between the former Nomura Research Institute, Japan’s first privatesector think tank, and Nomura Computer Systems, a pioneering systems integrator. We will continue to meet the expectations of our stakeholders as we carry on the powerful commitment to social responsibility embedded in the founding spirit of both companies. 17 Nomura Research Institute Contents ▶ ▶ Looking Back on the First year of the Medium-Term [Digital Transformation] NRI’s Strategy Management Plan The process of a business securing competitive advantages by revamping its business model, products and One year has passed since I took the helm of the NRI Group in April services through the use of new IT 2016.

We were able to achieve productivity improvements and expansion of our existing businesses, as well as to build a business foundation in new areas such as global business and Business IT. For the year ending March 2018, we are even further accelerating efforts toward achieving the goals of the Medium-Term Management Plan. In promoting the plan, NRI leverages management tools, such as the Strategy Map and the Balanced Scorecard, to go through the PDCA cycle, which includes not only target financial numbers, but also processes and qualitative goals. These tools are optimal for companies that wish to draw up their medium-to long-term vision, as NRI does, and manage the processes leading to the accomplishment of that vision. We intend to carry on using these tools on a continuous basis. See pp. 27-30 for more about progress on Vision2022 and the Medium-Term Management Plan.

Generally known as the Internet of Things, this refers to connecting a variety of items to the Internet. ▶ Diverse Human Resources Is a Major NRI Strength We are presently in a time of unprecedented change for the business environment. This is especially the case in the IT services industry, where new technologies such as AI and IoT are constantly emerging, bringing daily change to corporate activities. Within that change, there is an increase in crosscutting themes that cannot be handled by traditional categories for industries and services. Fortunately, NRI has gathered human resources with a wide range of expertise, from consulting to IT solutions, and can gain a multilateral and multilayered perspective. Corporate management during a period of 19 Nomura Research Institute Contents ▶ transformation requires a multifaceted point of view and validation.

NRI is presently operating under a business model notable for high profitability within the IT services industry. While holding on to such a successful experience, it can be difficult to foster a climate open to striving toward new areas like global business and Business IT. When launching Business IT within an existing organization, it can also be difficult to keep employees motivated because the operational scale is still so small. As one solution to this issue, we established a new company, NRI digital, Ltd., bringing together consultants and system engineers into one organization and giving them a place to pursue ideas for open innovation. Management must be sensitive to issues such as these, and it must prepare a system under which all employees can focus on doing new work. Moving forward, I intend to gather momentum by preparing more new vehicles to serve in similar roles to NRI digital.

However, it appears that they have yet to computer solutions as a service, much yield any concrete results. Also, IT venders have a trend of appealing to like water or electricity. NRI offers Prime Settlement Services, which clients based only on the functionality of new technologies. Regardless combine our BPO (Business Process of the era, technology is simply a means to an end. The question we Outsourcing) services that take on incidental work into a package with should be thinking about is how to use those tools to solve problems in shared online services for investment management. banking firms. If we were to make the transformation of a business into story chapters, the first chapter would involve clarifying the nature of that company’s business model and the main issues it faces. The theme of the second chapter would be thinking of a way that IT can contribute toward solving those issues. Finally, IT would be implemented in the third chapter, thus resolving the issues. Without the strong chapters 1 and 2, the transformation brought about by technology in chapter 3 would not be possible. I believe there are two major directions to take to transform a business model with Business IT. The first is in how to create points of contact with the client. The direction that will lead to expanded profits is to identify the best opportunity for communication with the client, based on analysis of big data taken from physical locations, call centers, 21 Nomura Research Institute Contents ▶ websites, and smartphone apps. NRI’s Strategy A similar approach can be taken in after-sales services, using IoT to gather operating data of sold equipment in real time. The second direction is improving the efficiency and sophistication of internal work. Speeding up or automating processing for a company’s supply chain or service delivery processes is beneficial, both in terms of client satisfaction and cost reduction. At NRI, we are moving forward on such initiatives, including the introduction of RPA for BPO services that [RPA (Robotics Process Automation)] target post-trading operations for financial institutions. These are efforts to use robots to No matter which of the above two directions one considers, it is not automate the various PC operations possible to provide an effective proposal without fully understanding done by people. the client’s business. At NRI, we have two types of human capital: consultants with familiarity in a variety of industries and operational processes, and system engineers who can use the latest IT while also considering practicality. This is the point for which NRI has a large advantage over other companies in Business IT areas. Business IT is not currently at the stage where we can predict the scale of the market based on this theme. Over the next few years, we hope to create a competitive platform by accumulating results from proof of concepts run together with our clients. We then plan to extend this platform to clients with similar problems. ▶ Competing on Value in the Global Market Over the past year, we have taken a variety of different measures. That said, rather than target costs or scale, NRI’s competitive strategy by creating new value remains unchanged. Even the global M&As that we conducted during the period were not done in pursuit of increasing scale. For an IT services company looking to expand globally, M&As are unavoidable. Different countries have many points of difference, such as regulations and business customs, and local business will not be successful without human resources that understand these differences. However, it is difficult for NRI to manage a company that has a completely different corporate culture. We adhere to a policy of finding and befriending like-minded companies that have unique IP. Integrated Report 2017 22 ▶ Message from the President In the year ended March 2017, we strengthened our efforts in the field of asset management. Looking at the financial IT market as a whole, the asset management field is not that large, but NRI does have T-STAR, a shared online service for this field. In June 2016, we acquired the US firm Cutter Associates, looking to spur further growth in this field. Cutter Associates is a company with intimate knowledge of the clients and product services in the North American market, and it evaluates and provides support for the introduction of package solutions for asset management firms. Moving forward, we are looking to evaluate the competitiveness of NRI’s IP in the local market and expand our business in North America. Also, our Australian subsidiary ASG, which joined the Group in December 2016, has established a unique business model based on cloud services. The Australian market is internationally on the leading edge of using cloud computing, and ASG’s business model can be deployed in Japan as well as the rest of the world. While putting serious effort into promoting the PCI Strategy in the Japanese market, NRI will [PCI (Package Cloud Integration) Strategy] also adopt ASG’s IP. This refers to combining work See PCI Strategy on p. 37. packages with cloud services to bring down development time and costs. ▶ Expanding Value Proposition for Corporate IT Competition on value is the same, even in the area of Corporate IT where NRI currently excels. In the US market, use of utility services in the area of Corporate IT has become firmly established, and system integration service for an individual company is falling to about 20% of total sales in the IT services industry. On the other hand, use of utility services, where clients do not own the systems, has exceeded 50% of the sales in this area. Those ratios are still reversed in the Japanese IT services market, but we expect those numbers to eventually approach the US market. 23 Nomura Research Institute Contents ▶ NRI owns many shared online services, primarily geared toward NRI’s Strategy the financial industry, but we are strengthening our utility services that combine BPO services in this field. For example, our subsidiary DSB Co., Ltd. provides BPO services to retail brokerage firms, and NRI Process Innovation, Ltd. serves a similar role for asset management firms. There is still plenty of room to expand our value provided in Corporate IT if we understand the needs of the client and add new ideas. ▶ Quality Management is a Top Priority Issue Up to this point, I have been emphasizing our measures for attack, but the foundation upon which our management has been able to develop bold measures was built on the success we have had over the past several years in avoiding large-scale unprofitable projects in NRI’s system development. Throughout NRI’s more than 50 years of history, we have had many successes and failures, reaffirming the importance of project management each time and allowing our quality management system to evolve. Even now, the Quality Management Division, in charge of company-wide project management, takes the lead in thorough deliberation at the proposal and quotation stage to ensure that projects are reasonable. The division also works to improve knowledge management related to the management of projects, and is steadily promoting various other improvements. NRI is currently driving forward improvements in work style by advocating “health and productivity management,” and the key elements for allowing employees to continue working in a lively way, both physically and mentally, is thorough risk management in systems development processes and ensuring that there are no failures in systems operation. In other words, it is necessary to ensure flawless quality management. Project management is a top priority issue for supporting NRI’s backbone, and we continually work to remain vigilant and improve this area. See pp. 63-64 for more on quality management. Integrated Report 2017 24 ▶ Message from the President ▶ Promoting CSV Based on the NRI’s Founding Spirit January 2018 marks the 30th anniversary of the merger between the former Nomura Research Institute, Japan’s first private-sector think tank, and Nomura Computer Systems, a pioneering systems integrator. The former Nomura Research Institute was founded in 1965, and a slump in the securities market led to increasing concerns about the future of Japan’s society and economy. The stated purpose of its founding was “service toward the promotion of industry, the economy, and the community.” Nomura Computer Systems, established in 1966, has also inherited similar DNA as a pioneer of commercial computer use in Japanese society. The new entity NRI, established through the merger of these two companies, does not simply provide research, consulting and IT solutions. It carries in its DNA a mission to navigate Japanese society. Since my appointment as CEO, I have had increasingly more opportunities to speak with many different corporate managers. The world is changing, and we are in uncertain times. There are many who would like to see NRI proactively make recommendations or take initiatives toward finding a direction for Japan moving forward, and toward finding solutions to the issues that face our country, companies, and people. Because of this background, NRI has very recently been reviewing its targeted CSR activities to place a greater emphasis on the idea of CSV. [CSV (Creating Shared Value)] CSV is the idea of a company using its strengths to solve social issues, This concept was proposed by Michael E. Porter, professor at Harvard ultimately leading to sustainable growth for that company. The spirit University, as an alternative to CSR. behind CSV is very close to the founding ideals behind NRI. The idea Companies are developing this idea in line with their core business by of a company using its main business to create new value with which working it into management strategy, it contributes to society, while also achieving growth and economic conducting services and initiatives that solve social issues. expansion, is a particularly fitting story for NRI.

See pp. 43-52 for more on CSR. ▶ Meeting the Expectations of the Shareholders by Effectively Utilizing Capital The year ended March 2017 saw not only a substantial increase in dividends by a stock split, but also the acquisition and subsequent cancellation of treasury stock. Further, in the year ending March 2018, we will be issuing a commemorative dividend for the aforementioned 30-year anniversary of the merger that created NRI. Regarding ROE (return on equity), we are aiming to meet our goals in V2022 and the Medium-Term Management Plan, which are 14% for the year ending March 2023, and around 12% for the year ending March 2019. Our mindset, that sustainable growth is the most important return to shareholders, remains unchanged, but we will also continue to consider improvements for capital efficiency and an agile capital policy that is compatible with a changing management environment. As I mentioned at the outset, despite unexpected economic and political occurrences, the key measures of our Medium-Term Management Plan are steadily progressing. The Group will continue taking on new challenges in order to meet the expectations of our shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders. July 2017 Shingo Konomoto President & CEO and Representative Director, Member of the Board Integrated Report 2017 26 ▶ Progress of Vision2022 and the Medium-Term Management Plan Vision2022, our long-term management vision, and its first half, the Medium-Term Management Plan, have been making steady progress.

Contribution through methodology and IT solutions I would like NRI to use its strengths in knowledge in methodology (ideas) and IT solutions for the creation of a sustainable society and the achievement of SDGs. SDGs are goals but do not provide methodologies. I think that one of the keys to achieving these goals is IT-based technology. Among the 17 SDGs, I expect NRI to focus on “Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure” Mr. Tetsuo Kondo and “Reduced Inequalities.” I realize through our past UNDP activities that ICT will encourage Director, UNDP Representation people to think about improving their lives, as the rapid spread of cellular phones in emerging Office in Tokyo, countries has demonstrated. I also think that NRI can verify and propose ideas how wealthy Adjunct Professor (Global Health people with leadership qualities can find ways to realize a better world. Policy) at the University of Tokyo*2 Change in recognition and engaging in activities that are in line with NRI’s business Based on the idea that “if we all aim at becoming developed countries, the planet would not sustain,” SDGs’ proposals for ideal development and the perfect society are completely different from the models proposed in the past. I am afraid that NRI cannot lead a new sustainable society if NRI does not change. Among the 17 SDGs, it would be appropriate for NRI, originating from a securities company, to focus on the “Partnership for the Goals” as well as “Reduced Inequalities” and Mr. Eiichi Sadamatsu take the initiative in creating a system to contribute to resolving global issues by using profits Secretary General, Japan generated from global transactions. It would be also useful to create a system to control food NGO Center for International waste at convenience stores by making use of NRI’s large amount of accumulated business Cooperation*2 knowledge and actual results of IT services, under the theme of “Responsible Consumption and Production.” Our Mission: navigation and innovation to issues Non-financial goals are included in Vision2022, our long-term management vision. For example, we aim to reduce our CO2 output by 25% ahead of Japan’s target year. In our consulting business, we mainly support planning and operation, providing assistance for infrastructure development in emerging countries as overseas activities to achieve our development goals. In our IT solution business, we provide financial institutions in emerging countries with shared online services, strive to improve infrastructure in the capital market and Kenji Yokoyama develop human resources. Senior Corporate The concept of a sustainable future society involves not only environmental issues, but also Managing Director*2, social changes brought about by artificial intelligence and IoT, as well as regional devastation NRI and revitalization. We would like to define what a “sustainable society” is, and carefully consider and address along with clear vision and policy that stand for NRI way. *2 Titles at the time this article was written 45 Nomura Research Institute Contents ▶ Solutions to Social Issues through Business Activities (CSV) There are many social issues that must be solved in this world. Through its business activities, NRI endeavors to solve these issues and lead the world to a sustainable future. “Regional Creation” × IT In times of change, new systems and services that break existing values are required. We need all kinds of knowledge and abilities to create totally new things. NRI brings about innovation based on a method called “Con-Solution,” in which consulting experts and IT solution experts create business together with clients in an integrated manner, starting from the planning stage. A good example is the “Dokokani Mairu” service (travel somewhere with miles), which Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. (JAL) Foundation Supporting NRI’s Value Creation started in December 2016. JAL and NRI “co-created” the very popular service in which passengers can take a round trip “somewhere” in Japan using 6,000 miles, where we worked together from the stage of crystallizing ideas to that of system development. This campaign not only filled in the vacant seats on flights but also generated multiple other values, such as regional revitalization and stimulation of demand for domestic trips. Through such co-creation, “Dokokani Mairu” service to rediscover the beauty of Japan Photo provided by JAL NRI endeavors to generate truly meaningful innovation. Support for Earthquake Disaster Reconstruction Kumamoto Prefecture was heavily damaged by two earthquakes of intensity seven, innumerable aftershocks and heavy rain. NRI made reconstruction proposals immediately after the Kumamoto earthquakes and has been supporting the prefecture and Mashiki. NRI has an abundance of knowledge related to regional revitalization and disaster prevention policies. We also have provided support to formulate reconstruction plans for areas damaged by the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake and the Great East Japan Earthquake. The President & CEO of NRI visited Kumamoto to offer NRI’s cooperation, based on its experience: a proposal to the prefectural government for a project to creatively rebuild the areas affected by the Kumamoto Castle as a symbol of reconstruction disasters and support to the municipality of Mashiki Town Photo provided by Kumamoto City Tourism Policy Division with reconstruction planning and implementation aid. Since then, NRI has been implementing local reconstruction activities by dispatching two employees to Mashiki Town for long-term assignments. NRI will continue to do its best to reconstruct damaged areas and develop industries post-recovery, because that is the field where NRI is in its element. Integrated Report 2017 46 ▶ NRI’s CSR Diversity Management NRI continues to promote diversity and health and productivity management in order to enable human resources with diverse values to thrive regardless of race, nationality, gender and age. We believe that respecting employees’ diverse values allows greater creativity in business activities. Also, it is essential for NRI’s sustainable business growth that its employees work enthusiastically and maintain good mental and physical health.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 31st March, 2015 (unaudited), 2016 and 2017 1. Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business The NRI Group (Nomura Research Institute, Ltd. (the “Company”) and its 54 consolidated subsidiaries) and its affiliates (5 companies) engage in the following four business services: “consulting services,” comprised of research, management consulting and system consulting; “system development & application sales,” comprised of system development and the sales of package software products; “system management & operation services,” comprised of outsourcing services, multi-user system services, and information services; and “product sales.” Information on the NRI Group’s operations by segment is included in Note 24. Basis of Presentation Fina nc ia l Se c tion The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the NRI Group are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. In addition, the notes to the consolidated financial statements include information which is not required under accounting principles generally accepted in Japan but is presented herein as additional information. Certain reclassifications have been made to present the accompanying consolidated financial statements in a format which is familiar to readers outside Japan. Basis of Consolidation and Application of Equity Method The accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31st March, 2015, 2016 and 2017 include the accounts of the Company and all companies which are controlled directly or indirectly by the Company. All subsidiaries (29, 41 and 54 for the years ended 31st March, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively) have been consolidated. The major consolidated subsidiaries are NRI Netcom, Ltd., NRI SecureTechnologies, Ltd., NRI Data iTech, Ltd., NRI Process Innovation, Ltd., NRI System Techno, Ltd., DSB Co., Ltd., DSB Information System Co., Ltd., Nomura Research Institute Holdings America, Inc., Brierley & Partners, Inc., Nomura Research Institute (Beijing), Ltd., Nomura Research Institute Asia Pacific Private Limited and ASG Group Limited as of 31st March, 2017. During the year ended 31st March, 2017, the NRI Group acquired shares of ASG Group Limited., and six other companies, and acquired equity interests in three companies, and established three companies. As a result, ASG Group Limited., and twelve other companies are newly included in the scope of consolidation. 9 Integrated Report 2017 78 1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Basis of Consolidation and Application of Equity Method (continued) The NRI Group’s investments in affiliated companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method, and, accordingly, the NRI Group’s share of such affiliates’ income or loss is included in consolidated income. All affiliated companies (3, 5 and 5 for the years ended 31st March, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively) have been accounted for by the equity method. The major affiliated companies are Marubeni IT Solutions Inc., iVision Shanghai Co., Ltd. and Wealth Square Co., Ltd. as of 31st March, 2017. Fiscal year-ends of consolidated subsidiaries The closing date of fifteen consolidated subsidiaries is 31st December, and that of seven other consolidated subsidiaries is 30th June. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of these subsidiaries based on a provisional closing of accounts as of the consolidated fiscal year end are used. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents, as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows, are defined as low-risk, highly liquid, short-term investments maturing within three months from their respective acquisition dates which are readily convertible into cash. Investment Securities The NRI Group determines the appropriate classification of investment securities as either trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale securities based on its holding objectives. Available-for-sale securities include marketable securities and non-marketable securities. Securities held for trading purposes are stated at market value and the cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are stated at market value as of the balance sheet date and the cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method. Unrealized gain or loss on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities is included as a separate component of net assets, net of the applicable taxes. Non-marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are stated at cost and the cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method. Inventories Inventories are stated at cost based on the identified cost method (in cases where profitability has declined, the book value is reduced accordingly). 10 79 Nomura Research Institute Contents ▶ 1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Depreciation of Property and Equipment (other than leased assets) Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated principally by the decliningbalance method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. However, buildings (excluding facilities attached to the buildings) acquired on or after 1st April, 1998 and facilities attached to the buildings and structures acquired on or after 1st April, 2016 by the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries are depreciated by the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives. Amortization of Software and Other Intangibles (other than leased assets) Development costs of computer software to be sold are amortized by the straight-line method over a useful life of three years, based on the estimated volume of sales or the estimated sales revenue with the minimum amortization amount. Software intended for use by the NRI Group for the purpose of rendering customer services is being amortized by the straight-line method over useful lives of up to five years. Other intangible assets are amortized by the straight-line method over their respective estimated Fina nc ia l Se c tion useful lives. Depreciation and Amortization of Leased Assets Leased tangible assets under finance leases that do not transfer ownership are mainly depreciated by the declining-balance method over the lease period. Leased intangible assets under finance leases that do not transfer ownership are amortized by the straight-line method over the lease period. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided based on the NRI Group’s historical experience with respect to write-offs and an estimate of the amount of specific uncollectible accounts. Provision for Loss on Orders Received To prepare for future losses in following years on orders received, a provision has been provided for loss on orders received outstanding, when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated as of the end of the year. Reserve for Financial Products Transaction Liabilities To prepare for losses arising from securities-related transactions at a subsidiary that operates a financial services business, a provision has been provided pursuant to Article 175 of the Cabinet Ordinance on Financial Instruments Business, Etc. in accordance with Article 46-5 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. 11 Integrated Report 2017 80 1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Retirement and Severance Benefits for Employees In calculating retirement benefit obligations, the NRI Group has adopted the benefit formula basis as the method for attributing the expected retirement benefits to accounting periods. Actuarial gain and loss is amortized by the straight-line method over a defined period, not exceeding the average remaining service period of the employees (5 to 15 years) from the next fiscal year after the incurrence. Prior service cost is amortized by the straight-line method over a defined period, not exceeding the average remaining service period of the employees (12 to 15 years). Revenue Recognition Revenues arising from made-to-order software and consulting projects are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method. The percent completed is estimated by the ratio of the costs incurred to the estimated total costs. Translation of Major Assets and Liabilities Denominated in Foreign Currencies All short-term and long-term monetary receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. The foreign exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. The balance sheet accounts of the consolidated foreign subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the current exchange rate as of the balance sheet date except for shareholders’ equity, which is translated at the historical rate. Revenue and expense accounts of consolidated foreign subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the average exchange rate during the year. Differences arising from such translation are stated as “foreign currency translation adjustment” and “non-controlling interests” in the net assets section. Derivatives and Hedging Activities The NRI Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts as means of hedging exposure to currency and interest rate risks. Derivatives are stated at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. For derivatives used for hedging purposes, the gains and losses are deferred until the hedged item is recognized. Forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into for the purpose of hedging the currency risk associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, including forecasted transactions, and interest rate swap contracts are entered into for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk associated with the underlying borrowings. As for the hedging instruments and hedged items, an evaluation of hedge effectiveness is performed for each hedging transaction. However, if the material conditions of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are the same and the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective, an evaluation of the effectiveness is omitted. 12 81 Nomura Research Institute Contents ▶ 1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Amortization of Goodwill Amortization of goodwill is determined on a case by case basis using the straight-line method generally over a period not exceeding 20 years. Appropriation of Capital Surplus and Retained Earnings Under the Corporation Law of Japan, the appropriation of capital surplus and retained earnings with respect to a given period is made by resolution of the shareholders at a general meeting or by resolution of the Board of Directors. Appropriations from capital surplus and retained earnings are reflected in the consolidated financial statements applicable to the period in which such resolutions are approved. Accounting Change In association with amendments to Japan’s Corporate Tax Act, the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries have applied “Practical Solution on a change in depreciation method due to Tax Reform 2016” (Practical Issues Task Force No. 32 on 17th June, 2016) from the Fina nc ia l Se c tion year ended 31st March, 2017. As a result, the depreciation method for facilities attached to buildings and structures acquired on or after 1st April, 2016 has been changed from the declining-balance method to the straight-line method. The effect of this change on the consolidated financial statements was immaterial. Additional Information (Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees etc. through Trusts) The Company has introduced a “Trust-type Employee Stock Ownership Incentive Plan” for employees (including employees of the consolidated subsidiaries, and the same shall apply hereinafter). The purpose of this plan is to promote the Company’s perpetual growth by providing incentives to employees for increasing the Company’s corporate value in the midto long-term and to enhance benefits and the welfare of employees. This is an incentive plan under which gains from the Company’s share price appreciation are distributed to all participants in the Employee Stock Ownership Group (the “ESOP Group”). The Employee Stock Ownership Trust (the “ESOP Trust”) was established exclusively for the ESOP Group to carry out this plan in March, 2016. The ESOP Trust acquires the number of the Company’s shares in advance, which the ESOP Group would expect to acquire over a period of three years subsequent to the establishment of the ESOP Trust. Then, the ESOP Trust sells them to the ESOP Group each time the ESOP Group is to acquire of the Company’s shares. When the share price appreciates and earnings have accumulated in the ESOP Trust, upon its termination, a cash distribution of the funds will be made to beneficiaries. Since the Company guarantees the loans of the ESOP Trust taken out to purchase the Company’s shares, the Company is obligated to repay the remaining liabilities of the ESOP Trust under a guarantee agreement if any obligations remain unsettled upon termination of the ESOP Trust. 13 Integrated Report 2017 82 1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) The Company includes the assets and liabilities of the ESOP Trust at the end of the fiscal year in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The Company records the Company’s shares that the ESOP Trust owns at the end of the fiscal year at the acquisition costs of the ESOP Trust in the net assets section as treasury stock. The Company records the earnings on stock in the ESOP Trust in the liabilities section as a suspense account to be settled. The Company records the losses on stock in the ESOP Trust in the assets section as a suspense account to be settled and also a provision when it is expected that the outstanding loans used to purchase shares will remain unsettled at the termination of the ESOP Trust. The shares of the Company held by the ESOP Trust amounting to ¥9,431 million (corresponding to 2,647 thousand* shares) and ¥6,912 million ($61,610 thousand) (corresponding to 1,947 thousand* shares) and the loan payable of the ESOP Trust amounting to ¥10,200 million and ¥6,827 million ($60,852 thousand) are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of 31st March, 2016 and 2017, respectively. * The above number of shares of the Company’s common stock reflects the 1.1-for-1 stock split effective 1st January, 2017. 2. U.S. Dollar Amounts The Company maintains its books of account in yen. The U.S. dollar amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto represent the arithmetic results of translating yen into dollars at ¥112.19 = U.S.$1.00, the rate of exchange prevailing on 31st March, 2017. The U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of the reader and the translation is not intended to imply that the assets and liabilities which originated in yen have been or could be readily converted, realized or settled in U.S. dollars at the above or any other rate. 14 83 Nomura Research Institute Contents ▶ 3. Financial Instruments 1) Qualitative information (a) Policy for financial instruments In the course of business operations, the NRI Group raises short-term funds through bank loans and commercial paper, and raises long-term funds through bank loans and issuances of corporate bonds. The NRI Group manages funds by utilizing low-risk financial instruments. The NRI Group’s policy is to only enter into derivative transactions to reduce risks, and not for speculative purposes. (b) Details of financial instruments and related risk and risk management system Although accounts receivable and other receivables are exposed to customers’ credit risk, the historical loan loss ratio is low and those receivables are usually settled in a short period of time. The NRI Group tries to reduce credit risk by managing due dates and balances of each customer, as well as monitoring and analyzing customers’ credit status. Accounts payable as operating payables are usually settled in a short period of time. Although operating receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to exchange rate fluctuation risk, the risk is partially hedged Fina nc ia l Se c tion by forward foreign exchange contracts. Investment securities, comprised of shares of companies with which the NRI Group has operational relationships, bonds and bond investment trusts, are exposed to issuers’ credit risk, risks of volatility of market prices, and foreign currency exchange and interest rates. To reduce these risks, the NRI Group monitors market value and the issuers’ financial status periodically. Long-term loans receivable represent construction assistance fund receivables, which were repaid in January, 2017. Bonds and long-term loans payable, which are mainly for fund raising related to capital investments, are exposed to fluctuation risk of interest rates. The interest-rate risk related to bonds is hedged by interest rate swap contracts. As for liquidity risk, the Company reduces the risk by managing the NRI Group’s overall funds with the cash flow forecast and ensuring stable sources of funding. In addition, a subsidiary, which operates financial services business, provides loans on margin transactions and operating loans. Loans on margin transactions as margin transaction assets, which are loans to securities companies, are exposed to credit risk. The subsidiary, therefore, sets the credit limit for each securities company, secures the securities purchased by the securities companies as collateral and receives guarantee deposits for loans on margin transactions. Operating loans, which are loans for individual or corporate customers, are exposed to credit risk. The subsidiary, therefore, receives securities as collateral for operating loans. Derivatives transactions are forward foreign exchange transactions to hedge the exchange rate fluctuation risk associated with receivables and payables in foreign currencies, including forecasted transactions and interest rate swap transactions to hedge the interest rate fluctuation risk associated with the borrowings. Hedge accounting has been applied to all derivative transactions. Although these are exposed to the credit risk of financial institutions, the NRI Group reduces the risk by doing business only with highly rated financial institutions. In executing of the transactions, the treasury department acts in accordance with the resolution of the board of directors, defining hedging transactions and related authority. Transaction results are regularly reported to the board of directors. An evaluation of hedge effectiveness is performed for each transaction. However, if the material conditions of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are the same and there is high effectiveness for each hedge transaction, an evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted. 15 Integrated Report 2017 84 3. Financial Instruments (continued) 1) Qualitative information (continued) (c) Supplementary explanation of the fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, and when there is no quoted market price available, fair value is based on management assumption.

Note 1: Methods to determine the estimated fair value of financial instruments Assets a. Cash and bank deposits and short-term guarantee deposits Fina nc ia l Se c tion Their carrying amount approximates the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. b. Accounts receivable and other receivables Their carrying amount approximates the fair value due to the generally short maturities of these instruments. For those receivables due after one year, the present value is further discounted by the rate corresponding to the credit risk and the amount is presented in the consolidated balance sheet, therefore, the carrying amount approximates fair value. c. Short-term investment securities, investment securities and investments in affiliates The fair value of stocks is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of bonds is based on either quoted market prices or prices provided by the financial institution making markets in these securities. The fair value of investment trusts is based on publicly available net asset values. d. Operating loans and margin transaction assets The fair value of these instruments, to which variable rates are applied, approximates the carrying amount because the variable rates reflect market interest rates over a short term unless the credit conditions of the counterparty change significantly after disbursement. With regard to potentially doubtful receivables, the amount of the allowance for doubtful receivables is determined based on the estimated amount collectible under collateral agreements, and their fair value approximates the carrying amount less the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts on the consolidated balance sheet. e. Long-term loans receivable Long-term loans receivable consists of deposits and guarantee money. The fair value of long-term receivables is based on the present value of the total future cash flows, which are the principal and the interest, discounted by the risk free rate corresponding to the time remaining until maturity. 17 Integrated Report 2017 86 3. Financial Instruments (continued) 2) Fair value of financial instruments (continued) Note 1: Methods to determine the estimated fair value of financial instruments (continued) Liabilities a. Accounts payable, short-term loans payable, margin transaction liabilities and short-term guarantee deposits received Their carrying amount approximates the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. b. Bonds The fair value of bonds is based on the quoted market price. c. Long-term loans payable The fair value of long-term loans payable, to which variable rates are applied, approximates the carrying amount because the variable rates reflect market interest rates over a short term. Those with fixed interest rates, on the other hand, are calculated by discounting the total amount of principal and interest by an interest rate assumed to be applied if the similar loans were newly executed. Derivative transactions The fair values are calculated based on the quoted price obtained from counterparty financial institutions.

Fina nc ia l Se c tion 60 Integrated Report 2017 128 [Appendix 1] SUMMARY OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN JAPANESE AND U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP in certain material respects. Such differences are discussed below and address only those differences related to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, no attempt has been made to identify disclosure, presentation or classification differences that would affect the manner in which transactions and events are presented in the financial statements. The significant differences between Japanese GAAP and U.S. GAAP which would affect the determination of consolidated net income and shareholders’ equity of the Company are set out below: 1. Trust-type Employee Stock Ownership Incentive Plan The Company introduced a “Trust-type Employee Stock Ownership Incentive Plan” in March 2011. Please see Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies: Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees etc. through Trusts ” for an outline of this plan and corresponding accounting treatment under Japanese GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires the adoption of ASC 718 for an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”), which is an employee retirement and severance benefit plan using company treasury stock to make the employees’ property. However, the incentive plan introduced by the Company differs from an ESOP, and ASC 718 is not applied. 129 Nomura Research Institute Contents ▶ Fina nc ia l Se c tion Integrated Report 2017 130 ▶ NRI Group Network (As of 1st July, 2017) ▶For more about NRI Group offices around the world: http://www.nri.com/global/company/office/index.html Nomura Research Institute, Ltd.
