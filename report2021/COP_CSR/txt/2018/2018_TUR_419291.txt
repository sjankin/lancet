Yaşar 2017 Sustainability Report 1 YAŞAR 2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT THE STARS POINT OUT TO THE FUTURE We are proud to present you Yaşar 2017 Sustainability Report. While preparing the theme of our report this year, the stars have been our inspiration. First of all, stars are sustainable with their existences. Such that, regardless of which geography we are from, which culture we come from, all individuals on earth point out that they make the exact picture that they expect them to do when they look in the sky. In this sense, it is possible to say that they are the symbol of trust as well as we can state that they are the beings that we are inspired by. Throughout the history, we have considered the stars in a positive way; they empowered compassion and love for some of us and courage and curiosity for some. On a common ground, we can say that they point out to a future that we believe to be “better”. POWERFUL SYNERGY We have also attributed different meanings to the stars. For example, we have wished to see each one of the shining stars symbolising Yaşar Group Companies and to see Yaşar Group that forms when they are taken together. With the same point of view, we have thought that each star symbolised Yaşar Group employees and stakeholders. We have dreamed of that horde of stars as a community that works for a better future and takes its power from unifying values. INDICATOR OF DIRECTIONS We cannot ignore the leading features and functions of the stars. It has been the biggest power for many people losing their directions by pointing out to the target even in the hardest times. The products and services of Yaşar Group having become guests to our homes and touching at least for once to the lives of Turkish people have showed up like a star in Turkish economy and sustainably keep shining like stars. It must not to be forgotten that the founder of Yaşar Group, our Honorary President, Selçuk Yaşar is a leader who has put signature under distinguished successes in Turkish business world and who has introduced the “firsts” to Turkish people. As a Group that follows the Yaşar path on which its founder shines like a star, we keep going forward on our path with our sustainable activities and with the same ideals. WE WILL CARE WELL 2017 We wanted to emphasise five main topics that constitute the foundation of our systematic of values with the lines set out by the stars unifying and with the shapes formed by those lines. From now on, as well as so far, we shall continue to reflect our sustainable Sustainability perspective that always provide added value, develop, bring goodness, happiness and success for our employees, our business, our environment, our society and our business partners with the same motivation.
