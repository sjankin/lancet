Whether it is an event to land a historic agreement or a romantic getaway for two, our hospitality plays a vital role. From the moment we extend our invitation, we carry a considerable part of the responsibility – and the credit – for the final result. And just like we care for our guests, we do the same for the world around us. Responsible Hospitality does not start and end at our gates – it is a 360 degree holistic mind-set we carry with us everywhere. We believe that when we take individual responsibility, we also improve as a whole. We listen and respond to the priorities of our stakeholders and understand the positive and negative impacts that our business can have on individuals, society and the environment. Ultimately, we believe an environmental and socially responsible approach to hospitality adds value to our business and enables us to better care for our guests and customers. And this is what we mean by Responsible Hospitality. 17 FIVE FOCUS AREAS: MARKETPLACE At BC Hospitality Group, we want to deliver high quality services and products in a sustainable framework. We can always do better, and therefore work closely with customers, guests, suppliers and partners to adjust and perfect our practices. CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT Every year, we are hosting hundreds of thousands of guests in our venues and locations. Due to our size, we have the power to integrate sustainable solutions that make a real difference. We work hard to improve our efficiency within energy and water usage, our procurement practices, waste management and more. In other words, everywhere it makes real sense and adds real value, we will make the change. Our efforts are documented in our DS 49001, ISO 14001 and Green Key certifications. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT We have a close relationship with our local community in Greater Copenhagen. A key focus area for us are marginalised groups and people outside the job market. We partner with local municipalities, NGO’s and charities to create career opportunities through employment programmes, training and apprenticeships. We also support education and research. WORKPLACE Our employees are the foundation of our business and the secret to our success. We are dedicated to building a positive, challenging and inspiring work environment with the opportunity for everyone to reach their full potential through training and job development. We value a diverse workplace where everyone is treated fairly and respectfully, and we strive to be an employer of choice. HEALTH AND SAFETY Health, Safety and Security are integrated and crucial parts of the services provided by the BC Hospitality Group. We operate only by the highest health and safety standards in all critical areas such as safety systems, hygiene, food, and sanitation. In addition, the security and safety of our customers, guests and employees are top priorities and handled accordingly. 18 19 IMPLICIT IMPACT ON ALL GOALS: STRONG OPPORTUNITY FOR DIRECT IMPACT: POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR DIRECT OR INDIRECT IMPACT: MITIGATE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT: 20 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the SDG’s.

This in turn improves societal outcomes. We want high-quality sustainable products that add value for our customers. 25 COLLABORATING ON SUSTAINABILITY Everything we consume or throw to waste has an environmental impact. Naturally, this also includes a visit to one of our restaurants, hotels or other venues. By engaging with customers, suppliers and our employees on this issue, we have the opportunity to create awareness and inspire change. The following highlights are two initiatives we took to further this agenda. 26 RESPONSIBLE HOSPITALITY DAY 2017 marked the International Year of Sustainable (Sustainable consumption and production) and Tourism for Development.

LOCAL Local sourcing stimulates our local economy. Products are fresh and short transportation reduces our climate impact. We define local as a range of 300 km from our headquarters in Copenhagen. SEASONAL Seasonal products are healthier, more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Seasonal food is very often also local. FAIRLY TRADED We support fair trading conditions and encourage sustainable farming in developing countries through our sourcing. When we have limited insight into trade and labour conditions, we prefer to buy Fair Trade certified products. It is equally important to us that products also live up to our quality standards and are available at an affordable price. When purchasing products that are not e.g. organically certified/labelled, we practice due diligence towards the supplier. For example through direct engagements with suppliers, visiting sites and working with experts to ensure best practice regarding the product. 28 ORGANIC AND BIODYNAMIC Less harmful chemicals and pesticides in our food mean healthier body and mind. It also keeps our ground water clean for future generations. ANIMAL WELFARE We buy meat from local farmers that are committed to animal welfare. We also believe that the highest quality meat comes from healthy animals.

We need to attract qualified candidates while also helping young people get a good start to their careers. As part of these efforts we have formed a partnership with a local public school. The partnership aims to create a better connection with the youngest generation. Activities include visits to our hotels, meeting employees and different project work. In 2018, we will continue to invest in creating more opportunities for the youth. This include pre-employment initiatives, on-the-job training and partnerships with community stakeholders.

In addition to providing storage space at Bella Center Copenhagen, many employees across the Group helped pack thousands of Christmas presents for the disadvantaged families. In addition, our hotels sponsored food and volunteers for a Christmas lunch for 70 people at a local homeless shelter. Hotel Crowne Plaza Copenhagen Towers also hosted a Christmas party for 40 refugees and their families for Egedal Refugee Network SUPPORT AND AWARENESS OF WORTHY CAUSES BC Hospitality Group also supports various other events and organisations either via donations or through awareness campaigns.
