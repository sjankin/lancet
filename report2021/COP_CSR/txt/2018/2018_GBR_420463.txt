Additional training may be provided depending on the risk associated with specific roles. Under the terms of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, employees may make a “Protected Disclosure” over certain malpractices without fear of reprisal from their employer but in addition we have a Whistleblowing Policy intended to ensure that Hermes’ employees are able to tell us about any wrongdoing at work which has occurred or which they perceive is likely to occur in the future. This policy gives employees the option to raise the matter directly with the Chief Compliance Officer or the regulator. If an employee were to have a concern related to corruption, the whistleblowing policy would enable them to raise their concerns or seek advice. Measurement of outcomes Hermes will take appropriate action (including seeking prosecution and notifying relevant regulators) against any person in employment who is involved or assists in committing a financial crime. Hermes Financial Crime program is subject to independent review by the internal audit function.

The last Internal Audit of Compliance was conducted in November and December of 2017, and the report was distributed in December 2017. The Compliance Monitoring team also review our Financial Crime Program as part of their risk based approach monitoring plan. In addition, Compliance provide a report on the Financial Crime Program to senior management on a periodic basis. On an annual basis, our Money Laundering Reporting Officer provides a report to the Board and senior management to demonstrate Hermes has established and maintain effective systems and controls for compliance with applicable financial crime requirements and standards under the regulatory system, and to counter the risk that Hermes might potentially be used to further financial crime. Major topics considered by the Risk and Compliance Committee during 2017 included approval of the Risk & Compliance Plan and the Compliance Monitoring Plan and consideration of the Money Laundering Reporting Officer’s Annual Report and Risk Assessment.
