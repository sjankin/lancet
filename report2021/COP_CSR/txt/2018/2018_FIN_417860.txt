KEMIRA REPORT 2017 | GRI DISCLOSURES | OUR PERFORMANCE INDICATORS | ENVIRONMENTAL 37 BUSINESS GRI CORPORATE FINANCIAL OVERVIEW DISCLOSURES GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS Carbon emission trends Scope 1 emissions in 2017 were consistent with 2016 emissions despite an increase in production compared to 2016. Kemira maintained emissions at the 2016 levels through the use of less carbon-intensive fuels where possible. Scope 2 emissions also remained consistent with 2016 levels due to continued improvements in energy efficiency and a higher share of purchased energy with lower GHG emissions levels (renewable sources) compared to 2016. The overall GHG emissions intensity is consistent with historical levels despite continued increases in production (7% increase in production compared to 2016, and a 12% increase in production compared to 2013). Scope 3 emissions in 2017 are consistent with previous emissions within the level of accuracy associated with the calculation methodology.

VOC increases are primarily associated with the site that is the largest emitter of VOC in Kemira. The site’s production rate increased in 2016, and the site improved the accuracy of the emissions calculation methodology for VOC. 4 Other standard categories of air emissions identified in relevant regulations. New reporting requirement starting in 2017. Includes former reporting requirement of Volatile Inorganic Compounds (VIC), which was reported as the sum of ammonia, hydrogen chloride and six other simple inorganic compounds through 2016. GRI Standard no longer requires reporting of VIC. VIC increases are primarily associated with the site that is the largest emitter of VIC in Kemira. The site’s production rate increased in 2016, and the site improved the accuracy of the emissions calculation methodology for VIC. 5 New reporting requirement starting in 2017. Changes in emissions between Other air emissions, POP, and HAP may be attributable to how emissions are regulated in a specific location. For example, acrylonitrile is specifically regulated under the term HAP in the United States and would be reported as such. However, acrylonitrile may not be regulated using the term HAP in another country and may be reported under Other air emissions. 6 A value of zero represents emissions equal to or greater than 0 and less than 0.5 tonnes. Emissions prior to 2017 were associated with one manufacturing site. In 2017, that site replaced the ODS material with a non-ODS material.

KEMIRA 2017 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IFRS) 29 BUSINESS GRI CORPORATE FINANCIAL OVERVIEW DISCLOSURES GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS New, amended IFRS-standards and IFRIC-interpretations IFRS-standard and IFRIC-interpretation The nature and effect of the change Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing (effective for annual periods beginning on 1 activities, including both cash and non-cash changes. The Group’s liabilities arising from financing activities consist of interest-bearing liabilities (Note 5.3. January 2017) Interest-bearing liabilities). A reconciliation between the opening and closing balances of these items is provided in the Note 5.1. Capital structure. Apart from this additional disclosure in the note, the application of these amendments has had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred The amendments clarify how an entity should evaluate whether there will be sufficient taxable profits against which it can utilize a deductible temporary Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses (effective for difference. The application of these amendments has had no impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements as the Group already assesses the annual periods beginning on 1 January 2017) sufficiency of future taxable profits in a way that is consistent with these amendments. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with As of January 1, 2018, Kemira adopts IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. IFRS 15 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use Customers (effective for annual periods in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. IFRS 15 supersedes the current revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue, beginning on 1 January 2018) IAS 11 Construction Contracts and the related interpretations when it becomes effective. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under IFRS 15, an entity recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when ‘control’ of the good or service underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer. Kemira’s revenue mainly consists of contract types that include the sale of chemical products and services provided in relation to the sale of these products. Kemira’s revenue recognition remains substantially unchanged and revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of the goods. In Kemira’s sales contracts the change of control to the customer is mainly based on delivery terms and revenue recognition occurs at a point in time, and adopting the IFRS 15 does not change the timing of revenue recognition. Kemira provides delivery and handling services together with the sale of the chemical products to the customers. The delivery and handling services are recognized at the same time with revenue of products and are not treated as a separate performance obligation in accordance with IFRS 15 standard. Recognition of revenue on both sale of products and delivery and handling services in the same reporting period is consistent with the accounting policy under IAS 18. Discounts provided to customers are not significant in Kemira’s sales contracts. Implementing IFRS 15 does not change the accounting treatment. Over the course of the widely communicated IFRS 15 project, organization has been informed about the new revenue recognition requirements. Based on the impact assessment IFRS 15 standard has no material impact on Kemira’s financial reporting or accounting systems. The project has resulted in enhancements in the revenue recognition related processes and controls. Kemira’s interim reports for the financial year 2018 and annual Consolidated Financial Statements 2018 will be prepared in compliance with IFRS 15 requirements. The Group adopts IFRS 15 using full retrospective method as of January 1, 2018. The comparative periods are not restated as the revenue recognition criteria remains unchanged. KEMIRA 2017 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IFRS) 30 BUSINESS GRI CORPORATE FINANCIAL OVERVIEW DISCLOSURES GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS IFRS-standard and IFRIC-interpretation The nature and effect of the change IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for As of January 1, 2018, Kemira adopts IFRS 9 Financial Instruments standard. IFRS 9 supersedes IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. annual periods beginning on 1 January 2018) IFRS introduced new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and introduces a new impairment model for financial assets, which is based on expected credit losses. Recognition and measurement of financial liabilities will mainly continue to be on the same basis as currently adopted under IAS 39. The new general hedge accounting requirements retain the three types of hedge accounting mechanisms currently available in IAS 39. However, greater flexibility has been introduced to the types of transactions eligible for hedge accounting, specifically broadening the types of instruments that qualify as hedging instruments and the types of risk components of non-financial items that are eligible for hedge accounting. IFRS 9 changes Kemira’s current credit loss recognition accounting policies relating to trade receivables. Kemira adopts a simplified credit loss model for trade receivables in which amount of credit losses is estimated by using the impairment model based on expected credit losses. In the new expected credit loss model, the credit losses vary according to ageing categories of trade receivables and geographical areas: EMEA, the Americas and APAC. In addition, the credit loss provision for trade receivables continues to be recognized based on individual risk assessment. In accordance with the new credit loss model, the adjustment of EUR 0.4 million (including deferred tax effect of EUR 0.1 million) will be recognized in the retained earnings as of January 1, 2018, and subsequent adjustments will be recognized in profit or loss. The comparative periods will not be restated. IFRS 9 impacts to the valuation of loan receivables, as expected credit losses on loan receivables are recognized. Expected credit loss of EUR 1.0 million (including deferred tax effect of EUR 0.3 million) arising from the measurement of loan receivables are recognized in transition into equity in retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. Subsequent adjustments to expected credit losses will be recognized in profit and loss. The comparative periods will not be restated. As of January 2018, non-listed PVO/TVO shares are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income. Under IAS 39 PVO/TVO shares are classified in available-for-sale financial assets. In IFRS 9 fair value changes, including gains and losses on sale, are recognized in other comprehensive income in equity and the dividends are recognized in profit or loss. The comparative periods will not be restated, except the classification change. In the previous financial years, the Group has applied cash flow hedge accounting for electricity derivatives in accordance with IAS 39. IFRS 9 provides an opportunity to apply hedge accounting separately for electricity price components of system price and area price quoted by the Nordic Electricity Exchange. Under IAS 39 the fair value changes of cash flow hedge accounted electricity derivatives are recognized in other comprehensive income and potential ineffectiveness is recognized in profit or loss. Kemira adopts IFRS 9 hedge accounting for electricity derivatives from January 1, 2018, then effective part of fair value changes related to cash flow hedge accounted electricity derivatives will be recognized in other comprehensive income and ineffectiveness will generally not arise because the components of electricity price risk will be separately hedged. The comparative periods will not be restated. The total effect on equity from trade receivables and loan receivables is EUR 1.0 million. Amendment to IFRS 2 Classification and The amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments clarify the measurement basis for cash-settled share-based payments and the accounting for Measurement of Share-based Payment modifications that change an award from cash-settled to equity-settled. Where tax law or regulation requires the employer to withhold a specified number of Transactions (effective for annual periods equity instruments equal to the monetary value of the employee’s tax obligation to meet the employee’s tax liability which is then remitted to the tax authority, beginning on 1 January 2018). The amendment such an arrangement should be classified as equity-settled in its entirety, if this would have been the classification of the arrangement without the net have not yet been endorsed for use in the EU. settlement feature. The application of the amendments will have an impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements as the Group has a share-based payment arrangement where the Group settles the employee’s withholding tax with the tax authorities. Before adoption of the amendment this feature was accounted for as a cash-settled arrangement. At adoption of this amendment, the Group will derecognize the liability related to this arrangement and reclassify the amount to equity.

It will supersede the current guidance including IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations when it becomes effective. IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer. Distinction of operating leases (off balance sheet) and finance leases (on balance sheet) are removed for lessee accounting, and is replaced by a model where a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognized for all leases by lessees (i.e. all on balance sheet) except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. In contrast to lessee accounting, IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17, and continues to require a lessor to classify a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease. In addition, IFRS 16 requires extensive disclosures. On the reporting date December 31, 2017, the Group’s operating lease commitments were EUR 197.6 million. The Group continues to assess the existing operating lease agreements to determine the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities to be recognized in the balance sheet on the basis of these agreements. The change in accounting practices relating to lease agreements is estimated to have a material impact on the Groups' financials. Balance sheet and some key figures like gearing, net debt, EBITDA and ROCE will be significantly impacted. IFRS 16 will also impact to the classifications in the income statement and cash flow. Impact assessment will continue together with relevant process, control and tool implementations during 2018. The Group expects to adopt IFRS 16 standard using the modified retrospective method for the existing and new lease agreements on January 1, 2019. The information from the prior years will not be restated and will be disclosed in accordance with the current IAS 17 standard.
