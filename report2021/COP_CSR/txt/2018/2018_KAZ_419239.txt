(419-1) The power industry in the Republic of Kazakhstan is of great importance as the key national industries such as metallurgy and oil and gas production are the highly energy intensive industries. Accordingly, the competitiveness of the production industries in Kazakhstan and the living standards are highly dependent on the reliability and quality of energy supply to consumers. The Company uses sectoral indices when evaluating the network reliability level: SAIDI System Average Interruption Duration SAIFI System Average Interruption Index defines the average one interruption Frequency Index defines the average duration per year. interruption frequency index. SAIDI SAIFI 14 0,14 0,13 12 12 0,12 10 0,1 8 0,08 6 0,06 4 0,04 0.024 0.021 2 0.91 0,02 0 0.09 0 2015 2016 2017 2015 2016 2017 EU28, EU29 The observed tendency of SAIDI and SAIFI improvement is the result of activities undertaken by the Company to improve the reliability of NPG. The Company defined SML (System Minutes Lost) and WWP (Percentage of Work Without Problems) indicators to assess the network reliability level. In 2017 SML was 1.04 minutes and WWP was 98.99% which is similar to reliability performance of the peer system operators of electric networks according to the results of completed benchmarking study under the Company's Strategy update. 16 Investment Activity In order to increase efficiency, reduce technical losses, increase the reliability of the NPG operation and the capacity of the networks, the Company continues to actively implement investment projects. In 2017 the Company disbursed KZT 57.6 billion (including KZT 5,1 billion of capitalized loan interest) vs. KZT 65.4 billion of the planned capital investments (including KZT10.8 billion of capitalized loan interest). The Company completed 96.3% of the planned amount of work excluding the capitalized loan interest. In 2017 the Company continued the implementation of investment projects totalling to KZT 107.6 billion including: construction of 500 kV Shulbinsk HPP (Semey)-Aktogai-Taldykorgan-Alma transmission line under the 'Construction of 500 kV North-East-South transit' project included into 'Nurly-Zhol' government's programme) and Pavlodar Electricity Transmission Reinforcement Project. Over the two years, KEGOC constructed 544 km of 500 kV Shulbinsk HPP (Semey) Aktogay-Taldykorgan-Alma transmission line of the total length of 883 km, including 380 km in 2017. The project work also included construction and installation at new 500 kV Taldykorgan and Aktogai substations and expansion of 500 kV Semey and Alma substations. Two 220 kV 125 MVA autotransformers were installed at 110 kV Pavlodar SS under the Pavlodar Electricity Transmission Reinforcement Project. The Company disbursed 100% of capital investments planed for maintaining the current level of operations in 2017 in the amount of KZT 5.3 billion. In 2017, the Scientific and Technical Council of KEGOC approved the feasibility study titled 'Inspection and assessment of the technical state of 220-500 kV transmission lines including the development of a feasibility study for 'Rehabilitation of the National Power Grid' project in Aktyubinskye MES, Sarbaiskiye MES, and Zapadnye MES branches of KEGOC. The project includes 26 high-voltage overhead transmission lines geographically located in Kostanaiskaya, Aktyubinskaya, West Kazahstan and Atyraskaya oblasts. The project objective: extend the service life by at least 30 years; improve the transmission conditions; increase the permissible transmission capacity and reduce losses. The Company completed evaluation of the technical condition of the facilities, analysis of the reasons for the line shutdowns, preparation of the technical conclusion, review of the advanced technologies in the electric power industry, and the options for rehabilitation of the overhead lines. In 2018, KEGOC plans to complete the project for 'Construction of 500 kV Shulbinsk HPP (Semey) -Aktogai-Taldykorgan-Alma transmission line' being a part of 'Nurly Zhol' government programme for 2015-2019 and continue the project for 'Rehabilitation of the National Power Grid'. R&D In recent years, the electric power industry is getting a clear understanding of importance and need for R&D for the company development and its long-term competitiveness. The electric power industry is a conservative industry: the service life of the primary equipment extends to several decades characterized by a long period of technology update and requires significant investments with long payback periods. In addition, unlike other industries, companies in the electricity sector are characterized by a low level of R&D. Nevertheless, R&D management is an important tool to ensure the effective growth of all leading international electric power companies. Understanding the importance of R&D for its development, KEGOC since its establishment has been engaged in R&D , which is aimed at achieving the strategic goals of the Company's LongTerm Development Strategy. The main objectives of R&D are to: create, classify and develop processes of R&D planning and implementation, taking into account their priority and urgency for the technology development in the Company; ensure efficient interaction of processes associated with the development and use of R&D products; 17 introduce R&D results to improve the efficiency and quality of operational business processes; R&D management activities in the Company are regulated by the 'Rules for organization of research and development works', which set uniform requirements for management, planning, registration, monitoring, and acceptance of research and development works implemented at the request of KEGOC. R&D shall be considered as a process comprising the entire life cycle of development: from the statement of priority scientific and technical tasks to assessment and accounting of the actual effect of the R&D results on the practical activities of the Company. One of the most urgent tasks for KEGOC is to reduce the losses of electric power when it is transmitted via electric networks. Losses or technological consumption of electricity during transmission via networks is an integral physical phenomenon during electricity transportation. One of the main technological losses of electricity is corona loss. Corona losses are caused by corona discharges occurring on the surface of overhead transmission line conductors and depend on the electric field strength, and therefore are observed only on high-voltage lines of 220-500 kV and higher. The length of 220-500 kV lines in the grid of KEGOC is more than 24 thousand km. Correspondingly, the share of corona losses within the total electricity losses in KEGOC networks is significant and amounts to 20-30% depending on weather conditions. To solve the issue of losses mitigation, KEGOC in 2017 for a total of KZT 74.6 million:  continued the work 'Feasibility study of corona losses mitigation in Kazakhstan NPG' with the involvement of NURIS (Nazarbayev University's scientific subdivision). This work studies possible ways to reduce corona losses in 500 kV KEGOC's networks by using the technologies of treating the surface of high-voltage overhead transmission line conductors;  together with ORGRES Engineering Center (Russia) KEGOC started a scientific research to reduce electric power losses in 500 kV transmission lines equipped with OPGW. The purpose of the work is to determine the causes and develop counteractions that will reduce electric power losses in 500 kV transmission lines of KEGOC equipped with OPGW that were reported to have high level of losses: L-5170 Ekibastuzskaya Agadyr and L-5320 Agadyr YuKGRES. (EU8) CORPORATE GOVERNANCE KEGOC continues systematic work on improving the corporate governance and sets high goals for achieving the level of the world's leading companies. For this purpose, the Company aims to ensure:  efficient exercise of shareholders' rights;  efficient balanced dividend policy;  efficient performance of the Board of Directors and Management Board of KEGOC;  sustainability and efficient stakeholders interaction system;  proper disclosure of information about the Company to stakeholders;  improved risk management and internal control systems.

Consolidated revenues based on 2017 results amounted to KZT 178,134.8 million and decreased by 5.6% (or KZT 10,581.5 million) compared to 2016 indicators. Operating revenues amounted to KZT 152,379.8 million. The operating revenues growth by 17.2% (or KZT 22,378.4 million) was due to increase in tariffs and regulated services volume, and electricity purchase/sale transactions conducted by FSC RES LLP. Non-operating revenues in 2017 amounted to KZT 25,755.0 million decreasing by 56.1% (or KZT 32,959.8 million) compared to 2016 mainly due to decrease in the foreign exchange gain, deposit operations, the fixed assets non-repayable receipt, and change in the fair value of long-term trade 24 receivables. At the same time, there is an increase in the income from equity participation in other organizations (share of profits of associated enterprises), interest on balances at banks, as well as income in the form of fines, penalties, forfeits under commercial contracts. Consolidated expenses in 2017 amounted to KZT 135,493.1 million, this 11.3% (or KZT 17,248.3 million) less than in 2016. Cost of sale of services rendered in 2017 was KZT 89,399.4 million, increasing by 12,6% (or KZT 10,010.6 million) compared to 2016 mainly due to higher expenses for purchase of electricity generated by renewable energy sources, technical losses of electricity, purchase of electricity from the power system of the Russian Federation to compensate for imbalances, labour payment for the operating personnel and depreciation. General and administrative expenses in 2017 amounted to KZT 13,142.4 million, this 25.5% (or KZT 4,498.0 million) less than in 2016. The decrease was mainly due to recovery of expenses for provisions (for doubtful debts under operating activities), decrease in property tax, payroll, consulting, audit and legal services expenses. Other expenses totalled to KZT 28,180.8 million, reducing by 43.0% (or KZT 21,258.5 million) compared to 2016 mainly due to decrease in currency exchange losses. According to the 2017 results, the Company's net profit amounted to KZT 32,881.3 million, which is by 19.2% (or KZT 5,291.2 million) higher than in 2016.

(102-9) ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION KEGOC considers environmental activities as an integral part of its day-to-day operations, completely understanding the necessity to keep environmental balance, to ensure environmentally sustainable social and economical development. Environmental responsibility is a key principle of KEGOC Environmental Policy. The goal of KEGOC Environmental Policy is to minimize adverse environmental impact, increase the level of environmental safety, take responsibility for environmental security of Kazakhstan National Grid development, promote energy saving and rational use of environmental and energy resources in the Company’s activities. KEGOC Management takes the responsibility for implementation of KEGOC's Environmental Policy obligations on continuous improvement and pollution prevention, as well as obligation to meet applicable legislative and other requirements related to KEGOC in terms of its environmental aspects. All employees of the Company as well as employees of contractors working for the Company shall read and understand KEGOC's Environmental Policy. The Company implemented the environmental management system (EMS), which is certified for compliance with the requirements of international standard ISO 14001. EMS operates within the integrated management system of KEGOC. The main objective of its implementation and operation is to apply new management methods that would enhance the influence on the environment of the Company's production and economic activities. In 2017 the Company successfully confirmed the compliance of the existing environment management system with ISO 14001 standard. The environmental (risk) aspects management is a component of the corporate risk management system in KEGOC. In order to prevent adverse environmental impact, KEGOC annually assesses environmental risks and determines mitigating measures which were fully implemented in 2017. For effective management in 2017 the Company developed: the register of regulatory requirements applicable to the identified environmental risks of KEGOC; registers of environmental risks and important environmental risks of KEGOC for 2017. When identifying the risks, all components of the environmental impact of the Company's activities are analysed (energy saving, water, soil, emissions, waste). 'PCB-containing waste', 'transformer oil' and 'waste transformer oil' were identified as critical environmental risks in 2017. The 'PCB-containing waste' aspect is critical due to the fact that polychlorinated biphenyl is a dangerous substance according to the Environmental Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan (red hazard level). The 'spent transformer oil' and 'transformer oil' risks are critical due to the existence of oil-filled equipment. To manage environmental risks, KEGOC prepared the Environmental Programme for 2017 which defines the necessary environmental measures, as well as costs for their implementation. Ambient Air Protection According to the standards MES branches identified stationary sources of harmful emissions (both organized and unorganized emission sources). In order to reduce emissions from stationary sources and mitigate their impact on atmosphere, the MES branches in 2017 conducted the monitoring 27 of the operations: kept records of hours of operation for each item of equipment and consumption of materials. The environmental monitoring of operations conducted by the qualified organisations shall determine stationary resource emissions through calculations or laboratory measurements. In 2017 the volume of gross emissions of contaminants from stationary sources amounted to 15.81 tons (the established standard 20.7 tons). Emissions from stationary sources in 2017 Name of Emissions from stationary sources t/y KEGOC's MES branch Plan Actual Akmolinskiye MES 2.91 2.91 Aktyubinskiye MES 1.14 0.42 Almatinskiye MES 2.94 0.68 Vostochnye MES 4.68 4.68 Zapadnye MES 0.94 0.25 Sarbaiskiye MES 1.48 1.48 Severnye MES 0.11 0.11 Tsentralnye MES 5.18 5.18 Yuzhnye MES 1.33 0.10 Total: 20.70 15.81 Thus, gross emissions of contaminants from stationary sources (with regard to standard rate) have dropped by 23 %, while the Long-Term Development Strategy of KEGOC planned 3% reduction. The fact of the reduced emissions in Aktyubinskiye MES, Almatinskiye MES, Zapadnye MES and Yuzhnye MES branches was supported by the findings of the environmental monitoring that was conducted by the specialized organisations. In 2018, according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement and environmental laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan, MES branches made an inventory of greenhouse gases emitted as a result of the Company operations in 2017. Greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources, and mobile sources equated to stationary sources were calculated. The 2017 reports on inventory of greenhouse gases were registered and sent to the territorial environment departments. In accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan 'On approval of the list of greenhouse gases subject to state regulation', the list includes carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and perfluorocarbons (PCFs). Following the results of inventory of greenhouse gases emitted by stationary sources, emissions amount to 143,085 tonne carbon dioxide equivalent a year, in this connection KEGOC does not fall within the requirements for greenhouse gas cap-and-trade according to the National plan for greenhouse gas quota allocation for 2018-2020. Greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources of KEGOC in 2017 СН4 N2O tonne carbon Total emissions in the CO2 tonne carbon dioxide tonne carbon dioxide tonne dioxide equivalent equivalent equivalent 143.017 0.002 0.066 143.085 According to the Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan 'On taxes and other mandatory payments to the budget' the emissions from mobile sources shall not be measured, reports specify the amount of the used fuel. The vehicles were tested for toxicity and opacity of exhaust gas. The Company does not emit any ozone-depleting substances influencing the climate change. (EU5) Waste Management 28 The waste products are generated in the course of operation, repair and rehabilitation of the substation equipment. Waste management in KEGOC is guided by the Environmental Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan and corporate standard CT KEGOC 00-602-11 'Waste management in KEGOC'. At KEGOC, all wastes are divided according to: 1) the type: production and municipal wastes (solid domestic wastes) generated in the course of life activity; 2) the hazard level (according to the Environmental Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan): 'green' – G index (non-hazardous); 'amber' – А index (hazardous); 'red' – R index (hazardous). The list of waste and their hazard level is updated as required. MES branches annually develop or amend the waste datasheets for each type of waste containing the description of waste production processes by their origin, quantitative and qualitative indicators, handling rules, monitoring techniques, environmental impact, waste producers information. For safe handling of industrial and consumer wastes, MES branches defined the areas for temporary safe and separate waste storage, prepared schematic maps of waste disposal on the territory of facilities with the explication and ensure timely removal for the subsequent disposal. In 2017, KEGOC subdivisions generated 2,548.7 tonnes of wastes. Costs for waste disposal at landfills amounted to KZT 10.6 million, costs for recycling KZT 11.5 million (mercury containing waste and industrial waste). Transformer oil and scrap metal were disposed by specialised organisations. Dynamics of waste production by tonne hazard level 2015 2016 2017 'green' – G index 2,490 2,722.287 1,739.02 'amber' – A index 905 446.305 809.68 'red' – R index – 10.530 – The work on detection of PCBs in the equipment at KEGOC substations continued in 2017; this work was performed in accordance with the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan 'On Ratification of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants' and 'Rules for handling of persistent organic pollutants and wastes containing such pollutants' (approved by the order of the Minister of Environment Protection of the Republic of Kazakhstan). MES Branches updated the PCBs containing equipment registers; the registers were submitted to the territorial environmental authorities within the established deadlines. The laboratory analyses for PCB in the oil-filled equipment planned and conducted in 2017 did not detect PCB. Akmolinskiye MES, Vostochnye MES and Severnye MES branches of KEGOC concluded contracts for packaging, transporting and disposal of PCB-contaminated electrical equipment: in Q4 2017, 22 units of electrical equipment were delivered for disposal. Water and Soil Impact The Company does not use water in its operational process. Water consumption by the Company is insignificant, so this has no material influence on used water sources. Water is consumed and discharged in accordance with contracts concluded by MES branches with specialized organisations. There are no discharges into water facilities and relief. Water is supplied from artesian wells at seven KEGOC branches; the wells are used according to obtained permissions. The specialised organisations are contracted to permanently monitor the ground water intake facilities in accordance with the Water Code of Kazakhstan. Potential sources contaminating water and soil at the Company's facilities include transformer oil used in oil-filled equipment, as well as waste waters resulting from domestic use of water. Environmental friendliness is one of high-priority criteria for KEGOC to select an equipment. 29 The Company smoothly replaces oil circuit breakers with SF6 and vacuum circuit breakers to reduce the volume of transformer oil used at substations of MES branches. The oil free equipment increases reliability, cycles to failure, life duration, fire safety, and excludes pollution of ground water and soil. Oil-filled equipment has oil receiving devices or oil soak pits that prevent oil from spilling on the soil. The containment of oil receiving devices shall be checked on regular basis. Environmental Actions during Investment Projects Implementation The Company shall address the environmental issues in a comprehensive way when implementing projects, including investment projects. PESTEL analysis is used to analyze the risks of project implementation, including analysis of social and environmental risks. The results of the conducted environmental impact assessment are taken into account, and the option that does the least harm to the environment and human health is adopted. Identification and assessment of project risks is carried out on an regular basis and at all stages of project implementation, including assessment of impact on: ambient air; surface and ground water; landscapes; land resources and soil cover; biodiversity, etc. In order to manage the environmental risks, the design shall provide that the grid facilities must be arranged in the territories well removed from populated areas and designated conservation areas. OHTL routes mainly pass along steppes and semideserts. Should the OHTL across forest-steppe zone, environmental impact assessment (EIA) shall be prepared to clean glades for the OHTL and take mitigation measures. For the purpose of transparency and availability of the environmental information on the Company's activities, the public hearings of draft EIAs are held. (102-11) Sanctions and significant fines for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations were not imposed on KEGOC in 2017. (307-1) Power consumption The main objective of energy saving and efficiency improvement at KEGOC is to reduce the consumption of energy resources through reduction of auxiliary energy consumption by KEGOC facilities, reduction of technical electricity loss while transmitting via the national power grid, improvement of the methods used for monitoring of energy consumption, and provision of the Company's facilities with electricity meters and other devices for metering of fuel and power resources, organisation of the information acquisition processes based on the metering devices. Consumption of fuel and energy resources in 2017 Electricity 10,176,714 GJ Heat power 84,630 GJ Fuel 134,10 GJ including motor gasoline 55,40 GJ diesel fuel 72,041 GJ natural gas 6,163 GJ liquefied gas 416 GJ TOTAL 10,395,454 GJ1 (302-1) The electrical power system of Kazakhstan is defined by large concentration of powerful energy sources in the North and long length transit lines (about 1000 km) due to vast territory of Kazakhstan (main transits include Kazakhstan North South transit and Pavlodar oblast Aktobe oblast transit) 1 The international system of units, MS, was applied to recalculate in Joule. 30 materially affecting the level of technical losses. Also technical losses in KEGOC grid depend on the operation modes of neighbouring states’ power systems (electricity transit, export and import). The technical losses in KEGOC's networks in 2017 amounted to 2.8 billion kWh or 6.2% of electricity supplied to the grid, not exceeding the standards established by the authorized body. (EU12) The structure of technical losses of KEGOC in 2017 was as follows: load losses in lines (65%); load losses in transformers (1%); corona losses (19%); no-load losses of transformers (4%); losses in reactors (8%); substation auxiliary supply (3%). KEGOC annually performs activities to reduce technological losses. Based on the results of 2017, such activities resulted in reduced electricity consumption amounting to 4.7 million kWh. (302-4) Outcomes Loss Reduction Measures in 2017 million kWh GJ Line tripping under low-load conditions 0.5 1,800 Shutdown of power transformers under low-load 4.2 15,120 conditions Total for KEGOC 4.7 16,920 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY HR Policy The human resources of KEGOC are the most important strategic factor for the Company’s success. KEGOC manages its human resources based on the principles of the Corporate Governance Code, Business Ethics Code, the integrated management system, HR Policy and internal documents relating to KEGOC’s HR motivation. The HR Policy based on the balancing between economic and social efficiencies of HR involvement and in accordance with the Long-Term Development Strategy of KEGOC aims to:  ensure the Company’s commitment to the principles of meritocracy, including search and recruitment of personnel, training and development, assessment of employee performance and remuneration management;  implement measures to enhance social and labour relations (feedback, reporting of the top management to the collective, monitoring of social health of the collective);  develop corporate culture. In 2017 the Company continued to implement KEGOC Business Transformation Program under which the project ‘Transition to the target organizational structure’ was implemented. In the course of the project implementation, regulations on divisions, new positions and positions with the changes in job descriptions were described, the step-by-step selection of employees for new positions and positions with the changes in job descriptions (job-matching) including the management team was carried out. Moreover, the role of HR in the Company is changing it has been transformed from ‘administrative’ to the role of ‘HR business partner’, and all HR processes are under review to create an interconnected system and to automate them. The corporate culture diagnostics defined the Company’s values, formed the Road Map and the communication plan for the transition to the target corporate culture. All the elements of HR policy are arranged in a way to enable quick and effective adaptation of new employees and accelerate their settling in a new job. On a regular basis an employee is introduced to the organization’s objectives, its activity characteristics, and the company’s basic rules 31 and expectations from employees. During the adaptation process, employees are instructed on safety as well. KEGOC supports and respects the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and the rights envisaged by the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In 2017, there were no cases of human rights abuses, or discrimination in respect of race, gender, language, religion, national origin, social and family status and sexual orientation at KEGOC. KEGOC’s operations do not use child labour, forced labour or require the employees to provide security or leave identity documents as collateral after starting their work for the Company.

For this purpose, 946 pensioners were provided with financial support amounting to KZT 50.3 million in 2017. Dynamic development of the company and considerable operational and financial success fostered the establishment of professional association of employees in 2003. The trade union of Kazakhstan energy industry employees Sectoral Trade Union of Energy Industry Employees Public Association (further the Trade Union) is an independent public association carrying out its activities independently, non-accountably and beyond the control of governmental authorities, employers and their associations, political organizations and other public associations operating within the entire territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The union is arranged based on the sector operating principle and open for the company’s employees as well as all enterprises of power industry, research and design institutes, pensioners and even contractors. One of the main goals of the Trade Union is to ensure labour rights of its members and to regulate labour relations. The Trade Union also influences the labour payment conditions, bonus payments to employees and discipline including disciplinary penalties. The Trade Union is intended to control the compliance with labour legislation, maintenance and implementation of guarantees and compensations, allowances, etc. KEGOC supports freedom of association and recognizes the right of employees to conclude collective bargaining agreements. In October 2017, Collective Bargaining Agreement for 2016-2020 between KEGOC and its employees was amended in terms of labour payment and study leaves. The Collective Bargaining Agreement provides for the agreement joining procedures, issues of regulating labour order, including social leaves, labour payment, ensuring personnel safety and occupational health, granting social guarantees and compensations; it specifies measures on support of employees and development of human resources, health insurance and entertainment and leisure events for the employees.

(403-4) The Collective Bargaining Agreement covers all employees of KEGOC, regardless of the type of employment. (10241) One of the key indicators of KEGOC’s HR policy is the Personnel Engagement Index, which is calculated following the results of employees questionnaire survey and on-line questionnaire for administrative and managing staff in accordance with the Methodology for Assessment of Personnel Engagement, approved by the Human Resource Committee of Samruk-Kazyna and the social stability rating determined among operational staff in accordance with the Methodology for Assessment of Social Stability approved by the Human Resource Committee of Samruk-Kazyna. In 2017, the staff engagement index was 68% (at least 68% planned), and the social stability rating was 88% (at least 65% planned). Operational Safety The social component of KEGOC’s activity is based on the principles of social responsibility, which among other things include ensuring of labour safety and preservation of the employees’ health. The Long-term Development Strategy of KEGOC defines the improvement of the professional security system as the most important task to achieve the strategic vision. The Board of Directors of KEGOC pays much attention to occupational health and safety, for which purpose established a special Committee of the Board of Directors intended to develop policies and procedures, improve the system and monitor the provision of industrial safety and occupational health. So, this Committee in 2017 reviewed the Concept for Development of the Occupational Safety System and the Action Plan to improve the OSH management system. Moreover, in order to effectively implement and strengthen control, the Committee recommended the inclusion of the Plan performance KPIs into the KPI motivational maps of the executive and administrative personnel of the Company. Safe labour conditions, low-level of operational injuries, improved operational and sanitaryhousehold and labour conditions of the employees, as well as low level impact of harmful and adverse factors are the constant development priorities of the Company. KEGOC performs Occupational Health and Safety Management System with the view to ensure effectiveness and improvement of indicators regarding occupational safety in accordance with KEGOC policy in IMS as well as management of the risks associated with specific nature of the Company’s activities. KEGOC annually elaborates the Programme for occupational safety which defines necessary events and expenses for their implementation with the view of managing the risks detected at each work place. In 2017, an assessment of harmful and hazardous production factors was carried out at all of the Company’s workplaces. The register of hazards and risks of KEGOC was prepared for 2017 specifying the significant hazards and risks of KEGOC for 2017: electric shock during operation and repair of electrical installations of 1,000 V and higher; electric shock during operation and with the use of lifting mechanisms; fall from height during climbing works and works at height. Based on the identified hazards and risks, KEGOC’s Occupational Safety and Health Management System Program for 2017 provides for risks management activities. Due to the fact that the risk of work-related accidents is one of the key risks, the actions for managing this risk are elaborated under the RMS of the Company and the Occupational Health and Safety Management System. The annual plan of certification of workplaces and measures to bring working conditions at each work place in accordance with the requirements of the rules and regulations on labour protection was completed in 2017. At the facilities of MES branches, KEGOC measured electromagnetic field, audible noise and vibration, identified harmful and hazardous factors of the production environment affecting the health of employees at working places, developed and implemented action plans to improve the safety conditions and set relevant benefits. To monitor the health of employees, KEGOC carried out medical examinations. The employees are provided with the necessary personal protective equipment, including electrical protection devices, special food and medicines. 40 In all MES branches the safety workshops were delivered during repair campaign including qualification tests of repair crew and check of availability of the individual protection devices, instruments, harness, and special cloths.
