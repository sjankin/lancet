We are committed to the ten principles of the Compact which foster better corporate responsibility in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. This Communication on Progress provides an insight into our recent activities in support of the Global Compact’s objectives. Statement of Continued Support As a member of the Tata group we follow the principles of corporate governance and a code of ethics (called the Tata Code of Conduct) very similar to the Global Compact. This Code of conduct is signed by all our employees and has been shared with our suppliers and customers. It is also translated into local Indian languages as relevant as well as in Mandarin Chinese and Portuguese in the relevant geographies. The triple bottom line – economic, environmental and social is today a prerequisite with stakeholders across the globe. Fortunately, Tata International, being a part of the Tata Group, whose values since the 1860s have mandated that no achievement in financial terms is worthwhile unless it improves the quality of life of the people and meets national aspirations, have always believed in it. In order to meet the national objective of earning foreign exchange, Tata International was incorporated as a trading house in 1962. Today, as an international trading and distribution company dealing in metals, minerals, distribution, agro and leather products it serves this same purpose in countries as wide apart as Cambodia and Brazil, by contributing to their foreign exchange earnings. Similarly, in response to a government request to develop the then backward areas of the country our leather manufacturing facility was set up in Dewas, in Madhya Pradesh, today it is the global hub for our leather business, and Tata International is India’s largest exporter of leather and leather products. The TIL leadership excels to build an environment conducive to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy of the company, as a result we continue to receive encouraging external feedback on our environment initiatives for leather manufacturing facility at Dewas which is recognized by the Ministry of Environment & Forest, Government of India with the ‘National Award for Prevention of Pollution’ and ‘Rajiv Gandhi Environmental Award for Clean Technology’, by the Council of Leather Exports.
