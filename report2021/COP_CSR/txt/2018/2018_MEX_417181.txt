While others react to market pressures by pulling back on their efforts, we maintain a strategic commitment to continuous exploration across all precious metals price cycles. The result? A steady pipeline of reserves and resources that fuels our ability to deliver growth and returns not just this year or next year, but in the decades ahead. GROWTH • Around US$1.5 billion invested in exploration since 2008. • Number of full-time geologists almost doubled, from 55 in 2009 to 100 in 2017. • Close to 900 kilometres drilled at our operations and projects by the exploration teams in 2017. RETURNS • Around 300 local community personnel employed as assistants to our geologists. • Increase in silver resources from 1.1 bnoz in 2008 to 2.3 bnoz in 2017. • Increase in gold resources from 12 moz in 2008 to 38.5 moz in 2017.

We strive to maintain an increasing level of production through three strategic initiatives. Firstly, we optimise capacity and recovery rates, for example, by investing in infrastructure to increase development rates and milling capacity. Secondly, we seek opportunities to expand operations at our existing mines, through activities such as further exploring areas of influence. Finally, we look for continuous improvements in productivity and cost controls – and technology is just one area where our investments and expertise are creating significant performance improvements. GROWTH • Increase in silver production from 38.6 moz in 2008 to 58.7 moz in 2017. • Increase in gold production from 263.6 koz in 2008 to 911.1 koz in 2017. RETURNS • Close to US$2.5 billion paid in dividends since 2008. • Silver reserves up from 410.0 moz in 2008 to 501.7 moz in 2017. • Gold reserves up from 4.1 moz in 2008 to 11.7 moz in 2017.

THIS FINANCIAL REVIEW IS INTENDED TO CONVEY THE MAIN FACTORS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE AND TO PROVIDE A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF THE GROUP’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALL COMPARISONS REFER TO 2017 FIGURES COMPARED TO 2016, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND YEAR-ON-YEAR VARIATIONS ARE PRESENTED IN US DOLLARS, EXCEPT WHERE INDICATED. THE FULL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THEIR ACCOMPANYING NOTES CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 186-243. By following strict controls on cash, costs and expenses and while adhering to our capex budgets, we have maintained a healthy cash and other liquid funds 1 position and a low leverage ratio. This has enabled us to invest in profitable growth and deliver solid returns to shareholders. The following report presents how we have managed our Financial Capital. COMMENTARY ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE This has been another year of progress for Fresnillo, as we continued our long-established reputation for creating value through growth and returns. Gross profit and EBITDA increased during the year by 4.9% and 2.7%, respectively. We also maintained a solid financial position, with US$896.0 million in cash and other liquid funds 1 as of 31 December 2017 despite paying dividends of US$236.6 million in accordance with our policy and investing capex of US$604.8 million to underpin our future growth. A number of factors contributed to the increase in gross profit and EBITDA, including the increased contribution of San Julián to silver and zinc sales, together with higher gold and base metals prices, which increased Adjusted revenue. These factors were partly offset by cost pressures, higher depreciation charges and exploration expenses and, these together with the sale of a non-strategic exploration project and the effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate on deferred taxes, resulted in an increase of 32.0% in net profit for the year. INCOME STATEMENT 2017 2016 Amount Change US$ million US$ million US$ million % Adjusted revenue 2 2,233.2 2,045.0 188.2 9.2 Total revenue 2,093.3 1,905.5 187.8 9.9 Cost of sales (1,167.9) (1,023.4) (144.5) 14.1 Gross profit 925.4 882.1 43.3 4.9 Exploration expenses 141.1 121.2 19.9 16.4 Operating profit 709.3 676.5 32.8 4.8 EBITDA 3 1,060.1 1,032.0 28.1 2.7 Income tax expense including mining rights 180.7 293.3 (112.6) (38.4) Profit for the year 560.8 425.0 135.8 32.0 Profit for the year, excluding post-tax Silverstream effects 481.2 331.5 149.7 45.2 Basic and diluted earnings per share (US$/share) 4 0.761 0.579 0.182 31.4 Basic and diluted earnings per share, excluding post-tax Silverstream effects (US$/share) 0.653 0.453 0.200 44.2 1 Cash and other liquid funds are disclosed in note 31(c) to the financial statements. 2 Adjusted revenue is revenue as disclosed in the income statement adjusted to exclude treatment and refining charges and gold, lead and zinc hedging. 3 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is calculated as gross profit plus depreciation less administrative, selling and exploration expenses. 4 The weighted average number of ordinary shares was 736,893,589 for 2017 and 2016. See note 18 in the consolidated financial statements. 105 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 The Group’s financial performance is largely determined by the quality of our assets, the skills of our personnel and the execution capabilities of management to achieve our strategic goals. However, there are a number of macroeconomic variables that lie beyond our control and which affect financial results. These include: PRECIOUS METAL PRICES In 2017, the average realised gold and silver prices remained broadly stable at US$1,267.4 per ounce (2016: US$1,246.5) and US$17.0 per ounce (2016: US$17.2), respectively. However, the average realised lead and zinc prices increased 24.9% and 34.9% year-on-year, to US$1.06 and US$1.36 per pound, respectively. We hedged a portion of our by-product lead and zinc production but, contrary to previous years, this did not have an effect on revenue. FRESNILLO MX$/US$ EXCHANGE RATE The Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2017 was $19.74 per US dollar, compared to $20.66 per TODAY US dollar at 31 December 2016. The 4.5% spot revaluation had a favourable effect, primarily on deferred income taxes. This positively compared versus the 20.1% devaluation in 2016, which resulted in a significant adverse effect on deferred income taxes. The average spot Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate devalued by 1.5%, from $18.66 per US dollar in 2016 to $18.94 per US dollar in 2017. This resulted in a favourable effect estimated at US$4.7 million on the Group’s production costs, as costs denominated in Mexican pesos (approximately 45% of total costs) were lower when converted to US dollars. STRATEGIC COST INFLATION In 2017, there was a net increase in the weighted average input cost over the year, of 6.4%. This inflation included the positive REPORT effect of the 1.5% average devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar. LABOUR Unionised employees received on average a 5.8% increase in wages in Mexican pesos, and administrative employees at the mines received a 4.5% increase; when converted to US dollars, the weighted average labour inflation was 3.3%. ENERGY CORPORATE ELECTRICITY GOVERNANCE The Group’s weighted average cost of electricity increased by 28.9% from US$5.9 cents per kW in 2016 to US$7.6 cent per kW in 2017. This increase was mainly explained by the higher average generating cost of the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the national utility, following the increase in the prices of natural gas and fuel and, to a lesser extent, of imported coal. DIESEL FINANCIAL The weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars increased 22.2% to US$76.5 cents per litre in 2017, compared to US$62.6 cents per litre in 2016, reflecting the price liberalisation of fuels. STATEMENTS OPERATING MATERIALS Year over year change in unit price % Other reagents 31.1 Steel balls for milling 3.0 Lubricants 1.0 Tyres (5.2) Explosives (6.4) Sodium cyanide (17.3) Weighted average of all operating materials (1.1) Unit prices of the majority of certain operating materials decreased in US dollar terms. However, this was mostly offset by the increase in the unit price of other reagents, particularly those linked to the price of copper and zinc, reflecting the higher metals prices. As a result, the weighted average unit prices of all operating materials decreased by 1.1% over the year. There has been no significant impact on the unit cost of operating materials from the devaluation of the MXN peso/US dollar exchange rate as the majority of these items are dollar-denominated. CONTRACTORS Agreements are signed individually with each contractor company, and include specific terms and conditions that cover not only labour, but also operating materials, equipment and maintenance, amongst others. Contractor costs are mainly denominated in Mexican pesos and are an important component of our total production costs. In 2017, increases granted to contractors, whose agreements were due for review during the period, resulting in a weighted average increase of 4.9% in US dollars. MAINTENANCE Unit prices of spare parts for maintenance remained unchanged on average in US dollar terms (0.4% increase). 106 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED OTHERS Other cost components include freight, which increased by an estimated 12.5% in US dollars, offset by a 10.0% decrease in insurance costs. The remaining components had an average inflation of 0.8% in US dollars over 2016. The effects of the above external factors, combined with the Group’s internal variables, are further described below through the main line items of the income statement. REVENUE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE (US$ MILLIONS) 2017 2016 Amount Change US$ million US$ million US$ million % Adjusted revenue 1 2,233.2 2,045.0 188.2 9.2 Gold, lead and zinc hedging 0.0 1.6 (1.6) (100) Treatment and refining charges (139.9) (141.1) 1.2 (0.9) Total revenue 2,093.3 1,905.5 187.8 9.9 Total revenue of US$2,093.3 million increased by 9.9% over 2016. This was explained by the 9.2% increase in Adjusted revenue as a result of the increase in volumes of silver and zinc sold and higher realised metal prices, except for silver.

The remaining 39.0%, or US$73.4 million, was explained by the benefit of higher gold, lead and zinc prices. As expected, the contribution of San Julián changed the relative proportion of Adjusted revenue, with silver revenue representing 38% of total Adjusted revenue in 2017 compared to 35% in 2016. Gold contribution to Adjusted revenue decreased from 55% in 2016 to 50% in 2017 as a result of the expected decrease in volumes of gold sold. The contribution of by-product lead and zinc to the Group’s Adjusted revenue increased from 9% in 2016 to 12% in 2017, due to higher lead and zinc prices and the increased volumes of zinc sold, primarily from the San Julián and Fresnillo mines. Herradura remained the main contributor to Adjusted revenue, reflecting a further decrease in gold inventories during the year. Saucito continued to be the second largest contributor, although its contribution declined from 26% in 2016 to 23% in 2017, in line with a 4.5% decrease in Adjusted revenue. Fresnillo’s contribution remained stable at 19%, notwithstanding the 10.0% increase in total Group Adjusted revenue. San Julián (phase I and phase II) contributed 13% to the Group’s Adjusted revenue. The relative contribution to silver Adjusted revenue changed over the year with San Julián (phase I and II) representing 18.6%, while the contributions of Saucito, Fresnillo and Ciénega decreased as expected, reflecting an expanded silver asset base. Similarly, contribution to gold revenue was modified with the San Julián mine representing 9.3% of total Adjusted gold revenue.

These contracts will start to mature in 2018. As no hedging structures expired in 2017, there was no effect on revenue. The chart below illustrates the outstanding hedging structures as of 31 December 2017. 2018 Concept Zinc 1 Lead 1 Weighted floor (US$/tonne) 2,591 2,370 Weighted cap (US$/tonne) 3,716 2,735 Total outstanding volume (tonne) 21,168 5,760 1 Monthly settlements through December 2018. In the second half of 2014, Fresnillo plc initiated a one-off hedging programme to protect the value of the investment made in the Penmont acquisition. The hedging programme was executed for a total volume of 1,559,689 oz of gold with monthly maturities until December 2019.

Fresnillo plc’s hedging policy remained unchanged for the remainder of the portfolio, providing shareholders with full exposure to gold and silver prices. TREATMENT AND REFINING CHARGES Treatment and refining charges 3 are reviewed annually using international benchmarks. Treatment charges per tonne of lead and zinc concentrate decreased in dollar terms by 18.8% and 17.8%, respectively, compared to 2016. However, this was partly offset by the 2.0% increase in silver refining charges and the increase in volumes of zinc concentrates with high silver contents shipped from Fresnillo and San Julián (phase II) to Met-Mex, as well as the increased volumes of precipitates sold from San Julián (phase I). As a result, treatment and refining charges set out in the income statement decreased by only 0.8% over 2016.

The US$144.5 million increase is explained by the following combination of factors: • An increase in Adjusted production costs (US$150.3 million). This was primarily due to: i) additional Adjusted production costs associated with the increased production (US$94.7 million); ii) cost inflation (US$40.2 million); iii) increases in the use of consumables, services, maintenance and others (US$17.9 million); and iv) the lower volume of ore processed from development works at Saucito (US$12.7 million). The increase was partly offset by the decrease in development works charged to production costs (US$10.5 million) and the positive effect of the 1.5% devaluation of the average Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate (US$4.7 million). • Depreciation (US$21.1 million). This is due to the additional asset base at San Julián, mitigated by lower depreciation at the other operating mines. • Reversal of inventories write-down in 2016 and others (US$17.5 million). • Profit sharing increased slightly by US$1.8 million. FRESNILLO These negative effects were partly offset by: • Variation in change in work in progress (-US$43.3 million). This reflected the further decrease in inventories on the leaching TODAY pads at Herradura, albeit not of the same magnitude as the decrease in 2016. • Mexican peso/US dollar hedging (-US$2.8 million). With the Mexican peso exchange rate hedging programme suspended, there was no effect in the income statement in 2017, compared to the US$2.8 million loss recorded in 2016. COST PER TONNE, CASH COST PER OUNCE AND ALL-IN SUSTAINING COST (AISC) Cost per tonne is a key indicator to measure the effects of mining inflation and cost control performance at each mine. This STRATEGIC indicator is calculated as total production costs, plus ordinary mining rights, less depreciation, profit sharing and exchange rate hedging effects, divided by total tonnage processed. We have included cost per tonne hauled/moved as we believe it is a useful REPORT indicator to thoroughly analyse cost performance for the open pit mines.

Explanations regarding changes in cost per tonne by mine are covered in the Review of Operations section, on pages 54-65. Cash cost per ounce, calculated as total cash cost (cost of sales plus treatment and refining charges, less depreciation) less revenue from by-products divided by the silver or gold ounces sold, when compared to the corresponding metal price, is an indicator of the ability of the mine to cover its production costs.

This was partly offset by higher cost per tonne (+US$0.54/oz) (see page 55). SAUCITO: US$1.50/OZ (2017) VERSUS – US$0.39/OZ (2016), (N/A) The increase was driven by: the higher cost per tonne (+US$1.69/oz) (see page 56); the expected lower silver grade (+US$0.53/ oz); and lower by-product credits per ounce of silver resulting from the decrease in volume of gold sold (+US$0.08/oz). These adverse effects were partly offset by lower treatment and refining charges (-US$0.39/oz) and lower profit sharing (-US$0.03/oz). CIÉNEGA: -US$163.74/OZ (2017) VERSUS – US$217.19/OZ (2016), (N/A) The increase in cash cost was primarily due to: the higher cost per tonne (+US$225.41/oz) (see page 58); and the expected decrease in gold grade (+US$23.81/oz). These unfavourable factors were partly offset by higher by-product credits per ounce of gold, due to the increased volumes of silver and lead sold, and higher lead and zinc prices (-US$179.45/oz); lower treatment and refining charges (-US$13.40/oz); and lower profit sharing (-US$2.92/oz). HERRADURA: US$492.86/OZ (2017) VERSUS US$470.72/OZ (2016), (+4.7%) The increase in cash cost resulted from: the higher cost per tonne (+US$29.81/oz) (see page 60); the lower gold grade (+US$25.95/oz); higher profit sharing (+US$0.66/oz); and lower by-product credits per gold ounce, due to the decreased volume of silver sold at a lower price (+US$0.61/oz). These adverse effects were offset by: a favourable inventory valuation effect, as ounces with a higher cost of production in the current period are mixed with the initial lower cost of inventory affecting cost of sales (-US$34.76/oz); and lower treatment and refining charges (-US$0.13/oz). NOCHE BUENA: US$793.48/OZ (2017) VERSUS US$765.90/OZ (2016), (+3.6%) The increase in cash cost per ounce was mainly due to: the favourable effect of the reversal of the write-down of gold inventories on the leaching pads in 2016, which did not occur in 2017 (+US$37.59/oz); and lower by-product credits (+US$2.22/oz). This was partly offset by the higher ore grade (-US$6.07/oz) (see page 62) and others (-US$6.17/oz). SAN JULIÁN PHASE I: As operations commenced in August 2016, AISC for 2016 is not considered representative as it corresponds to the start-up period, when a significant volume of ore from the stock pile was processed. SAN JULIÁN PHASE II: As operations commenced in July 2017, there are no comparable year-on-year figures. In addition to the traditional cash cost described above, the Group is reporting all-in sustaining costs (AISC), in accordance with the guidelines issued by the World Gold Council. This cost metric is calculated as traditional cash cost plus on-site general, corporate and administrative costs, community costs related to current operations, capitalised stripping and underground mine development, sustaining capital expenditures and remediation expenses. We consider all-in sustaining costs to be a reasonable indicator of a mine’s ability to generate free cash flow when compared with the corresponding metal price. We also believe it is a means to monitor not only current production costs, but also sustaining costs as it includes mine development costs incurred to prepare the mine for future production, as well as sustaining capex.

Saucito: Higher, as a result of the higher cash cost, an increase in sustaining capex and higher capitalised mine development. Ciénega: Higher, primarily explained by the higher cash cost, an increase in sustaining capex and higher capitalised mine development. Herradura: Higher, mainly due to an increase in capitalised stripping costs; and to a lesser extent, the higher cash cost detailed above, partially offset by lower sustaining capex. Noche Buena: Higher, driven by the higher cash cost detailed above. FRESNILLO San Julián: San Julián (phase I): As operations commenced in August 2016, AISC for 2016 is not considered representative as it corresponds TODAY to the start-up period, when a significant volume of ore from the stock pile was processed. San Julián (phase II): As operations commenced in July 2017, there are no comparable year-on-year figures. GROSS PROFIT Gross profit, excluding hedging gains and losses, is a key financial indicator of profitability at each business unit and the STRATEGIC Fresnillo Group as a whole.

The US$43.3 million increase in gross profit was mainly explained by: i) the higher profits associated with increased production of US$142.9 million; ii) the US$72.3 million estimated benefit of the increase in metal prices; and iii) the US$4.7 million favourable effect of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate devaluation. These factors were partly offset by: i) the lower ore grades mainly at Saucito and Herradura, which had an estimated adverse impact of US$88.1 million; ii) cost inflation estimated at US$40.2 million and others of US$48.3 million. Herradura and Saucito remained the largest contributors to the Group’s consolidated gross profit, albeit with a decrease in their gross profit when compared to 2016. Gross profit at the Fresnillo mine increased by 20.8% over 2016, while the mine’s contribution to the Group’s total gross profit increased to 20.9%. San Julián was the fourth largest contributor, providing 10.1% of total gross profit, while Noche Buena and Ciénega’s share of the Group’s total gross profit remained broadly unchanged. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Administrative expenses increased 22.9% from US$59.1 million to US$72.7 million, due mainly to additional administrative personnel hired to service a larger number of mines and projects and an increase in services provided by third parties (advisors, consultants and service providers). Furthermore, increased administrative services provided by Servicios Industriales Peñoles, S.A.B de C.V. in relation to San Julián (phase I and phase II) also contributed to the increase in administrative expenses during the year. 112 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED EXPLORATION EXPENSES Exploration expenses Exploration expenses Capitalised expenses Capitalised expenses Business unit/project (US$ millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Ciénega 10.8 14.0 – – Fresnillo 15.8 8.0 – – Herradura 19.1 13.6 – – Saucito 11.7 9.6 – – Noche Buena 6.1 1.3 – – San Ramón 4.4 4.3 – – San Julián 8.4 4.4 – – Orisyvo 1.9 2.2 0.0 0.2 Centauro Deep 2.7 3.2 0.1 1.0 Guanajuato 7.9 3.9 0.8 0.6 Juanicipio 0.0 0.0 2.3 14.6 Others 52.3 56.7 1.0 0.3 TOTAL 141.1 121.2 4.2 16.7 Exploration expenses increased by 16.4% to US$141.1 million in 2017, due to intensified exploration activities, mainly around our mining districts and advanced exploration projects (see pages 67-71). An additional US$4.2 million was capitalised, mainly relating to exploration expenses at the Juanicipio project, and to a lesser extent at Guanajuato. As a result, risk capital invested in exploration totalled US$145.3 million in 2017, a 5.4% increase over 2016. In 2018, total invested in exploration is expected to be approximately US$200 million, of which US$8 million is estimated to be capitalised.

It is calculated as gross profit plus depreciation, less administrative, selling and exploration expenses. In 2017, EBITDA increased 2.7% to US$1,060.1 million mainly due to the higher revenue. This was partly offset by the higher adjusted production costs, exploration and administrative expenses. However, EBITDA margin expressed as a percentage of revenue decreased, from 54.2% in 2016 to 50.6% in 2017. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES In 2017, other income and expenses of US$16.8 million was recognised in the income statement, mainly resulting from the sale of non-strategic mining claims to Argonaut Gold Inc around its Castillo mine. This compares favourably against the US$9.0 million expense recorded in 2016, which included disposals of fixed assets, remediation works and costs incurred in the maintenance of closed mines. SILVERSTREAM EFFECTS The Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value. The revaluation of the Silverstream contract generated a US$70.3 million non-cash gain mainly as a result of converting resources into reserves at Sabinas and the higher forward price of silver. In addition, a US$43.3 million non-cash gain was generated by: the unwinding of the discounted values; and the difference between payments (volume and price) actually received and accrued in 2017 and payments estimated in the valuation model as at 31 December 2016. The total effect recorded in the 2017 income statement was a gain of US$113.7 million, which adversely compares to the US$133.5 million gain registered in 2016. 113 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Since the IPO, cumulative cash received has been US$593.0 million, while total non-cash revaluation gains of US$797.4 million have been taken to the income statement. The Group expects that further unrealised gains or losses will be taken to the income statement in accordance with silver price cyclicality or changes in the variables considered in valuing this contract. Further information related to the Silverstream contract is provided in the balance sheet section on page 115 and in notes 14 and 30 to the consolidated financial statements. FINANCE COSTS AND INCOME Finance costs and income in 2017 rose by 3.6%, from US$32.2 million to US$34.0 million, mainly due to the decrease in borrowing costs capitalised in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, a US$41.1 million non-cash finance loss was generated by the mark-to-market time value of the outstanding gold hedging programme which was put in place to protect the investment made in the acquisition of the 44% stake of Newmont in FRESNILLO Penmont in 2014. FOREIGN EXCHANGE A foreign exchange loss of US$6.4 million was recorded as a result of the realised transactions in the year and the positive TODAY effect of the 4.5% spot revaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar on the value of peso-denominated net monetary assets. This compared favourably against the US$18.4 million foreign exchange loss recognised in 2016. We also enter into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage our exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in euro (EUR), Swedish krona (SEK) and Canadian dollar (CAD). At the end of the year, the total EUR, SEK and CAD outstanding net forward position was EUR 8.79 million, CAD 0.76 STRATEGIC million and SEK 32.06 million with maturity dates from March through September 2018. The volume that expired in 2017 was EUR 9.23 million with a weighted average strike of 1.1368 US$/EUR, and SEK 15.31 million with a weighted average strike of 8.43 REPORT SEK/US$, which has generated a gain of US$6,532 and US$55,119 respectively, both being recorded in the income statement. TAXATION Corporate income tax expense decreased from US$260.0 million in 2016 to US$153.5 million in 2017, despite the 3.2% increase in profit before income tax. This decrease resulted mainly from the effect of the 4.5% revaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar CORPORATE spot exchange rate in 2017 versus the 20.1% devaluation in 2016 on the tax value of assets and liabilities; together with the impact of the higher inflation rate (6.7% in 2017 versus 3.4% in 2016) on the inflationary uplift of the tax base of assets and liabilities. The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining rights, was 20.7%, which was below the 30% statutory tax rate. This was GOVERNANCE mainly due to the tax credit related to the special tax on diesel, the inflationary uplift of the assets, liabilities and tax losses, and the revaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar, which impacted the carrying amount of assets and liabilities (denominated in US dollars) and their tax bases (denominated in Mexican pesos) (see note 10 to the financial statements). Including the effect of the special mining rights, the effective tax rate was 24.4% in 2017. PROFIT FOR THE YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Profit for the year increased from US$425 million to US$560.8 million, while profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group increased to US$560.6 million, up from US$427.0 million in 2016. Excluding the effects of the Silverstream Contract, profit for the year increased from US$331.5 million to US$481.2 million. Similarly, profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group, excluding the Silverstream effects, increased to US$481.0 million, up from US$333.5 million.

Working capital increased US$2.9 million mainly due to an increase in trade and other receivables resulting from the higher volumes sold and the higher gold, lead and zinc prices (US$44.4 million); and an increase in prepayments and other assets (US$0.7 million). This increase in working capital was partly offset by a decrease in inventories (US$5.7 million) and an increase in trade and other payables (US$36.4 million). Taxes and employee profit sharing paid increased 169.4% over 2016 to US$309.3 million. As a result of the above factors, net cash from operating activities decreased 15.2% from US$898.0 million in 2016 to US$761.5 million in 2017. Other sources of cash were the proceeds of the Silverstream Contract of US$43.3 million, proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets of US$26.1 million and capital contributions from minority shareholders in subsidiaries of US$18.9 million. The above funds were mainly used to purchase property, plant and equipment for a total of US$604.8 million, a 39.3% increase over 2016. Capital expenditures for 2017 are further described below: PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 2017 US$ million Mine development and purchase of in-mine equipment and installation of a new zinc thickener and vertical Fresnillo mine 111.7 conveyor band Development, replacement of in-mine equipment, construction of the Pyrites plant and deepening of the Saucito mine 133.7 Jarillas shaft Stripping activities, sustaining capex and construction Herradura mine 153.2 of second line of DLP San Julián 79.1 Completion of San Julián phase II Development, replacement of in-mine equipment, Ciénega mine 46.5 construction of tailings dam and purchase of land Noche Buena 18.7 Mining works and sustaining capex Juanicipio project 34.1 Exploration expenditure and construction of ramps Other 27.7 Total purchase of property, plant and equipment 604.8 Dividends paid to shareholders of the Group in 2017 totalled US$236.6 million, a 168.2% increase from 2016, in line with our dividend policy that includes a consideration of profits generated in the period. The 2017 payment included the final 2016 dividend of US$158.4 million and the 2017 interim dividend paid in September of US$78.2 million. Net interest of US$21.0 million was paid, mainly reflecting the interest paid in relation with the issuance of the US$800 million principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes. The sources and uses of funds described above resulted in a decrease in net cash of US$16.0 million (net decrease in cash and cash equivalents), which combined with the US$912.0 million balance at the beginning of the year resulted in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of US$896.0 million at the end of 2017. 115 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 BALANCE SHEET Fresnillo plc continued to maintain a solid financial position with cash and other liquid funds 1 of US$896.0 million as of 31 December 2017. This represented a 1.7% decrease versus December 2016, as explained on the previous page. Inventories decreased 2.1% to US$271.1 million mainly as a result of the further decrease in inventories of gold deposited on the leaching pads at Herradura. Trade and other receivables increased 40.3% to US$402.1 million as a result of the increase in income tax recoverable, higher metal volumes sold which increased receivables and an increase in value added tax receivable. The change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$467.5 million at the beginning of the year to US$538.9 million as of 31 December 2017 reflects proceeds of US$42.3 million corresponding to 2017 (US$37.4 million in cash and US$4.9 million in receivables) and the Silverstream revaluation effect in the income statement of US$113.7 million. FRESNILLO The net book value of property, plant and equipment was US$2,448.6 million at year end, representing a 12.3% increase over TODAY 2016. The US$268.4 million increase was mainly due to: the larger asset base following the commissioning of San Julián; capitalised development works; construction of the Pyrites plant and the second DLP line; purchase of additional in-mine equipment; and the construction of leaching pads at Herradura and Noche Buena. The Group’s total equity was US$3,066.6 million as of 31 December 2017, a 12.9% increase over 2016. This was mainly explained by the increase in retained earnings, reflecting the 2016 profit, lower dividends paid during the year and the net unrealised gains STRATEGIC on cash flow hedges. REPORT DIVIDENDS Based on the Group’s 2017 performance, the Directors have recommended a final dividend of US$29.8 cents per Ordinary Share, which will be paid on 4 June 2018 to shareholders on the register on 27 April 2018. The dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling unless shareholders elect to be paid in US dollars. This is in addition to the interim dividend of US$10.6 cents per share totalling US$78.1 million.

My Board colleagues and I have sought to understand the implications of those developments for Fresnillo plc and respond to them accordingly. In Mexico, there was a significant development in anti-bribery and corruption legislation during the year. It was pleasing, from the Board’s perspective, to see that the work we have undertaken over the past few years to ensure compliance with the UK Bribery Act enabled us to accommodate the requirements of the new Mexican legislation very easily. Nevertheless, this provided us, as a Board, with the opportunity to review and update our Group Code of Ethics and Anti-Bribery and Corruption policy. We have also continued to monitor the work being undertaken by the management team to understand and develop our corporate culture which will help us as we FRESNILLO engage with our employees and the communities in which we operate. TODAY In 2017, we were required to re-submit our executive remuneration policy to shareholders for approval at the AGM. I am delighted that, again, over 99% of our independent shareholders supported the remuneration policy. We note that our policy is unusual in some respects compared to many companies in the FTSE 100 index because our approach to executive remuneration seeks to align with Mexican market practice. The Remuneration Committee continues to review investor expectations and will continue to provide good explanations for those aspects where we differ from the norm in our Remuneration Report (see pages 152-161). Ahead of the 2017 Annual General Meeting, we engaged in a number of conversations with institutional investors STRATEGIC and their representative bodies about our Board composition and membership, recognising the need to evolve REPORT the independent representation on the Board and ensure that our Directors have sufficient time to be able to commit to the work of the Board. During the second half of 2017, we continued to consider the evolution of the Board and as a result, we recently announced some further changes to the Board which will take effect from the 2018 AGM. I am delighted that Dame Judith Macgregor joined the Board as an independent Non-executive Director following the AGM. Dame Judith brings a range of perspectives to the Board, and we will CORPORATE benefit from her diplomatic experience particularly gained during her four years as the British Ambassador to Mexico. It is also proposed that Georgina Kessel will join our Board after the GOVERNANCE 2018 AGM. These two appointments mean that 50% of the new appointments to the Fresnillo plc Board in the past six years will have been female, demonstrating our commitment to broaden the diversity of our Board. The Nominations Committee continues to be mindful that Fresnillo plc does not yet meet the current expectations for gender diversity on FTSE 100 boards and will continue its efforts to address this in its future Board appointments. FINANCIAL Guy Wilson, the Chairman of our Audit Committee, has now served on the Board for nine years. In keeping with the UK Corporate Governance Code requirements on director independence, it will no longer be possible for Guy to remain on the Board as an independent Non-executive STATEMENTS Director and Audit Committee Chairman. It is therefore with great regret that Guy will step down from the Board after the 2018 AGM. We will continue to speak to our institutional investors and other counterparties concerning our approach to corporate governance in order to ensure that we communicate our perspective on governance within our Mexican context, while at the same time responding to any questions or concerns that shareholders may have about our governance standards. As we approach the tenth anniversary of our listing on the London Stock Exchange, we remain committed to the standards of good governance set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code which we will endeavour to apply in the way that we believe best serves the interests of all of our stakeholders.

Being a part of a group which has common requirements across a number of service areas, provides opportunities for resources to be shared efficiently from a cost point of view. The Audit Committee has therefore developed governance processes to ensure that these arrangements provide the intended benefits to the Company in a transparent and controlled manner. The key elements of the Board’s approach to ensuring that the Company’s commercial relationship with its parent company and other related parties are independent and maintained on an arms length basis are described later in this section. 123 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 THE GOVERNANCE OF FRESNILLO’S RELATED PARTY ARRANGEMENTS RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT Peñoles has entered into a relationship agreement with the Company (the ‘Relationship Agreement’) to ensure that relationships between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group are conducted at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms. The non-independent Directors listed previously have been appointed to the Board by Peñoles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement. The Relationship Agreement complies with the independence provisions set out in Listing Rule 6.1.4DR for controlled companies. The Company has complied with the independence provisions included in the Relationship Agreement during the financial year ended 31 December 2017. As far as the Company is aware, such provisions have been complied with during the financial year ended 31 December 2017 by Peñoles and/or any of its associates. FRESNILLO Peñoles has also undertaken not to exercise its voting rights to amend the Articles of Association in a way which would be TODAY inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement. It has also agreed to abstain from voting on any resolution to approve a ‘related party transaction’ (as defined in paragraph 11.1.5 R of the Listing Rules) involving any member of the Peñoles Group. The following diagram summarises the approach taken to identify and manage related party transactions. IDENTIFYING DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS STRATEGIC REPORT PROCESS HOW THIS IS MANAGED RESPONSIBILITY Monitoring of If a Director is interested in a company which could potentially enter into Directors Directors’ interests transactions with a Fresnillo plc Group company, the Board will normally consider that interest under its arrangements for authorising conflicts of interest under s175 of Companies Act. CORPORATE MANAGING A RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION GOVERNANCE PROPOSED Ongoing monitoring of Directors’ interests and related parties of the Company TRANSACTION provides the information to determine if a related party approval is required for a proposed transaction, where possible. FINANCIAL PROCESS HOW THIS IS MANAGED RESPONSIBILITY Contract The Executive Committee will seek to ensure that the best possible terms Fresnillo negotiation are achieved for a proposed transaction and that they are verified by industry management STATEMENTS and verification benchmarking reports or independent valuation/assessment, where possible. and Executive Committee PROCESS HOW THIS IS MANAGED RESPONSIBILITY Financial scrutiny The Audit Committee reviews the key terms of major transactions which Audit are verified as to price and quality with external consultants or independent Committee benchmarking, where possible. PROCESS HOW THIS IS MANAGED RESPONSIBILITY Independent Under the Relationship Agreement and the Listing Rules, the Independent Independent Director approval Directors must approve any transaction with the Peñoles Group and its associates Directors without the non-independent Directors voting. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The Group requires that Directors complete a ‘Director’s List’. The list sets out details of situations where each Director’s interest may conflict with those of the Company (situational conflicts). Each Director has re-submitted their list as at 31 December 2017 for the Board to consider and authorise any new situational conflicts identified in the re-submitted lists. At the beginning of each Board meeting, the Company Secretary reminds the Directors of their duties under sections 175, 177 and 182 of the Companies Act which relate to the disclosure of any conflicts of interest prior to any matter that may be discussed by the Board. Further information about related party matters considered by the Board during the year are set out in the Audit Committee Report on page 144. 124 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS BOARD COMPOSITION As at the date of this Report, the Board consists of a Non-executive Chairman, seven Non-executive Directors that it considers to be independent and four Non-executive Directors not considered to be independent. There are no Directors who have executive responsibilities within the Company. BOARD ROLES The requirements of the roles of Chairman and of the Chief Executive Officer have been agreed by the Board and are set out in a written Statement of Responsibilities. Octavio Alvídrez, the Chief Executive Officer, is not currently a member of the Board. Charles Jacobs, the Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have concerns that have not been resolved through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Head of Investor Relations. The composition of the Board has been structured to ensure that no one individual can dominate the decision-making processes of the Board. CHAIRMAN’S INDEPENDENCE The Chairman, Mr Baillères, is beneficially interested in more than 50% of the share capital of the Company through his interest in Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C.V., the Company’s controlling shareholder. Mr Baillères is also the Chairman of Peñoles and other companies within the BAL Group. Mr Baillères was appointed to the Board by Peñoles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement, thus at the time of his appointment was not independent. Having been responsible for overseeing the successful development of the Group over many years, the Board considers that his continued involvement as its Non-executive Chairman is very important to the continued success of the Company. The Relationship Agreement continues to provide a transparent governance system, which ensures that the Company benefits from Mr Baillères’ leadership and experience while being able to demonstrate to other shareholders that the Fresnillo Group is capable of carrying on its business independently. In particular, the Relationship Agreement ensures that transactions and relationships between the Fresnillo Group and its controlling shareholder are at arm’s length and on competitive commercial terms. Further information regarding the Relationship Agreement can be found on pages 123 and 144. INDEPENDENCE The Board considers the Directors listed as being independent on pages 119 and 120, to be independent in character and judgement. For each of these Directors, their circumstances are assessed by reference to Provision B.1.1. of the Code and the Board remains satisfied that they are each independent when the standards set out in Code Provision B.1.1 are taken into account. In making this assessment, the Board has taken the following considerations into account: Charles Jacobs Charles Jacobs is the worldwide senior partner and chairman of Linklaters LLP. Mr Jacobs is not involved in the provision of legal or any other services to the Company by Linklaters LLP. Linklaters LLP is currently one of the Company’s legal advisers where any such advice is limited to English law and is provided by a different partner of Linklaters LLP. Selection of legal advisers is not a Board matter and is decided at the management level. None of the Fresnillo management sit on the Board. However, if any decision were to be made at the Board level regarding Linklaters LLP, which has not happened to date, Mr Jacobs would excuse himself in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 relating to Directors’ interests. Mr Jacobs does not have, and has not had within the last three years, a material business relationship with the Company either directly, or as a partner, shareholder, director or senior employee of a body that has such a relationship with the Company. By way of illustration, the legal fees paid to Linklaters LLP for the last three financial years were £177k for the year ended 31 December 2015, £148k for the year ended 31 December 2016 and £117k for the year ended 31 December 2017. Thus, in each year, the fees paid to Linklaters represented less than 0.01% of Linklaters global earnings and less than 0.01% of the Company’s global revenues. The Audit Committee reviews the appropriateness of all professional advisers’ fees each year including legal fees as part of their review of ordinary course of business expenses. Bárbara Garza Lagüera No issues to consider. Dame Judith Macgregor No issues to consider. 125 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Fernando Ruiz Fernando Ruiz has, since 2008, been a retired partner and consultant in the firm Chevez, Ruiz, Zamarripa y Cia., S.C., a firm providing professional services to the Company. Mr Ruiz was not involved in the provision of such services to the Company by Chevez, Ruiz, Zamarripa y Cia., S.C. prior to his retirement. Mr Ruiz is an independent non-executive director of Grupo Nacional Provincial, S.A.B. and Grupo Palacio de Hierro S.A.B. de C.V., which are companies within the BAL Group. Given that he is not involved in executive duties in any of those companies and has a similar obligation to be independent for those two companies as for Fresnillo, the Board does not consider that Mr Ruiz’ position as an independent Non-executive Director of the Company is adversely impacted by those two appointments. Fernando Ruiz’ breadth of knowledge and experience across a wide range of Mexican businesses, together with the invaluable audit and tax experience he brings to the role, FRESNILLO are highly regarded by the Board. Notwithstanding his length of service on the Board, the Board is satisfied that he continues to demonstrate the qualities of independence TODAY and objectivity in carrying out his role as a Non-executive Director. Jaime Serra No issues to consider. Alberto Tiburcio Alberto Tiburcio retired as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mancera S.C., the Mexican firm of EY, the Company’s auditors, in June 2013. Mr Tiburcio was not STRATEGIC involved in the provision of audit or any other services to the Company by Ernst & Young LLP prior to his retirement. REPORT Mr Tiburcio is an independent non-executive director of Grupo Nacional Provincial, S.A.B. and Profuturo Afore, S.A. de C.V., which are companies within the BAL Group. Given that he is not involved in executive duties in any of those companies and has a similar obligation to be independent for those two companies as for Fresnillo, the Board does not consider that Mr Tiburcio’s position as an independent Non-executive CORPORATE Director of the Company is adversely impacted by those two appointments. GOVERNANCE Guy Wilson Guy Wilson retired as a partner of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s auditor, in 2008. Mr Wilson was not involved in the provision of audit or any other services to the Company by Ernst & Young LLP prior to his retirement. COMMITMENT FINANCIAL The Nominations Committee annually reviews the time commitments of the Non-executive Directors to the Fresnillo plc Board. Its philosophy in doing so, is that the total workload of the Non-executive Director should be taken into consideration. For those Directors who do not have a fulltime job elsewhere the availability of time is different to those that do. The Board benefits from the experience of those Directors as well as from their other interests. This is considered to be a strength. Furthermore, public STATEMENTS companies vary considerably in the expectations that they place on their non-executive directors. A global company with various lines of business operating in many countries, should not count the same as a single-product company with operations primarily in just one country. Fresnillo plc falls into the latter category and because of the relative simplicity of its activities, the Board does not consider that it needs more than four scheduled Board meetings a year, a factor which is reflected in the relatively low fees that the Company pays its Non-executive Directors. This relatively low number of meetings is further justified by the degree of governance oversight of the Company which comes by virtue of it being also a member of the BAL Group of which five of its Non-executive Directors are also members. The Non-executive Directors are required, by their letters of appointment, to spend 14 days per annum on Company business. The BAL Group Directors usually meet with management prior to each Board meeting to extensively review the agenda and papers for the forthcoming meeting with them. They also oversee management responses to actions arising from the Board meetings. This time commitment, as well as the time required in travelling to the UK for the annual general meeting each year, significantly exceeds the time commitment specified in their letters of appointment. The independent Directors have committee responsibilities which, in conjunction with their Board duties, take up more time than their letters or appointment require. In addition, the UK-based Directors also travel to and from Mexico for Board and Committee meetings which also significantly increases the time that they spend on their Board duties. OVERBOARDING During the year, the Company engaged specifically with shareholders and voting agencies on the subject of perceived overboarding on the part of some of the Board members. Board members have discussed this issue both formally and informally during the year and their perspective on this matter is underpinned by two generic factors which may not always be apparent to shareholders: (1) A number of directors hold non-executive roles within companies listed in Mexico. Mexican listed companies generally operate with large boards with the option for alternate directors to be appointed and generally lower expectations on the time and commitment required from their non-executive directors. The Board estimates that the time commitment for board and committee meetings at a Mexican company is between a third and a quarter of the time required at a UK plc. 126 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS CONTINUED (2) The calendar for Board and Committee meetings is scheduled to align with all of the other meetings of companies, including listed companies within the BAL Group ownership structure. This ensures that Fresnillo plc Directors who are appointed to the boards of other companies within the BAL Group do not have any time conflicts with their other commitments on BAL Listed Entity boards. The near full attendance record of the non-independent Non-executive Directors over the ten years since the Company’s IPO bears this out. The other listed company directorships of the Fresnillo plc directors is set out on pages 118 to 120 of this report.

BOARD PROCESS The Board supervises the management of the Group’s activities, including the implementation of both the Group’s long-term plans and commercial strategy. In addition, the Board provides leadership to the Fresnillo Group setting the key values by which the Group will continue to operate. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval which includes approvals of major expenditure, investments and key policies. The schedule is annually reviewed to keep it up to date with any regulatory developments. The last review and revision was undertaken in October 2017. All meetings of the Board are held in Mexico. The Board has a well-established programme of meetings. Board members usually receive Board papers five days prior to meetings in order to enable the Directors adequate time to study and consider the documents. Members of the Executive Committee, led by the Chief Executive Officer, are present at all of the Board meetings and present all of the papers on operational and financial matters. Directors have the right to raise concerns at Board meetings, and can ask for those concerns to be recorded in the Board minutes. The advice and services of the Company Secretary (whose appointment and removal is a matter reserved for the Board) are also available to the Directors. The Group has also established a procedure which enables, in relevant circumstances, Directors to obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. 127 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO BOARD BUSINESS DURING 2017.

The Code helps to ensure a foundation of values and works as a guide for behaviour that encourages an environment of ethics and responsibility for the benefit of our stakeholders. It serves to complement the internal and external regulations already in force and also to establish corrective measures for anyone who fails to comply with the provisions of the Code. It also provides the framework for the Company’s compliance with the UK Bribery Act and the Mexican anti-bribery and corruption legislation. Changes to the Code of Conduct were ratified by the Board in February 2017, the objective of these changes was to: • incorporate a ‘behavioural compass’ establishing basic questions that personnel should ask themselves before making decisions; • highlight the corporate values; • address topics such as money laundering and industrial espionage; • emphasise that safety is a top priority; and • give greater clarity on sanctions in the case of violations. CULTURE During 2017, the Board received regular reports on the organisational culture and ethics programme, including a presentation at its July meeting. The programme consists of three main elements: evaluation, support activities and training. Reports are received on the three cultural KPIs, the number of whistleblowing line cases, reports on management (the tone from the top) and disciplinary cases. The Group undertook an Ethisphere ethical, culture and perceptions assessment to benchmark its culture and these findings were reviewed by the Board. The HSECR Committee has been given responsibility for overseeing the programme on behalf of the Board, and has reviewed the progress of the programme in detail during its meetings in 2017. 128 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS CONTINUED GOVERNANCE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES THE BOARD COMPOSITION: KEY CONTRIBUTORS: • Non-executive Chairman • Chief Executive Officer • Independent Non-executive Directors Executive • Chief Financial Officer • Non-independent Committee • VP of Exploration Non-executive Directors • Chief Operating Officer AUDIT COMMITTEE COMPOSITION: KEY CONTRIBUTORS: Chief Financial Officer, External Auditor, • All independent Non-executive Directors Internal Audit, Risk Manager, Company Secretary REMUNERATION COMMITTEE COMPOSITION: KEY CONTRIBUTORS: Chief Executive Officer, • Majority independent Non-executive Directors Remuneration Consultants, Company Secretary NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE COMPOSITION: KEY CONTRIBUTORS: Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, • Majority independent Non-executive Directors Company Secretary HSECR COMMITTEE COMPOSITION: KEY CONTRIBUTORS: Chief Executive Officer, Head of Sustainability, • Majority Non-independent Non-executive Directors Line Managers, Chief Legal Officer CULTURE AND VALUES Sets the tone from the top through review and approval of Code of THE BOARD Ethics, key policies and receipt of reports on cultural performance.

The cycle of the Board’s evaluations is summarised as follows: YEAR 1 YEAR 2 YEAR 3 Externally facilitated Board evaluation Follow-up on action plan prepared in Focus on outstanding and emerging using questionnaires and/or response to year 1 evaluation using issues arising from the action plan interviews internally-facilitated questionnaires using internally-facilitated questionnaires BOARD EVALUATION IN 2017 At the beginning of 2017 the Board considered an action plan in response to the findings of the internally-facilitated evaluation FRESNILLO undertaken in 2016, being the final step in the previous three-year cycle. TODAY In 2017, Fresnillo engaged Lintstock to facilitate an evaluation of the performance of the Board of Directors. Lintstock is an advisory firm that specialises in Board performance reviews and has no other connection with the Company. The first stage of the review involved Lintstock engaging with the key project sponsors, including Executive Committee and Non-executive Board members, to set the context for the evaluation and to tailor survey content to the specific circumstances of Fresnillo. All Board members were then requested to complete an online survey addressing the performance of the Board STRATEGIC and its Committees. The anonymity of the respondents was ensured throughout the process in order to promote an open and frank exchange of views. REPORT Lintstock subsequently produced a report addressing the following areas of Board performance: • The appropriateness of the Board’s composition was assessed and respondents were asked to identify any additional competencies from which the Board would benefit. • The Board’s understanding of the views of key stakeholders and the markets in which the Company operates was CORPORATE considered. The Board’s oversight of the culture and behaviours throughout the organisation was also reviewed. • The relationships between Board members and management, and the atmosphere in and management of meetings, GOVERNANCE were assessed, as was the quality of the Board packs and management presentations at meetings. • The effectiveness of the Board in reviewing the Company’s current performance, and influencing future performance, was considered and respondents were asked to identify areas upon which they feel the Board should spend more or less time focusing. • The Board’s oversight of strategy and the Company’s progress against its strategic pillars was considered, as was the Board’s understanding of the capacity of the organisation to deliver the strategy. Respondents’ views as to the top strategic FINANCIAL issues facing the Company were also identified. • The Board’s oversight of risk management was assessed, as was the Board’s effectiveness in monitoring the Company’s STATEMENTS health and safety performance. • The appropriateness of the structure of the Company at senior levels was reviewed and the level of interaction between the Board and top management in various settings was considered. As a result of the review, among other things the Board agreed to the following key actions: KEY FINDINGS FROM 2017 EVALUATION PROPOSED ACTIONS More time should be devoted to strategy In future there will be one general strategy discussion a year and specific strategy discussions e.g. in relation to health & safety or exploration, at each other meeting during the year. More time should be allocated to succession planning A formal Board discussion of the succession plan will be scheduled once a year. INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS Non-executive Directors occasionally meet the Chairman without executives being present. The independent Non-executive Directors meet annually in order to evaluate the performance of the Chairman. On the back of this meeting, the Senior Independent Director discusses the views of the independent Directors with the Chairman. The Independent Directors held this meeting in 2017 after the February meeting and took the 2016 Board Evaluation review into account in their discussions and feedback to the Chairman. 130 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS CONTINUED BOARD DEVELOPMENT AND INDUCTION Senior management present on the Group’s strategic initiatives to provide the Non-executive Directors with more information about the broader context to the Company’s activities. In addition, there is a regular distribution of industry briefings on technical, market and sector issues. Directors are encouraged to visit the Company’s mines to familiarise themselves with the Fresnillo Group’s operations building on mine visits in recent years. During 2017, there were two visits by members of the Board to the new San Julián development. Mr Alejandro Bailléres and Mr Arturo Fernández, along with members of the Executive Committee visited San Julián in September 2017 and Messrs Wilson, Jacobs and Dame Judith Macgregor visited the same mine in October 2017. Mr Jacobs and Dame Judith Macgregor also visited the Fresnillo mine in October 2017. Briefings were arranged for all Directors from the Company’s legal advisers. These include presentations which were aimed at familiarising the Directors with the duties and responsibilities as Directors of a UK listed company. In addition, the Chairman meets with Directors to discuss any training or development needs. Following her appointment to the Board in May 2017, a series of briefings were arranged for Dame Judith Macgregor, including meetings with the Company’s key advisers and a presentation about the duties of a director of a UK listed public company. Meetings were also arranged with members of the Executive Committee to enable Dame Judith to discuss the Company’s strategy and business plans in more detail. Dame Judith also attended a meeting of the Audit Committee as an observer as part of her induction. THE GOVERNANCE OF THE SIX CAPITALS The following table shows how the Board oversees the six Capitals of the Group within its governance activities: TYPE OF CAPITAL GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE ACTIVITIES DURING 2017 Human Board, Audit and HSECR Committees • Review of culture and organisational ethics strategy and reports on metrics. • Approval of Modern Slavery Statement. • Oversight of whistleblower arrangements. • Succession planning. Natural Board and HSECR Committee • Review of the Exploration Strategy. • Regular review of exploration and environmental KPIs. Social and relationship Board, Audit and HSECR Committees • Annual review of Payments to Governments reporting and monitoring taxation strategies. • Review of communities initiatives. • Regular review of anti-bribery and corruption programme. Financial Board and Audit Committee • Approval of business plan and capex strategies. • Going concern reviews. • Viability Statement analysis. Manufactured Board and Audit Committee • Development of project monitoring methodologies and reporting for Board review. • Review of Internal Audit reports on new projects. Intellectual Board and Audit Committee • Reviews of IT Strategy. • Monitoring activity of the IT Governance Committee. The Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day stewardship of all classes of capital and its members report to the Board on the key metrics and initiatives. Indirectly, the Remuneration Committee supports the governance of the six types of capital by setting remuneration targets which incentivise value creation across all six types of capital. 131 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT DEAR SHAREHOLDER In my letter as Chairman of the Nominations Committee in the 2016 Annual Report, I stated that we remain strongly committed to the principle of equality of opportunity when considering new appointments to the Board. Shortly after the publication of that report, we were delighted to announce that Dame Judith Macgregor would be joining the Board with effect from the 2017 AGM. Dame Judith has now joined the Board and is adding useful counsel and insight to our discussions. I am equally delighted that we propose to appoint Georgina Kessel to the Board following the 2018 AGM bringing the proportion of women on our Board to 25% compared to less than 10% just over a year ago. Our policy is to make appointments to the Board on the basis of merit and there can FRESNILLO be no doubt that we have kept to our policy in making both of these appointments. TODAY The Nominations Committee remains mindful that we are in a phase during which careful consideration of the composition of the Board is required, particularly as some of our independent Non-executive Directors reach the ninth anniversary of their appointment. We have therefore made changes to the composition of the Board and its Committees to retain the right number of independent Non-executive Directors on our Board and meet the standards set by the UK Corporate Governance Code. As a Committee, we are also keen to ensure that our current Board members are committing appropriate amounts of time and effort to the Board’s work and have scrutinised the other commitments and attendance STRATEGIC record of our Directors very carefully. We are aware that two of our Board members hold more external REPORT directorships than some of our stakeholders would prefer and levels of attendance at Board and Committee meetings also come under scrutiny. We are delighted that our Board is made up of very talented and expert Directors and the contribution of each one both in and outside of Board meetings is valued. Each year we monitor the contribution of our Directors and, in 2017, we had the additional assurance provided by our externally facilitated Board and Committee evaluation exercise to support our views on this point. At present, the North America Free Trade Agreement, which is of critical importance to Mexico, CORPORATE is coming under increasing scrutiny and one of our Directors, Jaime Serra, who was key to its original introduction, is for a while, in demand because of his expertise in this area. We are pleased that he is actively contributing to this important development for Mexico GOVERNANCE and are happy to accept that this meant that he just missed one Board meeting as a consequence. During the year, the membership of the Nominations Committee changed with Fernando Ruiz standing down from the Committee following the Company’s AGM in May and being replaced by Alberto Tiburcio, an independent Non-executive Director. I would like to place FINANCIAL on record my thanks to Fernando for his contribution to the Committee since its formation in 2008 and I am pleased to welcome Alberto to the Committee in his place. STATEMENTS Yours faithfully Mr Alberto Baillères Chairman of the Nominations Committee 132 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP The members of the Nominations Committee are Alberto Baillères (Chairman of the Committee), Bárbara Garza Lagüera and Alberto Tiburcio. Mr Tiburcio was appointed as a member of the Nominations Committee on 23 May 2017, replacing Fernando Ruiz. The majority of the members of the Nominations Committee are, therefore, independent Non-executive Directors. ROLE The Nominations Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the structure, size and composition of the Board and its committees and succession planning for the Directors and other senior executives. Before making appointments of new Directors, the Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and identifying and nominating suitable candidates. The Nominations Committee has approved Board Appointments and Board Diversity Policies which provide the framework for the Nominations Committee and the Board’s approach to Board appointments. Attendance Mr Alberto Baillères 2/2 Mr Fernando Ruiz 2/2 Ms Bárbara Garza Lagüera 2/2 Mr Alberto Tiburcio (both meetings were held prior to Mr Tibucio being appointed to the Committee) 0/0 Board composition: gender split 2017 Post-2018 AGM Male 10/12 9/12 Female 2/12 3/12 Board composition: experience Finance and tax 4 UK capital markets and legal 2 Political and public policy 3 Mining/mining sector 3 Mexican business 9 International business 8 NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE BOARD APPOINTMENTS POLICY AND PROCESS IN SUMMARY The Nominations Committee and Board are strongly committed to the principle of equality of opportunity when making new appointments to the Board while ensuing that appointments are made on the basis of merit. The Nominations Committee continues to consider the composition of the Board with a focus on its continued commitment to diversity. The criteria for determining the composition of the Board and future Board appointments continue to be based on: • Relationship Agreement requirements for appointments to the Board by Peñoles. • The Company’s leading position as a precious metals miner in Mexico. • The Company’s inclusion in the FTSE 100 Index. • The specific functions on Board committees which independent Directors will be required to fulfil. • The provisions set out in the current terms of reference of the Nominations Committee. The Nominations Committee does not use open advertising or retain any external consultants when making new appointments to the Board as it is considered unnecessary considering the Company’s contacts within Mexico and further afield. BOARD DIVERSITY POLICY IN SUMMARY AND PROGRESS All Board appointments are made on merit. The Board recognises and embraces the benefits of having a diverse Board; particularly the value that different perspectives and experience bring to the quality of Board debate and decision-making. There are certain considerations which are taken into account in considering the composition of the Board such as: background and experience; age; gender; and shareholder perspectives. The Board believes that setting targets for the number of people from a particular background or gender is not the most effective approach to take. The Board will therefore look to follow the principles of this policy rather than specified quotas or targets. Following the appointment of Dame Judith Macgregor as an independent Non-executive Director during the year, three of the seven new Directors that have been appointed to the Board since 2012 have been women. This demonstrates the Board’s commitment to gender diversity. With 16.6% of the current Board composition being female, the Nominations Committee recognises that this does not meet the 33% target for representation of women on the board set by the Hampton133 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Alexander Review. Nevertheless, it will continue to keep the gender balance of the Board as a key factor in considering future Board appointments, which at all times will be based on merit. The Board recognises that very few women are attracted to mining engineering and geology academic programmes in Mexico and, in view of the stage of development of Mexico, the participation of women in the labour force as a whole is still relatively low. This will take time to rectify but it is changing and the Company is committed to hiring and developing women with educational training in mining engineering, geology, finance and accounting. With nine Mexican and three British directors on the Board, the Nominations Committee is satisfied with the ethnic diversity of the Board. Full versions of the Board Appointments Policy and Process and the Board Diversity Policy and the Group Diversity Policy, can be found on the Company’s website (www.fresnilloplc.com). FRESNILLO ACTIVITY DURING 2017 TODAY The Nominations Committee met twice during the year. BOARD APPOINTMENTS The Nominations Committee is committed to a progressive refreshing of the Board, as recommended by Code Provision B.2.3 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. STRATEGIC Following departures from the Board in 2016, the Nominations Committee, led by the Chairman, considered options for the appointment of a new independent Non-executive Director at its meetings in February and April 2017. In making its REPORT recommendation that Dame Judith Macgregor be appointed to the Board, the Nominations Committee recognised that Dame Judith’s impressive credentials as a diplomat, including four years as the British Ambassador to Mexico, would bring a new and valuable perspective to the Board’s work. The Nominations Committee recognises that further independent Non-executive Director appointments are necessary as some of the current independent Directors reach the nine-year deadline for independence set by the UK Corporate Governance Code. Consequently, Mr Guy Wilson will step down from the Board at the 2018 AGM and, CORPORATE subject to shareholder approval at the same meeting, be replaced as an independent Non-executive Director by Georgina Kessel. GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP The Nominations Committee reviewed the composition and effectiveness of the Board Committees in 2017 and, while it was satisfied that the Committees are working well, it also considered that the membership of the Committees would need to be refreshed in order to ensure that they clearly reflect the appropriate representation of independent Non-executive Directors on each Committee. The Nominations Committee therefore approved the following changes to the Board Committees in April 2017: • Alberto Tiburcio was appointed to the Nominations Committee in place of Fernando Ruiz; FINANCIAL • Jaime Serra Puche was appointed to the Remuneration Committee in place of Mr Ruiz; and • Mr Ruiz left the Audit Committee and was appointed a member of the HSECR Committee. EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING STATEMENTS Each year, the Nominations Committee reviews a schedule of possible successors for all the positions on the Executive Committee (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Exploration and Chief Operating Officer). This review considers both short-term emergency and long-term planning scenarios. Any actions needed to support the development of potential long-term successors are discussed. The Nominations Committee also monitors the long-term evolution of the membership of the Board as a whole. These matters were all discussed by the Nominations Committee in 2017 and it is satisfied with the actions that are being taken to support this. OTHER NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE ACTIVITY The Nominations Committee also considered the following matters: • Approval of the Nominations Committee Report prior to publication. • Review of the time commitment required from each Director. • The proposed re-election of each of the continuing Directors at the AGM. • A self-evaluation exercise (which concluded that the Nominations Committee is functioning well). The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee are available on the Company’s website at www.fresnilloplc.com. The letters of appointment for the Non-executive Directors are made available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, during normal business hours. 134 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT DEAR SHAREHOLDER In additional to our normal duties, which are set out in the following Report, we have been addressing three issues which arose in 2017, namely new accounting standards, the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and the increasing activities of the Mexican tax authorities. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Management has modelled the effects of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers. The results indicate that the financial effects on our Group financial statements of IFRS 15 are likely to be minimal. The effect of IFRS 9 is estimated to be an initial adjustment from retained earnings to hedging reserves as at 1 January 2017 of US$23.0 million and an adjustment decreasing financial costs for the year ended 31 December 2017 of US$42.1 million. THE NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING DIRECTIVE We have been monitoring management’s actions to assemble the information required, using Internal Audit to validate the data extracted from our operational records. We have also taken into consideration section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to ensure that the resulting information is properly presented. TAXATION During 2017, the Mexican tax authorities have opened a number of investigations into the tax returns of our subsidiaries, some of them going back several years. These investigations are considered to be routine but the level of activity appears to have increased. These investigations cover three main areas. • The normal reviews instigated by our recognised trade union seeking to ensure that PTU (the statutory employee profit-sharing arrangement which is available to all Mexican employees) has been correctly calculated. • Reviews looking at certain of our subsidiaries’ tax returns for the year 2013 which reflect the corporate reconstruction of our mining operations. • The tax inspections have been relatively straightforward so far in that activity has been limited to requests for information which we have promptly supplied by the due dates. In addition, new legislation required us to obtain details of the tax compliance of certain contractors to whom we made payments. We are working with our suppliers to ensure that full information is provided to the tax authorities. So far, this is working well but it did consume a significant amount of time and resources in 2017 prior to the online portal to input this information to the tax authorities opening in 2018. In all of the above, we are confident that no material tax costs or penalties will arise and therefore we do not consider that potential tax exposure in relation to the above matters is a significant issue for the financial statements for 2017, as reflected in note 10 to the financial statements, but we will continue to monitor the situation closely. AUDIT COMMITTEE EVALUATION In the latter part of 2017, Lintstock, an independent advisory firm, carried out an evaluation of us, using a questionnaire-based approach which indicated that we were doing an effective job. Nevertheless, we have done our own evaluation to identify a few areas of focus for 2018 which are set out in the Effectiveness section of this Report. SAN JULIÁN During the year, I and two of my fellow Directors had the opportunity to visit San Julián which is the first time I have visited a new mine. It is an amazing sight to see when, after flying over an impressive mountain range for some time, you see a transformed valley below. As it is a new mine, you can see how the mine commenced and from the plans you can see its logical development over time. The accommodation, community centre and recreational facilities are excellent and we also had a chance to see how the Company works positively with the local community. All in all, it is a visit that I will remember for a long time as the whole operation is a credit to the hard work of the development team to have completed such a large project in a remote location in a relatively short time and on budget. Yours faithfully Guy Wilson Chairman of the Audit Committee 135 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE COMPOSITION The members of the Audit Committee at 31 December 2017 were Guy Wilson (Chairman of the Committee), Jaime Serra and Alberto Tiburcio.

STRATEGIC THE ROLE AND ACTIVITY OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT The role and duties of the Audit Committee are set out in its terms of reference, a copy of which can be found on the Company’s website at www.fresnilloplc.com. The Audit Committee met five times during 2017. Its programme of activity is determined at the beginning of each year and is structured to ensure that it reviews all of the activities set out in its terms of reference. The Audit Committee has six primary responsibilities and a secondary one for monitoring its own effectiveness. This report is, therefore, presented under the following headings: CORPORATE FINANCIAL REPORTING INTERNAL AUDIT GOVERNANCE Overseeing the Company’s financial Overseeing the work and findings reporting to shareholders. of the Internal Audit team. EXTERNAL AUDIT WHISTLEBLOWING FINANCIAL Overseeing the Company’s relationship Overseeing the effectiveness of the Company’s STATEMENTS with its external auditor. whistleblower scheme. RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL RELATED PARTIES Overseeing risk, internal control, Overseeing financial aspects of the relationship going concern and viability. with related parties. EFFECTIVENESS Monitoring the Audit Committee’s effectiveness and that of the internal and external audit functions. 136 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED FINANCIAL REPORTING KEY ACTIVITIES IN 2017 • Review of the financial statements and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2016. • Review of the computations for Tax and PTU. • Review of Payments to Government disclosure. • Review of interim financial statements for 2017 and Interim Announcement. • Review of plan for preparing the financial statements and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2017. • Consideration of new accounting standards and their implications for the Company’s financial reporting. • Consideration of whether any changes were required to the existing accounting policies. SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT AREAS The Audit Committee spends time ensuring that there is consistency between the policies and judgements used in preparing both the full-year and half-year financial statements prior to respectively recommending those financial statements to the Board for approval. In conjunction with management and the external auditor, the Audit Committee considers the principal areas of audit risk and judgements made in relation to the financial statements which should be considered during its review of the financial statements and the external auditors report thereon. In many cases, these significant judgement areas will be the same as those considered in previous years; however, as the mining cycle progresses these judgement areas will evolve and new ones will need to be considered while others may become less important. This process may be summarised in the following way: SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT PROCESS BY CATEGORY OF RISK ANNUAL IDENTIFICATION REVIEW OF DISCUSSIONS COMMITTEE’S ASSESSMENT OF KEY SOURCES OF WITH CONCLUSION ON OF KEY AUDIT VARIABLES ASSURANCE MANAGEMENT SUITABILITY OF RISKS TO CONSIDER AND EY DISCLOSURE SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT AREAS IN 2017 The significant judgement areas prioritised in 2017 are set out below. In each case, the Audit Committee concluded that the accounting treatment and disclosure in the financial statements is appropriate. MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES (SEE PAGES 274 TO 278) ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK Reserves and resources are a primary driver of Fresnillo’s market valuation and a significant input into calculations of depreciation and assessments of impairment. Inaccuracies in the estimation of reserves and resources would lead to broad implications across the Annual Report and Accounts. VARIABLES CONSIDERED The estimation of mineral reserves and resources requires significant judgement, not only in respect of mineral physically in place but also metal price and cost assumptions used to determine the cut-off grade for identifying economically viable ore bodies. There is also judgment in developing and maintaining the mine plans which estimate the timing and quantities of related production. SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee reviewed the report by SRK Consulting (the Company’s independent reserves and resources auditor) on the reserves and resources (excluding Silverstream) and considered the year-on-year changes in SRK’s estimation of reserves and resources quantities. The Audit Committee also considered EY’s evaluation of the competence and objectivity of SRK, in the context of financial reporting. 137 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT (SEE NOTE 14 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK The Silverstream contract represents a large asset on our balance sheet which can, as a result of movements in variables discussed below, give rise to large, albeit noncash, income or expense amounts in our income statement. VARIABLES CONSIDERED The Silverstream contract is a derivative financial instrument which must be reflected at FRESNILLO fair value at each balance sheet date. The fair value is most sensitive to the timing and volume of forecast production derived from the reserves and resources and production TODAY profile of the Sabinas mine, estimated future silver price and the discount rate applied in the valuation. SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee reviewed the inputs into the estimation of the valuation at the balance sheet date and associated sensitivity analysis. This included management’s consideration of a review of the Peñoles reserve and resource estimation process STRATEGIC performed by SRK in the year (that had been commissioned by Peñoles) and the disclosures relating to the Silverstream contract. It discussed with EY their procedures REPORT for their audit of the valuation and the key assumptions therein. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING REVENUE RECOGNITION (SEE NOTE 27 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK Fresnillo has a controlling shareholder and as a result has very strong ties both to Peñoles and the broader BAL group. There is a risk that related party relationships could be taken advantage of to manipulate earnings or otherwise distort our financial position. CORPORATE Furthermore, related party transaction disclosure requirements allow investors to understand the Company’s exposure to inappropriate related party transactions and there GOVERNANCE is a risk that disclosures in our financial statements could be inaccurate or incomplete. VARIABLES CONSIDERED Every year, the Audit Committee scrutinises the probity of all major related party transactions to ensure that they are entered into transparently and fairly to all shareholders (see the section of this report headed ‘Transactions with Related Parties’). FINANCIAL The Audit Committee has also considered transfer pricing assessments completed by the Group’s external adviser, PricewaterhouseCoopers. STATEMENTS SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee reviewed EY’s procedures to ensure that related party transactions are recognised accurately and correctly reported in the relevant disclosures in the Annual Report, to ensure that they are consistent with the information it is presented with during the year. TAXATION AND PTU (SEE NOTE 10 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK The taxation of mining companies in Mexico has been the subject of much attention and governmental action in Mexico. In accordance with the Mexican legislation, local companies also pay employee profit sharing (‘PTU’) equivalent to approximately 10% of the taxable income of each fiscal year. There is a risk that deductions taken when calculating tax and PTU charges may be challenged, and that any resulting exposures to payable taxation and PTU may not have been provided for appropriately. In addition, certain tax assets and liabilities are denominated in Mexican pesos and may be revalued during the period, resulting in foreign exchange gains or losses which need to be taken into account when assessing the tax charge for the period. VARIABLES CONSIDERED The Audit Committee seeks to conclude that the stated charges for PTU and taxation are fair and reasonable. It reviews all the significant judgements and adjustments applied to accounting profit in determining profit subject to taxation or PTU for each subsidiary which are clearly set out in papers prepared by management. SOURCES OF ASSURANCE Throughout the year the Audit Committee received updates on the status of tax inspections and the Company’s progress in meeting the new legislation with respect to contractors’ tax compliance. The Audit Committee also challenged management’s detailed memorandum and sought EY’s views and ascertained the degree to which such judgements and adjustments are supported by internal and/or external subject matter experts and ensured that these explanations correspond with information it was presented with during the year prior to approving the relevant disclosures in the Annual Report. 138 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTINUED LICENCES AND LAND TITLE (SEE NOTE 12 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK Without good title to land and licences to operate, the Company would be unable to operate its mines. Defective title or failure to comply with operating conditions set out in the mine licences would give rise to impairment risk. VARIABLES CONSIDERED The Audit Committee considers whether the Company continues to have a robust process to ensure that all required legal documentation is completed correctly on acquisition of land titles particularly in light of litigation and ejido activity. The specific questions arising from this are: (i) whether there are factors which may give rise to asset impairment; (ii) whether the level of legal provisions and narrative disclosures in the accounts are adequate; and (iii) whether/when the Group would be able to resume operations at Soledad-Dipolos. SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee has oversight over the progress of the land title review and throughout the year has received verbal and written reports from the Company’s Head of Legal based on assessments by the Company’s external legal counsel. ENSURING THAT THE ANNUAL REPORT IS FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE There are a number of steps that the Board undertakes to ensure that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable: • Management prepares drafts of the Annual Report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. • Two weeks prior to the Annual Report being approved by the Board, members of the Audit Committee and other Directors review a current draft enabling them to assess whether the information was consistent with their understanding of the Company’s business. • Suggested changes put forward by the Directors, based on knowledge obtained through Board and Audit Committee papers and discussion and other interactions with management are taken into account by management in preparing the final version of the Annual Report. • Any Alternative Performance Measures (‘APM’) used in the Annual Report are reviewed by the Audit Committee. • Internal Audit undertake a review exercise of the non-financial numbers in the Annual Report which are extracted from the Company’s operational records. • The Audit Committee reviews the Annual Report and financial statements and then recommends them to the Board for approval. As a result of the above procedures, the Board considers that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable. EXTERNAL AUDIT KEY ACTIVITIES IN 2017 • Review EY report following completion of the audit for the year ended 31 December 2016. • Review of the representation letter given to EY for the 2016 full-year audit. • Review effectiveness of the 2016 full-year audit process. • Recommendation to the Board of the reappointment of EY as auditors at AGM. • Review of letter from EY providing their observations and opportunities arising from the 2016 audit process and management responses to same. • Discussion with EY of the findings from their review of interim results for the period ended 30 June 2017. • Review 2017 half-year representation letter given to EY. • Review and approval of the external audit plan, fees and terms of audit engagement. • Review of Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) Report on EY as a firm in respect of 2016 Annual Reports. • Consideration of the independence, objectivity and qualifications of EY as external auditor. • Review of policy on the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor and approvals. • Review of the results of the ‘hard close audit’ for the ten months to 31 October 2017. 139 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 EXTERNAL AUDIT CONTINUED During 2017, the members of the Audit Committee met twice with representatives from EY without management present and once with management without representatives of EY present, to ensure that there are no issues in the relationship between management and the external auditor which it should address. There were none. APPOINTMENT OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR In February 2017, the Audit Committee considered and recommended the re-appointment of the external auditor, EY, to the Board prior to the Company’s Annual General Meeting. This recommendation was made following a robust tender exercise which had been conducted during 2016 (and was outlined in the Audit Committee Report for 2016). EY’s tender in 2016 made certain commitments to enhance the quality of the external audit and the Committee have monitored how EY has fulfilled the FRESNILLO commitments made at that time. TODAY The Audit Partner is Daniel Trotman and he has been the Audit Partner for three years. EVALUATION OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR The key criteria against which the external audit tenderers were assessed in 2016, and which remain appropriate for the STRATEGIC assessment of EY, are as follows: • Experience in mining, with precious metals expertise preferred, in companies of a similar size and complexity. • London team experienced with FTSE 100 companies and associated regulation and governance supported by local Mexican team. • Quality of partners in UK and Mexico and quality of their teams, evidenced by firm and external evaluations. Issues from the REPORT FRC’s Audit Quality Review (AQR) of the firm relevant to audit of Fresnillo and details of internal processes used for quality assurance. Quality and experience of other technical resources that may be used on assignments. • How the audit approach is aligned to Fresnillo’s specific circumstances as set down in detail in their audit plan for the year. • Communication skills in both written documentation and meetings. CORPORATE • Expected continuity of team. • Proposed hours and fees. • Independence of firm and details of internal practices to ensure continuing compliance with independence requirements GOVERNANCE and freedom from conflicts of interest. • Co-ordination with parent company management and auditors. The Audit Committee also reviewed the FRC’s Audit Quality Review on EY as a firm, the FRC having not selected Fresnillo for review, and ensured that no findings concerning EYs audit quality were relevant to the audit of Fresnillo plc. In February 2018, based on the above criteria, and following detailed discussions with management, the Audit Committee FINANCIAL evaluated the performance of EY in 2017 and concluded that it was appropriate to recommend the re-appointment of EY as STATEMENTS external auditor at the 2018 Annual General Meeting. QUALITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES POLICY The Audit Committee is mindful of its responsibility to ensure that the external auditor maintains its independence and objectivity and is appropriately qualified with sufficient resources and expertise to fulfil the role. The Audit Committee specifically reviewed, and is satisfied with, the independence of EY as the external auditor based on disclosures provided by EY in accordance with UK Ethical Standards for the audit profession. The Audit Committee reviewed its policy for the provision of non-audit services to the Fresnillo Group by the external auditor (the ‘Policy’) during the year having updated it in 2016. No further changes were made to the Policy in 2017. The current policy permits the engagement of the external auditor to provide statutory audit services, certain assurance, and due diligence services where fees are less than US$5,000 to be pre-approved. Any engagement of the external auditor to provide permitted services above US$5,000 is subject to the specific approval of the Audit Committee. During 2017, the Audit Committee authorised EY to provide the following services under the Policy on the basis that neither piece of work was deemed by the Audit Committee to compromise EY’s independence: (i) A short deferred tax training session for the Fresnillo financial reporting team in Torréon (US$4,200). (ii) Accounting support for the finance team in relation to the application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 (US$23,500). (iii) A review of the calculations underpinning the tax methodology in Péru (US$7,000). In February 2017, EY informed the Audit Committee that there had been a minor breach of the Ethical Standards on non-audit services as a result of EY undertaking less than two hours work on tax compliance services in the UK in January 2017. Such work was permitted prior to 31 December 2016 and the services had been provided in error. The Audit Committee was satisfied that there was no threat to EY’s independence as a result of this matter. Details of the fees paid to EY during the year as shown in note 28 to the financial statements. 140 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL KEY ACTIVITIES IN 2017 RISK • Quarterly reviews of the risk matrix and Key Risk Indicators (‘KRIs’). • Half-yearly reviews of the Principal Risks and Uncertainties. INTERNAL CONTROL • Quarterly review of internal control monitoring reports to the Board. • Consideration of plan for the year-end review of the system of internal controls. • Annual review of the system of internal controls. FINANCIAL • Annual treasury policy review and investment of cash balances. NON-FINANCIAL • Review of reserves and resources data and report from SRK. • Quarterly review of Anti-Bribery and Corruption Programme (‘ABAC’). • Quarterly report on legal matters (including land titles and litigation). • Regular reviews of IT governance, IT strategy, cyber security and data protection. • Annual review of compliance with mining licence conditions. GOING CONCERN • Half-yearly reviews of the Going Concern Statement and supporting papers. VIABILITY • Review of the process for preparing the Viability Statement including scenario planning assumptions and supporting paper. • Review of the draft Viability Statement prior to submission to Board for approval. RISK Management continues to build on the existing risk management framework, seeking to enhance risk governance and management across the business in line with the changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code. In order to support the Board in monitoring the normal risk management activities, the Audit Committee reviewed management’s activities to: • develop a continuous monitoring process consisting of validating the effectiveness of current controls; • continue promoting ownership of risk mitigation and associated controls among the process owners at the business unit level (being the first line of defence) through their periodic reporting on the effectiveness of controls; and • ensure that the Group’s corporate values and control culture are embedded throughout the organisation. These efforts have resulted in a transparent analysis of the operational, financial and executive management controls for each of the risks that have been identified by management in its risk universe. A quarterly report is prepared for the Board which explains any significant variations in the KRIs and management’s conclusion on the likely effect on the relevant risk ratings and/or any modifications in the related controls. This is reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to its submission to the Board. During 2017, the Audit Committee and Board formally reviewed the Principal Risks and Uncertainties of the Group prior to the publication of both the interim and full-year reports. Further details of the risk management system are set out on page 34. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Company’s objectives and policies on financial risk management including information on the Company’s exposures to market risk, such as foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks; credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in note 31 to the financial statements. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY In the current year the Audit Committee continued to receive updates on the Group’s IT strategy, its linkage to the Group’s overall business strategy and the financial implications of that strategy for the business plan. The Audit Committee has also focused on the related risks of cyber security. The Audit Committee was satisfied that progress has been made during the year in each of these areas. Further information about the Group’s approach to IT is set out on pages 50 and 51 of the Strategic Report. INTERNAL CONTROL The Group has in place internal controls and risk management systems in relation to the Group’s financial reporting process and the Group’s process for preparing consolidated accounts. These systems include policies and procedures to ensure that adequate accounting records are maintained and transactions are recorded accurately and fairly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS. 141 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 During 2017, the Audit Committee has continued to review the quarterly internal control monitoring document which was introduced in 2016 and which is prepared and submitted to the Board at each of its regular meetings. This document specifically reports on internal controls and the key findings from the quarterly Internal Audit reports. The process agreed by the Audit Committee to monitor the Group’s system of internal controls is focused on improving the understanding of how the various sources of assurance (such as operational management, financial management, executive management and Internal Audit) interact in the review and execution of material controls identifying and addressing any gaps in the control framework. To this end, the Audit Committee, with the assistance of the risk function and management, has assessed its approach to monitoring the ongoing effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls. The progress to date FRESNILLO was reviewed by the Audit Committee in February 2018. TODAY Further control exceptions identified in the current year include those relating to operational safety, compliance with regulations for handling hazardous materials and explosives, monitoring of electrical installations, installation of auxiliary services within the mine, monitoring and operation of tailings deposits and the oversight over contractors. These issues are not pervasive throughout the Group’s operations but each issue has occurred at least at one of the Group’s operating areas and plans for remediation have STRATEGIC been approved and these are being progressed. On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board agreed that the following statement be made about the review of the system of internal control in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts. REPORT The Board has, through the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee (at its February 2018 meeting), reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls. As a result of this review, the Board considers that the measures that have been or are planned to be implemented complement Fresnillo’s risk management framework and are appropriate to the CORPORATE Group’s circumstances. The Board is committed to the continued development of its internal control regime with a view to achieving and maintaining GOVERNANCE best practice levels of risk management and internal control for international mining companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. GOING CONCERN The Directors must satisfy themselves as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for a minimum of 12 months FINANCIAL from the approval of the financial statements. The Audit Committee supported the Board in this assessment by considering whether, in adverse circumstances, the Company has adequate liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. In February 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed the Group budget and cash flow forecasts for the period to December 2019, STATEMENTS taking into account the Company’s anticipated production profiles at each mine, budgeted capital and exploration expenditure and the sensitivity of the cashflow forecasts to movements in metal prices. The Audit Committee also considered EY’s report on this assessment and on the reasonableness of assumptions therein, including their consistency with assumptions and estimates used elsewhere in the preparation of the financial statements. In particular, the Committee challenged management on the feasibility of the mitigating actions and the potential speed of their implementation. As a result of the procedures performed, the Audit Committee satisfied itself that the going concern basis of preparation is appropriate and the financial statements appropriately reflect the conclusions on going concern. LONGER-TERM VIABILITY Having adopted a robust process in 2015 for the preparation of the initial Viability Statement (which was described in the 2015 Audit Committee Report), in 2016 the Audit Committee considered with management ways of further enhancing the disclosures by including references to contingency planning. The Audit Committee agreed with management that no further changes were required in 2017. The Board’s Going Concern Statement and longer-term Viability Statement are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 48 and 49. 142 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED INTERNAL AUDIT KEY ACTIVITIES IN 2017 ANNUALLY • Review Internal Audit Plan and its resourcing for the following year. • Evaluation of Internal Audit. TWICE A YEAR • Meeting between the Audit Committee and Internal Audit without management present. EVERY MEETING • Review of significant Internal Audit findings (including progress on red flags) based on the audits conducted during the most recent quarter. The Head of Internal Audit and Internal Audit Manager attend all meetings of the Audit Committee. The Chairman of the Audit Committee met separately with them five times during 2017 around the time of each Audit Committee meeting. The Internal Audit team seeks to complete audits of all the operating risks across all of the Fresnillo Group’s mining assets on a regular basis. During the year, the Audit Committee received specific input from Internal Audit to focus on four particular areas: 1. New mines: Following the emphasis on auditing the Company’s new mines which was initiated in 2016, Internal Audit completed its examination to ensure that proper procedures were implemented from the beginning in those new operations and to ascertain whether there were any lessons to be learned. This work was fundamental to refine methodologies and working arrangements between multiple disciplines to provide enhanced transparency to management about operational and financial performance throughout the process of building and commissioning new mines. 2. Red flags: At each meeting during the year, the Audit Committee has focused on the progress made by management in dealing with ‘red flag’ items raised during internal audit visits to ensure that the management responses to remediation are appropriate and timely. Significant progress, which has been monitored by Internal Audit, has been made during the year to reduce the number of issues requiring long-term remedial work that remained outstanding at the end of 2017. 3. IT issues: (including cyber security): During 2017, the Audit Committee received presentations from the Head of IT setting out the Group IT Strategy for the year and demonstrating how this supports the overall Group Strategy. Within these presentations, the Audit Committee considered the steps being taken by management to deal with cyber security threats, liaised with Internal Audit to ensure that appropriate controls are, or are planned to be, in place and reviewed the extent to which awareness has been raised internally. 4. Data protection: Internal audit monitored the steps being taken to ensure that appropriate levels of procedural compliance with the requirements of Mexican data protection legislation are in place. Human Resources has taken over day-to-day responsibility for the implementation of the relevant procedures. The Audit Committee understands the steps being taken by management to deal with these matters and is satisfied with the progress being made. In addition, the Audit Committee also monitored the quality of the dialogue between Internal Audit and the Executive Committee in reviewing internal audit findings and agreeing action plans with appropriate levels of operational buy-in to deal with the points raised. The Audit Committee met with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer several times during the year to review the outstanding points and is satisfied with the progress achieved through this dialogue. The members of the Audit Committee evaluate the performance of the Internal Audit team annually and in 2017 this process was facilitated by the Chairman of the Audit Committee who discussed the findings of that review with the Head of Internal Audit and Internal Audit Manager and consulted with his colleagues on the Audit Committee before finalising the review. When reviewing the Internal Audit Plan for the year, the Audit Committee also considered the personnel available within the Internal Audit team, their expertise and experience, to resource their increasing workload. 143 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 WHISTLEBLOWING KEY ACTIVITY IN 2017 • Review of whistleblowing cases considered by Honour Commission at each meeting of the Audit Committee. The ‘Fresnillo Plays Fair’ whistleblower hotline allows stakeholders to anonymously report (via an independent third party) FRESNILLO violations of the Group’s Code of Conduct. The results are assessed by an independent third party and processed for review by the Honour Commission, which comprises the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Compliance Officer TODAY (currently the Chief Financial Officer), the Director of Internal Audit, the Vice President of Exploration and the Legal Manager. These arrangements have been established for some time and the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that appropriate investigation of all whistleblowing incidents is undertaken in a timely manner. In 2017, there were a total of 46 reports, a 10% decrease over 2016. The Audit Committee continues to view this level as encouraging for our efforts to promote a greater understanding of the benefits of reporting issues. The Audit Committee considers that this STRATEGIC indicates that employees recognise that such reports are valued and investigations are rigorously evaluated. 68% of the 2017 reports were actioned in the year with the remainder, having been raised in the latter part of the year, still being under investigation. Fresnillo plc has a whistleblowing line available for all stakeholders, including employees, third parties and the general public. REPORT Information regarding this whistleblowing mechanism is widely circulated with access available via our website in the Ethics and Culture/Code of Conduct section. The whistleblowing reports are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Honour Commission and then presented to the Audit Committee. The purpose of the whistleblowing line is to encourage employees and others to raise good faith concerns about CORPORATE misconduct that goes or appears to go against the Company’s internal Code of Conduct and our institutional values. The following table provides a summary of the cases that were received in 2016/2017: GOVERNANCE 2017 2016 Alleged inappropriate arrangements with suppliers 10 9 Alleged professional negligence 7 4 Alleged theft 7 6 FINANCIAL Alleged harassment 5 16 Alleged abuse of authority 4 2 Other – contractors 4 – STATEMENTS Alleged misuse of assets 3 4 Alleged fraud 1 – Alleged conflict of interest – 1 Alleged unethical arrangements with other third parties – 1 Other 5 8 46 51 Reports received can be anonymous; all are investigated as to their merits and addressed by the designated area assigned by the Compliance Officer in coordination with the Honour Commission. Once an investigation is concluded, results are presented to the Honour Commission which decides if any particular necessary action or sanction is required. A summary of such actions are presented below: Status 2017 2016 Disciplinary steps taken 8 8 No disciplinary action was taken but steps were 12 23 Concluded taken to reinforce current control procedures Dismissed for lack of grounds 11 18 In progress of investigation 15 2 46 51 During 2017, the Audit Committee was satisfied that all matters had been or are being properly investigated with appropriate action taken. The Audit Committee considers that current level of issues raised is good evidence that the programme is being taken seriously across the Group and is operating satisfactorily, albeit that it was noticed in 2017 that the process of investigating issues raised in the cases reported took more time to arrive at the appropriate solution which was the reason behind the increased number of cases in progress of investigation over 2016. 144 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED RELATED PARTIES KEY ACTIVITIES IN 2017 • Review of related parties list and payments to key external advisors. • Review of insurance programme (including the role of related parties in the insurance programme). • Review of Met-Mex treatment charge and refining charge rates for 2017. • Review of preparations for the renewal of the Shared Services Agreement in 2018. Peñoles owns just under 75% of the issued share capital of the Company (see page 148) and therefore has and will continue to have a significant level of influence over the affairs and operations of Fresnillo. Being part of the same Group also provides an opportunity for synergistic benefits to be achieved operationally and administratively by combining the resourcing of common services that can be shared between Peñoles and Fresnillo. The principal arrangements between the Company and related parties are: THE SHARED SERVICES AGREEMENT The Shared Services Agreement is an agreement between the Company and Peñoles under which 23 categories of services are provided to the Company by Peñoles. The Shared Services Agreement was renewed for five years with effect from 31 December 2012. In order to ensure that Fresnillo is charged appropriately for services rendered by Peñoles under the Shared Services Agreement, management has regular meetings with Peñoles to discuss its performance against the Key Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’) for each of the different categories of service where issues of non-compliance are addressed and remediation agreed. In addition, Internal Audit conducts reviews of approximately one third of the services provided each year to ensure that these services are provided in accordance with the agreed KPIs. As a result, all services are reviewed by Internal Audit over a three-year cycle. During 2017, the Audit Committee reviewed the planning for the renewal of the Shared Service Agreement in early 2018. Supported by KPMG, this process seeks to use third party benchmarking across all of the service categories covered by the Share Services Agreement to ensure that the scope and pricing for each service is appropriate. The Audit Committee also reviewed the performance of Peñoles in meeting the KPIs for the different service categories over the current term of the Shared Services Agreement. The Audit Committee is satisfied that appropriate services have been achieved. The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG their methodology for benchmarking prices for each of the 24 separate services now required and their evaluation of all of the prices tendered. Their resulting conclusion was a price for 2018, the first year of the new five-year Shared Services Agreement, which represented an increase of less than 10% over 2017, made up from inflation and additional service levels required offset by operational efficiencies. The Audit Committee concluded that the new five-year Shared Services Agreement was reasonable in all respects and recommended that the independent Non-executive Directors approve its signing by the Company, which they did at the Board meeting in February 2018. THE MET-MEX AGREEMENT During the year, the Audit Committee considered the proposed charges in respect of the Met-Mex arrangements for 2017 comparing proposed prices to comparable prices charged by Met-Mex to independent customers and to those of other refineries taking account of ore composition and transport costs to ensure that they are reasonable. Based on the satisfactory outcome of that review, the Chairman of the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the independent Directors approve the proposed charges for 2017 under the Met-Mex arrangements, which they did at the Board meeting in October 2017. OTHER AGREEMENTS There are other dealings with related parties in the ordinary course of business (e.g. insurance brokerage) which, although not requiring approval by independent Directors, will from time-to-time be reviewed by the Audit Committee to ensure that the arrangements are on a reasonable arm’s-length basis. 145 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 EFFECTIVENESS KEY ACTIVITIES IN 2017 • Review of the training and development activities for Audit Committee members and briefings from the external auditors relating to changes in financial regulation. • Audit Committee evaluation activities. • Annual review of the terms of reference of the Audit Committee in order to ensure that they remain up-to-date. FRESNILLO Since the inception of the Audit Committee, there has been a continuing programme of evaluation which has embraced the activities of the Committee itself as well as the performances respectively of the external auditor and the Internal Audit function. TODAY At least once every three years, these reviews have been externally facilitated with internal evaluation exercises undertaken during the intervening years. During 2017, there were two key workstreams to this activity: (i) follow-up to the internallyfacilitated evaluation of the Audit Committee undertaken in 2016; and (ii) an externally facilitated review of the Audit Committee undertaken by Lintstock as part of its review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees. 2016 evaluation follow-up: The internal evaluation in 2016 was facilitated by the Company Secretary, using a questionnaireSTRATEGIC REPORT based approach. This was the final step in a three-year process which commenced with the previous external evaluation in 2014. The conclusions of the 2016 evaluation were that the Audit Committee was satisfied that its core duties were being performed well; however, it identified five further areas for review during 2017. The following table shows the progress made on those five areas of review during the year: ACTION PROGRESS CORPORATE • Review of the Board’s post-investment review procedures. • A new format for reporting to the Board on postinvestment appraisal was presented to the Board GOVERNANCE at its July meeting. • Oversight of management’s evaluation of the Shared • A presentation on the process and metrics for the Services Agreement as it approaches its renewal date. renewal of the Shared Services Agreement was presented at the February 2018 meeting of the Committee with the Agreement being presented FINANCIAL to the Board for approval by the Independent Nonexecutive Directors in February 2018. • Oversight of the IT Governance Committee in relation • The Audit Committee has received presentations from STATEMENTS to the management of the IT strategy and IT-related the Head of IT on the IT Strategy and its interface with internal controls and the liaison with Internal Audit. the Company’s Business Plan and Strategy.

Lintstock concluded from the completed questionnaires that the management of Audit Committee meetings, in terms of the annual cycle of work, the meeting agendas and supporting documentation and the time and input during meetings, was highly rated, and that the Committee functioned effectively and no areas for improvement were noted. Nevertheless, the Audit Committee, from its own evaluation, identified that there were areas which warranted further review in 2018. • Oversight to ensure that the lessons learnt from the post-investment appraisal exercise in 2017 are correctly reflected in management’s methodologies for new projects. • Continued liaison with the IT Governance Committee over the development of IT-related internal controls and the interaction with Internal Audit. • Oversight of the development of performance indicators on non-financial information and the related work by Internal Audit. • Continued liaison with management over progress on the various outstanding matters with the Mexican tax authorities. NEXT STEPS The Audit Committee intends to undertake an externally-facilitated evaluation of the Internal Audit function during 2018. It will conduct an internal review of its own effectiveness in 2018. 147 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS The Board continually monitors the interests of the Company’s minority shareholders in order to ensure that those interests are being properly respected, and that they are aligned as far as possible with those of the majority shareholders.

The Annual Report and Accounts and the Notice of the Annual General Meeting will be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days prior to the date of the meeting. In planning the business of each AGM, the Board takes account of institutional shareholder guidelines on pre-emption rights, share buy‑backs and shareholder rights in relation to general meetings when drafting the usual resolutions dealing with those matters. In each case, resolutions are presented to the AGM to give the Board flexibility to respond to market developments. AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE OWN SHARES The Company was authorised by a shareholders’ resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting held in May 2017 to purchase up to 10% of its issued Ordinary Share capital. Any shares which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares or, if FRESNILLO not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued and authorised share capital. This authority will expire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and a resolution to TODAY renew the authority for a further year will be proposed. No shares were purchased by the Company during the year.

The Group’s remuneration policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain and motivate its Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee. The retention of key management and the alignment of management incentives to the creation of shareholder value being key objectives of this policy. COMPONENTS OF DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION HOW IS THE REMUNERATION POLICY ACHIEVED? COMPONENT RATIONALE SALARY Setting base salary levels for Executive Directors or key management at an appropriate level is key to managerial retention in Mexico. Salaries are positioned within the range according to experience and length of service. Ordinarily, the same basis for change (e.g. salary increases) will be applied across the Company to senior management and employees alike. BONUS The annual bonus rewards the achievement of financial and strategic business targets and the delivery of personal objectives. Annual bonus is capped at six months’ salary and is paid on the basis of metrics set out in the remuneration policy. LONG-TERM INCENTIVES The annual bonus scheme sets targets which are aligned to the long-term strategic objectives so that these priorities are embedded within the day-to-day activities of our business rather than being seen as something extra. BENEFITS Benefits are provided in line with the Group’s policy on employee benefits. PENSION The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. Executive Directors and key management are entitled to membership of the defined contribution scheme. SHARES The Company does not use share-based forms of remuneration because this continues not to be a common form of remuneration in Mexico. Additional features of Fresnillo’s Remuneration Policy SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES In the absence of share-based incentive schemes, there is no need to adopt shareholding guidelines for executives. RECOVERY OF BONUS The absence of long-term incentives makes it difficult to adopt claw-back and malus (MALUS/CLAW-BACK) arrangements. There is however scope within the bonus scheme for bonus awards to be adjusted downward at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. WHAT WAS ACHIEVED?

The most important job for the Remuneration Committee in 2017 was the renewal of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the Annual General Meeting in May. We proposed a few minor amendments to the Policy which were favourably received and I am delighted that our independent shareholders overwhelmingly supported the renewal of the Policy. My Remuneration Committee colleagues and I welcome shareholders’ endorsement of the Policy. Having received such strong support for our approach to executive remuneration, we will continue to work hard to ensure that our approach remains the most appropriate one to serve the long-term interests of the Company. During the year Fernando Ruiz, who had served on the Committee from its inception in 2008, stepped down from the Committee. Fernando’s contribution to the Committee over the past nine years has been greatly appreciated by his colleagues and we thank him wholeheartedly for his commitment and support during that time. I am delighted to welcome Jaime Serra, an independent Non-executive Director, to the Committee and look forward to working with him. In commenting on the activities of the Remuneration Committee during the year, I would like to highlight the time and attention that the Committee devoted to first, ensuring that executive remuneration is aligned to remuneration trends across the Group and second, ensuring that remuneration promotes the long-term interests of the Company. In reviewing the Chief Executive Officer’s salary each year, the Remuneration Committee takes account of the salary increases agreed for the whole workforce as well as other actuarial benchmark data on salaries. In 2017, the CEO was awarded a 3.5% increase in salary compared to an average benchmark increase of 4.61%. In determining this level of increase, the Remuneration Committee took account of previous increases in salary awarded to the Chief Executive Officer. The Committee also received periodic benchmarking data from Willis Towers Watson, as required by the Remuneration Policy, which confirmed that the CEO’s total remuneration remains well inside the parameters set in the Policy. While the CEO participates in a bonus scheme which is modest by any FTSE 100-listed company standard, he is not permitted by Mexican law to participate in the PTU scheme, the statutory employee profit-sharing arrangement which is available to all other Mexican employees and which has the potential to pay annual bonuses which are a significantly higher proportion of salary than the annual bonus scheme for the CEO. The CEO also participates in the same pension scheme arrangements as all other employees. The Remuneration Committee therefore believes that the CEO’s remuneration is well aligned to that of the workforce as a whole. Prior to the 2017 AGM, the Remuneration Committee spent time considering whether any changes were needed to the Remuneration Policy and concluded that while some minor amendments would be appropriate, for example, in relation to the exercise of discretion, the overall approach was correct. Nevertheless, the Remuneration Committee revisited the question of whether longterm incentives should be introduced into the Policy. This requirement was discussed with advisers and it was concluded that there was no need to introduce longer-term incentives at this time. The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly the Committee is satisfied that the annual cash bonus scheme contains sufficient elements and incentives to ensure that the Group is sustainable over the long-term. In particular, the high proportion of bonus paid for replenishment of reserves and resources and delivery of growth projects as well as the penalties in place for unhealthy, unsafe and environmentally unfriendly practices are designed to focus executive attention on the long-term viability of the Company as well as short-term performance. Second, we have always maintained that long-term incentives are not a key feature of remuneration within the Mexican market and we have been consistent on that since we listed in London back in 2008. During the year, we asked Willis Towers Watson to evaluate that assumption and while there is some anecdotal evidence that long-term incentives are beginning to emerge as a feature of remuneration in Mexico, we are yet to be convinced that our Remuneration Policy needs to be changed. We will continue to monitor this aspect between now and the next renewal of our Policy in 2020. The activities of the Remuneration Committee are described in more detail in the following sections of this Report. Staying in line with our previous approach to remuneration reporting, we have published remuneration information in respect of our Chief Executive Officer as if he were a member of the Board, even though that is not currently the case. We believe this is within the spirit of our reporting obligations, even if it is not strictly required, as it adds to the transparency of our reporting. As ever, I am always interested to hear the views of shareholders on our approach to executive remuneration. Yours faithfully Charles Jacobs Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 153 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION 2017 INTRODUCTION This Report sets out information about the remuneration of the Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017.

Where a change of emphasis is considered to be necessary, the weighting will be amended in future years. 2 Any decrease in equivalent ounces produced and/or in reserves and resources will result in points being deducted from the total points scored in proportion to the level of the shortfall compared to the previous year. Production excludes amounts from the Silverstream contract and is compared against budget for the year. Total resources includes 100% of all of the resource estimates at the Group’s controlled mines, irrespective of ownership. 3 Net profit is adjusted to exclude currency fluctuation, the effect of year-on-year changes in metals prices and any revaluation of the Silverstream contract. The 2017 net profit amount for the purposes of the 2017 annual bonus was in line with this approach. A table setting out the reconciliation of net profit to the numbers reported in the financial statements is set out on page 155. The target is set as the prior year profit, excluding the revaluation of the Silverstream contract, the mark-to-market revaluation of derivatives and foreign exchange gains/losses in the prior year. 4 The points awarded for the stakeholder and teamwork objectives are subject to some discretion. The following points are awarded depending on the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of the stakeholder and teamwork effort: Satisfactory performance = 100% of weighting points; outstanding performance = 140% of weighting points; and underperformance = 0 points. 5 In the event of a single fatality, zero points will be awarded for safety. For the purposes of calculating fatalities; all fatalities are included, irrespective of whether they are employees or contractors. Conversely, in the event of zero fatalities during the year, the number of points awarded would be increased to ten points. 6 In addition to the penalty for a single fatality (see note 5), the number of points awarded will be further reduced by 1% if there are two fatalities, or by 2% if there are three fatalities, or by 3% if there are four fatalities etc. 7 In the event of an environmental incident, the total bonus score will be reduced by 2%, in the case of two incidents, a further 3% will be deducted. In the case of three incidents, a further 4% and so on. 8 Under the current Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to make adjustments to bonus payments (see section headed Discretion in the table on page 163). 155 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET PROFIT TARGETS AND OUTCOMES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 2016 US$ millions Result Result Profit for year as shown in financial statements 560.8 425.0 Adjustments: Changes due to currency fluctuations 30.3 115.5 Changes due to year-on-year movements in metal prices (including the effects of metal hedging) (69.3) (109.5) Changes due to the movement in the valuation of the Silverstream contract (79.6) (93.5) FRESNILLO Adjusted net profit total for bonus purposes 442.2 337.5 TODAY EXPLANATION OF NON-FINANCIAL TARGETS AND COMMITTEE DECISION ON POINTS AWARDED Relationship with stakeholders The Remuneration Committee consider that progress has been made but with some scope for further development.

MALUS AND CLAW-BACK The introduction of the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code requires companies to either introduce malus and/or claw-back provisions and other forms of deferred variable pay where appropriate, or explain why they have not complied with the Code. The Remuneration Policy approved at the 2017 AGM gives the Remuneration Committee discretion to reduce bonus payments to take account of poor operational or financial performance during the year or in relation to previous years. Downward FRESNILLO adjustment would also be considered where the executive response to adverse health, safety or environmental performance during the year was considered to be poor. Such discretion would be applied after any adjustments in relation to safety and TODAY environmental performance had already been deducted under the annual bonus plan see page 165 in the Directors’ remuneration policy section. YEAR-ON-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF CEO AND ALL EMPLOYEES STRATEGIC Percentage change (in US dollar amounts) 2017–2018 Base salary/Fees Benefits Annual bonus Chief Executive Officer 2.2 (9.1) (49.0) REPORT All employees 8.7 21.7 18.4 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2017 AND 2018 The Remuneration Committee established the peer group of companies for the purposes of validating the remuneration of CORPORATE Executive Directors and senior management (the ‘Peer Group’). The Peer Group consists of 11 resources companies from Europe (three companies), USA and Canada (six companies) and Mexico (two companies) as follows: Europe Randgold Resources GOVERNANCE Acacia Mining Hochschild Mining FINANCIAL USA/Canada Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd Goldcorp Inc. Hecla Mining Co. STATEMENTS Newmont Mining Corporation Panamerican Silver Corp. Yamana Gold Inc. Mexico Goldcorp Grupo Mexico The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the Chief Executive’s salary should be set within a range of 25-75% of the Peer Group for base salary. In 2017, Willis Towers Watson advised the Remuneration Committee that the CEO’s salary remains well within the parameters set out in the remuneration policy. The Remuneration Committee has considered the effectiveness of key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) and targets that were set for 2017 and it continues to consider that the overall structure of the Incentive Plan and the targets set in 2017 remain appropriate for 2018 other than where adjusted to reflect the 2018 business plan targets. The Remuneration Committee has also, with effect from 2018, introduced a cap on each of the KPIs (other than the Safety KPI) such that the points awarded on any KPI (other than Safety) cannot exceed 135% of the target set for that KPI at the beginning of the year. Under the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 2017, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to amend bonuses in certain circumstances (as set out in the Policy). Such discretion is unaffected by this cap. The 2018 weightings and measures are therefore set out in the table below. The 2018 targets and performance against those targets will be disclosed in next year’s report. 158 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION 2017 (CONTINUED) Weighting Objective Measure points 1 Production Increase in equivalent ounces produced compared to prior year production level 2 26 Exploration/Growth Net increase in total resources compared to previous year-end total 2 10 Net increase in resources upgraded from inferred to indicated compared to 20 previous year-end total 2 Financial Year-on-year increase in net profit adjusted 3 17 Stakeholder Relationship with key stakeholder 4 5 Surface tenure 4 3 Controls over contractors 4 3 Teamwork Collective teamwork across the Group 4 5 Succession Plan for Executive Committee positions 6 Safety Fatal accidents 5 5 Total 100 Adjustments 6, 7, 8 – Total 8 100 1 The points weighting is considered by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that it reflects an appropriate balance of priorities for management.

Mr Fernando Ruiz, independent Non-executive Director, was a member of the Remuneration Committee until he stepped down on 23 May 2017. Although the UK Corporate Governance Code states the need for the Remuneration Committee to be made up of independent Non-executive Directors, the Board believe that it is vital that the membership of the Committee is made up of Non-executive Directors who are able to bring the following perspectives to the working of the Remuneration Committee: • An understanding of shareholder expectations. • An understanding of the evolving remuneration expectations of investors on the London Stock Exchange. • An understanding of the general approaches to remuneration within the Mexican market. 159 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 The current composition of the Remuneration Committee is considered to be appropriate. Although Mr Baillères was nonindependent at the time of his appointment to the Board (and therefore his membership of the Remuneration Committee does not comply with Code Provision D.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code), the Board continues to uphold the view that Mr Baillères’ experience and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committee’s deliberations justifies his membership of the Remuneration Committee.

Its key activities during the year were: • Approval of and recommendation of changes to the Remuneration Policy to the Board for approval prior to inclusion in the business of the 2017 for shareholder approval. • Receipt of reports from Willis Towers Watson concerning the benchmarking of remuneration for members of the Executive Committee and Executive Directors, by reference to the peer group. • Consideration of information about Mexican inflation trends and internal employee salary reviews prior to setting the STRATEGIC annual salary increases for the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee. • Receipt of a report from Willis Towers Watson concerning developments in market practice in Mexico in relation to longREPORT term/share-based incentives. • Review of the Non-executive Directors’ fees. • Review of the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee compared to the KPIs set for 2016 and approval of annual bonus awards for 2016 based on achievement of KPI targets. • Review of KPI targets for the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee for 2017, including CORPORATE consideration of the effectiveness of changes to the targets to reward better performance in safety improvement and exploration efforts set the previous year. GOVERNANCE • Receipt of reports from the Company Secretary on UK regulatory developments in relation to executive remuneration. • Other activities, e.g. Committee evaluation, as required by the Committee’s terms of reference and review of the terms of reference of the Committee. The terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee have been approved by the Board and are available on the Company’s website at www.fresnilloplc.com. FINANCIAL ADVISORS TO THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE STATEMENTS Remuneration consultants are engaged by Group companies to provide benchmarking information on remuneration but not to provide guidance on the structure of remuneration. All of the consultants that the Group uses are independent of the Company. No remuneration consultants are directly engaged by the Remuneration Committee itself. Benchmarking information on pay and employment conditions is supplied annually by Mercer, Hay Group and Data Compensation. The information provided is used across the Group in determining salaries for all employee grades including senior management. While the Remuneration Committee takes such information into account when considering executive remuneration, none of these advisors are considered to materially assist the Remuneration Committee in the performance of its duties. In addition, the Remuneration Committee receives specific reports comparing the remuneration of the members of the Executive Committee to international benchmarks. Willis Towers Watson have advised the Remuneration Committee in relation to the establishment of the peer group and the provision of benchmarking information showing the position of the remuneration, and particularly the salaries, of members of the Executive Committee in relation to the peer group. Willis Towers Watson provide general advice and benchmarking information to the Group concerning executive remuneration and during 2017, the Group paid Willis Towers Watson US$20,735 (2016: US$nil). The Company Secretary ensures that the Remuneration Committee fulfils its duties under its terms of reference and provides regular updates to the Remuneration Committee on relevant regulatory developments in the UK. The Group Human Resources Department provides information on Mexican market trends and compensation structures for the broader employee population in the Fresnillo Group. 160 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION 2017 (CONTINUED) AGM VOTING ON THE REMUNERATION REPORT The Remuneration Committee’s approach to executive remuneration has received strong support from shareholders at every Annual General Meeting since the Company’s listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2008.

GOVERNANCE Charles Jacobs Chairman of the Remuneration Committee FINANCIAL 26 February 2018 STATEMENTS 162 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED APPENDIX: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY INTRODUCTION This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy of the Company and has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (‘the Regulations’). The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 and the views of our major shareholders. It describes the policy to be applied for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 and beyond. The remuneration policy was put to a vote at the 2017 Annual General Meeting and overwhelmingly approved. The effective date of the policy is therefore the date of the 2017 Annual General Meeting of the Company, 23 May 2017. As required by UK law, the remuneration policy is binding in relation to Directors. The Company currently has no Executive Directors who would be bound by the remuneration policy. However, the Company will (as it has previously done) treat the Chief Executive Officer as if he were an Executive Director for the purposes of the remuneration policy and for reporting on his remuneration. REMUNERATION POLICY The Group’s remuneration policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain and motivate its Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee. The retention of key management and the alignment of management incentives and the creation of shareholder value being key objectives of this policy. Setting base salaries for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee at an appropriate level is a key to managerial retention in Mexico. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that salaries are market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies. Total compensation is set within a range around the median level for the Company’s peer group within Mexico and internationally, total remuneration is benchmarked triennially to ensure that the whole remuneration package is maintained at this level over the long term. Salaries are positioned within the range according to experience and service. The table below sets out the key elements of Executive Directors’ pay set out in the remuneration policy (the ‘Policy Table’): BASE SALARY PROVIDES THE CORE REWARD FOR THE ROLE Operation Reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months starting on 1 April each year and the review is influenced by: • Role, experience and performance. • Average workforce salary adjustments. • Mexican economic factors. • Comparison with the Company’s peer group in Mexico and internationally. Salaries are benchmarked triennially by reference to companies of similar size and complexity and will be positioned within a mid-range of the Company’s comparator peer group in Mexico and internationally. The next review will take place in April 2019. Maximum value The Executive Director’s salary will be reviewed taking account of the benchmarking information received by the Remuneration Committee and the maximum value of the Executive Director’s base salary will be positioned within the mid-range for companies in the peer group of Mexican and international resources companies. An Executive Director’s salary will be increased in line with increases applied across the whole workforce. In exceptional circumstances, the Executive Director’s salary may be increased by up to but never more than 10% above the average pay increase for the whole workforce of the Company in any year. The rationale for such increases will be fully explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration. Performance metric The Remuneration Committee considers individual salaries at the appropriate meeting each year by reference to the factors noted under the ‘Operation’ heading in this table. Details of the current remuneration of the Executive Director are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration. Discretion The Remuneration Committee will establish the Company’s comparator peer group in Mexico and internationally as part of the triennial review which it will consider in April 2019. The peer group will be reviewed again in April 2019. The Committee will report on the outcome of these reviews within the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration. 163 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 ANNUAL BONUS REWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF BOTH SHORT AND LONG-TERM FINANCIAL AND STRATEGIC BUSINESS TARGETS AND DELIVERY OF PERSONAL OBJECTIVES Operation Targets are renewed annually and relate to the strategic aims of the business as a whole. A scoring system is used for the plan. Each objective set for the executive at the beginning of the year is allocated a points-rating which represents a median performance target for that objective. Upper and lower point thresholds are set to allow for outstanding performance and to ensure that underperformance is not rewarded. For each member of the Executive Committee (including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice President of Exploration and the Chief Operating Officer), a bonus is only payable if the aggregate performance equals or exceeds 100 points. Bonus payments are paid for aggregate performance against target at or above 100 points as follows: FRESNILLO Points Variable pay (month’s salary) Variable pay (% of salary) Less than 100 Zero Zero TODAY 100.00–103.75 Two 16.67 103.76–107.50 Three 25.00 107.51–111.00 Four 33.33 111.01–115.00 Five 41.67 STRATEGIC 115.01+ Six 50.00 REPORT Maximum value The maximum percentage of salary is 50% (six months’ salary) and is paid where Executive Directors achieve 115.01 points or more under the Annual Bonus Plan (the target is 100 points). Performance metric The KPI targets set out in the previous table will apply and are intended to focus on risks that are within the control and influence of management. Thus, the management of safety, security, project, CORPORATE human resource, exploration and environmental risks are all currently implicitly covered within the KPIs. The KPIs and targets, which are set by reference to the reserved and resources and financial GOVERNANCE metrics at the previous year end and/or set in the budget for the forthcoming financial year are also designed to ensure that both short-term objectives and the long-term development of the Fresnillo Group are given equal priority. Details of the measures, targets and performance which is tested on an annual basis will be provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration. FINANCIAL Discretion The Remuneration Committee considers that the KPIs, upon which bonuses are based, may need to evolve from year-to-year in line with the strategy and therefore it retains the discretion to make modest STATEMENTS adjustments to the KPIs themselves, the bonus bands within the overall maximum and the individual KPI weightings from year-to-year. The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust bonus payments in the following circumstances: (i) A downward adjustment where the KPI outcomes would result, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, in a bonus payment which cannot be justified by the Company’s financial or operational performance during the year (or subsequently in respect of previous years). In this case a downward adjustment would be applied. (ii) Where factors outside the control of Executive Directors e.g. force majeure circumstances have significantly depressed the level of points awarded. In deciding whether adjustment is merited, the Remuneration Committee will consider the appropriateness of the Executive Director’s response to those circumstances; in this situation a modest upward adjustment may be considered. (iii) Poor executive response to adverse health, safety or environmental performance during the year, in which case a downward adjustment would be considered. The use of any such discretions will be fully explained in future Directors’ Remuneration Reports. Note: Any adjustment in individual KPI weightings will not result in their achievement being any less difficult to satisfy. 164 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED APPENDIX: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY (CONTINUED) BENEFITS HELP RECRUIT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES Operation An Executive Director would be entitled to life insurance, the use of a company car, the payment of premiums for medical insurance covering limited expenses and check-ups. Benefits may be changed if Company policy on benefits changes. Maximum value The current benefits are set out in the Annual Remuneration Report. The maximum value of benefits will be determined by Company policy that is applicable to all employees. Performance metric None. Discretion The Remuneration Committee may consider changes to the benefits made available to Executive Directors in line with any changes in the policy for benefits provided to all employees. PENSION REWARDS CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT AND SUSTAINED CONTRIBUTION Operation The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. Executive Directors are entitled to membership of the defined contribution scheme. Maximum value The maximum Company contribution for any employee may not exceed 13% of salary. Performance metric None. Discretion Not applicable. ALIGNMENT OF EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION AND THE MARKET In setting the fixed remuneration of Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee, information relating to the mining company comparators is provided by various consultants. Information relating to the Mexican economic metrics and internal benchmarking is collated by management for the Remuneration Committee to consider. Reviews are conducted by Willis Towers Watson triennially. These enable the Remuneration Committee to validate the Company’s policy towards remuneration and ensure that it is globally as well as locally competitive. The analysis evaluates the elements of base salary, short-term compensation (guaranteed payments and short-term bonus) and long-term compensation (primarily stock programmes) separately. With assistance from Willis Towers Watson, the Remuneration Committee has established a peer group which will be used to benchmark any Executive Director’s and any Executive Committee member’s remuneration to ensure that it remains within the parameters set out in this policy (see page 157 of the Annual Report on Remuneration). COMPARISON OF EXECUTIVE AND WIDER COMPANY REMUNERATION When setting pay and benefits for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration Committee takes account of pay and conditions across the Group. It will consider the overall pay increase percentage negotiated with employee representatives as its starting point. Subject to the 10% limit in the Policy Table, the Remuneration Committee may agree pay increases above or below the agreed percentage in exceptional circumstances, where in its discretion it considers such variance to the norm to be justified. Other than the Willis Towers Watson report specifically commissioned by the Remuneration Committee, the same benchmark reports are used in the evaluation of executive and employee remuneration, thus providing a common approach to both. Below Board level, a statutory profit-sharing arrangement (‘PTU’) is operated which in some years has enabled employees to receive significant levels of bonus in line with the increased profitability of the relevant employing company. Neither the Chief Executive Officer nor any of the Non-executive Directors participate in a PTU scheme within the Fresnillo Group. The other members of senior management group below Board level are employed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S.A. de C.V., which pays annual PTU payments. However, such payments are modest. The Group operates two pension schemes: (i) a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members on 1 July 2007 with benefits frozen at this date for existing members, subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index; and (ii) a defined contribution scheme (which was introduced on 1 July 2007). Membership of the latter scheme is voluntary, members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time may make contributions of 5% to the scheme. On behalf of members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time the employing company may make contributions of 5% to the scheme. The employing company may also make additional contributions between 5-8% of salary to this plan. Members may elect to match percentages between 5% to 8% of salary. Executive Directors may participate the Group’s pension schemes on the same basis as any other employee. 165 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS ON REMUNERATION The composition of the Remuneration Committee has been designed to ensure that the views of the controlling shareholder (through the membership of the Chairman of the Board on the Committee) and the independent shareholders (through the membership of a UK-based Director on the Committee) can be represented. The Remuneration Committee has considered the views of organisations such as Institutional Shareholder Services (‘ISS’) and the Investment Association both generally and as reported to the Company in relation to its own executive remuneration practices prior to each Annual General Meeting, when considering the Remuneration Policy and its application. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee also discussed aspects of the Remuneration Policy in person with ISS, and there were no major concerns raised. The Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees in setting Directors’ remuneration. POLICY ON RECRUITMENT The Remuneration Committee will consider the remuneration of new Executive Directors by reference to the remuneration FRESNILLO policy set out previously. The Remuneration Committee does not as a default position pay sign-on payments or compensate new Directors for any variable remuneration forfeited from any employment prior to joining the Board. If it did, such payments TODAY would be fully explained in the next Annual Report on Remuneration both as to the reason for payment and the rationale for the quantum. Salary will be set so as to be market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies and taking account of the experience and seniority of the appointee coming into the new role. The Remuneration Committee is likely to set base salaries below median on appointment while retaining discretion to award increases during the first and, possibly, subsequent years to bring salaries into the normal range expected for Executive Directors, in line with the Company’s stated policy. Such increases will not exceed the maximum level set out in the Policy Table. New Executive Directors STRATEGIC will receive benefits and pensions in line with the Company’s existing policy and will be able to participate in the Annual Bonus Plan on a pro-rated basis for the portion of the financial year for which they are in post. The maximum level of variable pay for REPORT new recruits will be the same as that set out in the Policy Table for existing employees (pro-rated as necessary). POLICY ON LOSS OF OFFICE Other than in circumstances of gross misconduct, Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer, leaving employment from the Group, will be entitled to receive salary and pro-rated annual bonus CORPORATE based on performance to the date of leaving. Statutory entitlements are payable according to Mexican labour law, based on length of service. Mexican labour law does not make any provision for employers and employees to give or receive notice of GOVERNANCE termination of employment. Therefore the Committee will not make payments in lieu of notice to departing executives unless required to do so by law. No contractual commitments concerning loss of office were entered into with any Director prior to 27 June 2012. ANNUAL BONUS PLAN AND POLICY ON VARIABLE REMUNERATION It is the Company’s policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance. The Company’s core strategy is one of long-term sustainable growth. Sustainable growth in mining requires the steady and safe expansion of the Group’s operations FINANCIAL through the discovery of new resources and construction, maintenance and/or expansion of new mines. No distinction is STATEMENTS therefore made between short and long-term incentives. The Company operates a single cash-based incentive plan for Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer. MALUS AND CLAW-BACK The Remuneration Committee has considered whether malus and/or claw-back provisions should be incorporated into the service agreement for the Chief Executive Officer. Given that the Company does not operate any remuneration plans with a timeframe of more than one year, the Remuneration Committee does not consider that there is much value in introducing claw-back provisions into the contractual arrangements with the Chief Executive Officer at this stage. Within this remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make downward adjustment to bonus payments where the KPI outcomes would result, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, in a bonus payment which cannot be justified by the Company’s financial or personal performance during the year (or subsequently in respect of previous years). In this case a downward adjustment would be applied. 166 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED APPENDIX: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY (CONTINUED) ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE APPLICATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER The following table sets out the fixed and variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer in the different scenarios where he receives, minimum, target and maximum variable pay (based on 31 December 2016 remuneration). Max value Component US$’000s Minimum Target Maximum Share incentives 1 Annual bonus 277 Annual variable pay 2 US$1,195k US$1,010k US$918k 9.1% 23.2% Pension benefits 36 Fixed pay 3 100% 90.9% 76.8% Other benefits 90 Base salary 792 1 Fresnillo plc does not operate any share option or share-based long-term incentive plans. 2 Variable pay consists only of remuneration where performance measures or targets relate only to one financial year. 3 Fixed pay includes salary, benefits and pension. EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS It is the Board’s policy to allow Executive Directors to accept directorships of other quoted and non-quoted companies and retain any fees or other remuneration for doing so, provided that they have obtained the consent of the Chairman of the Company. Any such directorships must be formally notified to the Board. CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company; however each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT On their initial appointment, each of the Non-executive Directors signed a letter of appointment with the Company, for an initial period of three years. Since April 2011, the letters of appointment of serving Non-executive Directors have been drafted in accordance with provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, thus obliging them to retire at each Annual General Meeting and be subject to annual re-election by shareholders to serve for a further term of one year. The amendments have been drafted such that renewed appointment will not necessitate a new letter of appointment. The Chairman of the Company does not receive any fees for acting as Chairman other than his fees as a Non-executive Director. Each Non-executive Director is expected to commit a minimum of 14 days per year in fulfilling their duties as a Director of the Company. Once this policy is approved a base fee of £35,000 per annum will be paid to each non-UK-based Non-executive Director to reflect the time commitment and level of involvement they are required to make in the activities of the Board as a whole. There are no set fees for membership of any Board committees or for the chairmanship of the Board. The UK-based Non-executive Directors receive a higher fee to reflect the additional time commitment that they make in order to travel to Board meetings in Mexico and to their responsibilities as appropriate as Senior Independent Director, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and Chairman of the Audit Committee. Unless otherwise determined, the Director concerned may give not less than three months’ notice of termination of the appointment. Copies of the Directors’ letters of appointment and service agreements are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. 167 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT In accordance with section 415 of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors of Fresnillo plc present their report for the year ended 31 December 2017.

These components accounted for: –– 100% of Revenues; –– 96% of Profit before tax, excluding Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale of concessions; and, –– 82% of Total assets. • In addition, we performed specified procedures on specific balances at a further 5 components. FINANCIAL These components accounted for: –– 100% of the Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale of concessions; STATEMENTS –– 4% of Profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale of concessions; and, –– 16% of Total assets. Materiality • Overall Group materiality of US$31.0m which represents 5% of forecast profit before tax, before Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale of concessions. KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 172 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED In the table below, each key audit matter is attributed an icon which is used to map these to our components in scope in the subsequent section below. KEY AUDIT MATTER RECOGNITION OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING REVENUE RECOGNITION  • All of the Group’s current year revenue from the sale of goods, being concentrates, doré, slag and precipitates (US$2,101.6 million; 2016: US$1,905.5 million), and a significant amount of its expenses incurred (US$111.6 million; 2016: US$84.0 million), arise from transactions with related parties. These related parties are principally subsidiaries of the Group’s direct parent, Industrias Peñoles (“Peñoles”). • Principal transactions include the sale of goods to the Met-Mex Peñoles refinery, administrative services received and the Silverstream contract. • There is a risk that, if not at arm’s length or not reflecting the goods or services provided in the period, such transactions could be used to manipulate earnings or to distribute profits to the Group’s parent. • There is also a risk that revenues are inappropriately recognised as a result of incorrect cut-off or inappropriate measurement of product sold. • There is an ongoing focus by the Mexican tax authorities on transfer pricing as reflected by the current tax inspections. There is therefore the potential risk of tax exposures arising from related party transactions. Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains Related party transactions are disclosed in note 27 to the consistent with the prior year. consolidated financial statements, Revenues in note 4 and relevant accounting policies in note 2. We have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year. OUR AUDIT RESPONSE We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 5 components, which covered 100% of the aggregate risk amount relating to revenue and 61% relating to related party expenses. In addition we performed specified procedures in 1 component which covered 38% of the aggregate risk amount relating to related party expenses. We also performed specified procedures over the Silverstream contract, which covered 100% of the risk amount. Identification of related • We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s process for identifying, recording and parties and related party reporting related party transactions. transactions • We read contracts and agreements with related parties to understand the nature of the transactions. • Throughout the performance of our audit procedures, we remained alert for any related party transactions outside the normal course of business. Revenue recognition • On a sample basis we performed testing to verify physical deliveries of product in the year. • We performed revenue cut-off testing, by reference to shipment dates. • We evaluated the appropriateness of the accounting for embedded derivatives arising from the provisional pricing terms in sales contracts. • We obtained an understanding of the basis of the treatment and refining charges negotiated between the Group and Peñoles for the current year, these being deducted from revenue. • We compared actual revenues on a disaggregated basis to detailed expectations developed based on production in the year and market prices for relevant metals to identify and understand variances for further investigation. Related party expenses • On a sample basis we tested related party expenses against underlying contractual terms. • We utilised data analysis tools to interrogate entire data sets for potential related party transactions. • We compared actual results against detailed expectations of income statement line items impacted by related party transactions to corroborate that there was no evidence of manipulation. Silverstream contract • We tested a sample of cash receipts in respect of silver that is payable under the contract in the year. • The valuation of the Silverstream contract is discussed separately below. Accuracy of disclosures • We verified that related party disclosures in the financial statements are consistent with the results of our audit procedures. 173 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 KEY AUDIT MATTER Identification of related • We, along with our internal transfer pricing specialist, obtained and reviewed the most recent parties and related party report (for 2016) to management from its transfer pricing specialists. transactions • We reviewed a letter provided by the specialist to management in February 2018 providing an update with respect to transfer pricing applied in 2017. We met with the specialist to further understand the content of the letter and to assess the conclusions reached. • We assessed the specialist as a specialist engaged by management. Revenue recognition • We developed detailed expectations for production volumes based on our interviews with management, published production reports and internal reporting to the Executive Committee. FRESNILLO • We performed analytical review procedures applying a low variance threshold, comparing revenue and production costs against the expectations we developed. • We used EY’s bespoke data analysis tools to search for terms indicating related parties and prepare a summary of transactions related to known related-party vendors and customers, TODAY which we compared to the schedule provided by management to the Audit Committee. KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE • Our procedures did not identify issues with the identification, recording or reporting of related party transactions. STRATEGIC • We concluded that revenue recognition in the year is appropriate, including the treatment of related provisional pricing terms. • In respect of transfer pricing in transactions with related parties, we consider that the work undertaken by management’s REPORT transfer pricing specialist is appropriate for Mexican tax law and also to support the appropriateness of the pricing applied to these transactions for financial reporting considerations. KEY AUDIT MATTER VALUATION OF THE SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT  CORPORATE • The valuation of the Silverstream contract (US$538.9 million at 31 December 2017; 2016: US$467.5 million), a derivative financial instrument, is estimated by management using a discounted cash flow model. • Key assumptions are the estimation of the reserves and resources and the related production profile of the Sabinas GOVERNANCE mine (owned and operated by Peñoles), future silver prices and the discount rate applied. These assumptions require management judgment and estimation. • The resulting valuation is sensitive to changes in these assumptions which may result in material revaluation effects in the financial statements (US$113.7 million pre-tax gain in 2017; 2016: US$133.5 million pre-tax gain). Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains The nature of the Silverstream contract and related valuation FINANCIAL consistent with the prior year. considerations are disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated STATEMENTS financial statements and the relevant accounting policies We adapted our procedures to consider the findings of a in note 2. specialist engaged by Peñoles to assess its estimation process of the mineral reserves and resources of the Sabinas mine in the current year. 174 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED OUR AUDIT RESPONSE We performed specified procedures over the valuation of the Silverstream contract at 31 December 2017 and related income statement revaluation effects. These procedures covered 100% of the risk amount. Valuation model • In conjunction with our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation approach and related model used by the Company to determine the fair value of the Silverstream contract under accounting standards. Reserves and resources • We interviewed the Sabinas mine geologist in order to understand the assumptions used and production profile in the estimation of reserves and resources and movements in the estimation in the year. of the Sabinas mine • We issued instructions to the auditor of Peñoles to perform procedures and report to us in respect of the reserves and resources estimate and mine plan of the Sabinas mine. These procedures included: –– conducting walkthroughs to confirm our understanding of Peñoles management’s processes to estimate quantities of reserves and resources and to develop the Sabinas mine plan; –– testing of certain key Peñoles controls which address the risks associated with the estimation of reserves and resources quantities and accuracy of the resulting mine plan; –– gaining an understanding of reasons for changes in estimates of reserves and resources in the year; –– assessing the professional competence, objectivity, and capabilities of Peñoles’ internal specialists involved in the estimation of reserves and resources quantities; and –– evaluating the reasonableness and appropriateness of inputs to the reserves and resources estimates and Sabinas mine plan as at 31 December 2017. • In the current year Peñoles has engaged SRK Consulting (“SRK”), to perform certain procedures over its reserve and resource estimation process. We have therefore also instructed the auditor of Peñoles to: –– gain an understanding of the scope of these procedures; –– review the conclusions reached by the external specialist and assess whether there are any implications for the estimate of Sabinas reserves and resources and related mine plan as at 31 December 2017; and –– assess the professional competence, objectivity, and capabilities of the specialist. • We discussed the results of the above procedures and reviewed key working papers. • We performed sensitivity analysis on inferred resources included in the mine plan. Key economic assumptions • With assistance from our valuation specialists we corroborated key economic assumptions in the valuation in the valuation, including future silver prices, foreign exchange rates and the discount rate applied. • This included comparison to market data to consider the appropriateness of silver price and discount rate assumptions when considered together in the valuation model and analysis of the consistency of assumptions to other accounting estimates. • We performed sensitivity analysis on the combination of silver price assumptions and discount rate. KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE • The valuation model is consistent with that used in prior periods and we consider this appropriate for the nature of this long term derivative contract. • We highlighted the sensitivity of the valuation to economic input assumptions, most significantly silver price and discount rate. We consider that both management’s long term silver price and discount rate assumptions are at the lower end of respective ranges considered appropriate by EY valuation specialists. We reported sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the financial impact of changing these assumptions. 175 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 KEY AUDIT MATTER DISCLOSURES, PROVISIONS AND ASSET RECOVERABILITY ARISING FROM THE EL BAJÍO EJIDO LITIGATION AND LAND DISPUTES  • The El Bajío litigation and land disputes may create uncertainty around the Group’s ability to realise the carrying values of impacted assets in the Group’s balance sheet and may give rise to further asset impairment. • Related assets are capitalised mining costs and inventory held in leaching pads at the impacted mine site. • The assessment of the recoverability of impacted assets and appropriate disclosure or provisions in the financial statements requires judgement about the future legal outcome of claims and land disputes and estimates of any related financial impacts. Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains Contingencies in respect of the El Bajío ejido litigation and consistent with the prior year. land disputes are disclosed in note 26 to the consolidated FRESNILLO financial statements and the relevant accounting policies We have not made significant changes to our audit in note 2. TODAY response compared to the prior year. KEY AUDIT MATTER OUR AUDIT RESPONSE STRATEGIC We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 1 component, which covered 100% of the risk amount. Recoverability of • We assessed management’s conclusion that there is sufficient likelihood of future economic non-current assets benefits flowing from the use of assets impacted by the El Bajío land disputes that continue REPORT to be carried on the Group’s balance sheet. • We evaluated management’s assessment of related indicators of impairment in respect of those assets. Inventory valuation • We assessed management’s estimation of the recoverable value of inventory that is impacted CORPORATE by land disputes, including corroborating gold price assumptions to market data. Future legal outcome • We evaluated management’s assessment of the current status of the El Bajío ejido litigation GOVERNANCE of claims and claims against the Group and considered whether there is a requirement for any provision or related disclosures under accounting standards. • We obtained and read independent legal confirmation letters from the Group’s external lawyers advising on these issues, and assessed these for consistency with management’s conclusions. We assessed these lawyers as specialists engaged by management. • We assessed the Group’s internal legal counsel as a management specialist. FINANCIAL • We reviewed related disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts to consider their appropriateness and completeness. STATEMENTS Management override • As the evaluation of related controls requires the evaluation of the assumptions used in, and the output of, that process, we do not seek to rely on these controls. As such, we did not specifically address the risk of management override of controls in this area but rather increased the level of challenge when performing our substantive procedures. KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE • We concluded that, based on the facts and circumstances of the El Bajío ejido litigation and land disputes, management’s assessment that no provision is required and that the impacted assets are recoverable at 31 December 2017 is appropriate. • The legal confirmations we received supported management’s judgements in this area. • We concluded that the carrying value of related assets is appropriate. • We consider that the disclosure in note 26, Contingencies, is appropriate. 176 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED KEY AUDIT MATTER RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF MINING ASSETS  • The identification of indicators of impairment is judgmental. • When an impairment test is performed, the key assumptions underpinning management’s assessment of the recoverable amount of mining assets are reserves and resources and related mine plans and production profiles, estimated future operating and capital expenditure, future commodity prices, exchange rates and the discount rates applied. • The estimation of mineral reserves and resources quantities of the Group’s mines requires significant judgment and estimation. • The Group’s reserves and resources are audited by SRK, a specialist engaged by management. • Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in estimated recoverable amounts, resulting in impairment of property plant and equipment (US$2,448.6 million, 2016 US$2,180.2 million). There is however no impairment taken prior years that may be reversed. Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains Management’s assessment of the judgement and estimation consistent with the prior year. required is set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, with results of management’s assessment We have not made significant changes to our audit for impairment in note 12.

FRESNILLO • We concluded that the carrying values of mining assets are recoverable at 31 December 2017. KEY AUDIT MATTER TODAY POTENTIAL TAX UNCERTAINTIES ARISING FROM TAX AUTHORITY INSPECTIONS AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION   This is an area on which the audit team, including senior members thereof, has spent considerable time during the year as these areas have developed. Constituent areas discussed below have not resulted in provisions at 31 December 2017 but are disclosed as contingent liabilities. STRATEGIC Tax authority inspections REPORT • As disclosed in note 26, Contingencies, in the consolidated financial statements, in 2015 the tax authorities (SAT) initiated inspections of Minera Penmont for 2012 and 2013 which are ongoing. • During the current year SAT initiated a number of further inspections at certain of the Group’s subsidiaries. • The Company has provided information to SAT with respect to the inspections initiated in the year. However, to date no findings have been raised by SAT. CORPORATE Changes in legislation • Effective 1 January 2017 there were changes in Mexican income tax and VAT requirements relating to contractors, a significant area of expenditure for Fresnillo. Fresnillo now has an obligation to ensure that contractors are compliant GOVERNANCE with their own tax obligations, including employment tax. • If Fresnillo does not obtain and retain sufficient evidence of a contractors’ compliance, the Company is at risk of not being permitted to deduct costs related to the contractor for income tax purposes or recover the related input VAT. • The tax authorities committed to establish an online portal to facilitate compliance. This was only made available in December 2017. As such there has been a lack of clarity around the implementation of the requirements for 2017 until FINANCIAL late in the year. In late 2017 the related legislation was updated, to clarify that registration by a contractor on the online portal by the end of 2018 was sufficient to discharge any 2017 compliance obligations for Fresnillo. Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area has Contingencies in respect of taxation are disclosed in note 26 STATEMENTS increased compared with the prior year. to the consolidated financial statements and the relevant accounting policies in note 2. We have designed and executed specific audit responses to address the risk in the current year. 178 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED KEY AUDIT MATTER OUR AUDIT RESPONSE We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in all impacted components, which covered 100% of the risk amount. Tax inspections • Throughout the year we maintained an understanding of the progress of inspections in order to understand the status of inspections started in 2015 as well as areas of information requested for new inspections and the status of subsequent correspondence with the tax authorities. • We read the correspondence with tax authorities relating to the tax inspections and, where relevant, legal opinions supporting tax treatments. • For elements of inspections that were progressed during the year, we critically inspected correspondence with the SAT to substantiate management’s views on any remaining exposure at 31 December 2017. • We evaluated management’s process to determine any remaining exposure and likelihood of tax treatments being accepted by the tax authorities. • We read the related disclosures in the financial statements assessing whether they accurately reflect our understanding of the status of the investigations and management’s assessment of potential exposure. Contractors’ fiscal • Using our tax specialists we assessed the implications of the new legislation and its compliance implementation as this evolved during the year. • We understood the Company’s process for seeking compliance with the regulation and assessed its adequacy. • We held meetings with management to understand its progress in obtaining evidence of contractor compliance throughout the year. • On a sample basis we checked the evidence obtained by management in support of contractors’ compliance during 2017. • Following the clarification of legislation in late 2017 we assessed management’s process to achieve contractor registration on the portal, and the subsequent extent of actual registration. Management override • As the evaluation of related controls requires the evaluation of the assumptions used in, and the output of, that process, we do not seek to rely on these controls. As such, we did not specifically address the risk of management override of controls in this area but rather increased the level of challenge when performing our substantive procedures. KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE • We conclude that management’s process for evaluating tax exposures is appropriate and that the conclusions reached are supportable. • We conclude that the disclosure of contingent liabilities is appropriate at 31 December 2017. 179 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 KEY AUDIT MATTER RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES (PARENT COMPANY ONLY)  • Investments in subsidiaries (US$7,094 million, 2016 US$6,958 million) are more sensitive to changes in recoverable value than the Group’s underlying mining assets because these investments were re-measured at fair value in 2008 when the Group was established ahead of its Initial Public Offering. • The principal driver of the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries is the estimated value of underlying mining assets held by the Group’s subsidiaries. Refer to related considerations in the related key audit matter above. • In addition, management estimates the recoverable value of exploration projects in considering the recoverable value of subsidiaries. • Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in estimated recoverable amounts, resulting in either impairment or reversals of impairment taken in prior years.

In the current year we consider this as a component of a new Key Audit Matter: “The recoverable amount of mining assets” and as a component of “Recoverability of investment in subsidiaries.” In response to an increased number of tax inspections and changes to income tax and VAT in respect of contractors we identified a new Key Audit Matter: “Potential tax uncertainties arising from tax authority inspections and changes in legislation.” AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT TAILORING THE SCOPE Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile and the organisation of the Group and the effectiveness of group-wide controls and other factors such as the results of the work of Internal Audit when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity. We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 5 components (2016: 5) (“full scope components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. These components are the 4 operating mining units in Mexico and the Parent Company. In some instances operating mining units include more than one operating mine; the Fresnillo mining unit includes the Fresnillo and the San Julián mines and the Penmont mining unit includes the Herradura, Noche Buena and Soldeda & Dipolos mines. We also performed specified audit procedures on specific account balances in a further 5 components (2016: 5). The procedures were on those account balances within those components which we deemed to be significant either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. These accounts included taxation, mine closure provisions, property, plant and equipment and cash and cash equivalents and all balances relating to the Silverstream contract. The reporting components where we performed audit procedures represented: Key Full scope Specified procedures Other procedures 4 2 2 100 100 100 100 104 0 2 2 96 16 16 82 82 -4 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Group revenue Silverstream revaluation effect Group’s profit before tax* Total assets * Excludes sales, Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on sale of concessions. The audit scope of components at which we perform specified procedures may not include testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage reflected above. The remaining components together represent an effect on the Group’s Profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on disposal of concessions of less than 1% (2016: (1)%) and 2% of total assets (2016: 2%). For these components, we perform other procedures, including analytical review and testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement in the Group financial statements. CHANGES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR There were no significant changes in our scoping as compared to the prior year. 181 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 INVOLVEMENT WITH COMPONENT TEAMS All of the Group’s significant operations are in Mexico and are audited by one local team under our direct supervision. Work performed by Primary team One component team under our direct supervision Full scope components l llll (Parent Company) Components on which specified l llll audit procedures are performed (Silverstream contract*) * In respect of the valuation of the Silverstream contract, we perform primary procedures directly. The component team performs certain supporting procedures regarding FRESNILLO TODAY cash receipts, and the auditor of Peñoles provides support in respect of procedures on the estimation of reserve and resource quantities and the related mine plan at the Sabinas mine. In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by the component auditor operating under our instruction. Of the 5 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 1 of these directly by the primary audit team. For the 5 components at which specified procedures were performed, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained STRATEGIC as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. REPORT The primary engagement team, including the Senior Statutory Auditor, visited Mexico four times during the audit, during both the planning and execution phases, with members of the team working with and supervising the component team in Mexico for a number of weeks over several visits. These visits involved discussion and oversight of the component team audit approach, consideration of any accounting and auditing issues arising from their work, reviewing key audit working papers, meeting with management and attending closing meetings. In addition, in the current year members of the primary engagement CORPORATE team, including the Senior Statutory Auditor, visited three of the group’s mining operations. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements. Senior members of the component team attended a Global Team Planning Event in the planning phase of the audit, the Post GOVERNANCE Interim Event after hard close procedures and interacted regularly with the local team between visits to Mexico as appropriate. The primary engagement team is predominantly composed of Spanish speakers in order to further enhance our interactions with both the component team and management. The primary team was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. For certain procedures, in particular areas FINANCIAL involving significant judgement and heightened audit risk, we performed work ourselves with support where required from the STATEMENTS component team. In other cases, we reviewed key working papers including, but not limited to, the risk areas described above. OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. MATERIALITY The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures. US$ million 800 700 741.5 113.7 24.8 600 500 603 400 300 200 100 0 Profit Silverstream Concession Basis for before revaluation sale materiality tax effect 182 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED We determined materiality for the Group to be US$31.0 million (2016: US$29.2 million), which is 5% (2016: 5%) of profit before tax prior to Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on sale of concessions, a one-off material item (subject to roundings). This is a consistent basis to 2016 (there being no gain on sale of concessions in 2016). We believe that this measure of profit represents one of the principal considerations for members of the Group, particularly as the Silverstream revaluation effects are principally non-cash in nature and the gain on sale of concession is a one off transaction. During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and updated its calculation for the actual financial results of the year. This did not result in any changes to materiality. We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be US$70.5 million (2016: US59.3 million), which is 1% of equity. The materiality of the Parent Company is higher than that of the Group, reflective of the Parent Company’s primary role being that of a holding company. PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality. On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely US$23.2 million (2016: US$21.9 million). We based this judgement on factors including the past history of misstatements, our ability to assess the likelihood of misstatements and the effectiveness of the internal control environment. Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. The performance materiality allocated to full-scope components in the current year is set out in the graph to the right. Allocated performance materiality increased in respect of all components, reflecting the overall performance of the Group and the individual contributions of the components to that performance. Specifically in respect of the Fresnillo mining unit, we note that the increase in performance materiality reflects the San Julián mine becoming fully operational during 2017.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of US$1.5m (2016: US$1.5m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion. OTHER INFORMATION The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. FRESNILLO Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly TODAY stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a STRATEGIC material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact. REPORT We have nothing to report in this regard. In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those CORPORATE items meet the following conditions: GOVERNANCE • Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 169 – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or • Audit committee reporting set out on pages 134-146 – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or FINANCIAL • Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 122 – the parts of the directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate STATEMENTS Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R (2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: • the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and • the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 184 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or • the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or • certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 169, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. Our approach was as follows: • We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group. We determined that the most significant which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those related to the reporting framework (IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code), regulations impacting mining operations including mining laws, environmental and labour regulations and tax and employee profit sharing requirements in Mexico. • We understood how Fresnillo plc is complying with those legal and regulatory frameworks by making enquiries to management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee. • We assessed the susceptibility of the group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it is considered there was a susceptibility of fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programs and controls that the group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programs and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free of fraud or error. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. 185 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 OTHER MATTERS WE ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS • Following a competitive tender process and the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed as auditors by the shareholders and signed an engagement letter on 28 July 2017. We were appointed by the company at the AGM on 4 May 2016 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2017 and subsequent financial periods. • The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 10 years, covering periods from our initial appointment in 2008 through to the year ended 31 December 2017. • In January 2017, we identified that non-audit services related to December 2016 prohibited under the new FRC Ethical Standard had been undertaken. These related to less than 10 hours of tax services related to payroll tax for an immaterial subsidiary of the group. No amounts related to these services have been recognised in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. We, therefore, consider this to be a minor breach of the Ethical Standard and we do not consider our independence to be impaired. We notified the Audit Committee of this breach in February 2017. The Audit Committee agreed with our conclusion that the breach is minor and that our independence is not impaired. The Committee’s discussion of this breach is set out on page 139. The evaluation of whether our independence was impaired included consideration of the FRESNILLO safeguards to independence in connection with the service specifically that the work was undertaken by a separate team from the audit team and responsibility for the related tax calculation was taken by a competent member of the group’s management. TODAY • The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. CORPORATE INFORMATION Fresnillo plc. (the ’Company’) is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 5 of the Parent Company accounts (the ‘Group’). Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C.V. (‘Peñoles’) currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baillères family, whose beneficial interest is held through Peñoles. The registered address of Peñoles is Calzada Legaria 549, Mexico City 11250. Copies of Peñoles’ accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. Further information on related party balances and transactions with Peñoles’ group companies is disclosed in note 27. The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 26 February 2018. The Group’s principal business is the mining and beneficiation of non-ferrous minerals, and the sale of related production. The primary contents of this production are silver, gold, lead and zinc. Further information about the Group operating mines and its principal activities is disclosed in note 3. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (A) BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CONSOLIDATION, AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial assets and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($’000) except when otherwise indicated. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position as of 31 December 2017 and 2016, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended. Entities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by the Group. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3. All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-byacquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at initial recognition and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Any losses of a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance. Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that is, a transaction with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interest are also recorded in equity. 193 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 (B) CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016. During 2017, there were no amendments to existing accounting policies. NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS (NEW STANDARDS) ADOPTED BY THE GROUP The Group has adopted from 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 7. The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The Group also has adopted Amendments to IAS 12. The amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. They also clarify certain other aspects of accounting for deferred tax assets. These amendments had no impact in the financial information of the Group. Other than the above mentioned amendments there were no significant new standards that the Group was required to adopt effective from 1 January 2017. FRESNILLO STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE TODAY The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, as applicable to the Group’s financial statements, when they become effective, except where indicated. IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial STRATEGIC liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. The Group has decided not to adopt IFRS 9 until it becomes mandatory on 1 January 2018. The Group does not expect the new guidance to have a REPORT significant impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets for the following reasons: CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT The equity instruments that are currently classified as available-for-sale financial assets satisfy the conditions for classification as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Under IFRS 9, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are not recycled CORPORATE to the income statement. There are no other significant changes to the accounting for these assets. Also, embedded derivatives resulting for the sales of goods as described in note 2(p) will be no longer separated from the host contract. Instead, the entire GOVERNANCE receivable will be measured at fair value through profit or loss. Management does not expect this to result in a significant impact on the measurement of the receivable. There will be no impact on the Group’s accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and the Group does not have any such liabilities. FINANCIAL DERECOGNITION The derecognition rules have been transferred from IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and have STATEMENTS not been changed. HEDGE ACCOUNTING The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Group’s risk management practices. At this stage the Group does not expect to designate any new hedge relationships except for the derivatives corresponding to purchase of property, plant and equipment. The Group’s existing hedge relationships qualify as continuing hedges upon the adoption of IFRS 9. As a consequence, the Group does not expect an impact on the accounting for its hedging relationships. IFRS 9 changes the accounting requirements for the time value of purchased options where only the intrinsic value of such options has been designated as the hedging instrument. In such cases, changes in the time value of options are initially recognised in OCI. Where the hedged item is transaction related, amounts initially recognised in OCI related to the change in the time value of options are reclassified to profit or loss or as a basis adjustment to non-financial assets or liabilities upon maturity of the hedged item, or, in the case of a hedged item that realises over time, the amounts initially recognised in OCI are amortised to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the life of the hedged item. Under IAS 39, the change in time value of options is recorded in the income statement. The initial credit adjustment from retained earnings to hedging reserve as at 1 January 2017 would be US$23.0 million and the adjustment decreasing financial cost for the year ended 31 December 2017 US$42.1 million. 194 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED (B) CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES CONTINUED IMPAIRMENT IFRS 9 requires the Group to now use an expected credit loss model for its trade receivables measured at amortised cost, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. Given the short-term nature of these receivables, the Group does not expect these changes will have a significant impact. PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and extent of the Group’s disclosures about its financial instruments particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard. IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers. The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer. The Group has evaluated recognition and measurement of revenue based on the five-step model in IFRS 15 and has not identified any financial impacts, hence no adjustments are expected to result from the adoption of IFRS 15. The Group has elected to adopt the new standard from 1 January 2018 applying the modified retrospective adoption method. Certain disclosures will change as a result of the requirements of IFRS 15. The Group expects this to include a breakdown of revenue from customers and revenue from other sources, including the movement in the value of embedded derivatives in sales contracts. IFRS 16 LEASES IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted. However, as there are several interactions between IFRS 16 and IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, early application is restricted to entities that also early adopt IFRS 15. The Group has decided to adopt the standard when it becomes effective. IFRIC 22 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND ADVANCE CONSIDERATION IFRIC 22 clarifies which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when payment is made or received in advance. The interpretation requires the company to determine a ‘date of transaction’ for the purposes of selecting an exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income. In the case that there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the entity should determine a date of the transaction for each flow of advance consideration. IFRIC 22 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted. The interpretation is not expected to have any impact in the financial information of the Group. IFRIC 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS This Interpretation clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. Application of tax law can be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain. The Group is working to identify potential uncertainties based on previous resolutions of tax authorities. IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier adoption is permitted. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective. 195 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 (C) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the consolidated financial statements. JUDGEMENTS Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are: • Determination of functional currency (note 2(d)): FRESNILLO The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be more than one currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. TODAY • Evaluation of the status of projects (note 2(e)): The evaluation of project status impacts the accounting for costs incurred and requires management judgement. This includes the assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals to justify the commencement of capitalisation of costs, the timing of the end of the exploration phase and the start of the development phase and the commencement of the production phase. These judgements directly impact the treatment of costs incurred and proceeds from the sale of metals from ore produced. STRATEGIC • Stripping costs (note 2(e)): The Group incurs waste removal costs (stripping costs) during the development and production phases of its surface mining REPORT operations. During the production phase, stripping costs (production stripping costs) can be incurred both in relation to the production of inventory in that period and the creation of improved access and mining flexibility in relation to ore to be mined in the future. The former are included as part of the costs of inventory, while the latter are capitalised as a stripping activity asset, where certain criteria are met. CORPORATE Once the Group has identified production stripping for a surface mining operation, judgement is required in identifying the separate components of the ore bodies for that operation, to which stripping costs should be allocated. Generally a component GOVERNANCE is a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. In identifying components of the ore body, the Group works closely with the mining operations personnel to analyse each of the mine plans. The mine plans and, therefore, the identification of components, will vary between mines for a number of reasons. These include, but are not limited to, the type of commodity, the geological characteristics of the ore body, the geographical location and/or financial considerations. The Group reassesses the components of ore bodies annually in line with the preparation of mine plans. In the current year, this reassessment did not give rise to any changes in the identification of components. FINANCIAL Once production stripping costs have been identified, judgement is also required to identify a suitable production measure STATEMENTS to be used to allocate production stripping costs between inventory and any stripping activity asset(s) for each component. The Group considers that the ratio of the expected tonnes of waste to be stripped for an expected tonnes of ore to be mined for a specific component of the ore body is the most suitable production measure. Furthermore, judgements and estimates are also used to apply the units of production method in determining the depreciable lives of the stripping activity asset(s). • Qualifying assets (note 2(e)): All interest-bearing loans are held by the parent company and were not obtained for any specific asset’s acquisition, construction, or production. Funds from these loans are transferred to subsidiaries to meet the strategic objectives of the Group or are otherwise held centrally. Due to this financing structure, judgement is required in determining whether those borrowings are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. Therefore, management determines whether borrowings are attributable to an asset or group of assets based on whether the investment in an operating or development stage project is classified as contributing to achieving the strategic growth of the Group. • Contingencies (note 26). By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. 196 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED (C) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include: • Estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources, note 2(e): Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s mining properties; mineral resources are an identified mineral occurrence with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating to the geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery rates, in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code 2012. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources is based upon factors such as geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body, estimates of commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, future capital requirements and production costs. As additional geological information is produced during the operation of a mine, the economic assumptions used and the estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources may change. Such changes may impact the Group’s reported balance sheet and income statement including: –– The carrying value of property, plant and equipment and mining properties may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows, which consider both ore reserves and mineral resources; –– Depreciation and amortisation charges in the income statement may change where such charges are determined using the unit-of-production method based on ore reserves; –– Stripping costs capitalised in the balance sheet, either as part of mine properties or inventory, or charged to profit or loss may change due to changes in stripping ratios; –– Provisions for mine closure costs may change where changes to the ore reserve and resources estimates affect expectations about when such activities will occur; and –– The recognition and carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes regarding the existence of such assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets. • Determination of useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes, notes 2(e) and 12: Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets. For depreciation calculated under the unit-of-production method, estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation and/or amortisation of mine-specific assets. The depreciation/amortisation charge is proportional to the depletion of the estimated remaining life of mine of production. Estimated useful lives of other assets are based on the expected usage of the asset. Each item’s life, which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to expectations of the use of the asset by the Group, including with reference to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the asset is used. • Silverstream, note 14: The valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires estimation by management. The term of the derivative is based on Sabinas life of mine and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates, including the estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources and future production profile of the Sabinas mine, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. For further details on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, see note 30. The impact of changes in silver price assumptions, foreign exchange, inflation and the discount rate is included in note 31. • Assessment of recoverability of property plant and equipment and impairment charges, note 2(f): The recoverability of an asset requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, reserves and resources and the associated production profiles, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. Changes in these assumptions will affect the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment. • Estimation of the mine closure costs, notes 2(l) and 21: Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine closure cost as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, the currency in which the cost will be incurred, technological changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, mine life and changes in discount rates. Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision at the balance sheet date represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future closure costs required. 197 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 • Income tax, notes 2(r) and 10: The recognition of deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. (D) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the parent company’s functional currency. The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. For all operating entities, this is US dollars. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate FRESNILLO ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary TODAY items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined. For entities with functional currencies other than US dollars as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at STRATEGIC the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in other comprehensive income. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income REPORT relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement. (E) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. The cost of CORPORATE self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. GOVERNANCE The cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset FINANCIAL when not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit-of-production calculations, are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated. The expected useful lives are as follows: STATEMENTS Years Buildings 6 Plant and equipment 4 Mining properties and development costs 1 16 Other assets 3 1 Depreciation of mining properties and development cost are determined using the unit-of-production method. An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising at de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is de-recognised. Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale. 198 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED (D) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION CONTINUED DISPOSAL OF ASSETS Gains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. MINING PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS Payments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when incurred. Purchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination. Mining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of time in which benefits are expected to be obtained from that specific concession. Mine development costs are capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced exploration phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been obtained pre-operative expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as a mine development cost. The initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation, the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost, and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. The Group cease the capitalisation of borrowing cost when the physical construction of the asset is complete and is ready for its intended use. Revenues from metals recovered from ore mined in the mine development phase, prior to commercial production, are credited to mining properties and development costs. Upon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate. Mining properties and mine development are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any. CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. The cost of construction in progress is not depreciated. SUBSEQUENT EXPENDITURES All subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced, is de-recognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred. STRIPPING COSTS In a surface mine operation, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste material in order to gain access to the ore bodies (stripping activity). During development and pre-production phases, the stripping activity costs are capitalised as part of the initial cost of development and construction of the mine (the stripping activity asset) and charged as depreciation or depletion to cost of sales, in the income statement, based on the mine’s units of production once commercial operations begin. Removal of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a surface mine. At the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the surface mine the activity is referred to as production stripping. Production stripping cost is capitalised only if the following criteria is met: • It is probable that the future economic benefits (improved access to an ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to the Group; • The Group can identify the component of an ore body for which access has been improved; and • The costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably. If not all of the criteria are met, the production stripping costs are charged to the income statement as operating costs as they are incurred. 199 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Stripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised into existing mining development assets, as mining properties and development cost, within property, plant and equipment, using a measure that considers the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production. This measure is known as ‘component stripping ratio’, which is revised annually in accordance with the mine plan. The amount capitalised is subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity asset, by using the units of production method. The identification of components and the expected useful lives of those components are evaluated annually. Depreciation is recognised as cost of sales in the income statement. The capitalised stripping activity asset is carried at cost less accumulated depletion/depreciation, less impairment, if any. Cost includes the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. The costs associated with incidental operations are excluded from the cost of the stripping activity asset. FRESNILLO In identifying components of the ore body, the Group works closely with the mining operations personnel for each mining operation to analyse each of the mine plans. Generally, a component will be a subset of the total ore body and a mine may have several TODAY components that are identified based on the mine plan. The mine plans and therefore the identification of components can vary between mines for a number of reasons including but not limited to, the type of commodity, the geological characteristics of the ore body, the geographical location and/or financial considerations. (F) IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS The carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate STRATEGIC that the carrying value may not be recoverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether REPORT carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level. If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to CORPORATE reflect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. GOVERNANCE THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF AN ASSET The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Fair value less cost of disposal is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in an orderly sale transaction between market participants. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable FINANCIAL amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. The Group’s cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other STATEMENTS assets or groups of assets. REVERSAL OF IMPAIRMENT An assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement. (G) FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; held to maturity investments; available-for-sale financial assets; or loans and receivables or derivatives designated as hedging instruments, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. 200 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED (G) FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets or liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the short term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39. Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value, presented as finance costs or finance income in the income statement. LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or availablefor-sale. After initial measurement, such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Gains or losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Non-current receivables are stated at amortised cost. Loans and receivables from contractors are carried at amortised cost. LOANS AND BORROWINGS After initial recognition at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss, in the income statement, when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. The Group adjusts the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The carrying amount is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense. This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. For more information, refer to note 20. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held to maturity investments. Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore, a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is de-recognised. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense. DE-RECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement. 201 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 (H) IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. ASSETS CARRIED AT AMORTISED COST If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no FRESNILLO objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively TODAY assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does STRATEGIC not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. REPORT In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are de recognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. CORPORATE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS If an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal GOVERNANCE payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Group considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged, by considering the size of the decline in this value, the historic volatility in changes in fair value and the duration of the sustained decline. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. FINANCIAL (I) INVENTORIES Finished goods, work in progress and ore stockpile inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. STATEMENTS Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs. For this purpose, the costs of production include: • personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore; • the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and • related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). Operating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. An allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent of such an allowance. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. (J) SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS Where the Group invests in short-term instruments which are either not readily convertible into known amounts of cash or are subject to risk of changes in value that are not insignificant, these instruments are classified as short-term investments. Short-term investments are classified as loans and receivables. 202 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED (K) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and four months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. (L) PROVISIONS MINE CLOSURE COST A provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure, restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas) based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and is depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations. Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, the portion of the increase is charged directly as an expense. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss. (M) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Group operates the following plans: DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN This funded plan is based on each employee’s earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico until it was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. The plan is denominated in Mexican Pesos. For members as at 30 June 2007, benefits were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI). The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss. Past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the benefits have already vested following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, the past service cost is recognised immediately. The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan. Net interest cost is recognised in finance cost and return on plan assets (other than amounts reflected in net interest cost) is recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due. The contributions are based on the employee’s salary. This plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme. 203 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SENIORITY PREMIUM FOR VOLUNTARY SEPARATION This unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service. For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary. The cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur. OTHER Benefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies. FRESNILLO Termination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred. TODAY (N) EMPLOYEE PROFIT SHARING In accordance with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing (PTU) equivalent to 10% of the taxable income of each fiscal year. PTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year, considering their most recent salaries. The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement. PTU, STRATEGIC paid in each fiscal year, is considered deductible for income tax purposes. REPORT (O) LEASES The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date including whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: a) There is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement; CORPORATE b) A renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term; GOVERNANCE c) There is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment is dependent on a specified asset; or d) There is a substantial change to the asset. GROUP AS A LESSEE Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum FINANCIAL lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in the income statement. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there STATEMENTS is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. GROUP AS A LESSOR Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned. Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b) above. For arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2005, the date of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2007, in accordance with the transitional requirements of IFRIC 4. 204 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED (P) REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates and other sales taxes. SALE OF GOODS Revenue is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. The Group recognises revenue on a provisional basis at the time concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are delivered to the customer’s smelter or refinery, using the Group’s best estimate of contained metal. Revenue is subject to adjustment once the analysis of the product samples is completed, contract conditions have been fulfilled and final settlement terms are agreed. Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined. In addition, sales of concentrates and precipitates throughout each calendar month, as well as doré bars that are delivered after the 20th day of each month, are ‘provisionally priced’ subject to a final adjustment based on the average price for the month following the delivery to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. Doré bars that are delivered in the first 20 days of each month are finally priced in the month of delivery. For sales of goods that are subject to provisional pricing, revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met using the provisional price. The price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract. At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotation period stipulated in the contract until the quotation period ends. The selling price of the metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges. The revaluing of provisionally priced contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue. The customer deducts treatment and refining charges before settlement. Therefore, the fair value of consideration received for the sale of goods is net of those charges. The Group recognises in selling expenses a levy in respect of the Extraordinary Mining Right as sales of gold and silver are recognised. The Extraordinary Mining Right consists of a 0.5% rate, applicable to the owners of mining titles. The payment must be calculated over the total sales of all mining concessions. The payment of this mining right must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year and can be credited against corporate income tax. The Group also recognises in selling expenses a discovery premium royalty equivalent to 1% of the value of the mineral extracted and sold during the year from certain mining titles granted by the Mexican Geological Survey (SGM) in the San Julián mine. The premium is settled to SGM on a quarterly basis. OTHER INCOME Other income is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. (Q) EXPLORATION EXPENSES Exploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. Exploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions: • Cost of sales: costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life; and • Exploration expenses: –– Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves; and –– Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which are identified by project. Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. 205 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 (R) TAXATION CURRENT INCOME TAX Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the country the Group operates. DEFERRED INCOME TAX Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: • Where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and FRESNILLO • In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary TODAY differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except: • Where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an STRATEGIC asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and REPORT • In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no CORPORATE longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. GOVERNANCE Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. FINANCIAL Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity and not in STATEMENTS the income statement. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. MINING RIGHTS The Special Mining Right is considered an income tax under IFRS and states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities. The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences arising in the determination of the Special Mining Right (see note 10). SALES TAX Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, except: • When the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable; and • When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included. The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. 206 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED (S) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING The Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodities price which impact its financial and business transactions. Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The full fair value of a derivative is classified as non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the item is more than 12 months. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, European foreign exchange options are valued using the Black Scholes model. The Silverstream contract is valued using a Net Present Value valuation approach. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for the undertaken hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: CASH FLOW HEDGES For derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded as in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains or losses related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk these are included, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised directly as finance costs, in the income statement of the related period. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in other comprehensive income from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement. When hedging with options, the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge relationship. The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation. Changes in fair value of time value is recognised in the income statement in finance costs. EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives. 207 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 (T) BORROWING COSTS Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 12 or more months to get ready for its intended use or sale (a qualifying asset) are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available for a short term from funds borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. FRESNILLO (U) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments TODAY measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 30 and 31. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: • In the principal market for the asset or liability; or STRATEGIC • In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. REPORT The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. CORPORATE A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset GOVERNANCE in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the FINANCIAL fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. STATEMENTS Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 30. (V) DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s shareholders or Board as appropriate. Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s subsidiaries. 208 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3. SEGMENT REPORTING For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines. At 31 December 2017, the Group has seven reportable operating segments as follows: • The Fresnillo mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine; • The Saucito mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine; • The Ciénega mine, located in the state of Durango, an underground gold mine; including the San Ramón satellite mine; • The Herradura mine, located in the state of Sonora, a surface gold mine; • The Soledad-Dipolos mine, located in the state of Sonora, a surface gold mine; • The Noche Buena mine, located in state of Sonora, a surface gold mine; and • The San Julián mine, located on the border of Chihuahua/Durango states, an underground silver-gold mine. Phase one of San Julián mine commenced commercial production in the third quarter of 2016 and phase two in the third quarter of 2017. The operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group’s chief operating decision-maker does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this information. Management monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making decisions about resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within cost of sales and gross profit which are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines. The table below provides a reconciliation from segment profit to gross profit as per the consolidated income statement. Other income and expenses included in the consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments.

On the basis of management’s internal forecast, a deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses amounting STATEMENTS to US$227.4 million (2016: US$221.1 million).

(D) UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX ON INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE CONTINUED (E) CORPORATE INCOME TAX (‘IMPUESTO SOBRE LA RENTA’ OR ‘ISR’) AND SPECIAL MINING RIGHT (‘SMR’) The Group’s principal operating subsidiaries are Mexican residents for taxation purposes. The rate of current corporate income tax is 30%. During 2016 the Mexican Internal Revenue Law granted to taxpayers a credit in respect of an excise tax (Special Tax on Production and Services, or IEPS for its acronym in Spanish) paid when purchasing diesel used for general machinery and certain mining vehicles. The credit can be applied against either the Group’s own corporate income tax or the income tax withheld from third parties. The credit is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis and expires one year after the purchase of the diesel. In the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group applied a credit of US$23.2 million (2016: US$19.1 million) in respect of the year and recognised a deferred tax asset of US$2.9 million (2016: US$4.8 million) in respect of the IEPS incurred in 2017 and expected to be applied during 2018. As the IEPS deduction is itself taxable, the deferred tax asset is recognised at 70% of the IEPS carried forward. The net amount applied by the Group is presented in the reconciliation of the effective tax rate in note 10(b). The SMR states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities and is considered as income tax under IFRS. The SMR allows as a credit the payment of mining concessions rights up to the amount of SMR payable The 7.5% tax apply to a base of income before interest, annual inflation adjustment, taxes paid on the regular activity, depreciation and amortisation, as defined by the new ISR. This SMR can be credited against the corporate income tax of the same fiscal year and its payment must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year. 11. EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period.

(2016: Juanicipio development project). During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group capitalised US$11.4 million of borrowing costs within construction in progress (2016: US$18.2 million). Borrowing costs were capitalised at the rate of 5.78% (2016: 5.78%). SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS As at 31 December 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount of mining assets was fully supported by the higher of value in use and fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) computation of their recoverable amount. Value in use and FVLCD was determined based on the net present value of the future estimated cash flows expected to be generated from the continued use of the CGUs. For both valuation approaches management used price assumptions of US$1,300/ounce and US$19/ounce (2016: US$1,250/ounce and US$18/ounce) for gold and silver, respectively. Management considers that the models supporting the carrying amounts are most sensitive to commodity price assumptions and have therefore performed a sensitivity analysis for those CGUs, where a reasonable possible change in prices could lead to impairment. Management has considered a low sensitivity by decreasing gold and silver prices by 5% (2016: gold and silver 10%) and a high sensitivity by decreasing gold and silver prices by 10% (2016: gold 15% and silver 20%). As at 31 December 2017 no impairment resulted in those CGU tested (2016: San Julián US$84.3 million under high sensitivity; US$nil under low sensitivity and Herradura US$109.6 million under high sensitivity; US$nil under low sensitivity). 13.

At 31 December 2017, several investments in quoted shares were valued below the cost paid by the Group. This decrease has continued throughout the past 12-month period, which is considered to be prolonged, therefore an impairment of US$0.04 million was recognised as other expenses in the income statement. During 2016 no impairment arose on the investment in quoted shares. The fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market. 219 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 14. SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT On 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Peñoles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Peñoles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine (‘Sabinas’), a base metals mine owned and operated by the Peñoles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million. In addition, a per ounce cash payment of US$2.00 in years one to five and US$5.00 thereafter (subject to an inflationary adjustment that commenced from 31 December 2013) is payable to Peñoles. The cash payment per ounce for the year ended 31 December 2017 was US$5.20 per ounce (2016: US$5.15 per ounce). Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Peñoles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver. If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Peñoles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall. The Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at fair value and classified within non-current and current assets as appropriate. The term of the derivative is based on Sabinas life of mine which is FRESNILLO currently 38 years. Changes in the contract’s fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2017 TODAY total proceeds received in cash were US$43.3 million (2016: US$47.5 million) of which, US$5.9 million was in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2016 (2015: US$2.8 million). Cash received in respect of the year of US$37.3 million (2016: US$44.8 million) corresponds to 3.6 million ounces of payable silver (2016: 3.8 million ounces). As at 31 December 2017, a further US$4.9 million (2016: US$5.9 million) of cash receivable corresponding to 422,375 ounces of silver is due (2016: 538,756 ounces). The US$113.6 million unrealised gain recorded in the income statement (2016: US$133.5 million gain) resulted from the STRATEGIC updating of assumptions used to value the Silverstream contract. The most significant of these were the increase in the Sabinas mine silver reserves and resources, the unwinding of the discount, an increase in the forward price of silver, and the difference REPORT between the payments already received during the year ended 31 December 2017 and payments estimated in the valuation model as of 31 December 2016.

PLEDGE ON ASSETS: The Group shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key CORPORATE assets). Nevertheless, the Group may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets. 21. PROVISION FOR MINE CLOSURE COST GOVERNANCE The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the estimated date of depletion of mine deposits. Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning, dismantling, reclamation alternatives, timing, and the discount, foreign exchange and inflation rates applied. FINANCIAL During the year, the Group refined its estimation of costs by further analysing the currency in which costs will be incurred. The STATEMENTS Group has performed separate calculations of the provision by currency, discounting at corresponding rates. As at 31 December 2017, the discount rates used in the calculation of the parts of the provision that relate to Mexican pesos range from 6.27% to 7.97% (2016: range of 6.61% to 7.74%). The range for the current year parts that relate to US dollars range from 1.37% to 2.22% (2016: not applicable). Mexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to regulations in many other jurisdictions. It is the Group’s intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law, and estimated costs reflect this level of expense. The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the life of the mines. 224 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 21. PROVISION FOR MINE CLOSURE COST CONTINUED The provision is expected to become payable at the end of the production life of each mine, based on the reserves and resources, which ranges from three to 27 years from 31 December 2017 (three to 27 years from 31 December 2016).

PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS The Group has a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan. The defined contribution plan was established as from 1 July 2007 and consists of periodic contributions made by each nonunionised worker and contributions made by the Group to the fund matching workers’ contributions, capped at 8% of the employee’s annual salary. The defined benefit plan provides pension benefits based on each worker’s earnings and years of services provided by personnel hired through 30 June 2007 as well as statutory seniority premiums for both unionised and non-unionised workers. The overall investment policy and strategy for the Group’s defined benefit plan is guided by the objective of achieving an investment return which, together with contributions, ensures that there will be sufficient assets to pay pension benefits and statutory seniority premiums for non-unionised workers as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks of the plan. However, the portion of the plan related to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers is not funded. The investment strategies for the plan are generally managed under local laws and regulations. The actual asset allocation is determined by current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. Within this framework, the Group ensures that the trustees consider how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the respective potential impact on the funded status of the plan, including potential short-term liquidity requirements. Death and disability benefits are covered through insurance policies. 225 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 The following tables provide information relating to changes in the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets: Pension cost charge to income statement Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI Return on plan assets Actuarial Actuarial (excluding changes changes Defined amounts arising from arising from benefit Balance at Sub-total included changes in changes in Sub-total increase due Balance at 1 January Net Foreign recognised Benefits in net demographic financial Experience Foreign included Contributions to personnel 31 December 2017 Service cost Interest exchange in the year paid interest) assumptions assumptions adjustments exchange in OCI by employer transfer 2017 US$ thousands Defined benefit obligation (25,377) (956) (1,729) (1,146) (3,831) 883 – – 515 498 – 1,013 – (15) (27,327) Fair value of plan FRESNILLO assets 16,282 – 1,031 731 1,762 (413) (80) – – – – (80) 422 137 18,110 Net benefit TODAY liability (9,095) (956) (698) (415) (2,069) 470 (80) – 515 498 – 933 422 122 (9,217) Pension cost charge to income statement Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI STRATEGIC Return on plan assets Actuarial Actuarial (excluding changes changes Defined REPORT amounts arising from arising from benefit Balance at Sub-total included changes in changes in Sub-total increase due Balance at 1 January Net Foreign recognised Benefits in net demographic financial Experience Foreign included Contributions to personnel 31 December 2016 Service cost Interest exchange in the year paid interest) assumptions assumptions adjustments exchange in OCI by employer transfer 2016 US$ thousands Defined benefit obligation (32,165) (649) (1,803) 5,573 3,121 816 – (744) 2,636 1,103 – 2,995 – (144) (25,377) CORPORATE Fair value of plan GOVERNANCE assets 17,631 – 927 (3,003) (2,076) (432) (552) – – – – (552) 1,570 141 16,282 Net benefit liability (14,534) (649) (876) 2,570 1,045 384 (552) (744) 2,636 1,103 – 2,443 1,570 (3) (9,095) Of the total defined benefit obligation, US$7.5 million (2016: US$6.7 million) relates to statutory seniority premiums for FINANCIAL unionised workers which are not funded.

These leases have renewal terms at the option of the lessee with future lease payments based on market prices at the time of renewal. TODAY There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases. The Group has put in place several arrangements to finance mine equipment through loans and the sale of mine equipment to contractors. In both cases, contractors are obligated to use these assets in rendering services to the Group as part of the mining work contract, during the term of financing or credit, which ranges from two to six years. The Group considers that the related mining work contracts contain embedded operating leases. STRATEGIC The future minimum rental commitments under these leases are as follows: REPORT As at 31 December 2017 2016 US$ thousands US$ thousands Within one year 3,424 6,790 After one year but not more than five years 1,538 3,399 4,962 10,189 CORPORATE As at 31 December GOVERNANCE 2017 2016 US$ thousands US$ thousands Minimum lease payments expensed in the year 4,916 4,142 26. CONTINGENCIES FINANCIAL As of 31 December 2017, the Group has the following contingencies: • The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. STATEMENTS • Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities (SAT, by its Spanish acronym) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, the reviews may cover longer periods. As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future. • There are currently a number of ongoing tax inspections that have been initiated by the SAT. No findings or claims have been communicated to the Company in respect of these, other than relating to Penmont as discussed below. It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. 228 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 26. CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED • With regards to Penmont tax audits, which commenced during 2015, the Company considers it completed the provision of all documentation required in order to demonstrate that all the 2012-2013 non-taxable income and tax deductions which are being challenged, are appropriate. Penmont formally filed a writ before the Mexican Taxpayers Ombudsman (PRODECON, per its Spanish acronym) requesting a conclusive agreement in the matter. SAT’s first, second and third response to the request detailed that, while the documentation provided was sufficient to demonstrate that all of non-taxable income and the majority of the tax deductions are correct, there are still two tax deductions to be approved. In this sense, discussion with the SAT continue, and as long as the conclusive agreement is still in progress, the current auditing process is suspended and the tax authorities cannot determine a tax deficiency until PRODECON issues the final agreement under the terms agreed between Penmont and the SAT. • On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate. • Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to: (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission; and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ tax consolidation pays an intra-Group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ or ‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an amount in respect of that tax. • On 30 November 2012, the Mexican government enacted a new federal labour law. During 2014 management implemented certain actions as a part of an ongoing process in order to manage the exposure resulting from the issuance of the new labour law including any potential impacts on the operations and financial position of the Group, however, management does not expect any potential contingency or significant effect on the Group’s financial statements as at 31 December 2017 and going forward. • New income tax and VAT legislation in respect of contractors came into effect on 1 January 2017, requiring management to ensure that contractors are compliant with their own tax obligations, including employment tax. This has created a new obligation for Fresnillo to obtain and retain sufficient evidence of contractors’ fiscal compliance in order to deduct costs related to the contractors for income tax purposes and to recover input VAT. In late 2017, the 2018 Federal Revenue Law clarified that if the online portal (established by the tax authorities to facilitate compliance) is used in 2018, it would be sufficient to discharge any 2017 compliance obligations. Management considers that it is well progressed in meeting its obligations for 2017 and does not consider that any significant economic exposure will arise as a result of this new legislation with respect to the current year. • In regard to the ejido El Bajío matter previously reported by the Company: –– In 2009 five members of the El Bajío agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont (‘Penmont’), submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court (Tribunal Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo, Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of the Soledad-Dipolos mine are located. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1,824 hectares of land. The disputed land was returned in July 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. –– The Agrarian Court noted in that same year that certain remediation activities were necessary to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) in this respect. The Agrarian Court further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling determining, amongst other aspects, that Penmont must remediate the lands to the state they were in before Penmont’s occupation. –– In the opinion of the Company, this procedural order was excessive since this level of remediation was not part of the original agrarian ruling and also because the procedural order appeared not to consider the fact that Penmont conducted its activities pursuant to valid mining concessions and environmental impact permits. In December 2016, the Agrarian Court issued a subsequent procedural order in which the Court recognised that Penmont complied with the agrarian ruling by having returned the land in dispute and, furthermore, that remediation activities are to be conducted in accordance with Federal environmental guidelines and regulations, as supervised by the competent Federal authorities. Remediation activities in this respect are pending as the agrarian members have not yet permitted Penmont physical access to the lands. Penmont has already presented a conceptual mine closure and remediation plan before the Agrarian Court in respect of the approximately 300 hectares where Penmont conducted mining activities. The agrarian community Ejido El Bajío appealed this procedural order from the Agrarian Court and a Federal District Court denied this appeal. The agrarian community has presented in the month of August 2017 a further and last recourse against this ruling by the Federal District Court and the final result is pending. 229 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 –– In addition, and as also previously reported by the Company, claimants in the El Bajío matter presented other claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels separate from the land described above. Penmont has no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont. As previously reported, the Agrarian Court issued rulings declaring such occupation agreements over those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate such lands to the state that they were in before Penmont’s occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from this area. Given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or has specific geological interest in these land parcels, any contingency relating to such land parcels is not considered material by the Company. The case relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to finalisation. –– Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in the El Bajío matter. There remains significant uncertainty as to the finalisation and ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings. 27.

The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective STRATEGIC currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency. REPORT OPTION COMMODITY CONTRACTS The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option CORPORATE contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity. SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT GOVERNANCE The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model including unobservable inputs (Level 3). This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and/or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the FINANCIAL future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican peso and US dollar, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable STATEMENTS silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Peñoles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company. The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the latest plan and estimates, also provided to the Company by Peñoles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described above, and determines their impact on the total fair value. The significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated. The fair value of the Silverstream is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in future exchange rates, however, it is to a reasonable change in future silver price, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. For further information relating to the Silverstream contract see note 14. The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, inflation and the discount rate is disclosed in note 31. 236 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED (B) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT CONTINUED QUOTED INVESTMENTS: The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. (Level 1) INTEREST-BEARING LOANS The fair value of the Group’s interest-bearing loan, is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. (Level 1) EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES WITHIN SALES CONTRACTS: Sales of concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are ‘provisionally priced’ and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price and the Group’s best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery (see note 2(p)). This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and is separated from the sales contract. At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to this valuation (Level 3). At 31 December 2017 the fair value of embedded derivatives within sales contracts was US$6.5 million (2016: US$(2.7) million). The revaluation effects of embedded derivatives arising from these sales contracts are recorded as an adjustment to revenues. (C) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos and other currencies. The Group also enters into option contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price risk as described in note 2(s).

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT STATEMENTS OVERVIEW The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, cash, available-forsale financial assets, interest-bearing loans and trade payables. The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: • Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks; • Credit risk; and • Liquidity risk. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. 238 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED OVERVIEW CONTINUED (A) MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. In the following tables, the effect on equity excludes the changes in retained earnings as a direct result of changes in profit before tax. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican peso, euro and Swedish krona which are exposed to foreign currency risk. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services, fixed assets, spare parts and the payment of dividends. As a result, the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso. In order to manage the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts with maturity dates from 2018 (see note 30 for additional detail). The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Group’s profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments.

These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles. FINANCIAL The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge against an element of gold, zinc and lead price. The table below reflects the aggregate sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible STATEMENTS change in commodities prices, reflecting the impact on the Group’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant.

Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interest-bearing loans and loans from related parties are excluded from the table below. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, the Silverstream contract and available-for-sale financial assets. STATEMENTS The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter-party. The Group’s financial assets are with counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 27, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Group’s financial assets were neither impaired nor past due, other than ‘Other receivables’ as disclosed in note 16. The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings. The Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty Met-Mex Peñoles, the Group’s primary customer throughout 2017 and 2016. A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract. Both Met-Mex and the counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Peñoles group which currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and is considered by management to be of appropriate credit rating. 242 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED OVERVIEW CONTINUED (B) CREDIT RISK CONTINUED The Group’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments investing in a number of financial institutions. Accordingly, on an ongoing basis the Group deposits surplus funds with a range of financial institutions, depending on market conditions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Group only deposits surplus funds with financial institutions with a credit rating of MX-1 (Moody’s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor’s) and above. As at 31 December 2017, the Group had concentrations of credit risk as 23% of surplus funds were deposited with one financial institution of which 17% was held in short-term Mexican government paper. The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 13 for the maximum credit exposure to available-for-sale financial assets, note 17 for short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents and note 27 for related party balances with Met-Mex. The maximum credit exposure with relation to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2017, being US$538.9 million (2016: US$467.5 million). (C) LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows from operations and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATE The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain GOVERNANCE interest-bearing loans, including loans from related parties, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains or losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder’s capital invested in the Group management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Group’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream.

CORPORATE INFORMATION Fresnillo plc (the ’Company’) is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 5. The Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes with tax residency in Mexico City. For further information see note 4. Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C.V. (‘Peñoles’) currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baillères family, whose beneficial interest is held through Peñoles. The country of incorporation of Peñoles is Mexico. Copies of Peñoles’ accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. The primary activity of the Company is as holding company for the Fresnillo Group of companies, see note 5. The financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 26 February 2018. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (A) BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial instruments which have been measured at fair value. The financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000) except when otherwise indicated. The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated. (B) CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the separate financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016. NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS (NEW STANDARDS) ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY The Company has adopted from 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 7. The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The Company also has adopted Amendments to IAS 12. The amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. They also clarify certain other aspects of accounting for deferred tax assets. This amendment had no impact in the financial information of the Company. Other than the above mentioned amendment there were no significant new standards that the Company was required to adopt effective from 1 January 2017. STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Company’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Company intends to adopt these standards, as applicable to the Company’s financial statements, when they become effective, except where indicated. IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. The Company has decided not to adopt IFRS 9 until it becomes mandatory on 1 January 2018. The Company does not expect the new guidance to have a significant impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets for the following reasons: CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT The equity instruments that are currently classified as available-for-sale financial assets satisfy the conditions for classification as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Under IFRS 9, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are not recycled to the income statement. There are no other significant changes to the accounting for these assets. There will be no impact on the Company’s accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and the Group does not have any such liabilities. DERECOGNITION The derecognition rules have been transferred from IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and have not been changed. 249 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 IMPAIRMENT IFRS 9 requires the Company to now use an expected credit loss model for its trade receivables measured at amortised cost, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. Given the short-term nature of these receivables, the Company does not expect these changes will have a significant impact. Regarding loans receivables the Company has evaluated the expect credit loss on a 12-month basis. No material loss has been determined. PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and extent of the Company’s disclosures about its financial instruments particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard. IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers. The new revenue FRESNILLO standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. TODAY The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer. In the case of royalties the revenue is recognised based on the sales-or usage-based royalties criteria. The Company has evaluated recognition and measurement of revenue based on the five-step model in IFRS 15 and has not identified any financial impacts, hence no adjustments are expected to result from the adoption of IFRS 15. The Company has elected to adopt the new standard from 1 January 2018 applying the modified retrospective adoption method. STRATEGIC IFRS 16 LEASES IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with REPORT a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted. However, as there CORPORATE are several interactions between IFRS 16 and IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, early application is restricted to entities that also early adopt IFRS 15. The Company has decided to adopt the standard when it became effective. IFRIC 22 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND ADVANCE CONSIDERATION GOVERNANCE IFRIC 22 clarifies which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when payment is made or received in advance. The interpretation requires the Company to determine a ‘date of transaction’ for the purposes of selecting an exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income. In case there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the entity should determine a date of the transaction for each flow of advance consideration. IFRIC 22 is applicable for FINANCIAL annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted. The interpretation is not expected to have any impact in the financial information of the Company. IFRIC 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS STATEMENTS This Interpretation clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. Application of tax law can be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain. The Company is working to identify potential uncertainties based on previous resolutions of tax authorities. IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier adoption is permitted. The IASB has issued other amendments to standards, including those resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company. The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective. (C) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is in the accounting policies and the notes to the financial statements. 250 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED (C) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED JUDGEMENTS Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: • Determination of functional currency (note 2(d)): The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be more than one currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. • Contingencies (note 13): By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the financial information statements include: • Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets (notes 2(g) and 6): The Company classifies certain financial asset as available-for-sale and recognises movements in their fair value in equity. When the fair value declines, management makes an assessment of the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should be recognised in profit or loss. • Impairment and subsequent reversal of impairment of investments in subsidiaries (notes 2(e) and 5): The Company assesses investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and the value in use. Due to the nature of the subsidiaries, the assessment of the recoverable amount is generally determined based on the net present value of future cash flows related to the subsidiaries requiring the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, reserves and resources and the associate production profiles, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. These cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The determination of that rate requires certain judgements. Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge. At 31 December 2017 the Company reversed impairment losses of US$102.8 million (2016: US$997.9 million) to recognised a cumulative impairment relating to subsidiaries of US$436.4 million (2016: US$539.2 million). (D) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The Company’s financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined. (E) INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES Subsidiaries are entities which the Company controls due to it being exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. Impairment charges and reversals, up to the value of the merger reserve, are reclassified from retained earnings to the merger reserve. When the Company increases its capital investment in or where there is a return of share capital from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised as an addition to, or return of the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries. 251 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The Company usually determines fair value based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount. Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. (F) FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FRESNILLO Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held to maturity investments; or available-for-sale TODAY financial assets, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, STRATEGIC or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. REPORT Financial assets are offset with liabilities and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. CORPORATE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value transactions GOVERNANCE through profit and loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets or liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments, as defined by IAS 39. Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. LOANS AND RECEIVABLES FINANCIAL Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or availableSTATEMENTS for-sale. After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Non-current receivables are stated at amortised cost. LOANS AND BORROWINGS After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. The Company adjusts the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The carrying amount is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense. This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans. For more information refer note 11. 252 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED (F) FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held-to-maturity investments. Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses being recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is derecognised. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense. DE-RECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement. (G) IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. ASSETS CARRIED AT AMORTISED COST If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS If an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Company considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged by considering the size of the decline in this value, the historic volatility in changes in fair value and the duration of the sustained decline. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. 253 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 (H) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and four months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. (I) SHARE CAPITAL Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue. The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue. (J) REVENUE RECOGNITION FRESNILLO Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other TODAY sales taxes. TRADEMARK ROYALTIES Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received STRATEGIC INTEREST INCOME Interest income is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method; i.e. the rate that exactly discounts REPORT estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset). DIVIDEND INCOME Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established. CORPORATE (K) INCOME TAX GOVERNANCE CURRENT INCOME TAX Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. DEFERRED INCOME TAX FINANCIAL Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: STATEMENTS • Where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and • In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: • Where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and • In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 254 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED (K) INCOME TAX CONTINUED Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. (L) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodity prices which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. In the Group’s consolidated financial statements certain of these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company’s stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges. Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives. (M) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 17 and 18. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: • In the principal market for the asset or liability; or • In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 255 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. FRESNILLO For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the TODAY nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 17. (N) DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. STRATEGIC Mexican Income Tax Law establishes a 10% withholding on earnings from 2014 and thereafter, for dividends paid to foreign REPORT residents and Mexican individuals. Dividends paid are not subject to income tax if paid from the Net Tax Profit Account (CUFIN). Dividends paid that exceed CUFIN are subject to an income tax payable at a rate of 30%. The tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against the normal income tax payable by the Company in the year in which the dividends are paid or in the following two years. Dividends CORPORATE paid from earnings previously taxed are not subject to any withholding or additional tax payment. GOVERNANCE 3.

The Company has calculated the recoverable amount of its investments in subsidiaries as at 31 December 2017 and as a result has recognised a reversal of previously recognised impairment loss amounting to US$102.8 million (2016: US$997.9 million). The recoverable amount was estimated based on the Fair Value Less Cost of Disposal (FVLCD) model (2016: FVLCD). The following tables provide relevant information in respect of each impaired subsidiary: Year ended 31 December 2017 Current year Cumulative Impairment reversal Impairment Recoverable amount US$ thousand US$ thousand US$ thousands Discount rate Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V.

(8,042) 75,663 146,670 Post-tax 5.02% (102,789) 436,454 In determining FVLCD it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate future cash flows including reserves and resources volumes and related production profile, price assumptions, cost estimates and discount rate. Accordingly, the fair value is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The price assumptions used to calculate FVLCD are determined with reference analysts’ consensus of long-term prices. As at 31 December 2017, the Company used price assumptions of US$1,300/ounce and US$19/ounce for gold and silver, respectively. 257 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Year ended 31 December 2016 Current year impairment reversal Cumulative impairment Recoverable amount US$ thousand US$ thousand US$ thousands Discount rate Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V.

Management considers FRESNILLO that the model supporting the determination of FVLCD is most sensitive to commodity price assumptions. The price assumptions TODAY used to calculate FVLCD are determined with reference analysts’ consensus of long-term prices. As at 31 December 2016, the Company used price assumptions of US$1,250/ounce and US$18/ounce for gold and silver, respectively. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS As at 31 December 2017 management has performed a sensitivity analysis for those subsidiaries where cumulative impairment may be affected by a reasonably possible change in silver and gold prices. Management has considered a decrease in silver and gold of 10% (2016: 20% and 15%, respectively). The sensitivity resulted in an additional impairment on Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V. STRATEGIC of US$448.2 million (2016: US$622.3 million), Minera Mexicana la Ciénega, S.A. de C.V. US$110.6 million (2016: US$85.7 million) and Minera Saucito, S.A. de C.V.

At 31 December 2017, several investments in quoted shares were valued below the cost paid by the Group. This decrease has been continued throughout the past 12-month period, which is considered to be prolonged, therefore an impairment of US$0.04 million was recognised as other expenses in the income statement. During 2016 no impairment arose based on the investment in quoted shares. The fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market. 7.

INTEREST-BEARING LOANS SENIOR NOTES On 13 November 2013, the Group completed its offering of an aggregate principal amount of US$800 million of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023 (the ‘Notes’). An analysis of the debt recognised in the balance sheet is as follows: As at 31 December 2017 2016 US$ thousands US$ thousands Opening balance 798,027 797,032 Accrued interest 46,267 46,267 Interest paid 1 (46,267) (46,267) Amortisation of discount and transaction costs 1,019 995 Closing balance 799,046 798,027 1 Accrued interest is payable semi-annually on 13 May and 13 November. The Group has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of the senior notes (the ‘Notes’): CHANGE OF CONTROL: Should the rating of the senior Notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or more of the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation process; or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Group is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earnt at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor. PLEDGE ON ASSETS: The Group shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key assets). Nevertheless, the Group may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets. 12.

CONTINGENCIES As of 31 December 2017 the Company has the following contingencies: • The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. • Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of the corporate income tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future. • There are currently a number of ongoing tax inspections that have been initiated by the SAT in respect of certain subsidiaries of the Company. No findings or claims have been communicated to the Company in respect of these, other than relating to Penmont as discussed below. It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid FRESNILLO or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. • With regards to Penmont tax audits, which commenced during 2015, the Company considers it completed the provision of TODAY all documentation required in order to demonstrate that all the 2012-2013 non-taxable income and tax deductions which are being challenged, are appropriate. Penmont formally filed a writ before the Mexican Taxpayers Ombudsman (PRODECON per its Spanish acronym) requesting a conclusive agreement in the matter. SAT’s first, second and third response to the request detailed that, while the documentation provided was sufficient to demonstrate that all of non-taxable income and the majority of the tax deductions are correct, there are still two tax deductions to be approved. In this sense, discussion with the SAT continue, and as long as the conclusive agreement is still in progress, the current auditing process is suspended and STRATEGIC the tax authorities cannot determine a tax deficiency until PRODECON issues the final agreement under the terms agreed between Penmont and the SAT. REPORT • On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement relates to the separation of the Fresnillo Group (the ’Group’) and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the CORPORATE precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection GOVERNANCE with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate. • Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to: (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission; and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities FINANCIAL and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ STATEMENTS tax consolidation pays an intra-Group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ or ‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an amount in respect of that tax. • New income tax and VAT legislation in respect of contractors came into effect on 1 January 2017, requiring management to ensure that contractors are compliant with their own tax obligations, including employment tax. This has created a new obligation for Fresnillo to obtain and retain sufficient evidence of contractors’ fiscal compliance in order to deduct costs related to the contractors for income tax purposes and to recover input VAT. In late 2017, the 2018 Federal Revenue Law clarified that if the online portal (established by the tax authorities to facilitate compliance) is used in 2018, it would be sufficient to discharge any 2017 compliance obligations. Management considers that it is well progressed in meeting its obligations for 2017 and does not consider that any significant economic exposure will arise as a result of this new legislation with respect to the current year. • In regard to the ejido El Bajío matter previously reported by the Company: –– In 2009 five members of the El Bajío agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont (‘Penmont’), submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court (Tribunal Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo, Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of the Soledad-Dipolos mine are located. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1,824 hectares of land. The disputed land was returned in July 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad‑Dipolos. 262 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 13. CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED –– The Agrarian Court noted in that same year that certain remediation activities were necessary to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) in this respect. The Agrarian Court further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling determining, amongst other aspects, that Penmont must remediate the lands to the state they were in before Penmont’s occupation. –– In the opinion of the Company, this procedural order was excessive since this level of remediation was not part of the original agrarian ruling and also because the procedural order appeared not to consider the fact that Penmont conducted its activities pursuant to valid mining concessions and environmental impact permits. In December 2016, the Agrarian Court issued a subsequent procedural order in which the Court recognised that Penmont complied with the agrarian ruling by having returned the land in dispute and, furthermore, that remediation activities are to be conducted in accordance with Federal environmental guidelines and regulations, as supervised by the competent Federal authorities. Remediation activities in this respect are pending as the agrarian members have not yet permitted Penmont physical access to the lands. Penmont has already presented a conceptual mine closure and remediation plan before the Agrarian Court in respect of the approximately 300 hectares where Penmont conducted mining activities. The agrarian community Ejido El Bajío appealed this procedural order from the Agrarian Court and a Federal District Court denied this appeal. The agrarian community has presented in the month of August 2017 a further and last recourse against this ruling by the Federal District Court and the final result is pending. –– In addition, and as also previously reported by the Company, claimants in the El Bajío matter presented other claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels separate from the land described above. Penmont has no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont. As previously reported, the Agrarian Court issued rulings declaring such occupation agreements over those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate such lands to the state that they were in before Penmont’s occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from this area. Given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or has specific geological interest in these land parcels, any contingency relating to such land parcels is not considered material by the Company. The case relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to finalisation. –– Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in the El Bajío matter. There remains significant uncertainty as to the finalisation and ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings. 14.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values: OPTIONS AND FORWARDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency. OPTION COMMODITY CONTRACTS The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity. QUOTED INVESTMENTS: Fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. INTEREST-BEARING LOANS Fair value of the Company’s interest-bearing loan, is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. LOANS WITH RELATED PARTIES Fair value of the Company’s loan to related party is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market interest rates at each reporting date. 267 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 (C) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its subsidiaries’ exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from the activities of these subsidiaries. Also the Company enters into option contracts to manage its subsidiaries’ exposure to commodity price risk associated with the sales of gold. In the Group’s consolidated financial statements certain of these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company’s stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale financial assets, loans to and from related parties, interest-bearing loans and trade payables. The Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries. The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: • Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks; • Credit risk; and • Liquidity risk. This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework. The Company’s risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. (A) MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, payment or receipt of dividends and other items. As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Company’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods. There is no impact on the Company’s equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles. The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge against precious metals commodity price exposure in its subsidiaries, see mentioned in note 17(c).

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED INTEREST RATE RISK The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments. The Company’s earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the loans with related parties and interest earned on cash balances. Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interestbearing loans and loans from related parties are excluded from the table below. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date. There is no impact on the Company’s equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables, intercompany loans, cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale financial assets. The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Company’s financial assets are with counterparties that the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 14, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Company’s financial assets were neither impaired nor past due. The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency and commodity hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings. The Company’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of M-1 (Moody’s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poors) and above, and only for periods of less than four months. The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 6 for the maximum credit exposure for available-for-sale investments, note 8 for cash and cash equivalents and note 14 for related party balances. 271 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 (C) LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain interest-bearing loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder’s capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Company’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows. 272 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL

Mineral resources are not ore reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Gold, silver, lead and zinc assays were capped where appropriate. CORPORATE 2 Mineral resources are reported at metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions*, variable metallurgical recovery assumptions (variable metallurgical recoveries as a function of grade and relative metal distribution), mining costs, processing costs, general and administrative (G&A) costs, and variable NSR factors (NSR factors include smelting and transportation costs). The AgEq is calculated by dividing the cost by the Ag net value factor which includes prices, recoveries, and payabilities. GOVERNANCE 3 The cut-off grade for Ciénega’s mineral resources varies between 117 and 162 gpt AgEq. 4 The Mega Centauro, Soledad/Dipolos, and Noche Buena resources are reported within pit shells run at a US$1,250/oz Au price. 5 The Mega Centauro, Soledad/Dipolos, Noche Buena open pit mines has produced silver at an average concentration of 0.3 gpt to 1.1 gpt. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model. Based on past production, factored in situ silver in the open pit M & I & I resources is approximately in the range of 14 to 15 moz. 6 Mega Centauro mineral reserves are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.25 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, transitional and sulfide material above 0.30 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, oxide material above 0.93 gpt Au reports to the mill, transitional and sulfide material above 0.48 gpt Au reports FINANCIAL to the mill. 7 The Soledad/Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access. SRK has been provided with reassurances that Fresnillo has a reasonable chance to reacquire surface rights to these areas. STATEMENTS * Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,250.00), Silver (US$/oz 17.00), Lead (US$/lb 1.00) and Zinc (US$/lb 1.20). • The resources were estimated by Fresnillo.

All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Metal assays FINANCIAL were capped where appropriate. Mineral resources are reported at variable metal, metal equivalent or NSR cut-off grades and assuming reasonable metal recoveries. Orisyvo, Lucerito, Candameña, Rodeo and Guachichil mineral resources are reported inside a conceptual pit shell based on appropriate mining and processing costs and metal recoveries for oxide and sulfide material. Equivalent metal grades (and conceptual pit optimization) are based on US$1,250 per ounce of gold, US$17.00 per ounce of silver (US$1,400 per STATEMENTS ounce of gold, US$17.50 per ounce of silver for the Orisyvo project), US$1.20 per pound of zinc and US$1.00 per pound of lead. 2 Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries. 3 Portions of the Valdecañas deposit within the Minera Juanicipio property where Fresnillo plc holds a 56% interest.

Mineral reserves are reported at metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions*, variable metallurgical recovery assumptions (variable metallurgical recoveries as a function of grade and relative metal distribution), mining costs, processing costs, general and administrative (G&A) costs, sustaining capital costs, and variable NSR factors (NSR factors include smelting and transportation costs). The AgEq is calculated by dividing the cost by the Ag net value factor which includes prices, recoveries, and payabilities. 2 Reserves include planned dilution to a minimum mining width and to minable outlines. 3 The cut-off grades for the Ciénega reserve vary between 224 and 319 gpt Ag equivalent. 4 Reserves have no additional dilution added to that inherent in the Selective Mining Unit (SMU) of 15m x 15m x 8m. Reserves are converted from resources through the process of pit optimization, pit design, production schedule and supported by a Minera Penmont cash flow model. 5 Mega Centauro mineral reserves are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.25 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, transitional and sulfide material above 0.30 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, oxide material above 0.93 gpt Au reports to the mill, transitional and sulfide material above 0.48 gpt Au reports to the mill. 6 The Soledad/Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access. SRK has been provided with documents indicating a reasonable chance that these actions will be settled in favour of the mine. * Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,250.00), Silver (US$/oz 17.00), Lead (US$/lb 1.00) and Zinc (US$/lb 1.20). • Full mining recovery assumed with a factor applied for pillars where appropriate. • The reserves are valid as of December 31, 2017. All topography is valid as of October 31, 2017. • The ore reserves were estimated by Fresnillo.
