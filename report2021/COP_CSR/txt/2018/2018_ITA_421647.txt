GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 Introduction The United Nations Global Compact (www.unglobalcompact.org) is rooted in the desire to promote a sustainable global economy, in full respect of human rights, labour rights, environmental protection, and the fight against corruption. It was proposed for the first time during the 1999 World Economic Forum in Davos by former UN Secretary Kofi Annan, who on that occasion invited the global economic leaders attending the forum to endorse a “Global Compact” with the United Nations to tackle the most critical aspects of globalization in a collaborative manner. As of today (September 2018) over 12,000 companies and organizations from over 170 countries have adhered to the Compact. In 2012, illycaffè adhered to the Global Compact (in 2013 published its first Communication on Progress), and committed to integrating into its strategic vision, organizational culture, and day-to-day operations the ten principles related to human and labour rights, environmental protection, and the fight against corruption promoted by the initiative. The Communication on Progress is a document that accompanies and completes the company’s Sustainable Value Report, prepared according to the Global Reporting Initiative: both are instruments through which illycaffè periodically informs its stakeholders on the activities implemented and results achieved concerning corporate responsibility and sustainability. For more in-depth information and a detailed account of what illycaffè has done and the results it has achieved, please see the link https://valuereport.illy.com to the relevant sections of the Sustainable Value Report 2017.
