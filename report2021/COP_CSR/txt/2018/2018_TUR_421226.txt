Şişecam continues to further strengthen its performance in this area The waste management understanding at Şişecam covers glass waste collection and through sustainable environmental and natural resource management practices. recycling activities with a holistic perspective. Şişecam also conducts activities to create a suitable infrastructure for increasing the efficiency of glass waste collection and recycling activities in Turkey. Şişecam now performs waste management so as to reduce the environmental impact. Hazardous waste constitutes less than 1% of Şişecam’s total waste. Waste reduction through recycling makes up an important part of the waste management approach, and raw materials are used effectively with the reuse of recycled products in the production processes. In addition, Şişecam has benefited from obtaining about 440,000 TL of financial savings with a waste reduction of about 1,100 tons. Glass is a product which can be recycled infinitely and is characterized by being the healthiest packaging material. At Şişecam, glass is brought back into production using sustainable practices. Glass Packaging supplied 172,000 tons of pieces of glass as of 2017, and used recycled glass in the production processes by reducing the use of raw materials. Pieces of glass are used as an input in production among the Group companies of Şişecam as well. About 25,000 tons of glass pieces were taken from Şişecam Automotive, recycled and used by Glass Packaging. This reduces both the use of raw materials and also production costs by working towards the implementation of a circular economy model.

The recycled water used in all plants has risen to about 2.6 million m3 emission levels, Şişecam is actively working on improvement projects. Improvement thanks to the increase in the amount of recycled water by %26 over the last two years. activities aimed at production are being continued to meet the target of reducing NOx The amount of waste water, on the other hand, has decreased by 11% over the last two emissions by 2022. years. Şişecam carries out projects to reduce the NOx emissions caused by glass furnaces Amount of Recycled Water (m3) during its production processes. Within this scope, it works to reduce both fuel . consumption and emissions with primary measures. As a consequence, Şişecam has aimed to achieve reduction at the source by optimizing operation conditions. The target is to develop these practices in the upcoming period and take the performance in this 26% increase field one step further. In 2017, Şişecam reduced its NOx emissions from production activities to 13 million tons. In glass production processes, natural gas is mainly used. Therefore, there is no SOx emission related to fuel and burning. Even though the SOx caused by some of the raw materials of glass with sulfate content is very low, research continues to find raw material alternatives that will minimize such emissions.

Şişecam carries out afforestation and conservation activities to increase the value of biodiversity in the areas where it operates. It allocates an area of about 5-10 acres within the boundaries of all its plants for afforestation activities, and creates Şişecam Forests in all areas where it operates. A Şişecam Forest of about 368 arcres has been created this year in the Yalıköy region where Camiş Madencilik A.Ş is located. A forest consisting of about 18,000 trees has been planted within the factory site of Denizli Cam Sanayii ve Ticaret A.Ş. Thanks to the planting event held regularly by Soda Sanayii A.Ş., the number of trees has reached 40,000 after 12 years. Acting with the awareness of the fact that its manufacturing processes are dependent on nature, Şişecam takes into account the environmental impact of its activities and carries out projects to protect nature. The coastline in the Mersin Kazanlı region where the Soda Sanayii factory is located is the nesting site of loggerhead sea turtles whose numbers are rapidly depleting. Within the scope of “The Project for Researching, Studying and Protecting Sea Turtles at Kazanlı Beach of Mersin Province”, which was carried out between 2007-2017 with the cooperation of Şişecam Chemicals and Mersin University, the nest sites of endangered Caretta caretta and Chelonia mydas turtles were taken under protection. In addition to this, awareness-raising activities to inform local people in the region about the subject, and coastal cleanup activities aimed at preserving the habitats of turtles and protecting endangered sea turtles continued. As a result of the work carried out, the number of nests has increased steadily since 2007, and with the 1,705 sea turtle nests detected in 2016, the project achieved a 10-year record number of turtle nests. After the completion of the project, this year it was aimed to increase the survival chances of baby turtles before the nesting period by carrying out a beach cleaning activity under the leadership of Şişecam.
