committed to continuous sustainability reporting. This report covers the whole company’s sustainability performance for the year 2017 and it covers all Ensto's business units and locations. Our sustainability report follows the GRI standards principles. As we are not a listed company, and do not report our financial performance, this report concentrates mainly on social and environmental aspects. In our sustainability report, we are committed to transparency. In our report, we also report our compliance with UN Global Compact principles. The Global Reporting Initiative index is available on page 75 and on our website. Reporting cycle The sustainability reports have been published every second year starting from the year 2012. An exception was made in 2016 (25.10.2016), when we published the report for the years 2014-2016. The one year delay was due to a renewal and implementation of our new corporate strategy. Starting from 2017 we have decided to publish the sustainability report in electronic format yearly. Material aspects and boundaries Our sustainability reporting focuses on our relevant impacts on our entire value chain as well as on topics that are most important to our business. The material aspects reflect Ensto's strategic priorities and our customers' and other stakeholders' sustainability requirements. UN Global Compact principles guide our reporting topics as well as key performance indicators determined in the GRI Standard Guidelines. Material aspects have been defined internally in sustainability framework process. We have concentrated on reporting environmental and social responsibility. As we are a family company, we have chosen not to publish our economic figures externally and therefore only limited amount of financial data is included in this report. © ENSTO 5 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 Ensto's impact on sustainability through the value chain Reporting data collection Data gathering is an important part of our sustainability reporting. The personnel data and the data related to the social performance, are collected through Human Resource Management system (Flower). The system includes accurate data on Ensto's employees globally, covering all units and providing basic employment related information on all employees. The training data is collected by our local human resources personnel. In 2017 we launched an eLearning platform (Ensto Academy) which will help us in the future to report more accurately of the employee trainings and educations. Environmental data is compiled from manufacturing plants. No data of waste production was available from India and St. Petersburg. Also data of energy consumption in St. Petersburg could not be gathered. CO2 emissions of the electricity production were collected from the energy producers whenever the data was available. CO2 emissions of the electricity in Llers in Spain and Milan in Italy factories were taken from European Environment Agency. CO2 emissions of the electricity in Russia and India were taken from publication of International Energy Agency. CO2 emission factors for fuels were gathered from different © ENSTO 6 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 sources, which were Finland´s Ministry of the Environment, Motiva and U.S Energy Information Administration. Financial data is based on data collection through our enterprise resource planning system (IFS). The figures used in Ensto Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to the International Financial Reporting Standard. Further information This report has been published in May 2017 and it is only available in digital format because we want reduce the usage of printing materials.

This year (2018) Ensto is celebrating its 60th anniversary. Many great things have happened during these years but we want to focus on the future. In order to stay in the business also in the coming decades we need constantly and closely observe the megatrends that guide our business environment, and act accordingly. For active players, as I see Ensto, megatrends are an opportunity not a threat. Sustainability as such is one of the megatrends but also a combining factor of other megatrends. Sustainability is a key part of our operation as we aim to design and manufacture smart and ecological products. Besides sustainable products, human perspective is also very important for us. We truly care in what kind of conditions employees are working, and we want our employees to enjoy working at Ensto. Furthermore, we expect our suppliers to operate according to our ethical principles and values. © ENSTO 8 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 Improving our employees skills and knowledge In 2017 one of our biggest projects concerning development of our employees has been building up Ensto Academy, which is Ensto's Learning Management System. It enables versatile personnel and customer trainings online. I believe that employees are more pleased with their work when they have enough knowledge to succeed in their daily duties and therefore this project has been important for us. Enhancing dialog with our suppliers Teamwork between Ensto and our suppliers has a key importance, as it is the basis of a successful business. In 2017, we organized our first Supplier Days where we had the possibility to an open dialogue with our suppliers. The transparency of the supply chain and expectations for suppliers were presented for both parties. I am pleased that as a result of the workshops it was evident that suppliers are interested in taking part of our product developments and that they wish to be involved already at earlier stages. 60 Acts for Better life At Ensto we are celebrating our 60th anniversary with 60 acts for better life and better future, together with our customers and other stakeholders. Our own personnel have been invited to share their ideas of the anniversary acts and the best ideas will be realized. I am very excited to find out what kind of thoughts there will be and which ideas will be put into practice. Continued commitment to UN Global Compact Like last year, I am pleased to confirm that Ensto reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption. This year we have combined our sustainability report, which follows GRI standards, and UN Global Compact report. In the combined report, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. © ENSTO 9 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 OUR SUSTAINABILITY HIGHLIGHTS Ensto Quality and Environmental policies renewed to comply with the new strategy and values In 2017 we renewed Ensto's Quality and Environmental policies to comply with the new strategy and values.

In 2017, we have had multiple students and pupil groups visiting and getting to know Ensto's factories in Finland and in Estonia. During these visits we tell the young people about our operation, our products and possibilities that Ensto can offer them in the future e.g. opportunity to do their master thesis, summer jobs, training positions and working opportunities. In 2017, we had over 60 summer employers working in our factories and offices. We also attend students own events and sponsor their activities. Sometimes groups of students are visiting us to learn real professional skills e.g. how cable joints are done in real life. Ensto supports design research and education at Aalto In 2017 Ensto made a donation to support education in the field of arts and design at Aalto University (Finland) in the framework of the matched-funding scheme.

Policies and voluntary commitments Our aim is to ensure that all Ensto's employees take social and environmental matters into considerations in their daily work. In order to be successful in this task, we apply a set of policies and principles for maintaining the high standards of our operations. We expect all of our employees to fulfil these commitments in their everyday work. In 2017 we have renewed Ensto's Quality and Environmental policies to comply with the renewed direction, strategy and values and to comply with the ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 requirements. The two policies have been replaced with one combined policy. Quality and Environmental Management and our values are the foundation of all our operations in Ensto. The meaning of the Policy is to summarize the essential elements of our commitment for Quality and Environmental Management. We established an e-learning course to Ensto's Employee Code of Conduct. Our Employee Code of Conduct sets out our expectations for employees across the company. We expect all our new employees to complete the course and act accordingly. Naturally, also current employees are expected to follow the rules and guidelines of Employee Code of Conduct. Besides our own employees, we expect our suppliers to take sustainability and ethical matters into account in all their actions. That is why we have published Supplier Code of Conduct, which is based on the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Ensto's suppliers are obligated to implement the principles of the supplier Code of Conduct across their whole operation.  Employee Code of Conduct  Ethical principles  Quality and Environmental policy  Safety and health policy  United Nations Global Compact principles  Conflict mineral policy  Supplier Code of Conduct © ENSTO 33 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 We comply with all national laws and regulations wherever we operate.

Personnel – diversity as a strength We believe that engaged and skilled personnel are the key to success. We see diversity as a strength that helps us attract the most talented and motivated people. It is our duty to offer people a working environment where every individual’s contribution and participation is appreciated, rewarded, and encouraged. At the end of 2017 Ensto employed 1,573 people of which 1,502 (95%) were fulltime employees. Ensto has employees in 20 countries. The majority of our employees are located in Estonia (33%), Finland (25%) and France (19%). © ENSTO 35 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 Our employee base is relatively evenly distributed in terms of age and gender and there have not been big changes over the years. At the end of 2017, 43% of our employees were female and 57% male. 98 % of the employees had a full-time employment contract. Factors like one’s gender, nationality, ethnicity or age have no weight in our recruiting decisions.

At Ensto we believe that employees give their best when the things that are meaningful to them are taken good care of in the workplace. Our employee surveys help us to gather valuable information about our employees’ opinions and what are the most important things for our people. The survey gives us a tool to develop our activities and identify practices that will make Ensto a better place to work. Until 2017, we conducted engagement surveys every second year, but have now decided to conduct an Highlights of employee survey every year. In 2017, with the renewed employee survey concept, the employee experience survey response rate was 75% which was a little bit lower compared to  Survey response the previous year (80%). In the survey the employees rate 75% were asked to choose five factors, which are most  73% of important to them from the given statements relating respondents are to a good work place. Based on their choices they were satisfied with asked to give their evaluation and open feedback. Ensto as a workplace The results showed that 73% (scale: 1-100, 73% = good  77% have had level) of respondents are satisfied with Ensto as a their best work workplace. When asked where respondents have had experience at their best work experience, 77% answered that they Ensto have been most satisfied working for Ensto than for previous employers. This is a very good result, and © ENSTO 37 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 indicates that we have great potential in creating the best employee experience together. Ensto's employee Net Promoter Score was five, which is an internationally comparable promoter score showing how engaged employees are. It is measured by asking how likely is it that you would recommend your employer to a friend or acquaintance. eNPS score over 20 is considered good, so we still have some work to do reach that level. The results of the employee survey were discussed within the teams with a solution based approach. Each team was asked to discuss about the most meaningful things on team level and plan actions to develop those factors. We also encourage each employee to discuss their personal top 5 meaningful things with their superior to enable influencing individual employee experience. Next employee experience survey will be conducted in autumn 2018. Open communication At Ensto, we believe that open communication plays an important role in building employee engagement. We use multiple channels such as global intranet, team sites, reviews held by CEO, to communicate with our employees. We also send regular newsletters via email and provide printed versions for factories. One of the forms of the open communication is Ensto Council, our own Groupwide cooperation forum, which is organized every year. The role of Ensto Council is to provide an opportunity for overseas units' employee representatives to express their views on various issues as well as to act as a Group-wide discussion and information forum. All Ensto offices and location are entitled to send their representatives to the Ensto Council's meetings. In 2017 the Ensto Council concentrated on discussions about the strategic target Best Employee Experience – how it is understood, examples how it works, what supports it and what is still needed to develop, to meet the target. Employee wellbeing At Ensto we believe that satisfied, happy and healthy employees are more productive and lead to satisfied customers. Well-being at work is a set of preventive, comprehensive and systematic actions where everyone in the organization is involved. © ENSTO 38 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 The well-being work at Ensto is led by the well-being steering team. Superiors, employees and the work community have their own responsibilities. Health and safety matters have the highest priority and individuals' own responsibility is crucial. Ensto supports employees in this by providing different tools and possibilities to maintain and develop own skills and competences needed in one's daily work, to participate in developing one's own work, and in other development projects.

We utilize smart technology and digital means to support our customers in reducing energy consumption. We consider durability and long lifetime as key features of our products and solutions. We prioritize recyclable and durable materials to ensure the longevity of our products. We put a great emphasis on easy and fast installation process in order to minimize the amount of excessive material or waste generated. Contributing to build electric vehicle charging infrastructure Electric Vehicles (EVs) are gaining ground and are becoming more and more common. This means that electric traffic and transportation are growing. For this positive development to continue more EV charging points are needed. As electric solution provider for smart transportation, Ensto wants to be a part of this development and create possibilities for EVs to become more of a standard than exception. Ensto headquarters’ parking place one of the biggest EV charging points in Finland Ensto headquarters’ parking place in Porvoo is one of the biggest EV charging points in Finland. On the parking place, you can find 30 Ensto's own charging points for Ensto's employees or for anybody who owns an EV. There are five different charging station models available. One of the charging points is extra special. It gets its electricity from solar power panels. You can seldom find a more environmentally friendly way to charge and drive a car. On Ensto's parking place, the fast charging is also possibility. Depending on the car type, the charging lasts from 10-20 minutes. To enhance the electric traffic more this kind of parking places are needed. Finland has currently approximately 1,000 public EV charging points. One of © ENSTO 46 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 the biggest being at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport. To compare Sweden has 3,700 and the Netherlands 30,000 public EV changing stations. Global financial services company UBS has predicted that by 2025 16% of cars sold worldwide will be EVs. In Europe the percentage will be 30 according to same prediction. Building a more sustainable tomorrow with A2A in Italy Ensto helped an Italian Energy company A2A to build an electric vehicle charging field. A2A had changed a big part of their car fleet to electric vehicles so charging capacity was needed on their parking place. As the building and the parking place were old, careful planning was needed in order to avoid big rebuilding of electricity system. A2A chose Ensto's smart charging solutions, which enable dynamic sharing the maximum load for each car and the need for new electricity supply connection was avoided. The solution secures the best possible charging power per socket depending on the number of vehicles and their charging capabilities. The chargers are connected to back office system to secure full remote management. Ensto helped India to take its first steps to build electric vehicle charging infrastructure First Ensto electric vehicle charging station was opened in New Delhi, India in October 2017. The station has Ensto Pro EV charging unit and it is connected to Finnish clean-energy company Fortum's Charge & Drive platform. The station was inaugurated by Finland’s Minister for Housing, Energy and Environment Kimmo Tiilikainen, Finnish ambassador in India Nina Vaskunlahti, Fortum SVP Corporate Affairs and Communications Arto Räty and Ensto CEO Ari Virtanen. © ENSTO 47 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 In the picture from left: Ari Virtanen, Ensto CEO, Kimmo Tiilikainen, Finland's Minister for housing, energy and environment, Arto Räty, Fortum SVP corporate affairs and communication, Nina Vaskunlahti, Finnish ambassador in India India is the world’s 5th largest automobile market and it is preparing for a huge transportation transformation by 2030. India's aim is that by 2030, not a single new petrol or diesel car should be sold in the country in order to reduce emissions and dependency on petroleum imports. Recently India’s government has invited bid for purchase of 10,000 electric vehicles. Ensto wants help and guide the nation in its efforts to build a proper EV charging infrastructure. Helping our customers to utilizing circular economy in luminaires The global lighting market is undergoing a fast transformation due to technological change. LED lights are replacing other technologies and the adoption of connected lighting systems is growing. In the coming years, the shift into LED technology is likely to accelerate due to falling prices of LEDs, increased interest towards energy efficiency and upcoming regulations. LED luminaires are not installed just in the new constructions but also in old buildings. Refurbishment of a lighting system is nowadays usually conducted with LED lighting. In case of fixed luminaires where the light source is integrated into the luminaire, this generally means that the whole luminaire needs to be changed and old one is discarded. Modularity in Ensto's luminaires At Ensto, we want prolong the lifecycle of our products and promote circular economy. Therefore, we have chosen to use modular structure in many of our luminaires. Modularity enables the change of the lighting source easily without © ENSTO 48 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 changing the whole luminaire. Additionally more features such as radar or intelligence, can be added in the luminaire. a a b b c d Picture: a = diffuser, b = body, c = installation plate with two compact fluorescent light bulbs (2*18W), d= installation plate with LEDs (12 W). Lighting source type can be changed by changing just the installation plate. Modular structure means that the installation plate, which includes a built in lighting source, can be changed in our most common luminaires. In refurbishment of a lighting system only the old installation plate including the light source, is discarded and recycled. This way energy savings are gained with more efficient lighting source, and usage of components as well as materials is minimized, when diffuser and body do not need to be changed. The advantage of the solutions is also lower total expenses since very simple installation of new lighting source lowers the costs. Ensto's Marlo luminaire is one of the newest luminaire with modular structure. It is designed for retail trade usage. Often spaces are reorganized in stores and lighting needs to be adjusted to new needs. Marlo is designed so that by changing the lighting source the light optics can be changed. By optimizing the lighting pattern the light can be used where it is really needed and energy can be saved. © ENSTO 49 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 Ensto SmartWay luminaires save energy with artificial intelligence In 2017, Ensto launched a new intelligent lighting solution, Ensto Ensto SmartWay. Ensto SmartWay allows wireless SmartWay is communication without control wires or programming. The solution uses artificial intelligence, and it uses smart motion a selfdetection and light sensor. learning wireless Ensto SmartWay is self-learning solution, and the smart system, which features start working as soon as luminaires have been enables smart installed. They learn continuously about the movements of buildings of the people using the building, adapting to any changes. Ensto SmartWay keeps learning throughout its life. Thus, tomorrow. the lights are on only where and when they are needed. Ensto SmartWay will enable smart building functions. Sensors placed in luminaires can generate massive amounts of data about how a building is used. Movement may be analyzed in offices, stairwells or warehouses creating comfort and allowing a building owner to influence behavior and save energy. © ENSTO 50 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 RESPONSIBLE SOURCING We strive to ensure that our suppliers and partners uphold high standards for responsible business practices and how they treat the people who work for them.

Supplier evaluation Ensto requires that suppliers' operations are performed in a manner that is appropriate, as it applies to their ethical, legal, environmental, and social responsibilities. We select our major suppliers and subcontractors on their ability to meet our Ethical Principles which are based on Ensto's values and the principles of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Rights of the Child and the Declaration of the United Nations International Labor Organization. © ENSTO 51 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 We evaluate our potential new suppliers in accordance with the suppliers’ approval process and our current major suppliers on criteria of quality, operational efficiency, cost, occupational health & safety, social and environmental responsibility. In addition, human rights related criteria, anticorruption principles and labor principles are important part of the evaluation process. We are using supplier scorecard method for supplier evaluation. It is based on the quality performance of suppliers’ products and services. The most important criterion are among others account delivery accuracy, quality, lead time and payment terms. If the supplier is not fulfilling the set criteria, the supplier will be audited or other development actions will be agreed with the supplier in order to ensure the fulfillment of the criteria. The principles of no forced or compulsory labor and no child labor are included in Ensto Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2017 we conducted 46 supplier audits and visits. No non-compliance cases were reported during these audits and visits. Supplier Code of Conduct Ensto Supplier Code of Conduct defines the minimum sustainability requirements to our suppliers and expectations regarding ethical issues. It is part of Ensto's ethical code for purchasing and it requires that suppliers act in ethically, legally, environmentally and socially appropriate manner. The Code lists basic requirements on labor issues such as ban of child, forced and indentured labor, working hours and wages and benefits. In 2017 Supplier Code of Conduct was renewed. Ensto suppliers are obligated to implement the principles of the We expect Supplier Code of Conduct across their whole operations. our We expect suppliers to verify compliance by providing suppliers to information and allowing possible audits.

If the supplier © ENSTO 52 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 does not fulfill the requirements, they are either given an opportunity to conduct corrective actions before they can be approved as Ensto's supplier or in more severe case they are turned down. Supplier requirements Ensto's Supplier requirements were renewed in 2017. The document describes the minimum criteria required from all Ensto's key suppliers. The document is public and is introduced to the key suppliers at least during the tendering process. Suppliers play a very important role in our value chain we offer to our customers and with supplier requirements we want to ensure the faultless performance of our suppliers. Working with our suppliers Ensto's suppliers are an important part of our supply chain. With our supplier, we are able to provide high-quality products, solutions and services to our customers. Ensto currently has active co-operation with around 4,000 external suppliers who supply us raw materials, components, modules, services etc. Out of these 169 are classified as key suppliers. The classification is done based on annual purchases value. Through collaboration with our stakeholders, we aim to enhance long-term relationships, ensure the highest quality and create a sustainable supply chain. In purchasing this means specifically that the suppliers shall be treated equally, without discrimination and purchasing decisions shall be based on open and clear criteria. First Ensto Supplier Days As collaborative supply chain is one of Ensto's goals to sustainable success, Ensto organized the first Supplier Days event in Tallinn, Estonia in 2017. Our aim is to build a strong supply base with our trusted partners and Ensto Supplier Days offered a great platform to share ideas and expectations. We believe that bringing Ensto strategies to life is not possible without our suppliers and that is why we saw it important to organize this event. For us at Ensto teamwork between the company and the suppliers has a key importance. We believe that open dialogue is the basis of a successful business and therefore the focus was on communication throughout the event. Together © ENSTO 53 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 with our suppliers we were able to discuss how to optimize joint activities and how to develop shared business. Around 80 suppliers form different countries attended the Suppliers Days. During the three days Ensto strategy and production systems, procurement strategy and collaboration possibilities were introduced. Also Ensto's values were presented, which ideally should be followed throughout the whole supply chain. During the event, an Innovations Workshop was organized to encourage our partners to bring up innovative ideas how to increase the competitiveness and reduce costs of Ensto products. Suppliers had also possibility to visit our factories in Keila and Tallinn, where we introduced our current processes for them. Ensto gives a new life to old flags and other leftovers Minimizing waste is one of our environmental goals at Ensto. We continuously try to find ways to recycle, prevent the waste generation and to find new uses for our old items. Sustainability of our own products as well as purchased products is also important for us. Therefore, we started to find ways to use our own leftovers in making more sustainable business gifts. The first outcome of sustainable business gifts are ecological bags, which have been made from our own old Ensto flags which otherwise would have © ENSTO 54 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 been discarded. The first collection is a limited edition of 100 pieces. Manufacturing of a canvas bag from virgin cotton produces 960 – 2,750 g CO2-ekv emissions (Finnish Environment Institute), so roughly estimating 96 – 275 kg CO2ekv emissions can be saved, when 100 pc of bags are made of discarded materials. The intention is that in the future we can better utilize the leftovers and old brand and marketing materials e.g. from exhibitions and give them a new life. Through re-designing and re-sewing, leftover and old materials can be turned into new and unique gifts, bags, clothes and accessories. Responsible partnership The ecological bags were done in cooperation with Globe Hope, a Finnish company which designs and manufactures ecological design products from recycled and discarded materials to give them a new life. Environmental values are an important part of our business, and the cooperation with Globe Hope supports our ambition to be a responsible partner to our stakeholders. Circular economy is one of key ways to reduce our environmental footprint, and therefore we are very excited about this collaboration. Business gifts made out of our own materials with no use are good way to indicate that Ensto is a responsible partner. © ENSTO 55 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 LEAN MANUFACTURING AND DELIVERY Our culture of continuous improvement is based on sustainable, effective and efficient manufacturing. We are constantly working to minimize negative environmental impacts of our operations, minimizing both the resources used and the waste created. We are also utilizing possibilities of circular economy. We focus on efficient and agile delivery capability and keep our promises to customer. We are focusing on providing customers the best possible products at the best possible prices, quality levels and delivery times. Lean does this by focusing on finding and removing waste. Improvement in business needs is seen as a continuous effort at Ensto. Lean manufacturing at Ensto Efficient and well-organized operations are an essential part of Ensto's company culture. We work hard to enhance delivery lead times, manufacturing flexibility, and logistics accuracy in order to meet our customer's current and future needs. In order to promote lean manufacturing in our operations, we are running a company-wide internal program, “The Ensto Operational Excellence (EOX)”. The program is all about continuous improvement and a focus on adding value and reducing waste, which results in shorter lead times, flexibility and top quality for the benefit of our customers. We have defined and created our own Ensto level standards of each EOX method which have been taken then into action after tested in pilot plants. In 2018 we will concentrate on refining our current EOX processes to be able to get same results by using fewer resources and time. Continuous improvement is led in War Rooms War Room is one of the most important initiatives to continuously improve our actions. War Room is used almost in all our operation units and also in other Ensto's functions such as manufacturing, warehouse, procurement, health and safety, environment. War Room is based on the idea that we should continuously identify and measure performance losses in the plant. In this context, losses are defined as lost productive time by machine or people. Ensto production personnel meet daily for a brief 15 minutes meeting and review the losses. Whenever possible losses are immediately addressed with corrective © ENSTO 56 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 actions. Whenever a loss occurs, personnel in production fill in a so called ‘Loss Card’ where all the details about the particular loss are recorded. Loss Cards are then posted to the board of the department in question. Periodically losses are summarized and categorized. In this way the most burning and urgent problems are identified. Out of those Losses Reduction Projects are formed and executed. Those projects reduce and eliminate the root causes of the losses. We continuously follow the number of loss cards and improvement project completions. In 2017, 38,162 loss cards were written which equals to 56,400 h loss time in a year.  In 2017: 270 improvement projects were completed generating 25,600 h/a loss time reduction.  In 2016: 316 improvement projects were completed generating 21,000 h/a loss time reduction.  In 2015: 309 improvement projects were completed generating 24,400 h/a loss time reduction. Increasing the efficiency of our factories Improving the maintenance of our factory plays an important role in improving productivity and quality through eliminating waste and visualizing risk. Preventive maintenance enables us also to increase the reliability of our machines, reduces random failures and improves safety. We improve our machine intensive work efficiency with the equipment efficiency method, by shortening set-up times, reducing cycle times and waste times. The main target is to intensify our manufacturing, increase the capacity and decrease the usage of resources. Our target is to reduce the waste time of key machines by 20% and waste time by 5% © ENSTO 57 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 EOX status Method What is all about? Our status today?

At Ensto, we try to use raw materials as effective as we can and we are always looking ways to decrease our wastage. Therefore minimizing plastics waste is an important part of our operation. In 2017 around 230 tonnes of plastics were used in Ensto's manufacturing of which 60% were used in Tallinn. At Ensto Tallinn plant plastic is used mainly in manufacturing of luminaires and enclosures. At Ensto Tallinn plant plastic wastage is generated e.g. in molding from runners, molding defective components and from lumps which are generated during material change in the injection molding machine. Runners and defective components, which would otherwise be discarded, are collected. Depending on the material type and quality criteria, the waste parts are either mechanically recycled in our own plant or sold to a waste management company. Plastic waste from left to right: Runners, Defective component, Lumps Mechanical recycling is physical grounding of plastic waste into small secondary fractions. The aim of mechanical recycling is to obtain regrind, which is utilized in injection molding process of new products. Only high quality plastic waste can be reused in the molding. Ensto Tallinn plant recycles only waste generated in-house because this is the only way we can ensure high quality and consistent blend of raw material. In 2017 Ensto Tallinn plant used in products manufacturing more than 33 tons of regrind materials. 14% of the waste plastic used was polycarbonate, 52% PC with glass fiber and 34% acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer. The most typical Ensto Tallinn plant products in which recycled plastic is used are electrification enclosure bases and luminaire bases. As Ensto Tallinn plant enclosures follow safety consulting and certification company Underwriters Laboratories requirements, the maximum allowed content of regrind for lids and bases is 25% by weight. On the other hand in some luminaire bases the regrind content is up to 100% by weight. © ENSTO 59 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 Main reason for conducting mechanical recycling is due to economic benefits comparing to virgin plastics use for manufacturing new products. Mechanical recycling also saves landfill space, energy, oil, water utilization and reduces carbon dioxide emissions. Ensto builds a more sustainable tomorrow one package at a time In 2017 Ensto launched its new brand and visual identity to match better with the new strategy. This started up a need to redesign our packages. As we want to reduce the environmental impact whenever it is possible and help our customers to make more sustainable choices, it was clear that we would take environmental aspect closely into consideration when the new packages were designed. This project has major importance since we supply about 20,000 different products annually and roughly 1,100 tons of cardboard are used yearly in packaging. Only little plastic is used as packaging material. We have chosen to continue to use card board as packaging material, because it can be recycled. Cardboard also retains its value for longer than many other commodities and it breaks down completely, which means it is easy to store, bale and transport. In our new packages, recyclable materials are used as much as possible and we use mainly brown corrugated board. Whenever possible, recycled fibers are used. We have also reduced the number of colors used in packaging printing, and we prefer more environmentally friendly packaging methods to reduce the amount of © ENSTO 60 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 packaging materials. In addition to environmental values, Ensto's both business and retail customers have been taken into account in packaging design. We have started to introduce new, more ecological packaging in spring 2018. Focusing on quality at Ensto The quality of our products, services and solutions is an integral part of our strategy and a cornerstone of our business. Quality is embedded in our daily business, as we strive to deliver the best customer loyalty and satisfaction. Our target is to solve customer's problem fast and smoothly in order to ensure satisfied customer. We strive to observe potentially dangerous, expensive and epidemic product faults as soon as possible in order to minimize the effects. We do our best to prevent recurrent problems by affecting on root causes of the problem. A lot of effort has been put to improve and maintain high quality. In 2012 we started a persevering work to improve the quality which has led to impressive results. Compared to the year 2012 we have managed to reduce the number of claimed quantities by 65% in 2017. By providing high quality products, we meet our customers' requirements. Also less waste is generated, material usage is decreased and CO2 emissions are reduced. We set plant specific quality targets and follow key performance quality indicators which are quality yield, monetary yield and number of claims. © ENSTO 61 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 In Ensto yield is used to measure quality. Yield covers both internal and external quality and it is calculated by dividing the difference of sold and claimed quantities with sold quantities. All the factories have their own targets for the quality yield. In 2017 we reached 99.75% yield (including our own and trading products). Development of yield 100,0 % 99,8 % 99,6 % 99,4 % 99,2 % 99,0 % 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Delivery at Ensto One of our key strategic projects is to improve efficiency and agility of our end-toend supply chain. We aim to improve our service capabilities –such as delivery times, small-orders handling and warehousing strategies, and securing visibility on profitability across our operations teams. When planning our delivery, we take sustainability into account. We try to optimize the sizes of delivery batches and avoid air freights whenever possible. One of the criteria for selecting logistics partners for Ensto is environmental aspect. We require for our transportation partners to have clear consciousness of environmental issues and also to take concrete actions to decrease the CO 2 emissions in transportation. Model of transport is chosen based on the customer needs. In Finland and Estonia we have one carrier partner responsible for approximately 80% of the deliveries. According to them the carbon footprint of forwarding and freight was 1.8 tons of CO2 (equivalent) in 2017. 84% of the shipments (km) were done by road transportation, 14% by sea carriage and 2% by airfreight. Road transportation caused majority of carbon house dioxides (83%). © ENSTO 62 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 CO2 emission of logistics in 2017 Ocean In-trancit 2% storage 5% Airfreight 12% Road 83% © ENSTO 63 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 ENVIRONMENT In Ensto we, care for the environment, its protection, and continuous improvement of environmental protection is an integral part of our daily operations, and the premise of our business. We are constantly aiming to improve and promote our environmentally conscious business. At Ensto's our Environmental Management aims at integrating environmental management into our daily operations and continuously improve our environmental competence. The main focus is to assess and reduce the negative environmental impacts of our own operations, as well as the impacts of the entire supply chain. Environmental programs In 2015 we established three main projects focusing on environmental themes for the years 2016-2018 which are reducing energy consumption, rising environmental awareness (reported under Best Employee experience) and Ensto Green Office. In the first phase, the scope of these projects is Ensto in Porvoo, Keila, Tallinn, and St. Petersburg and in Sweden. In coming years the programs will be rolled out also to other Ensto countries. Reducing energy consumption Reducing energy consumption is a project where the focus is in reducing the consumption of energy and other natural resources in our facilities and operations. One of the concrete targets is to reduce electricity consumption in our factories by 5% by the end of year 2018 (in relation to number of produced pieces). The base year for reduction is 2015. In 2017 the biggest energy savings projects in Porvoo, Keila and in Tallinn have been the refurbishment of the lighting systems. Ensto Green Office Although most of our environmental impacts are generated in our production plants, with concrete actions energy and material savings can also be found in the office as well. To increase sustainable thinking and actions in offices we have created, Ensto Green Office, which is part of our ISO 140001 based environmental management system. © ENSTO 64 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 The aim of this program is to decrease the consumption of natural resources by improving the energy efficiency, by preventing waste generation and by increasing environmental consciousness of employees. With Ensto Green Office we motivate our personnel to act in an environmentally friendly way in their everyday tasks. A local Green Office coordinator and team, consisting of employees from different positions and apartments, are responsible for implementing and developing the Ensto Green Office. Ensto Green Office is audited internally in a certification process. The coordinator reports to the concept owner once a year of the KPI and development of Ensto Green Office. First pilot for Ensto Green Office started in 2016 in Keila in Estonia. In 2017 we started to implement Green Office also in Porvoo site and we are expecting that Porvoo will be certified in 2018. Ensto Green Office will be implemented in all other Ensto offices and it will also be integrated to our existing audit systems. In 2018 we have planned to start Ensto Green Office implementation in St. Petersburg and Stockholm. Reducing CO2 emission of our own travelling During 2017 we have encouraged our employees to evaluate the necessity of their business trips and advised them to attend the meetings using video conference facilities whenever possible. We also enable remote working where allowed by the nature of work. This allows our employees to work from their homes and reduce the usage of private cars. Through our global car policy we try actively to reduce the CO2 emission of our business car fleet and increase the share of electric vehicles. CO2 emission values have been included as a part of the Sustainable Ensto strategy to support our Customer Promise. We purchase/lease as environmentally friendly cars as possible. We favor electrical and hybrid cars, having benefits especially driving in a city. We recommend changing over to the cars with smaller engines when ordering new company cars. Charging the batteries of electrical and plug-in hybrid vehicles can be done free of charge in Ensto yard, where applicable. © ENSTO 65 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 The value of the car benefit 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% Electric plugin <110 g <100 g <130 g vehicle hybrid CO2/km CO2/km CO2/km vehicle The value of the car benefit in Finland is calculated based on the CO 2 emissions of the car (see chart above). This has encouraged many of our employees to choose plugin hybrid vehicles. Maximum CO2 emission limit for company cars is reviewed annually, which currently is 130 g/km in Finland. In Ensto the average CO2 emissions of the company cars was 94 g/km.

The environmental assessment applies to all relevant Ensto functions and processes. Ensto's environmental aspects and risks are evaluated regularly. In 2015 we introduced Health and Safety and Environment War Room”. Important parts of HSE War room is to register all health and safety and environmental accidences or potential accidences and risks and to make corrective actions. © ENSTO 66 (76) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 Procedure how to respond to environmental incidents is described and audited regularly. Environmental performance Since 2010 we have regularly reported our direct and indirect energy consumption. In our environmental reporting we have concentrated on tracking the most relevant sources of direct and indirect emissions – fuel and energy consumption as well as water consumption and waste disposal. Energy Ensto participated voluntary Energy Efficiency Agreement during the period 20082016 and has decided to continue to be part of the Agreement also in 2017-2025. Through the agreements, the aim is to improve the efficient use of energy within industry, energy sector, service sector, property and building sector, as well as regional authorities and municipalities. Ensto's target is to decrease the energy usage at Porvoo site 7% (520 MWh) in 2020 and 10.5% (780 MWh) in 2025 compared to the energy usage in 2015. The main energy saving action in 2017 at Ensto in Finland was lighting renovation projects. Around 10% of our luminaires were changed to LED luminaires. The renovation project will continue in coming years.

Fuel consumption in Lohja was not available in 2014. CO2 emissions from cooling agents are excluded from the calculation. Waste We are striving to find ways to prevent waste generation by recycling and reusing materials and components. Majority (48%) of the produced waste is metals, which are recycled and reused. Only 9% of the waste produced in 2017 was classified as hazardous waste. We offer recycling stations in our facilities as well as collection points for hazardous waste for employees’ personal use. In 2017 we started to collect bio waste in our Porvoo site in Finland. We have set ourselves a goal of 0% landfill waste and have gained this target in majority of our locations. In 2017 still around 8% of the waste ended up to landfill. In some of our countries waste collection and management is still under development and therefore waste ending in landfills is inevitable.
