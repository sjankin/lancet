For example, all fruit and milk, which is provided to employees every day, is now 100% organic, incorporating SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production. Climbing Sustainability was also a theme at the annual summer party, where employees got the chance to be some of the first guests to visit Climate Planet – a gigantic 5-story tall globe where visitors experienced a visual presentation regarding the current state of climate change around the world. This was followed by a historical walking tour around the city of Aarhus (the 2017 European Capital of Culture), and the evening was rounded off with dinner at Aarhus Central Food Market, which specializes in using and selling local ingredients. This year, DEM-ESB also participated in the ARK-ING CUP – an event bringing together both engineers and architects with the purpose of meeting in an Summer party informal context. With participants who are both partners and competitors, events like these contribute to strengthening mutual trust between local companies, while contributing to SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals. Employees have also participated in a number of active events over the past year, including We Bike to Work, the DHL Relay Race, treetop climbing and a ski trip to Norway. All of these activities allow employees to socialize, have fun and get some exercise. Employees also arranged soccer matches this year, and now play with an official SDG ball, providing the added benefit of increasing visibility and recognition of the SDGs. Soccer game And in December, employees participated in both old and new traditions of “hygge”– aka Danish coziness. One of the oldest and most cozy of traditions is the annual Christmas event for all the companies’ employees and their families. This event is an invitation to wind down in the days before Christmas with good food, games and prizes, and socialize with the husbands, wives and children of colleagues. A new twist to another tradition was that this year, the employee lunch held just before Christmas break included an SDG-themed quiz, with prizes for both the winner and five runners-up. The questions challenged employees’ knowledge about the SDGs and 2030 objectives, as well as the way Christmas lunch in which DEM-ESB applies them to measure our impact. 10 ENVIRONMENTAL CARBON FOOTPRINT REPORT INTRODUCTION This Carbon Footprint report has been prepared for the energy consultancy company Danish Energy Management & Esbensen. DEM-ESB places major focus on energy projects worldwide within the field of renewable energy, energy efficiency, demand side management, climate change, sustainable development, rural energy/ electrification, energy policy and energy legislation. This report follows The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Standard 1, under which DEM-ESB is classified as a service sector / office based organization. Preparation of this report was also aided by the World Resources Institute calculation tool Working 9 to 5 on Climate Change: An Office Guide 2. ORGANIZATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL BOUNDARIES AND BASE YEAR This carbon footprint report estimates the GHG-emissions caused by DEM-ESB activities in the reporting year 2016 (May 1, 2016-April 30, 2017). The base year for reporting on verifiable emissions data is the 2015 reporting year. This year has been chosen because it was during this time that the company Esbensen Consulting Engineers merged with Danish Energy Management, creating Danish Energy Management and Esbensen A/S. In an attempt to be as transparent as possible, we have gone a step further this year by adding concrete figures where possible. The operational boundary covers scope 1, scope 2, and part of scope 3 (business travel) with relation to all DEM-ESB offices in Denmark. Each scope is defined by the GHG protocol, and is further explained below. In addition to international offices, DEMESB also owns 51 percent of the company DEEP A/S (Danish Energy Efficiency Partners Sdn. Bhd.). However, the activity of this organization is also considered outside of the operational boundaries of this report. The DEM-ESB offices included in the 2016 reporting year are: • Aarhus • Sønderborg • Copenhagen http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards/corporate-standard To calculate results, emissions are categorized as either direct (Scope 1) or indirect (Scope 2 & Scope 3). Direct, Scope 1, emissions are those that are directly caused by a source that the company owns or controls. Indirect, Scope 2 and Scope 3, emissions are derived from the company’s consumption of energy products and services, where the company does not own or control the emissions source. http://pdf.wri.org/wri_co2guide.pdf Following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, the direct and indirect emissions are divided into three scopes: SCOPE 1 (MANDATORY): All direct emissions caused by the company, e.g. emissions from company owned cars, or combustion of fossil fuels such as natural gas in company-owned equipment. SCOPE 2 (MANDATORY): All indirect emissions caused by the company’s purchase of energy, including electricity and district heating. SCOPE 3 (OPTIONAL): Other indirect emissions caused by consumption of products and services e.g. business travel in 1 2 non-company-owned vehicles (car, plane, and train), waste produced, outsourced activities, etc. 12 Activities related to scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 have been selected based on the operations of DEM-ESB, the accessibility to data, and the possibilities that exist for influencing emissions reduction. The activities included under each scope are: SCOPE 1 • Use of company cars SCOPE 2 • Electricity use in SCOPE 3 • Use of employee cars for busifor business purposes offices ness purposes (car allowance) – managers • District heating • Transportation by train  • Use of company cars used in offices • Transportation by bus for business purposes • Transportation by ferry – employees • Domestic air transport • International air transport SCOPE 1: SCOPE 2: SCOPE 3: Direct emissions caused by fuel Indirect emissions caused by Indirect emissions caused by consumption consumption of collective energy supply consumption of products and services We do not include “employee commuting in noncompany-owned vehicles to and from work” in our SCOPE 3 Use of other report. However, DEM-ESB does participate in the transportation forms for Employees own car campaign “We Bike to Work,” which encourages business purposes Train employees to ride their bikes to work, and includes an internal team contest and prizes. During this Ferry Electricity one-month long campaign (May-June 2016), the 34 participants biked a total of 3064 kms, and saved a International ﬂight SCOPE 2 total of 560 kg CO2. Use of energy in oﬃces As the second year that DEM-ESB produces a Carbon Bus Employees Footprint Report, optimizations and improvements SCOPE 1 have been made, enabling us to be more precise in our Use of company cars for business emissions reporting. This is largely due to the fact that Domestic ﬂight District heating Managers purposes after locating data for our base year (2015-2016), we were able to systematize our collection of data, making our data collection more robust. In future reports, we may include additional activities, old activities may be excluded, or new measurement systems and sources may be applied. In the case that these activities represent a combined 10 percent change in the base year emissions, DEM-ESB will conduct a recalculation and back-cast these data points. 13 TOTAL CO2 EMISSIONS IN THE 2016-2017 REPORTING YEAR % CO2 EMMISSIONS DISTRIBUTED ACTIVITIES DISTANCE ENERGY CON­S UMP­T ION/ CO₂ EMISSIONS BY SCOPE (km) PRODUCTION (kWh) (tCO2) SCOPE 1 5% SCOPE 1 Use of company cars for business 13,080 3.7 purposes – managers Use of company cars for business 45,249 6.5 30% purposes – employees SCOPE 2 SCOPE 2 Electricity use in offices 113,259 36.4 65% District heating use in offices 158,814 27.3 SCOPE 3 SCOPE 3 Use of employee cars for business 103,810 18.9 purposes ENERGY USED BY DEM-ESB IS EQUIVALENT Transportation by train 31,403 1.5 TO 10% OF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY Transportation by bus 4,012 0.4 GENERATED BY OFFSETS Transportation by ferry 5,002 0.7 Domestic air transport * 10.6 10 % 211 International air transport * 104.8 tCO₂ Total 202,556 272,073 210.8 OFFSETS Middelgrunden offshore wind farm 303,900 97.8 Hvidebæk biomass district heating 11,771,000 2,024.6 plant/ solar thermal Total 12,074,900 2,122.4 2,122 * Number of kilometers flown is not provided because our calculation methodology takes point of departure in take-off 100 % tCO₂ and landing destinations. At DEM-ESB, there are no boilers etc. in buildings that could contribute to own oil/gas use. For this reason, our Scope 1 consists of “use of company cars for business purposes – managers” and “use of company cars for business purposes – employees.” The company cars used by managers as their personal car only registers the kilometers driven to and from work, and to and from clients for business purposes. 14 ANTI-CORRUPTION VISION AND VALUES FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE VISION AND VALUES At the core of DEM-ESB’s business strategy lies our were identified with a view to addressing the energy vision to build a future where energy is applied effiaccess challenge in rural areas.

And why is this so important? SDGs are important because consumers, donors, investors and nations are increasingly choosing goods and services that make a difference. There is an increasing demand for products that document sustainable impact, in addition to value chain sustainability, giving these products a competitive edge. According to the UNDP, achieving the SDGs is projected to create market opportunities worth up to $2.5 trillion a year. The next question that many public and private sector organizations are asking is how can sustainable impact be measured? DEM-ESB has developed an online SDG Reporting System for sustainability measurement, which can be used to track and report on progress towards the SDGs following UN standards. This journey started over 30 years ago with design, planning and implementation projects in Denmark. The focus was then, as it is now, on sustainability, which led to a range of monitoring and evaluation projects focused on the creation of SMART or RACER indicators and IT systems, and leading to assignments with the monitoring of all types of EU projects in all sectors. This experience has led to the creation of our online SDG Reporting System. DEM-ESB now uses our online SDG Reporting System to measure the impact across all projects on an annual basis. Each relevant SDG and actionable SDG Target is connected to our financial system so that impact can be measured both in terms of dollars and cents, and in terms of hours worked. This makes our contribution to global sustainability tangible for our employees and stakeholders in the wider community. Within each SDG Target area, indicators are identified using specific national and international standards, which means that they can also be used to provide performance metrics that complement official data. Our online SDG Reporting System is now being offered to clients worldwide, as both a stand-alone system and as an option for integration into pre-existing monitoring systems.
