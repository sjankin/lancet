Covering the period from 13 November 2017 to 13 November 2018, this third annual Communication on Progress outlines steps taken by CourtHeath to integrate the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to transparency in sharing this information with our stakeholders through our primary communication channels. CourtHeath is a small consulting firm based in Melbourne, Australia. Our business provides probity and procurement advice and associated services to government departments and agencies, local government and not-for-profit organisations. We uphold the principles of the UN Global Compact in our own small-scale operations and have enshrined these principles in our business processes. However, we anticipate that our greatest impact will be our ability to influence the practices and purchasing approaches of public sector agencies, so that government behaviour upholds the Global Compact’s principles. This is likely to be primarily in the areas of anti-corruption training, awareness raising (integrity, anti-corruption, whistleblower protections, etc) and upholding labour rights in the supply chain (through our procurement work). CourtHeath supports human rights initiatives relevant to our sphere of operation including workplace diversity. We also support clients that promote environmental initiatives in Victoria. In 2016 we commenced this journey, establishing our presence in the Victorian public sector as a Global Compact participant and an ethical and values-based organisation. We developed a website giving prominence to the UN Global Compact. Having been appointed to panels providing us access to government probity and procurement business, we are able to raise awareness of the UN Global Compact principles with government purchasers and policy makers. During 2018, CourtHeath was excited to observe: • the Victorian public sector promoting the sustainable development goals, and • tenderers to the Victorian government raising their UN Global Compact participation in response to the government’s new Social Procurement Framework effective from 1 September 2018.

HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 1.1. ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS CourtHeath is committed to respecting human rights in its work. Despite being a small consulting organisation, which does not have direct experience of human rights violations, we aim to encourage government agencies to engage in ethical purchasing and effective social procurement. This approach emphasises propriety in allocating public funds to further human rights, the creation of positive and sustainable social externalities, and the mitigation of inequality through empowerment of disadvantaged communities. More broadly, we endorse the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and aim to incorporate its standards in our policy and practice. Through rigorous due diligence, we pledge to avoid infringing the rights of others, and to take steps to avoid negative human rights impacts resulting from our work. We will adhere to international human rights standards in our activities and our relationships. This includes taking steps towards respect, protection and fulfilment for such rights as freedom of association and collective bargaining; the effective elimination of child labour and modern slavery; the elimination of all forms of racial and gender discrimination; and the realisation of a workplace which positively empowers its employees and people of the broader world without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, physical ability, or mental illness. Beyond these basic commitments, we intend to implement measures, which positively contribute to the realisation of human rights, in particular through the creation of a diverse, inclusive and accessible workplace. We believe this pledge places us in line with best-practice international standards regarding human rights. Among the human rights risks in the Australian government procurement sector are discrimination against disadvantaged groups based on gender, disability, race or ethnicity. Our specific human rights goals are to achieve improved effectiveness of ethical procurement as measured by purchasing agencies including effective tendering provisions. “Our specific human rights goals are to achieve improved effectiveness of ethical procurement as measured by purchasing agencies including effective tendering provisions.” 1.2. IMPLEMENTATION We have offered all staff practical ethics training provided by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which has raised staff awareness of human rights risks in procurement supply chain management. We have also trained CourtHeath staff about the Global Compact and its Ten Principles. CourtHeath has articulated responsibilities to respect, protect and fulfil human rights in the Our People policy. The Managing Director, ensuring strong leadership on human rights issues within the company, oversees this policy personally. We have promoted the Victorian government’s new Social Procurement Framework, assisting clients to tailor their tender schedules to elicit responses from tenderers that will facilitate involvement in projects of disadvantaged Victorians.

We have contributed to social justice initiatives globally, including publishing the following blog: • International Anti-Corruption Day http://www.courtheath.com.au/2-6-trillion-stolen-through-corruption/ We have a publicly available complaints policy to ensure accountability for human rights issues within our small company and would deal with alleged human rights issues through this confidential mechanism in accordance with the Our People policy. From our complaints policy: CourtHeath Consulting encourages a workplace with appropriate, ethical conduct, and recognises the right for complaints to be made about the conduct of our people, including employees and contractors. CourtHeath Consulting will take all reasonable steps to protect those involved in a complaint from any victimisation, as a result of such a complaint. Complaints will be managed confidentially, discreetly and courteously, and all records pertaining to complaints will be held in confidence. This Policy applies to CourtHeath Consulting personnel as well as clients and members of the public who make complaints relating to CourtHeath Consulting or to CourtHeath Consulting personnel. 2. LABOUR PRINCIPLES Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Pixel Perfect Pty Ltd trading as CourtHeath Consulting ABN 15 006 514 209 Page 4 of 12 CourtHeath UNGC Communication on Progress 091118.docx 2.1. ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS In keeping with the pursuit of equitable, transparent and accountable government and corporate institutions, CourtHeath recognises the importance of collective and individual labour rights. We affirm our commitment to the International Labour Organisation’s Core Conventions, and especially to the freedoms of association and collective bargaining and freedom from all forms of employment discrimination. Our work aims to promote ethical sourcing and procurement, working towards the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour, as well as the effective abolition of child labour. We have a diverse staff whose needs we strive to accommodate. We embrace flexible working hours and working from home, where this is the choice of the staff member in question. We are committed to providing compensation and benefits for employees, for instance in the case of workplace injuries. Our policy encourages adherence to the UN Global Compact labour principles from our business partners and suppliers. CourtHeath staff members participate in committees advocating inclusion, for example digital accessibility for people with a disability and diversity in the legal profession. 2.2. IMPLEMENTATION We have offered all staff practical ethics training provided by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which has raised staff awareness of labour rights risks in procurement supply chain management.

ENVIRONMENT PRINCIPLES Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 3.1. ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS CourtHeath has a publicly available environmental policy outlining its commitment and approach to environmental sustainability. This Policy can be accessed through our website at www.courtheath.com.au. We are committed to improving environmental performance across all of our business activities, and encourage our business partners and members of the wider community to share that commitment. We practice sustainable procurement, purchasing goods and services that are less damaging to the environment and human health. As a small business, the major items we purchase are commuter transport services, stationery and power. In its professional advisory services, CourtHeath has made a commitment to promote environmental sustainability. Where appropriate, we seek to educate and influence others (clients, community and sub-contractors). We are mindful of the opportunities that government purchasers have to set behavioural expectations of suppliers and the supply chain. This opportunity often arises in our procurement advice and particularly as we are drafting market invitation documents. We work with our clients to ensure that the specifications they publish reflect current best practice and identify suitable alternatives (both goods and services) which are environmentally friendly such as energy saving, recycled content, water saving, low toxicity or other significant attributes. We can direct clients to the full range of activities related to purchasing goods and services ranging from contracting for an entire service to purchasing small assets such as office equipment. Green purchasing spans the entire life cycle of the product or service from inception and design through to contract management and disposal of any redundant assets. 3.2. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES We aim to use the following criteria to measure our progress on environmental sustainability goals: • Ensuring that our office equipment and stationery (including lighting and paper products) are sourced sustainably • Ensuring that suppliers (such as website hosting providers and office providers) meet sustainability standards relevant to their various operations • Ensuring that our transport arrangements are sustainable where possible. Pixel Perfect Pty Ltd trading as CourtHeath Consulting ABN 15 006 514 209 Page 7 of 12 CourtHeath UNGC Communication on Progress 091118.docx Our awareness raising activities relevant to this area included a major commitment to fighting climate change: TAKE2 is Victoria’s collective climate change program supporting individuals, government, business and other organisations to help the state achieve net zero emissions by 2050. (Source) In 2018, CourtHeath took the TAKE2 pledge making a public commitment to tackle climate change as stated on our TAKE2 profile page. Featuring the work we have been doing to reduce our emissions, our page also includes our plans for the future and asks others to make the TAKE2 pledge and join us to help keep the temperature rise under two degrees. Our pledge in part: …to improve our environmental performance across all our business activities, and encourage our business partners and members of the wider community to do the same. We practice sustainable procurement, purchasing goods and services that are less damaging to the environment and human health. CourtHeath attended the annual address of the Young Professionals Network of the Victorian Chapter at the Institute of Public Administration Australia in July 2018.
