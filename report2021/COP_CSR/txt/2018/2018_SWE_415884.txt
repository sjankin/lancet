This increased focus is a step in the development of production logistics to increase productivity at the worksites. The goal is for JM’s worksites to have both fewer and smaller disruptions caused by the material supply chain. Sustainability work that benefits the business JM supports the UN’s Agenda 2030 and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Our own sustainability targets for 2030 are in line with the UN’s sustainability targets and will ensure our long-term focus in this area. JM also supports the UN’s Global Compact initiative and its principles regarding human rights, labor law, the environment and anti-corruption. Our operational targets and actual outcomes over the past three years are presented on page 37. In practice, our sustainability work uses these long-term targets as a guide and consists of a broad palette of priority areas – all of which are very valuable for both JM and society in general. Customers benefit from better homes, residents benefit from better neighborhoods, suppliers can work more efficiently and employees benefit from a more pleasant work environment. • All JM residential units that will be started as from 2018 will be certified in accordance with the Nordic Swan Eco­ label. The idea is that the efforts we have made over a ­period of years to create a healthy environment and sustainable development should be more visible for housing customers.

JM’s business is capital-intensive and requires effective utilization of the balance sheet. In order to maximize value generation, the starting point of an optimized capital structure must be based on the fact that different fields of activity have different requirements for capital when ­addressing their specific risks.

Concept phase – market analyses offer insight into customer need Good understanding of market development, customer need and demand forms the basis for generating value through project development. Thus JM regularly performs market surveys among its customer groups in order to ascertain need and preferences for issues ranging from type of housing to location and design. The customer needs and market development analysis generates ideas for how the offer can be attractively designed. Land with the right development potential – at the right price Projects generally start with acquisition of land. The market surveys that are regularly conducted to analyze customer preferences form an important basis for decision-making when acquiring land. Being able to acquire land with potential for development – at the right price – is a decisive factor in terms of implementing plans to produce attractive housing and achieve profitable project development. The land acquisition and concept phases are thus crucial in pro­ ject development. Planning process – defining land use The next step involves defining land use, which means building rights take shape with respect to their content. This step is performed in a dialogue with the municipality, which together with JM’s project manager determines how the land can be used. Property owners can influence the planning process, but it also depends on the municipal planning process and any appeals. It is during this stage – when ideas for the land are to be implemented and transformed into concrete plans for attractive neighborhoods – that the greatest part of value generation takes place. Pre-construction phase – with architects Next follows a pre-construction phase under the supervision of JM’s pre-construction manager. An architect produces drawings, and when the proposal has been approved, we involve consultants specializing in construction, land, electricity, ventilation, heating, sanitation, etc. A purchasing supervisor takes care of procurement processes, material and work orders, while the site manager plans the daily work. Sales process – via several different channels When the sales process begins, VIP customers receive advance information and have priority to JM’s homes. Our sales channels include our websites, Big Open House Days, social channels, etc. Production – secure and effective processes Construction does not begin until the number of reserved residential units reaches the predetermined target percentage. Site managers, foremen and others make sure work progresses safely and effectively. Many of JM’s teams have worked together for a long time, and their well-established and structured processes are an important aspect of value generation. Occupancy, management and housing services Production and completion continue until occupancy, after which JM@home offers both technical and economic management to the tenant-owners associations in order to ­provide them with a secure, stable foundation as well as selected housing services. The services ­offered via JM@home create added value after occupancy. Transfer of experience By sending surveys to customers, we create a Customer Satisfaction Index for each project, which together with experiences from the organization serves as the starting point for how to improve our future work. 24 JM ANNUAL REPORT 2017 PROFITABILITY / residential building rights Building rights – the basis for ­sustainable profitability JM continually invests in land that can be developed for future production.

It contains the values and behavior that should be promoted within JM. The Code is broken down by theme and guidelines are presented in each section. All of JM’s current employees have played “Right from me”, a game developed in-house with the aim of implementing and raising awareness for the Code of Conduct. New employees play the game during “New at JM Day”. Every week JM Competence presents a “dilemma of the week” for groups to discuss during department meetings or coffee breaks.

Wear-and-tear afflictions are one of the construction industry’s recurring development areas that generally has not undergone improvements.

We believe this will lead to a reduction in the number of wear-and-tear-related afflictions and the development of new working methods. Feel good In order to improve opportunities for follow-up, the system support for reporting illnesses and returning to work after an illness has been developed in Sweden. We offer our employees medical advice from a nurse in the event of illness. Total absence due to illness is 3.7 percent in Sweden, and short-term absence due to illness is 2.1 percent.

Long-term variable salary programs can be equity and/or cashrelated and will be performance-based and, at the time of commitment, be capped at 50 percent of fixed salary. Termination of employment is normally subject to a mutual period of notice of six months. If notice of termination is given by JM, severance pay equivalent to six months’ salary should also be payable. Pension benefits are either defined-benefit or defined-contribution, or a combination thereof, and the normal retirement age should be 65.

Cash flow for the first two years, after Closing residual value at end of year 15 12 2017, is based on the strategic plan adopted by the management. Cash flow beyond the strategic two-year period is extrapolated based on the following assumptions: • Estimated operating profit or loss based on the previous year’s results and expectations of future market developments note 12 Participations in associated companies • Growth rate of 2 percent (2) in order to extrapolate cash flow beyond the 2017 2016 strategic period. The growth rate is a conservative assumption of the operation’s Accumulated acquisition value long-term growth, not exceeding growth for the industry as a whole Opening balance, at beginning of the year 15 15 • Discount rate before tax is 8 percent (10), which is based on the JM Group’s New purchases – 0 average cost of capital before tax, while taking operation-specific data into Sales –14 0 account. At the end of the year 1 15 Sensitivity analysis If the estimated operating profit after the end of the strategy period had been 5 percent lower than the management’s assessment, the recoverable amount would decrease by 4 percent. If the estimated growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the strategy period had been 50 percent lower than the basic assumption, the recoverable amount would decrease by 12 percent. If the estimated average cost of capital applied for the discounted cash flow had been 3 percentage points greater than the basic assumption, the recoverable amount would decrease by 32 percent. A sensitivity analysis of the discount rate shows that the discount rate would have to exceed about 21 percent (23) before the need for impairment would arise. In all cases, the sensitivity analysis above shows a surplus (i.e. that the recoverable amount is higher than the carrying amount). None of the hypothetical cases above should lead to impairment of goodwill for the Norwegian business. 92 JM ANNUAL REPORT 2017 GROUP / notes note 13 Participations in joint operations and associated companies Specification of Parent Company’s shares and participation in joint operations and associated companies, SEK 000s Carrying amount Number of shares and parCompany CIN Domicile ticipations % of capital 2017 2016 Adolfsbergs Brunns AB 1) 556303-8685 Örebro 340 33 34 34 Dockan Exploatering AB 1) 556594-2645 Malmö 50,000 33 16,834 16,834 Exploateringsbolaget Högmora KB 1) 916643-6254 Stockholm 1 25 31 31 Fastighetsbolaget Glasberga KB 1) 916643-1842 Södertälje 1 25 101 101 Glasberga Fastighets AB 1) 556361-0707 Södertälje 1,000 25 100 100 HB Silverdal Exploatering 2) 969674-5802 Solna 1 1 Högmora Exploaterings AB 1) 556395-0707 Stockholm 1,000 25 100 100 Kvarnholmen Utveckling AB 1) 556710-5514 Stockholm 50,000 50 165,886 165,886 Kvibergstaden Exploatering HB 1) 969731-1695 Gothenburg 1 50 1 1 Mälarstrandens Utvecklings AB 1) 556695-5414 Västerås 44 44 2,200 2,200 SMÅA AB 3) 556497-1322 Stockholm – – – 13,854 Södra Centrum Krokslätt HB 1) 969777-2144 Stockholm 5,200 65 5,200 5,200 Carrying amount, at end of the year 190,488 204,342 1 ) Joint operations 2) Unlimited liability 3) Associated companies Specification of the Group’s other holdings of shares and participations in joint operations and associated companies, SEK 000s Carrying amount Number of shares and parCompany CIN Domicile ticipations % of capital 2017 2016 Fastighets AB Kranlyftet 556829-3251 Lidingö 250 50 135,226 135,226 Fjellgata 30 AS, Norway 997484983 Oslo 100 50 2,002 2,108 Fjellgata 30 KS, Norway 997485009 Oslo 45 45 7,207 7,589 Täby Park Exploatering AB 556833-6555 Stockholm 500 50 161,500 144,500 Grefsen Utvikling AS, Norway 982913209 Oslo 500 50 25,025 26,350 Hans Nielsen Haugesgate 50 AS, Norway 987719427 Oslo 60,000 50 23,420 26,407 Husebyplatået AS, Norway 913864948 Oslo 5,000 50 501 527 Larvik Saneringsselskap AS, Norway 918044051 Larvik 100 50 242 255 Lillestrøm Kvartal 37 AS, Norway 935267269 Lillestrøm 75 50 7,508 7,905 Lillestrøm Kvartal 37 Næring AS, Norway 919196416 Oslo 300 50 30 – Merbraine, Belgium 450160865 Brussels 625 50 304 283 Noreveien 26 AS, Norway 990351465 Oslo 10 50 88 92 Son Utvikling AS, Norway 990341419 Oslo 23,050 50 12,292 12,943 Spireaveien 6 Utvikling AS, Norway 998015340 Oslo 50 50 2,511 2,643 Spireaveien 6 Utvikling KS, Norway 998015375 Oslo 45 45 9,001 9,478 Strømmen Sentrum AS, Norway 911662256 Strømmen 7,000 50 7,007 7,378 Torstvet Utvikling AS, Norway 959639159 Larvik 5,000 50 11,553 – Carrying amount, at end of the year 405,417 383,684 Reclassification in the Group –595,222 –573,489 Carrying amount in the Group, at end of the year 683 14,537 The joint operations contain primarily properties for residential development.

See Note 23, Financial risk management and financial derivative instruments. In Sweden, JM AB initially raises a building loan in its own name for ongoing residential projects when a binding agreement is entered into with the tenant-owners association. At a later date, the building loan is transferred to the customer, the tenant-owners association, without any payment inflows or outflows. The liability is therefore reported net against JM’s receivable on the customer and is included in the items, “Recognized revenue less progress billings” or “Progress billings in excess of recognized revenue”. As at December 31, 2017, these building loans amount to 2,517m (1,716) and are not included in the interest-bearing liabilities above. The building loans have a short term and are interest-bearing.

PricewaterhouseCoopers AB Håkan Malmström Authorized Public Accountant Auditor-in-charge Ann-Christine Hägglund Authorized Public Accountant 108 JM ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Auditor’s report Auditor’s report To the general meeting of shareholders of JM AB (publ), corporate identity number 556045-2103 REPORT ON THE ANNUAL ACCOUNTS AND CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS Opinions We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of JM AB (publ) for the year 2017. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 72–108 in this document. In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of parent company as of December 31 2017 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of December 31 2017 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and the balance sheet for the parent company and the group. Our opinions in this report on the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11. Basis for opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, to the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Other matter The annual accounts and the consolidated accounts for the year 2016 were audited by another auditor who issued an auditor’s report dated February 20 2017 with unmodified opinions in the Report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. Our audit approach Audit scope We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements. We tailored our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the JM group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which JM operates. In a business such as JMs, our risk assessment is particularly influenced by the impact of the Board of Directors’ and management’s estimates and judgements on the financial statements. We have assessed the highest risk for misstatements in the financial statements to be the percentage-of-completion revenue recognition in the ongoing projects – in both the residential development business and the construction business. In addition, we have identified a number of other risks that also reflect components of estimates and judgements. Amongst those are warranty provisions, valuation of development and project properties, provisions for pensions and disputes. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of the Board of Directors’ and management overriding internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Based on the risk assessment the central audit team developed an audit strategy according to which the group audit has focused on the large components JM Residential Stockholm, JM Residential Sweden, JM Construction and the Norwegian operations within JM International which all have been subject to a so-called full audit. For the Finnish operation within JM International, specific procedures have been performed primarily for ongoing projects. With respect to JM Property Development and the building rights in Belgium, the examination has focused on the book values of project and development properties. The central audit team performs the audit of the Swedish components and issues, based on the audit strategy, instructions to the Norwegian and Finnish audit teams. JM’s signing auditors have also visisted JM’s Norwegian and Finnish operations and the local audit teams. The central team also audits relevant aspects of and controls over the JM group’s common information systems, including SAP ECC. The results of this examination are shared with local teams. Materiality The scope of our audit is influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. JM ANNUAL REPORT 2017 109 Auditor’s report Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. Key audit matters Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Reclassification of project financing in JM International When examining significant financial statement items we have as During 2017 JM has adjusted its financial reporting in that projapplicable evaluated the accounting principles applied in relation to ect financing in JM International has been reclassified.

The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for this other information. Our opinion on the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion on this other information. In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the President are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and the consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the assessment of the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the President intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The audit committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s responsibility Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts. A further description of our responsibility for the audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts is available on Revisors­ inspektionen’s website www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar. This description is part of the auditor’s report. REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Opinions In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the President of JM AB (publ) for the year 2017 and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the President be discharged from liability for the financial year. Basis for Opinions We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company’s and the group’s type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company’s and the group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general. The Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s organization and the administration of the company’s affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and the group’s financial situation and ensuring that the company’s organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The President shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors’ guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfil the company’s accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner. JM ANNUAL REPORT 2017 111 Auditor’s report Auditor’s responsibility Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the President in any material respect: • has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or • in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association. Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act. A further description of our responsibility for the audit of the administration is available on Revisorsinspektionen’s website: www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar. This description is part of the auditor’s report.
