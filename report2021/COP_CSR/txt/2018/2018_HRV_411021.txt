The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct contains rules and guidelines for our business conduct and responsibilities vis-à-vis colleagues, customers, guests, suppliers, shareholders and authorities. The Hotel is encouraging its application by employees of other companies working with the Hotel, including outsourced services. Each employee is personally responsible for abiding by this Code. The Code in short: 1. We respect the law 2. We show respect for all persons in all situations 3. We think ethically 4. We act fairly 5. We do not discriminate against anyone for any reason 6. We are honest and transparent 7. We are loyal to our employer 8. We do not exploit the company’s resources 9. We think of safety at all times 10. We take care of our planet Page 6 Global Compact Principles: Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Esplanade Zagreb conforms to all international and local declarations and laws on human rights. Key human rights issues for the Hotel include fair wages, women’s rights, skills requirements, the ability to join trade unions and collective bargaining. It is our policy to recruit, employ and promote qualified persons in all positions ensuring equal employment opportunity: we do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, religion, sexuality, age, national origin, ancestry or physical impairment. We have several colleagues with special needs. Our cooperation with two companies that employ only persons with disability is increasing on annual basis by 7 % We continue with providing good employment opportunities on short and long term basis for many students and trainees. Page 7 Principle 2: Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Esplanade Zagreb respects all restrictions and prohibitions of discrimination of employees – as regulated by the Labor Law of Croatia. We offer a variety of training tools geared towards our Hotel standards, service levels, business plan objectives and brand positioning, open to all of our employees. Furthermore, administration of personnel action programs such as compensation, benefits, promotions, distribution of tips, transfers, vacation use, paid leave based on social needs, free meals for all staff regardless of status, termination, lay-offs and training participation is performed in a non-discriminatory manner. After period of maternity leave all colleagues continue to work with us on the same position as before. Hotel has a zero tolerance for mobbing and such cases are attended to immediately. Page 8 Global Compact Principles: Labor Standards Principle 3: Businesses should support the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective negotiation The Hotel has concluded a Collective Agreement in 2004 between the Hotel as an employer and Hotel's branch of the Independent Union of the Hospitality Industry and Tourism of Croatia. In agreement with the Union an Annex to the Collective Agreement was drafted in 2010 with updates of those articles of the Collective Agreement that changed due to new regulations within the Croatian Labor law. New Collective Agreement has been signed in 2017. According to new agreement a new system of vacation accrual has been implemented respecting the weekly work schedule. The hotel’s Employees council is a representative entity which protects and promotes the interests of all employees in the hotel and insures the enforcement of the Labor law, the collective agreement and other relevant legal regulations. It also monitors the obligation of the employer of paying social insurance contributions. The hotel continues to assist in organizing meetings of the Union members by providing facilities as well as financially assisting in annual team building activities & professional competitions organized by the Union for union members. Meetings between the hotel management and Union representatives are held on a regular basis. Page 9 Principle 4: Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor. The Hotel is strictly following the Labor Law in Croatia regarding forced and compulsory labor. Furthermore, the Collective Agreement signed by the Hotel defines that the overtime cannot be given to: pregnant women minor employees Parents who work short time because he/she has to care for a child with special needs. A mother with a child to three years and a single parent with a child up to six years can work overtime if they give their written approval. To foster commitment to the hotel we organize staff parties on which we present Loyalty Award for staff with more than 10 years of employment in our company. Page 10 Principle 5: Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labor. Child labor is not accepted and does not exist within Hotel's operations. This is ensured through local hiring policies and Croatian Labor Law. Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. By signing the Collective Agreement the Hotel prohibited the discrimination in regards to: 1. equal employment terms, including criteria and conditions for selection of candidates to conduct certain work on all levels of professional hierarchy, 2. work promotion based on competencies and relevant experience, 3. equal access to all types and levels of professional training, gaining additional qualification or changing the qualification, 4. transparency in employment issues and work conditions including equality in payment, 5. termination of employment contract, 6. right to participate in employee associations or in any other professional organization, including privileges which come out of this membership. The Collective Agreement moreover stipulates that the Hotel is obliged to pay equal salaries to men and women for equal work and work of equal value in accordance to the Labor Law. In addition, tips are equally distributed within the relevant outlet. Page 11 Global Compact Principles: Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. The hotel has two certified representatives for waste management who are ensuring that the hotel is in line with all legal requirements and obligations in regards to waste disposal. Those certified representative’s coordinate work on a daily base with an outside contracted company certified for waste disposal which is in charge for the operational side of the work. The Hotel has an energy class E certificate, which is a quite low energy class explainable due to the fact that the hotel is situated in an old building which is under heritage protection and work/ modernization is limited due to those facts. However as in future plans a complete renovation of the hotel is foreseen this will impact the buildings sustainability, although still limited due to the heritage fact, processes will be applied that are environmental responsible and resource efficient, which will impact the energy class certificate. Economic use of energy continues with stable energy consumption in 2017. Comparison show a slight increase of consumption of energy in 2017 in comparison to 2016 which follows the increase of guest nights in 2017 compared to 2016. Page 12 The below presented graphs show total guest nights per month for the past three years (1), total number of guest nights for the past three calendar years (2), total consumption of electricity for the past three years (3) Number of guest night’s per month. Page 13 Guest nights (annual comparison) Electricity consumption kW/h Page 14 Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Beside ongoing projects like Fish Forward and Earth Hour, the Hotel introduced several new actions where guests are given option to act green; such as Think outside the bottle! As Zagreb tab water is safe for consumption we encourage guests to use tab water instead of bottled another option for guest to act green is the opportunity to opt for not changing linen (unless guests does not instruct otherwise linen are changed on a daily basis). Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. The Esplanade Zagreb hotel continues to follow and implement different working procedures and habits to enhance sustainable business practice. In 2017 we have introduced new equipment which decomposes bio waste to water; this water is disposed off into the sewage system but only after obtained approval of sanitary inspection.
