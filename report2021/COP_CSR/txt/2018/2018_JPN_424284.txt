The Component Solutions business, in which we mainly sell precision reduction gears for industrial robots and hydraulic equipment for construction machinery, showed substantial growth, while the Transport Solutions business, in which we focus on aircraft, marine vessel and railroad vehicle equipment, was rather stagnant.

It would be difficult to deal with ESG issues because most of them are qualitative issues, but I expect that Nabtesco will set numerical and visible targets as much as possible so that Nabtesco Value Report 2017 32 Dialogue on Governance Innovation to Make Effective Use of Human Resources Companies need to promote governance and effective use of human resources as the basis for their sustainable growth. Chairman Kazuaki Kotani talked with Outside Director Naoko Yamazaki about the measures taken for Nabtesco to meet these two important requirements, including its unique initiatives, current challenges and new ideas to enhance the measures. (Meeting held in a conference room of the company in April 2018.) Outside Director Chairman of the Board Nabtesco Corporation Nabtesco Corporation Naoko Yamazaki Kazuaki Kotani (Hereinafter their names will be listed without the titles.) 33 Nabtesco Value Report 2017 Dialogue on Governance: Innovation to Make Effective Use of Human Resources Section 01 time to discuss long-term growth strategies. If it is difficult to spend more time on these First impression of Nabtesco: Reliable technology and sincerity strategies at Board meetings, we might be able to talk with each other for brainstorming purposes before or after each of the meetings. Kotani: We might not have sufficiently discussed what we generally lack and what it takes About Nabtesco Group Kotani: Two years have passed since you became an outside director of our company. for us to foster mediumto long-term growth strategies. In my capacity as the chairperson What was your first impression of Nabtesco? Has that impression changed? If it has, could of Board meetings, I would like to discuss this also at the meetings. In fact, we have so you tell me how? many things to discuss at the meetings and we probably need to review the agenda. Yamazaki: By participating in the meetings of the Board of Directors, I found that Nabtesco Yamazaki: Was the number of items included on the agenda always as large as it is now? was a technology-oriented company that had reliable technologies and made sincere Kotani: In the past, no interim reports were made by the in-house companies at the meetefforts to develop products and promote its businesses. ings. However, some insisted that the presentation of the initial plans for the term and the This impression has not changed, but I have also recently found that the company is final reports on the results was not enough to allow Board members to have effective discusSection 02 implementing measures by looking far ahead. At present, it is implementing the mediumsions, and so we decided to include the presentation of the interim reports on the agenda. term management plan for 2020, but at Board meetings participants also discussed matters Yamazaki: I do think it better to include the presentation of the interim reports, and it looking beyond 2020, which I found very impressive. Nabtesco acquired OVALO in 2017 and I seems difficult to decrease the number of items to be included on the agenda. However, also have a strong sense of the company’s determination to speed up its globalization. I think it is possible to devise reporting methods that will reduce the time currently spent Kotani: We acquired OVALO to change Nabtesco, based on the belief that we should on explaining the present situation, so that we can focus more on important issues. In fact, Growth Strategies of change in order to survive in the market. you can grasp the financial data by reading the reference materials distributed before the Yamazaki: Discussions at Board meetings have certainly given me a sense of that strong Board meetings. determination. It is very meaningful for the company to have a large base in Europe, and it the Nabtesco Group will also be able to take a big step forward by expanding the scope of its business to include systems in addition to single products. Kotani: Nabtesco is highly rated as a component manufacturer, but we also need to supply systems to achieve further growth, and I am pleased that you are aware of this necessity. Section 03 Yamazaki: Adding OVALO to the Nabtesco Group leads to the integration of hardware and software technologies, and this gives Nabtesco a great advantage. I participated in discussions at Board meetings with the expectation that the integration would exert a positive influence over a range of components manufactured by Nabtesco and eventually enhance the overall value of its products. Measures to Solve ESG Issues Free-ranging discussions based on the appropriate provision of information Kotani: What do you think about the Board of Directors? Yamazaki: Nabtesco provides me and the other outside directors with sufficient information and does so very openly, and I think that the company is reliable in that it allows us to discuss issues freely. Also, the agenda of the Board meetings is determined and necessary explanations are made in a very thoughtful manner. However, I think we need much more Nabtesco Value Report 2017 34 Dialogue on Governance that you established the Nomination Committee when you were the CEO of the company. Kotani: Yes, I established it in 2015, one year before resigning from the position of CEO. Earlier, in 2012, or one year after becoming the CEO, I was asked by one of the outside directors about the nomination of my successor, and this caused me to think about founding a nomination committee. But the Remuneration Committee was established first, and the related discussions led to the step-by-step introduction of a nomination committee to the company. We have enough time before the next nomination. The Nomination Committee, which is now composed of five members, including yourself, while it was composed of three in the past, will hold deeper-level discussions to select new Board members in addition to choosing the future CEO. Yamazaki: It is wonderful that members are able to share the evaluation criteria and engage in discussion based on the shared criteria. I have already received reference materials about the candidates for the next CEO and Board members and I am conducting examinations. But I am a bit worried about the fact that no specific discussions have been held regarding how to ensure sufficient training is provided to the candidates. Kotani: The Nomination Committee is also responsible for the training of the next management team, but the members of the restructured committee have not yet discussed at great length the training of the future management team members. I would like to provide the committee with an opportunity for such discussion as soon as possible. At Nabtesco, the Human Resources Department implements training programs for Kotani: Yes, indeed. We might have to review the reporting details in order to discuss young and mid-ranked employees for their development, but for the training of employees things more efficiently at Board meetings within the limited time available. You have kindly in higher positions, we have not yet undertaken the necessary full-scale examinations said “in a very thoughtful manner,” and in fact people at our company tend to think that within the company. At Board meetings, it is sometimes pointed out that employees can they need to offer detailed explanations to outside directors to help them deepen their develop themselves quickly by experiencing and overcoming hardships overseas, where understanding of the company’s situation. they are all alone. In fact, if you are transferred to an affiliate of Nabtesco located outside Yamazaki: I can understand that reporters have things that they definitely want to comJapan, you will assume a managerial position that is higher than your previous position in municate. However, we also have things that we want to ask at Board meetings. So you can Japan and you will take more responsibility for the growth of the business. And there are omit the explanations about things that can be easily understood by reading the reference no senior staff members around you whom you can immediately rely on, or junior staff materials and instead allocate more time to the Q&A session, thereby making Board meetmembers who understand you and work for you. If you have to work in such a situation, you ings more meaningful. will naturally develop into a “multi-player.” Yamazaki: You have worked overseas yourself. The Nomination Committee gives consideration also to Kotani: I visited various regions in Asia as a salesperson and also got experience working the development of the next management team as a senior vice president at an affiliate of Nabtesco in Indonesia. However, we do not have enough overseas positions involving managerial responsibilities to give all candidates for top management a chance to develop themselves. Also, it would be strange if “working Kotani: I would like to take this opportunity to ask your opinions about the Nomination overseas” were deemed to be a precondition for employees to assume the position of CEO Committee. or director, and we need to establish a system under which our people can have a range of Yamazaki: I feel honored to have been appointed a member of the committee. I have heard experiences even if they don’t go abroad. It is certainly a difficult issue, and let me repeat 35 Nabtesco Value Report 2017 Dialogue on Governance: Innovation to Make Effective Use of Human Resources Section 01 that we need to begin discussing how to develop a future management team as early as of service. It means that many female workers continue to work for the company even after possible, as you have pointed out. getting married and giving birth, and also while raising their children. In this respect, it can be said that Nabtesco provides women with a workplace where they can work comfortably. However, regarding promotion, I feel it is a shame that there are few female employees Women’s participation in society delayed in Japan compared with overseas About Nabtesco Group who want to move up the career ladder at Nabtesco. In particular, female workers at the plants mostly want to remain in their current positions. It is of course up to individuals what Yamazaki: Under the current medium-term management plan, you are committed to they value, but I am still worried that they limit the scope of work that they can perform befocusing on the solution of ESG issues, and work style reform and diversity promotion are cause there are still only a few female managers at the company who can be a role model for regarded as important management themes. For these issues I feel I am very much exthem. It might therefore be difficult for female workers to even aspire to become managers. pected to play a central role and really want to fulfill that role. Kotani: I was briefed on the results of this questionnaire survey by the head of the Human Kotani: For diversity, in particular for women’s participation in society, I have long felt Resources Department. Female employees who were highly motivated to get a promotion Section 02 that Japan is different from other countries. As a salesperson, I visited or worked in ASEAN when they joined the company seem to go one of two ways after they got married and gave countries, such as Indonesia, as well as Taiwan and China, where women were working on birth: those who want to be promoted while raising their children and those who give up on the same level as men. The same applies to the United States and Europe, which I subsethe idea of getting a promotion after their return to work. It is of course important to requently visited frequently. In these countries, female managers proactively contributed at spect their individual ideas, but if the work environment discourages them from wanting a meetings. A female representative of Boeing once asked me why participants in the meetpromotion, we need to think about how we can provide them with appropriate support. Growth Strategies of ings with Nabtesco were all men, and she also asked me, “Shall I give a talk to your female Yamazaki: I think you need to make small improvements one by one.

Kotani: If improvements are made to the working environment from a unique female Yamazaki: I think the situation in the United States was also not very good in the past perspective, it will also help reduce the risk of occupational accidents. I would like to follow and it has improved over the past 30 years. A series of improvements have been made to your proposal at once. change the situation. Yamazaki: Small changes will encourage women to make more meaningful contributions Section 03 Kotani: Yes, indeed. They have made steady progress in that country. Why can’t Japan do at manufacturing facilities and eventually encourage more women to aim at becoming the same thing? Recently, a decrease in the working-age population following a decrease managers. in the birth rate has started to become a social problem in Japan, but if the participation rate of women in the labor force, which has been low, is increased, the shortage of workers It takes at least 10 years to change the way workers think Measures to Solve will be mitigated. Also, from this perspective, diversity promotion is a management priority and I think it is urgently necessary for us to foster work style reform and remove hurdles that prevent women from working in a way that is comfortable for them. Kotani: In Japan’s manufacturing industry, the percentage of female employees is generally low. At Nabtesco too, the rate hovers at around 10% on an unconsolidated basis. But ESG Issues the number of female employees has been increasing over recent years at our company, How to support women who want to move up the career ladder including those who have worked long enough to be promoted to managerial positions. I still think it will take some more time for women to achieve parity with men in terms of Yamazaki: I read the results of the questionnaire survey conducted in 2015 targeting all managerial positions at Nabtesco. female employees who had been working for Nabtesco for three years or longer, and found Yamazaki: It takes time to develop human resources and it is indeed difficult to change peoout that at Nabtesco female employees are on par with male employees in terms of length ple’s way of thinking. I therefore think it is necessary to make plans with 10-year intervals. Nabtesco Value Report 2017 36 Dialogue on Governance manner will contribute to changing how people think about their work. Kotani: The number of female managers might increase to some extent at our company Kotani: Apart from participating in grassroots activities such as the “Chikyu Kyoshitsu” over the next four to five years, but in the end it will take a total of around 10 years from project, Nabtesco needs to enhance its ability to convey messages. Even if we conduct quite now for female employees to be promoted to even higher positions. I think that they will valuable activities, it will be meaningless if they are not widely recognized by the public. find their jobs more interesting as they assume higher positions and get more empowered.

I found the job interesting and worked to get a sage to the world outside the company, it will also have an impact on those inside the company. higher position so I could do something I found even more interesting. Kotani: You are conducting a range of activities to foster the empowerment of women, including working as the Chirperson of Japanese Rocket Society “Sorajo” board and an How to adopt and evaluate diverse work styles ambassador for the Women’s Initiative in Developing STEM Career (WINDS). What are the topics that often come up in discussions in these activities? Yamazaki: In fact, today I also had a lunch meeting on women’s empowerment in business, Kotani: Last year, the CEO once again declared that the company would foster work style which was held by the APEC Business Advisory Council. At the meeting, I talked to other particreform, although we have been repeatedly mentioning this reform for several years now. ipants about how to make the social environment more conducive to women’s empowerment. Under the slogan of changing our way of thinking, habits and future, we have also established In meetings like this, it is often pointed out that in Japan women tend to be stereotyped a new organization to promote the reform. Please tell me your opinion about such activities. and traditional values are hard to shift. I have said that it is difficult to change the way Yamazaki: It is important to approve a range of work styles, which will help promote people think and it is therefore important to raise the awareness of the younger generadiversity and women’s empowerment.

However, at the head office, about 10% of employees reportedly work from home. There is no doubt that it is a waste of time and About Nabtesco Group effort for employees to commute to workplaces in the Tokyo metropolitan area during rush hour, and adopting a work-from-home system might mean a lot for us. However, we need to talk more about introducing diverse work styles to the entire company, including discussing the performance evaluation methods. Yamazaki: The introduction of diverse work styles might make the personnel evaluation and wage systems more complex and impose more burdens on managers. I still think the company should take on this challenge. Section 02 Kotani: We are engaged in B-to-B business, in which we cannot make achievements in the short-term. What we are tackling now will bring about results in several months at the earliest and in as many as three to four years in some cases. How we evaluate these achievements is a difficult issue. However, as the CEO has said, we need to think about “how we can make our jobs easier” and I feel that our people are steadily moving in this direction. Growth Strategies of the Nabtesco Group With a focus on technology and human resources Wanting to contribute to greater corporate value Kotani: So, finally, could you tell me about your future aspirations? Section 03 Yamazaki: I have been serving in this position for two years, and have a deeper understanding of the businesses conducted by Nabtesco. It is now clear to me that two of the most important capitals that give Nabtesco tremendous corporate value are its technology and human resources. For even greater corporate value, I want to support the provides us with opportunities to review our way of thinking.

ESG Issues and diversity promotion among the broader population, I want to encourage employees to raise their own awareness while increasing the company’s public profile as a company whose employees are highly motivated. I also want to have a meeting with female employees of Nabtesco, whom we have mentioned in today’s meeting. Kotani: In my capacity as the chairperson of Board meetings, I should ensure that outside directors, who are experts in different fields, can freely express their opinions at the meetings. Outside directors ask questions and give opinions beyond the framework of the conventional wisdom inside the company, which is certainly scary but also Nabtesco Value Report 2017 38 Road Map for Growth By providing products and services to customers, the Nabtesco Group will contribute to solving social challenges through business and strive to provide value on a continuous basis.
