business the PRESIDENT AND CEO right way, and I’m humbled by the work we’ve done so far. This report proves that Deckers is more than just a company – we are a company with a heart and soul. We are a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories and our global scale is significant. Equally significant is the responsibility we have to set an example in our industry by advancing sustainable business. We are protecting human rights, doing good in the communities in which we operate globally, and preserving the environment for future generations. As such, our FY18 Corporate Responsibility Report focuses our movement toward achieving our sustainable development goals (“SDGs”) in the following categories: • “People” (Human Rights, Gender Equality/ Reduced Inequalities/Quality Education); • “Purpose” (Community); and • “Planet” (Materials, Waste, Chemicals, Climate and Clean Energy, Water). We have detailed certain FY19 targets in each of these categories and we have adopted some long term goals related to our “7 by 2027”. We hope that this layout will prove to be a clearer indication of what we are hoping to achieve in this space. As FY18 comes to a close, I found myself reflecting on what it means to be part of a company that is I know that in order to make a big impact we all need to believe in the power that we have, individually and driven to make an impact on the world around us collectively, to move the needle. That is why in FY19, and the people that inhabit it.

Making our mark on the global marketplace while Sincerely, remaining socially and environmentally conscious is fundamentally important to our success as a company. We recognize that you can’t have one without the other, and we seek this kind of balance Dave Powers through everything we do. President and Chief Executive Officer MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 1 WELCOME INTRODUCTION Growth isn’t in the steps we take, but the paths we create. Deckers is driven by a commitment to developing quality brands and doing business in the right way. 2016 marked a big year for us we joined the United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”), the world’s largest voluntary corporate citizenship initiative, and adopted our sustainable development goals (our “7 by 2027”). The UNGC has outlined 17 categories of sustainable development goals (“SDGs”). Per UNGC guidance, Deckers will focus our efforts in those categories of SDGs where we can have the most impact. We’ve always had big dreams to make the world a better place, and this union opened a number of doors for us to set these dreams into motion. We have already made incredible progress, and each year we look forward to providing more insight into the attention that goes into reaching and exceeding these goals. We’re energized by the challenges we encounter along the way, and humbled by the power of community that makes this all possible. This Corporate Responsibility Report gives an insider’s perspective on how we’ve gone above and beyond to serve our community, fine-tune our ethical supply chain, and significantly reduce our environmental impact. This journey to sustainability shapes us as an organization and constantly reminds us of what’s important—our people, our purpose, and the planet.

As a voluntary, employee-led group, the Voices team holds events that celebrate our uniqueness, elevating employee issues, community concerns, needs and policies the Global Deckers Family is passionate about. Conceived in 2016 and rebranded at the end of FY18, this initiative seeks the diverse perspective of our workforce which makes Deckers a special place to work. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 8 PEOPLE FEMALE LEADERSHIP & EMPOWERMENT INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY International Women’s Day is a formal opportunity for us to recognize the year-round contribution and achievement of all women at Deckers. From our executive team to our supply chain employees, women play a crucial role in our organization—and that doesn’t go unnoticed. This year, UGG launched a multi-channel donation campaign where 5% of the retail price of all www.ugg.com and United States store purchases in the days surrounding International Women’s Day (March 8, 2018-March 11, 2018) went back to supporting HERproject programs. HERproject is a collaborative initiative managed by BSR (Business for Social Responsibility) that strives to empower low-income women working in global supply chains. HERproject EXPANSION UGG and HERproject joined forces back in 2016. Since then, we have launched HERproject trainings at a total of 6 factory partners (1 in FY17 and 5 in FY18). Through this program, we have trained approximately 10,976 women in our supply chain with plans to train a total of 30,000 women by 2020. The growth of HERproject gets us closer to our goal of providing guidance on health, financial inclusion and gender equality in the workplace to 100,000 women globally by 2027. WOMEN’S LEADERSHIP SUMMIT Deckers is always cultivating opportunities for collaboration. The Women’s Leadership Summit, ideated in FY18 but took place in FY19, is a prime example of this. The summit was created by female leaders at Deckers with a shared desire to create change that extends beyond the walls of the workplace.

We’ve taken it upon ourselves to set a high standard for the industry as a whole, with zero tolerance for human rights violations. In 2008, we adopted our ESC Guidelines which evolved to our Ethical Supply Chain Supplier Code of Conduct implemented in 2011. Our Ethical Supply Chain Supplier Code of Conduct covers our stance on forced labor, child labor, wages and benefits, hours of work/ overtime, non-discrimination, harassment, freedom of association/collective bargaining, health and safety, and environmental standards. Additionally, we have established performance scorecards for our Tier 1 partners. Further, for our primary factories, Deckers executives and factory owners/senior management meet to evaluate overall performance in the areas of labor rights, overtime, water and energy usage, and lean manufacturing. We require full and open access to all facilities producing Deckers brands product and conduct audits or reviews annually, at minimum. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 10 PEOPLE PARTNER PERFORMANCE: AUDIT RANKINGS Every year, we place trust in Deckers-authorized compliance auditors or accredited third-party auditors to conduct our carefully outlined performance audits based on International Labor Organization core labor standards. In FY18, our Ethical Supply Chain team audited every single one of our Tier 1 partners, including 24 in-person audits for direct sourced Tier 1 factories, 8 onsite audits for our key Tier 2 partners, and 96 desktop assessments for Agent/ Licensees sourced suppliers (which mostly focus on lifestyle products), and lifestyle/non-footwear facilities. The majority of our partners—82% to be exact—are identified as premier or preferred partners, meaning they received an audit score of either 85-100% or 70-84% respectively. 11% of our partners fell into our partner improvement program, meaning they received an audit score of 60-69% and were accepted with conditions. 7% of our partners were on our partner improvement program pending rejection, meaning they received an audit score of 59% or below. We had more partners in our partner improvement program than last year, but this is likely in part to shifting additional production to Vietnam and working with new Tier 1 partners who are evolving to meet our high standards. As we grow, one of the greatest challenges we face is in maintaining our high standards of quality and ethics, while constantly striving to optimize our operations. We’re confident that we will be able to continue improving and will remain transparent along the way. 4% Premier Partner Audit 5% 1% Premier Partner Audit 5% 7% Score 85%-100% Score 85%-100% Preferred Partner Audit Preferred Partner Audit FY18 T1 Score 70%-84% FY18 Score 70%-84% PARTNER SUPPLIERS ESC 11% FACTORIES Partner Improvement Program PERFORMANCE Partner Improvement Program PERFORMANCE Accepted with Conditions Audit Accepted with Conditions Audit Score 60%-69% Score 60%-69% 78% Partner Improvement Program Partner Improvement Program Pending Rejection Audit 89% Pending Rejection Audit Score 0%-59% Score 0%-59% Premier Partner Audit 6% Premier Partner Audit 14% 3% Score 85%-100% 5% Score 85%-100% 2% Preferred Partner Audit Preferred Partner Audit 9% FY17 T1 Score 70%-84% FY17 Score 70%-84% PARTNER SUPPLIERS ESC FACTORIES Partner Improvement Program PERFORMANCE Partner Improvement Program PERFORMANCE Accepted with Conditions Audit Accepted with Conditions Audit Score 60%-69% Score 60%-69% 75% Partner Improvement Program Partner Improvement Program Pending Rejection Audit 86% Pending Rejection Audit Score 0%-59% Score 0%-59% MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 11 PEOPLE PARTNER AUDITS: MOST COMMON CATEGORIES OF NON-COMPLIANCE By embracing full transparency, we are FY18 TOP GLOBAL FINDINGS motivated to hold ourselves accountable for the guidelines we set into motion. While we have a lot to be proud of in the past year, we recognize that there are areas that may require additional attention. INSUFFICIENT EXCESSIVE FIRE SAFETY OVERTIME MANAGEMENT The most prevalent findings of noncompliance at our factories in FY18 were excessive overtime, insufficient benefits, PREVALENT insufficient first aid, insufficient social HUMAN RIGHTS insurance and insufficient fire safety RISKS IN OUR management. INSUFFICIENT INDUSTRY INSUFFICIENT SOCIAL BENEFITS INSURANCE We plan to create more focused training in FY19. These areas of non-compliance are common in our industry so we intend to INSUFFICIENT collaborate with our peers to influence our FIRST AID factories to ensure industry best practice. ETHICAL SUPPLY CHAIN RELATED TRAINING HOURS A key element to upholding an Ethical Supply Chain is education for all parties involved. Our business partners are armed with knowledge about best Ethical Supply Chain practices and we plan to increase the amount of trainings we offer in the coming years. In FY18, our Ethical Supply Chain Team spent approximately 197.5 hours training our suppliers, agents, licensees, and manufacturers on a variety of topics including, but not limited to: health and safety regulations, benefits and excessive overtime. In FY19, we plan to increase our Ethical Supply Chain related trainings by 6.3% to approximately 210 hours. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 12 PEOPLE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF FACTORY EMPLOYEES Although we do not own any factories, which is common in our industry, we consistently review our partner facilities to ensure they offer a safe environment. The health and safety of our own employees as well as those working to produce our products is something we take very seriously. While this is a challenge, we strive to immerse ourselves in every step of the manufacturing process in order to maintain our high standards of safety and ethics. All employees in the extended Deckers family should be able to feel secure about their well-being at work. That’s why we set a system of checks and balances in the form of our yearly factory onsite assessment. We monitored 28 of our core partners including footwear suppliers, outsole/midsole factories, and tanneries, for any health and safety issues that arose throughout the year. It saddens us to report a single fatal incident in FY18 where a partner factory employee working on an unrelated brand encountered an exploding pressure vessel on a lasting line. We brought together our Ethical Supply Chain Team, Deckers upper management, and factory representatives to investigate the situation and prevent this from happening in the future. The findings of the investigation were carefully reviewed and we offered suggestions and solutions where possible. In FY19, we plan to continue on our pledge to monitor health and safety issues through thoughtful onsite audits and regular trainings, creating a safer place of work for our extended Deckers family. See below for FY18 health and safety performance rating as well as FY19 targets. PERFORMANCE UNITS FY18 FY19 MEASURE PERFORMANCE TARGET Lost Time Injury Rate Cases x 200,000/ (LTIR) total hours worked 0.39 0.35 Total Recordable Cases x 200,000/ Incident Rate (TRIR) total hours worked 0.45 0.40 * Note: We used OHSA standards to get the above calculation.

UGG contributes to HERproject, a collaborative initiative managed by BSR (Business for Social Responsibility) that strives to empower low-income women working in global supply chains. The brand also participates in the Textile Exchange’s Kickstart Program, which accelerate the availability of Responsible Wool Standard certified wool into supply chains. A RWS certification ensures that sheep are treated with respect to their five freedoms, and ensures best practices in the management and protection of land. UGG also partners with Happy Hearts Fund, an organization which rebuilds safe, resilient schools in areas impacted by natural disasters. In FY19, UGG will contribute to Save The Waves, and Protect Our Winters, two organizations who help educate on the impact of climate change and focus on protecting our coastline and our planet respectively. TEVA supports the Los Padres ForestWatch alongside the Conservation Alliance, the only local nonprofit organization protecting wildlife, wilderness, and clean water throughout the Los Padres National Forest and other public lands along California’s central coast. Teva also works with the Wilderness Youth Project, whose mission is to foster confidence, health and a life-long love of learning for young people and families through active outdoor experiences and mentoring. SANUK has teamed up with the Surfrider Foundation to protect clean water, healthy beaches and defend our coastline. Sanuk also supports Surf Happens, a local community-based business which provides an outlet for under served kids and at-risk youth. HOKA, SANUK, AND TEVA collectively support Camber Outdoors, the sole national organization dedicated to achieving women’s equality in the active-outdoor industries. SANUK AND TEVA also contribute to the Outdoor Industry Association, a thought-leader in the industry for recreation and trade policy, sustainable business innovation and increasing outdoor participation. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 16 PURPOSE PRODUCT DONATIONS In addition to the charitable contributions noted above, we have donated product to multiple organizations further helping those in need. Deckers partners with Good360 and Soles4Souls to recover and repurpose returns and post-consumer shoes. The benefit of these valued partnerships is two-fold—partly for the individuals we help, and for the environment we work so hard to preserve. Our work with these organizations allows us to close the loop on our product lifecycle, meaning less product destined for landfill and more shoes on the feet of those living in poverty-stricken regions across the globe. Since 2006, we have donated 810,769 pairs of shoes through our partnership with Soles4Souls. In providing quality footwear, children are able to attend school comfortably and adults are able to find work through various microenterprises. In FY18 alone, Deckers donated 64,018 pair of shoes to Soles4Souls. In addition to the donation Deckers made, the Sanuk, Teva, and Hoka brands came together and donated 28,600 pairs of shoes to the Hurricane Harvey Relief Program. Hurricane Harvey was the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. since Wilma in 2005, and our brands stepped up to the plate to provide relief to the communities affected by this devastating event. Since 2014, we’ve donated 8,291 shoes to Good360, a non-profit organization that distributes shoes to local charities throughout the U.S. In FY18 alone, Deckers donated 888 pairs of shoes to Good360. EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEER EFFORTS Altruism is a shared sentiment at Deckers, and we are committed to doing everything in our power to challenge the status quo and make a difference. Our President and CEO said it best: “The gift of compassion and your time is the best way to make a difference in the lives of others.” We’re grateful to be able to give back to our communities in a tangible, monetary way, but we also see the value in showing up for the people that need us. That’s why we rally our employees to dive in to the issues that energize them—compensating them up to 24 hours of volunteer time each year. In FY18, our employees based in the U.S. volunteered approximately 1,941 hours while our APAC team volunteered 1,303 hours. We’re excited to share that our EMEA employees have planned their first corporate volunteer effort for FY19 which we will cover in our FY19 report. FY19 is already proving to be a record-setting year for employee volunteer efforts and we look forward to sharing how Deckers employees have truly made a difference. We recognize that a lot of employees volunteer but unfortunately do not record their time so it is difficult to track we intend to improve upon this in FY19.

It’s our goal to bring more sustainable materials into the supply chain, but the first step is attaining a better understanding of what materials we use and how often we use them. As part of our promise of transparency, our materials team began to examine the ins and outs of what our products REPURPOSED WOOL are made with. This exercise gives us context for the 40% POLYESTER 36.89% choices we’ve made in the past, and the resources we need to move forward. WOOL Our most commonly used fiber material (40%), UGGpure, 7% COTTON is repurposed wool. As part of an ongoing effort to 10% eliminate waste, most of this wool is sheered from the hides that we are already using in our products. RECYCLED OTHER ACRYLIC NYLON ORGANIC POLYESTER Polyester is our second largest fiber material by use FIBERS 1% 4% COTTON .11% 1% 0% (37%), followed by cotton (10%) and wool (7%). The following charts show the materials used by each brand. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 18 PLANET OUR FIBER MATERIALS BASELINE STUDY CONTINUED The intention behind this study is to pinpoint opportunities for improvement. Now that we have a solid understanding of where we stand in terms of fiber materials used, we can identify next steps for introducing more sustainable materials to our supply chain. There is always room for improvement, and we aren’t afraid to challenge ourselves to create the best products for our consumers and the environment that surrounds us. After seeing our fiber materials baseline study, the Teva brand has already surpassed their goal set by the Textile Exchange of using 25% more recycled polyester by 2020. We’ll cover the exciting details in our FY19 CR report. Our best work is done when it serves the world around us. All in all, this study proves that our teams are willing to come together to set higher standards for themselves and Deckers as a whole. We look forward to making even more progress towards sustainable materials in FY19.

Another crucial element to ensuring an ethical supply chain is to know where everything comes from. Our fiber materials baseline study was a huge mile marker for us, and we took it a step further and began tracing our materials back to their country of origin. In FY18, we were able to identify the country of origin for 100% of our hides. It was our goal in FY17 to achieve this goal by 2020, and we are proud to report that we reached it two years early. See below for a full breakdown of our traceability project: • 39% of our hides come East Asia and Pacific • 28.8% of our hides come from North America • 15.60% of our hides come from Latin America • 14.4% of our hides come from Europe and Central Asia • 1.2% of our hides come from Sub-Saharan Africa • 1% of our hides come from South Asia Knowing this, we’re able to take a clearer look at exactly how these materials are sourced, and take the necessary steps in eliminating any inhumane treatment of animals as well as sustainability issues. While identifying the country of origin for our materials strongly supports our strict animal welfare expectations, we decided to take it a step further and trace our hides all the way to the processing facility. While the meat industry is full of complexity, it’s essential to approach this step holistically and consider every detail that goes into manufacturing our footwear. Our hides are currently purchased as a byproduct of the meat industry. The cycle works like this: the meat industry purchases the animals from the farmers, the tanneries purchase hides directly from the meat processing facilities, and we buy from those tanneries. As we head into FY19, we aim to trace 80% of our hides back to the processing facility. This is a lofty but highly attainable goal that represents another way that we challenge ourselves to do better.

The UNGC is the world’s largest voluntary corporate citizenship initiative with over 8,000 participating companies. As a member of the United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”) for the past two years, we’re able to leverage the UNGC and its network to aid in our efforts to attain our corporate sustainability goals. TEXTILE EXCHANGE’S KICKSTART PROGRAM At Deckers, we have absolutely no tolerance for animal cruelty. In FY18, we joined the Textile Exchange’s Kickstart Program in order to bring smaller, family-owned farms into the Responsible Wool Standard initiative and increase the availability of certified wool in supply chains. This will not only benefit Deckers directly, but will have a ripple effect on the industry as a whole, creating more access to responsibly grown wool. Our donation has already helped 50 small farm operations become Responsible Wool Standard certified—something that these small farms would not normally be able to afford. This kind of milestone sets a precedent for the rest of the industry, motivating other companies to take action. LEATHER WORKING GROUP As expressed throughout this report, our materials and supply chain are a huge part of our journey to corporate sustainability. In FY18, we sourced 99.2% of our leathers from Leather Working Group certified tanneries which maintain protocols that promote sustainable and appropriate environmental business practices within the leather industry. 100% is just around the corner, and a goal that we are confident we will hit in FY19. This achievement is critical in our progress towards reaching our sustainable development goals year after year. LEATHER WORKING GROUP’S ANIMAL WELFARE GROUP A large segment of our traceability efforts is focused on how our leather is sourced. One of Deckers valued partnerships is with the Leather Working Group’s Animal Welfare Group (“AWG”). The primary objective of the AWG is the education of the leather value chain on the long and short of animal welfare. This group prioritizes their efforts around traceability, slaughter protocols, assurance schemes and risk mapping. RECOGNITION TEXTILE EXCHANGE MARKET REPORT LEADERBOARD In FY18, Deckers was recognized as a leader in the sourcing of down in the Textile Exchange’s Market Report Leaderboard, largely in part to our ceaseless commitment to transparency. Specifically, we released a public-facing policy that outlines our requirement to use only Responsible certified down. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 21 PLANET 3D TECHNOLOGY At Deckers, we are always seeking innovative ways to improve our processes and help us reach our goals at an accelerated pace. In FY18, our brand General Managers set out on a mission to increase their usage of 3D Technology by 15% in FY19. 3D Technology can be introduced at any point of the manufacturing process, saving time, money, and material. The benefit of using this technology is multi-faceted—it increases our production accuracy and subsequently creates less waste. This presents a remarkable opportunity for our manufacturing teams, and we highly anticipate seeing the amount of waste our brands can avoid after increasing the use of 3D Technology in FY19 and beyond. VEGAN PRODUCT Deckers is well aware that some consumers seek vegan products. We decided to expand our product offerings to show that not only are we listening to the needs and requests of our consumers, but we understand the environmental benefit of these choices. Deckers is proud to report that in FY19, Teva, Sanuk, and Hoka brands are offering certain styles that are entirely vegan, and we invite our consumers to check out these styles online or email us using the contact information at the end of this report to learn more. PACKAGING REDUCTION EFFORTS In order to take a well-rounded approach to examining our entire supply chain, in FY18 we decided to delve into what makes up our packaging materials. Like we did for our materials, a baseline study for packaging materials and fibers used in textiles was carried out and will shape our FY19 targets.

It’s no small number, so we must work hard to ensure that every single chemical used in our products is safe for our workers, consumers, and the environment. Our Restricted Substances List, which is updated annually, outlines testing limits for all Deckers Brands products and lists all chemical substances that are legally restricted globally. We’re glad to report that in FY18, the restricted substances materials test failure rate was only 2.4%, a decline from the 3.5% reported failure rate in FY17. This noticeable reduction can be attributed to our Restricted Substances Team’s hands-on effort to train and educate our partners on our policies and best practices, rather than simply monitoring them.

One of our sustainability goals is to integrate climate change measures at every level of our business. To help us drive toward accomplishing this goal, in FY18 we installed solar panels at our Goleta headquarters. To bring more visibility to these efforts we installed multiple informational kiosks in our lobby and Brand Showcase to give our employees and in-store visitors a virtual tour of our state-of-the-art solar electric system, the energy we are producing and the positive effects on the environment. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 26 PLANET ELECTRICITY USAGE AT OUR CORPORATE OFFICES In FY18, our Corporate HQ electric energy usage averaged approximately 1.017 kwh/sqft. This is a slight increase from last year’s average of approximately 0.7423 kwh/sqft which we can likely credit to the multiple natural disasters Santa Barbara suffered from during this reporting period. Our corporate office in Flagstaff Arizona averaged approximately 1.018 kwh/ sqft (see energy chart below for reference). We’ll continue to monitor this energy usage each year, and our full transparency allows us to constantly seek areas for improvement. Thanks to our solar panel installation, we anticipate being able to offset our electric electricity usage by 25% in FY19 and beyond. ELECTRICITY USAGE AT OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER LOCATIONS In addition to tracking energy use at our corporate offices, we also examined the usage at our distribution centers. In FY18, our Moreno Valley distribution center averaged approximately 0.188 kwh/sqft while our Camarillo location averaged approximately 0.272 kwh/sqft. In the chart below, we’ve broken down the split between electric and solar energy at our Camarillo and Moreno Valley distribution centers. We are proud that our Moreno Valley distribution center location is LEED SILVER certified for sustainability and environmental stewardship.

FACTORY AND TANNERY ELECTRICITY USAGE Remaining mindful of energy consumption as a brand is vital in assuring we are constantly serving the environment we live in. As our planet is so affected by climate change, every area where we can track and regulate energy usage and emissions will help us reach our corporate sustainability goals and produce long-term environmental benefits. These efforts in lessening our consumption allow us to be more sustainable, reduce emissions and costs, and ensure we are on par with local regulations. We’re always looking at our manufacturing and delivery processes to keep our carbon emissions in check. In FY18, we looked at 28 core partners (14 Thankfully, the tanneries we work with who are part footwear suppliers, 6 outsole/midsole factories, and of the Leather Working Group already have high 8 tanneries) to monitor their energy consumption ratings for their overall sustainable approach to and find areas where we can cut back.

In FY18, we transitioned to 100% recycled paper for all of our bathroom paper needs. We also went with a “coreless” toilet paper product that is not only 100% recycled, but is more compact and doesn’t need to be replaced as often. We followed the same formula for our hand towels. Furthermore, we installed new stainless steel automated dispensers in all bathrooms as well as new automatic foamsoap dispensers. It’s the attention to detail that pushes us closer to reaching our corporate sustainability goals, and positions ourselves as a thought leader for the rest of the industry. WASTE REDUCTION EFFORTS AT OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS Following the lead of our corporate offices, our Distribution Centers have committed to regularly monitoring their waste reduction efforts. In FY18, our distribution centers recycled an impressive 1,646 tons of materials, which prevented 154 tons of waste from ending up in a landfill. To put it in perspective, we were able to recycle 91% of the materials used at our distribution centers. We estimate that these efforts have saved approximately 44 trees.

In being mindful to the climate that surrounds us, we use drought tolerant plants and a high efficiency drip irrigation system. We also save approximately 30% more water on landscape through the use of both native and non-native plants that, once established, need very little watering. Deckers is always looking for ways to challenge ourselves to do better. The state-of-the-art technologies in place at our corporate headquarters already create significant impact in terms of lessening our water waste, so we are likely unable to report much by way of water reduction year over year. While we always look forward to reporting on positive change, there are certain areas of our business that we have already optimized. TANNERY WATER USAGE Water is an essential element to all manufacturing efforts, so it’s important for us to survey these processes and ensure that we’re recycling whenever possible. As mentioned earlier in the report, in FY18 Deckers sourced 99.2% of our leathers from Leather Working Group certified tanneries which maintain protocols that promote sustainable and appropriate environmental business practices within the leather industry. The Leather Working Group’s audit criteria assesses the fresh water usage, per unit area, for the specific type of production that is manufactured. It gives rewards for water that is recycled and usage tables and target metrics for the facility to achieve different ratings. In fact, on average Leather Working Group rated leather manufacturers save approximately 12.1 billion liters of water each year. We are proud that 92.2% of the tanneries we use are Leather Working Group gold certified tanneries (highest rating), 4% are silver and 3% are bronze. In FY19 we anticipate that 100% of our leathers will be sourced from Leather Working Group certified tanneries. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 32 FACTORY WATER USAGE WATER CONSUMPTION FOOTWEAR 846,147.2 TONS Deckers is highly motivated to minimize its 15% overall water usage, and we’ve already seen some OUT/MIDSOLE 190,236 TONS 3% significant success. We encourage our suppliers to think critically about water consumption, and jump TANNERY 45,442,899.4 TONS at any opportunity to promote overall water efficiency. In FY18, we collected water usage 82% data from 28 of our core supplier partners (14 footwear factories, 6 outsole/midsole factories and 8 tanneries) in order to establish a baseline. Of the 28 partners we monitored, our footwear suppliers averaged 17.52 tons of water per 1,000 WATER RECYCLED pair which is less than other competitive brands. FOOTWEAR 109,708 TONS Our outsole/midsole suppliers average 2.76 tons per 11% 1,000 pair. Our tanneries average 10.25 tons of water OUT/MIDSOLE 105,982 TONS per square foot of material (as already discussed 10% our tanneries are Leather Working Group certified meaning they already have strict standards for TANNERY 812,440.48 TONS sustainability efforts including water conservation). 79% This exercise has allowed us to further define and establish goals for continued reduction at the factory level into FY19 and beyond. BRAND FOCUS ON WATER A huge part of our progress towards sustainability is in mobilizing our passionate teams of individuals to make change. This is shown through our brands’ meaningful partnerships with charitable organizations that are in line with their brand ethos. Notably, Teva works closely with the Conservation Alliance. The Conservation Alliance is the only local nonprofit organization protecting wildlife, wilderness, and clean water throughout the Los Padres National Forest and other public lands along California’s central coast. In FY19, UGG will contribute to Save The Waves and Protect Our Winters, two organizations who help educate on the impact of climate change and focus on protecting our coastline and planet. Finally, Sanuk and Surfrider joined forces to work together to protect clean water, healthy beaches and defend our coastline. These kinds of collaborations broaden our perspective and bring us closer to the issues valued by our surrounding communities and beyond.
