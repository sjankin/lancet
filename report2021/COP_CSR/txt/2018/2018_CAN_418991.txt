We continue to seek ways in which our business activities can support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. “Tomorrow, Together” is a reflection of our belief that in mining, the hard work of taking a project from exploration to reclamation can only be done with support from, and in partnership with, our employees, local communities and host governments. Mining is a complex, long-term industry and to continue to succeed, we must seek out ever safer and more sustainable ways to operate. George Burns President & Chief Executive Officer 3 LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT & CEO 2017 YEAR IN REVIEW WORKING TOGETHER TO SUCCEED TOGETHER The past year was a challenging one for the Company. Despite successfully Throughout 2017, we continued to work together with local stakeholders acquiring and advancing the Lamaque project, the technical challenges at to build opportunities in the communities near our mines. Numerous Kışladağ and the political headwinds in Greece overshadowed the Eldorado initiatives improved educational opportunities and access to healthcare, value proposition. Although we faced headwinds, some of the year’s supported arts, cultural and sporting activities, and helped to develop other highlights included reaching commercial production at Olympias Phase II, industries such as agriculture and tourism. along with continued exploration success at Lamaque (Canada), Bolcana (Romania), Efemçukuru (Turkey) and Stratoni (Greece). We have improved our alignment with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights to ensure our sites’ security teams continue We ended the year in a strong financial position, with $485 million in to uphold and respect human rights. As we continue to embrace diversity cash, cash equivalents and term deposits, and $250 million in undrawn across our operations, we developed a formal Diversity Policy for our lines of credit; this positions us well for our path forward, provides us with Board and senior management team that recognizes the benefits of flexibility, and allows us to make the decisions needed to create value for diverse perspectives in delivering superior business performance. all our stakeholders. DEFINING OUR PATH FORWARD OUR SAFETY GOAL: ZERO HARM We can always do better and in 2018 we have committed to strengthening Working safely continues to underpin all that we do, with our ultimate goal and reinforcing our safety culture across all our operations. Our corporate being zero harm. At each site visit last year, I repeated the same message: objectives reflect the importance we place on safety, and our leadership if a job cannot be done safely, do not do it. We have work to do in this area team’s compensation is tied to Eldorado’s safety performance, compliance as our lost-time incidents increased in 2017. with safety and environmental standards, and creating a safety culture through felt leadership.

By advancing the Lamaque project through the development phase and Despite rigorous safety protocols being in place, I am deeply saddened by into production, and with the proposed construction of a mill at Kışladağ, the fatality at Skouries when an employee of a contractor was struck by a combined with gold production from our existing operations at Efemçukuru, branch from a falling tree. A full investigation occurred and findings were Olympias and the Kışladağ leach pad, we plan to restore Eldorado’s annual acted upon. Such tragedy reminds us that we cannot let our focus on safety gold production to over 600,000 ounces by 2021. We will continue waiver and strengthens our resolve to achieve zero harm. to prioritize our development opportunities and prudently deploy our capital in a manner that will maximize the value of our portfolio for all our stakeholders. STRENGTHENING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS With multiple projects under development, our teams continue to seek ways Mining is a complex, long-term industry and we must continue to seek out to mitigate our environmental impacts from the outset. At Lamaque we are ever safer and more sustainable ways to operate. Working to meet these looking at options to reduce our energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. challenges requires the collaboration of a skilled and dedicated team – At Skouries we recently committed to using dry stack tailings, which, a team who partners with key stakeholders to find innovative solutions and if approved by the Government of Greece, reduces the project’s surface mutually beneficial opportunities.

Various teams manage these inputs, including Operations, Exploration, Corporate Development, Administration & Legal, Human Resources, Engineering, Investor Relations and Finance. Effectively managing our resources and relationships can lower operating costs, reduce site disruptions, secure mine licences and permits, and accelerate Company growth and expansion. Resources Relationships ■ Employees ■ Services and suppliers ■ Labour ■ Local communities ■ Contractors ■ Plants and equipment ■ Unions ■ Investors ■ Capital ■ Energy ■ Suppliers ■ Industry associations ■ Land ■ Water ■ Government ■ Peers ■ Public authorities ■ Religious associations 7 OUR BUSINESS EXPLORATION (3–5 YEARS) Eldorado’s Exploration and Corporate Development teams actively look for potential assets within our focus jurisdictions and in new regions. They assess early and advanced-stage exploration projects and conduct near-mine and grassroots exploration programs, with the primary goal of adding value through discovery in order to increase our resources and reserves. During grassroots exploration, our Exploration teams visit prospective areas to conduct geological surveys and sampling programs, and often partner with other companies to benefit from their local knowledge and experience. If results indicate a possible mineralized deposit, we drill exploration holes to determine whether economically viable concentrations of metals may exist. Advanced-stage exploration projects will include detailed drilling programs designed to define resources and reserves, and they provide the basis for the evaluation and development stage. During exploration, we initiate engagement with local communities to identify social and environmental concerns, and we consider these parts of the mine development plans. EVALUATION AND DEVELOPMENT (5+ YEARS) During the development stage, our Engineering, Technical Services and Metallurgy teams conduct feasibility studies to determine: ■ Optimal mining methods and mineral recovery processes for each project ■ Required infrastructure ■ Optimal facility placement and design, based on thorough impact and mitigation assessments ■ Required mine monitoring, closure and reclamation plans These studies give us a picture of the capital costs required for development and the longer-term economics of the project. We are then able to decide whether capital investment makes economic sense, in order to make a construction decision. We also build upon our initial environmental baseline studies and conduct extensive environmental testing to establish baseline data for air, water, soil and biodiversity. This information becomes part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which must be completed and approved by the relevant authorities before a mine can be developed. Sustainability criteria are built into the EIA, and throughout the environmental permitting process we engage and consult with local communities, businesses and government to obtain input. This research and dialogue helps Eldorado develop innovative solutions for the social and environmental challenges that our projects face, including dust and air emissions, water and energy use, noise and waste. Site preparation work at Certej, Romania. Infrastructure development initiatives – such as improving roads, building sewage systems and drilling water wells – may also commence, according to project and local community needs. 8 ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2017 CONSTRUCTION (3–5 YEARS) Once the project EIA and other relevant permits are approved by relevant government authorities, and we have received a positive decision from our Board of Directors to proceed, our Capital Projects team can begin construction. Explicit requirements described in the EIA guide our activities and help us manage key social and environmental risks. This construction phase requires the greatest proportion of capital and resource inputs invested over a project’s life cycle. During this phase we add significant value to local economies through local job growth and procurement. Eldorado focuses on local hiring and procurement everywhere we operate, and our aim is to train all employees and contractors in the industry’s leading environmental, health and safety practices, procedures and controls. Based on dialogue with local communities and businesses, we identify gaps in skills and capacity, provide on-the-job training and, where needed, support local technical schools and universities to enhance their mining-specific and trades programs, so that local residents and students can improve their prospects of employment with us. MINING AND PROCESSING (10–20+ YEARS) During production, our Operations team and site personnel are responsible for mining, extracting and processing ore from our mines. Any leftover materials generated by our mining activities – which typically include topsoil, waste rock and tailings – are either placed on site in engineered facilities for storage and treatment, or reused elsewhere on site as part of construction activities, rehabilitation or underground backfill. Rigorous environmental monitoring – to test air, water and soil quality, and noise, blast vibration and dust levels – allows us to assess our compliance with environmental regulations and the terms of our operating licences and permits. We add value during the production phase through a commitment to local employment and procurement, operational excellence, local investment and community engagement. New equipment and technologies, continuous improvement projects, low accident rates, a commitment to environmental stewardship, and effective controls and procedures all combine to deliver productivity benefits. Frequent consultation with local communities and businesses helps us identify where we can create new opportunities for sustainable economic development.

Our in-country Marketing teams are responsible for establishing working relationships and purchase agreements with downstream refineries. These agreements outline the terms and conditions of payment for our products, and specify parameters and penalties for the quantity, quality and chemical composition of our doré and concentrate. More details on our products can be found on page 10. RECLAMATION AND CLOSURE (2–5 YEARS, PLUS ONGOING MANAGEMENT) Restoring the land so it is compatible with the surrounding landscape is our responsibility and a priority for our communities. How we conduct our rehabilitation in one jurisdiction impacts our welcome in another. Therefore, prior to and throughout a mine’s operation, our Operations teams develop and continuously enhance plans for the mine’s future closure, in order to: ■ Protect public health and safety ■ Eliminate the potential for environmental damage ■ Return the land to its original condition (or an acceptable and productive alternative) ■ Provide for long-term socio-economic benefits Whenever possible, remediation and reclamation begin during the mine’s operation. When areas are no longer needed for mining, they are reclaimed in parallel with other work being carried out elsewhere. Topsoil removed from mining and construction areas is stored for later use in all reclamation activities. Some sites investigate different plants, shrubs and tree species suitable for local propagation, in studies taking place in on-site greenhouses. As a member of the Mining Association of Canada, we look to our sites to align with the requirements of the Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) program, including the TSM Mine Closure Framework. The framework goes beyond legal compliance and seeks collaboration between mines and communities to develop closure plans and strategies to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of mine closure. Sometimes it is necessary to place a mine site under care and maintenance, such as at our Skouries, Perama Hill and Vila Nova mines. This means we temporarily halt construction and/or operational activities so that we may recommence development at a later date. This may occur when economic conditions or resource prices make the mine uneconomic to operate or, in the case of Skouries, when political challenges delay the issuance of key permits and licences required for construction. Environmental risks such as mine tailings and hazardous materials storage continue to be managed, while idle plant and machinery are maintained. All safety and environmental conditions continue The plant nursery at our Olympias site to apply under care and maintenance. in Greece. Over 250 plant species are grown here and will be used in our Once a mine site is permanently closed, we conduct further environmental monitoring and reclamation rehabilitation efforts. activities, as required by our EIA and mine licences, so that the environment can successfully transition to a productive ecosystem. All of Eldorado’s mine closure plans address: ■ Decommissioning: dismantling project infrastructure such as facilities and buildings ■ Reclamation: re-vegetating disturbed areas ■ Ongoing monitoring: long-term monitoring of environmental parameters ■ Closure costs: regularly reviewing and updating closure plan costs and making financial provisions 10 ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2017 Our Products Eldorado is committed to responsibly producing gold and other metals that offer a wide range of uses. Our products are often essential elements in a variety of goods that advance sustainable development in other fields and contribute to economic growth around the world. We focus on producing all our products responsibly, and all of our gold-producing sites are certified to the World Gold Council’s Conflict-Free Gold Standard (CFGS). Product Responsibility Eldorado supports industry-wide efforts to steward the responsible production of gold and other precious and base metals. We acknowledge and believe that our licence to operate requires that all of our activities be conducted in a manner that do not cause, support or contribute to human rights abuses, unlawful conflict, or breaches of international humanitarian law. As a member in good standing of the World Gold Council (WGC), Euromines and the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), we are committed to operating at the forefront of social and environmental standards. Our operating mines adhere to the following: ■ ISO 14001 Environmental Management System Standard ■ OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System Standard ■ Conflict-Free Gold Standard ■ International Cyanide Management Code Our primary operating cash flows derive from the sale of unrefined gold bullion bars (or doré), and gold, silver, lead and zinc concentrates. Product Handling All of Eldorado’s products are sold in bulk to downstream refineries for secondary treatment. We do not sell our products to the public and our products do not require packaging. At Kışladağ and Efemçukuru, doré is sold and transported to precious metals refineries to be further processed into pure (99.9%) metals. At Efemçukuru, Olympias and Stratoni, metal concentrates are transported to offshore smelting facilities for further refinement. As 100% of Eldorado’s metal products are sold to downstream refineries for further processing, we do not undertake product recycling or reclamation. Our doré, which largely contains gold and silver, has no environmental or safety risks associated with handling or disposal, and it therefore requires no product service or labelling. As a result, beyond our product transport and security procedures, we have not developed detailed protocols, procedures or public labelling for product handling or responsibility. Our concentrates, which contain combinations of gold, silver, lead and zinc, are transported by conveyor to a local port facility (e.g. Stratoni) or loaded onto enclosed trucks and transported to sea ports for export to foreign smelters. The transport of concentrate is subject to numerous risks, mainly with respect to theft and environmental liabilities in the event of a spill. All road and marine shipments of concentrate from Efemçukuru, Olympias and Stratoni are performed under the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road and International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations. Eldorado exclusively hires subcontractors certified and trained to follow the standards and procedures relevant to the aforementioned guidelines for emergency response with respect to transportation and security.

Although we have a strong understanding of material issues as they evolve, a formal assessment allows us to map the topics most important to our stakeholders and connect what may be material in one of our operating regions to similar circumstances across our global operations. This broad view provides valuable internal insights into our business, and is the foundation of this Report. 31 MATERIALITY DEFINING MATERIALITY the regions and communities in which we operate.

We then select the sources from which we gathered This year we sought to focus on environmental materiality. Once the purpose of the our information, select the stakeholders involved, and assessment is determined, we consider which topics best address our objectives. We take design interview questions for internal and external our prior year materiality assessment results as a starting point, and then review peer stakeholders to address a range of material topics. reports, industry reports and internal documents to refine our selected topics. As material topics remain relatively stable year to year, this year’s assessment was conducted internally with the assistance of previously collected external data.

Despite Turkey experiencing continued heightened levels of political, economic and regional geopolitical instability in 2017, our operations experienced no significant disruptions and continued to operate under normal business conditions. 37 RESPONSIBLE PERFORMANCE HUMAN RIGHTS In the past two decades, the mining industry has attracted international attention for failures relating to human rights. While operating in complex social and political environments can pose inherent human rights-related challenges, prioritizing human rights through clear policies and due diligence procedures often leads to better outcomes for all stakeholders. Eldorado believes that respecting and supporting human rights begins with the fundamental recognition of the equality and dignity of all people. These values are in a number of international documents recognized by Eldorado, including the International Bill of Human Rights, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. These values guide our respect for human rights across our sites and communities, and across all aspects of our operations, from developing a workplace culture that values safety and diversity to assisting local communities achieve socially inclusive development goals. We require our employees and contractors to comply with Eldorado’s Human Rights Policy, which was updated and signed by Eldorado’s President & CEO in 2017. The Policy outlines our requirements for upholding and respecting the human rights of our employees, contractors, supply chain workers, local community members, and other stakeholders who may be impacted by our activities. As stated in the Policy, Eldorado supports the global elimination of child and forced labour, as well as the elimination of workplace discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, age, social status, sexual orientation or any other arbitrary characteristic unrelated to an individual’s job performance. As a significant economic actor in our host communities, Eldorado has a particular responsibility to respect and advance human rights. Although this influence enables us to make positive contributions to human rights in local communities, governments hold primary responsibility for protecting and upholding the human rights of their citizens. Alignment with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights Created in 2000, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPs) are a set of principles designed to guide extractive sector companies in maintaining the safety and security of their operations within an operating framework that encourages respect for human rights. The Government of Canada identified the VPs as one of six leading standards in Canada’s CSR Strategy for the Extractive Sector. In March 2017, the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) announced a membership commitment to implement the VPs. Member companies, including Eldorado Gold, that rely upon private or public security forces must commit to implementing a human rights and security approach consistent with the VPs and based on a determination of risk at mining facilities that they control. Eldorado retained an independent consultant to conduct a long-term project to review existing Employee at Efemçukuru, Turkey. security arrangements and to develop a plan to address performance gaps and training needs in accordance with the VPs. The assessment included a review of management policies, site actions, and stakeholder perceptions related to security and human rights. In November 2017, training on the VPs was provided to Eldorado’s leadership team including Officers, country Vice Presidents and mine managers, and in early 2018 a pilot project was undertaken at Eldorado’s Tocantinzinho project in Brazil. Key gaps and recommendations from the review will inform the development of security and human rights training materials that will be adopted, adapted and applied across all Eldorado sites. 38 ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2017 PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY United Nations Global Compact Eldorado is a signatory to the UN Global Compact (UNGC), the world’s largest corporate responsibility initiative. The UNGC’s Ten Principles provide fundamental guidance for our business in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption. We have considered the UNGC’s Principles in the development of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Anti-Bribery and AntiCorruption Policy, Human Rights Policy, Diversity Policy and our Environmental Policy, with the goal of being a welcome and trusted partner everywhere we operate. Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights The Voluntary Principles comprise a “set of principles designed to guide companies in maintaining the safety and security of their operations within an operating framework that encourages respect for human rights.” The Voluntary Principles were established in 2000 and are considered the standard for best practice in managing security for extractive industry operations. Eldorado’s Human Rights Policy, which was updated in 2017, states that all of our mine sites are required to align their security practices with the Voluntary Principles and follow all laws in the jurisdiction of operation when engaging with private or public security forces. Through 2017, all Eldorado country Vice Presidents and mine managers attended training sessions on the Gold pour at Kışladağ, Turkey. Voluntary Principles, and they were given the opportunity to review and discuss Eldorado’s enterprisewide alignment with the Voluntary Principles. As we work to advance cross-Company alignment with the Voluntary Principles, Eldorado is also working with the MAC, which announced on March 2, 2017 its commitment to the Voluntary Principles, to formalize alignment. MAC members, including Eldorado, will now report on progress towards the Voluntary Principles in the MAC’s annual Towards Sustainable Mining Progress Report. The Voluntary Principles are an important part of our commitment to protecting and respecting the human rights and safety of all our stakeholders while maintaining the security of our employees, contractors and assets. Conflict-Free Gold Standard The World Gold Council published the CFGS in 2012, following extensive consultation with governments, civil society, external auditors and supply chain participants. The standard creates a framework for assurance that the production of gold by a company does not contribute to unlawful armed conflict or human rights abuses. The CFGS is based on a recognition across much of the mining industry that the value created by gold-producing activities has the potential to cause or contribute to conflicts within communities and countries, and that companies should mitigate the potential for their activities and products to contribute to conflict. The CFGS also serves to operationalize the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD’s) Due Diligence for Responsible Supply Chains for Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. Eldorado’s operations are not located in conflict-affected areas, but we nonetheless chose to adopt the CFGS in 2013, to provide assurance that the gold we produce does not cause, support or benefit armed conflict or contribute to human rights abuses or breaches of international humanitarian law. In 2017, we published our fourth annual Conflict-Free Gold Report. The Report details our findings that Eldorado’s operations, and all gold and gold-bearing material produced by our operations, conform to the CFGS. Conformance with the Standard was subject to independent assurance. A copy of our report and independent assurance statement can be found here: eldoradogold.com/responsibility/our-approach/accountability/. 39 RESPONSIBLE PERFORMANCE WORKING WITH GOVERNMENTS Government authorities are some of our most important stakeholders and essential partners Contributing throughout the mining life cycle. Governments in all of our operating jurisdictions play an important role by instituting laws and regulations that provide a clear and stable framework for responsible to Sustainable business operations. Stable regulation provides guidance and clarity for our business, and helps us Development mitigate risks when making investment decisions. All of our operations are required to abide by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. Taxes and other legally required payments to governments To better understand government objectives and policies, provide information about our projects, are important ways in which discuss relevant issues and advance our permits, Eldorado maintains frequent dialogue with Eldorado contributes to economic government authorities at the local, regional and national levels through our in-country teams. growth and social development At the corporate level, we work with ministerial offices and diplomats, both in Canada and abroad. The knowledge we derive from these communications helps guide our decision-making processes in the countries in which we while keeping our government stakeholders aware of our development successes and challenges. operate. In addition to our community investments, we Appropriate regulation, accompanied by strong and stable judicial and political institutions, allows rely on capable government us to develop operations capable of generating value for all our stakeholders. Strong government institutions to distribute tax institutions are also important to the legitimacy, inclusivity and accountability of our operations among revenue towards inclusive and many of our other stakeholders, particularly local communities. For this reason, Eldorado encourages sustainable development that the development of effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels of government in supports the well-being of our accordance with the UN SDGs. host communities. Eldorado does not participate in any party politics or make donations to political parties. TAXES AND ROYALTIES Following a commitment stated in Eldorado’s 2016 Year in Review Report – namely, to incorporate a tax strategy into our overall business strategy – we finalized our corporate tax strategy in 2017. The strategy focuses on adhering to all tax obligations and understanding tax risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Paying taxes is an important part of our contribution to the economic growth and social development of the communities and countries in which we operate. Our tax requirements are not only legal obligations, but also reflect the relationships we have with our stakeholders. We focus on meeting all tax obligations while managing taxes and tax risks to provide sustainable outcomes within the parameters of Eldorado’s strategic and commercial objectives. Eldorado expects to pay taxes in the countries in which activities occur, and believes double taxation of the same activity by different jurisdictions should be avoided. We are transparent about our profit-generating activities and tax payments in the countries where we operate. Maintaining an open dialogue with governments and tax authorities is an important part of our socially and economically responsible business operations. Transactions in lower taxed jurisdictions do occur but are minor, and our objective is not to shift profits to such jurisdictions to reduce our tax burden or limit the transparency of our transactions. Responsibility for Taxes In-country teams that have expertise in navigating and understanding the legislative, cultural and political circumstances of their home countries manage day-to-day tax-related issues. We also work closely with reputable tax advisors to comply with local tax legislation. Eldorado’s Global Tax Manager is responsible for global tax planning, the maintenance of tax records and the oversight of tax matters world-wide, and reports to the CFO.

BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION Eldorado and its subsidiaries comply with all applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations. Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy has been in place since 2015 and is designed to educate our employees and contractors on their responsibility to comply with applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. It also encourages staff to be alert to potential violations of applicable laws by any of Eldorado’s personnel or independent representatives, distributors, consultants or agents. All employees participated in anti-bribery and anti-corruption workshops in 2017. Company officers, leadership and key staff also attended in-person anti-corruption training at the corporate, regional and site levels. Company leadership, key management and employees are also required to sign an annual declaration affirming that they have read and understood Eldorado’s Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, as well our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Copies of these policies are posted at each of our sites, in communal work areas and on noticeboards. The policies are overseen by Eldorado’s Corporate Secretary and Global Internal Controls Manager. Team meeting at Efemçukuru, Turkey. 42 ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2017 Providing Decent Work People are at the core of our business, and our primary concern is the safety and well-being of our employees and contractors. Working in the mining industry has inherent safety risks, and it is our job to mitigate those risks by training all employees and contractors to follow safety protocols and procedures. By keeping our people safe and providing well-paid jobs, our operations contribute to the socio-economic development of the communities in which we work. 43 PROVIDING DECENT WORK Keeping Our People Safe Health and safety in the workplace matters to everyone at Eldorado, particularly given the high risks of working in heavy industry that are inherent across all of our sites. Protecting the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities is therefore our biggest priority and a cornerstone of our operating philosophy. High-risk and safety-sensitive activities include but are not limited to: working at heights, handling and using explosives, exposure to hazardous chemicals, working in confined spaces, operating with or near heavy equipment and driving vehicles. Protecting the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities is critical to fulfilling our role of providing sustainable, responsible value to stakeholders. Health and safety risks such as disease and injury related to working in natural environments are addressed in our health and safety planning. Climate change may also affect the health and safety of our workers and communities, which we consider later on in the environmental section of this Report. STRENGTHENING OUR SAFETY CULTURE Safety begins Building a healthy and safe work environment requires employees to have the skills and knowledge to identify hazards and avoid risks. Individuals must also value health and safety in order to make the right with every Eldorado decisions, while strong policies, procedures and systems must be in place to safeguard workplaces. employee. We continuously strengthen our safety culture by taking a holistic view towards safety leadership. We understand that how our people feel, what our people do, and how our policies, procedures and systems address health and safety are all interdependent. A culture of safety means that each individual values their safety and the safety of those around them; having this culture allows for our policies, procedures and systems to be implemented effectively and leads to safety-conscious behaviour. RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFETY Safety begins with every Eldorado employee. Everyone is responsible for their own and their colleagues’ safety. At each of our sites, Health and Safety teams and site management are responsible for the day-to-day oversight, implementation and management of our Health and Safety policies, programs and activities. Each team reports directly to its mine General Manager, who in turn reports to the country Vice President & General Manager and Eldorado’s COO. The COO annually oversees safety objectives and targets, and reviews safety performance on a week-to-week basis. Eldorado’s President & CEO is ultimately accountable for our safety performance. At the Board level, the Sustainability Committee has oversight of all health and safety activities. HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Each of our operations follows Eldorado’s corporate Health and Safety Policy, which establishes George Burns, President & CEO, requirements to monitor and report lead and lag indicators. Site-specific health and safety presenting the Golden Rules Handbook targets are defined annually as part of the management review element of our health and safety at Stratoni, Greece. management systems. To complement our internal systems, we use the internationally recognized OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System Standard to help us better identify and manage safety risks and improve our safety performance. Our Kışladağ and Efemçukuru mines in Turkey and our Halkidiki assets in Greece are all independently certified to OHSAS 18001. On site at Kışladağ, Turkey. 44 ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2017 TRAINING AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT Developing workforce capacity and conducting regular training across all of our sites is an ongoing priority. The majority of our workforce comes from local communities and the regions surrounding our mines, and they often have no prior mining experience. We believe there are significant socioeconomic benefits to building a local workforce and economy, and we invest in relevant training and development initiatives to improve the productivity and safety of our employees. All new recruits and interns at our facilities undergo training on safety, accident prevention, environmental issues and Company procedures, among other topics. Ongoing training priorities are defined based on job requirements, performance evaluation notes and legal requirements. Even at sites with a long mining history and a well-established workforce, such as Kışladağ, we see the benefits of refresher training to improve employee capacity, productivity, and health and safety performance.

(4) The 2016 TRIFR was adjusted to exclude injuries and man-hours worked attributable to Eldorado’s formerly owned Chinese assets, increasing from 5.47 to 7.18. Eldorado’s total number of injuries, particularly LTIs, increased in 2017 compared to the previous year. Unfortunately we also experienced a fatality at our Skouries project in August. A woodcutter employed by our contractor was struck by a large branch from a diseased tree located behind him while he was cutting another tree. The incident was investigated separately by the external authorities and the Company’s own health and safety staff. We are waiting on the inspector’s final report; however, our internal investigation resulted in a number of additional administrative control measures and training opportunities that have been implemented to increase hazard awareness and surveillance during logging and vegetation clearance. Our Greek subsidiary, Hellas Gold SA, is required to follow Department of Forestry vegetation clearance protocols which prohibit the use of mechanical tree-removal equipment. We are disappointed by our safety performance in 2017 and are committed to strengthening and reinforcing a strong safety culture across the Company to drive improved performance. A number of new safety initiatives were introduced during the year partly in response to this, including Eldorado’s Health and Safety Directive. In 2018 we also introduced Eldorado’s Golden Rules to our workforce and celebrated our inaugural International Safety Week by hosting safety training, presentations, competitions and other activities to remind ourselves of the importance of working safely. Weekly health and safety incident reports are prepared by each site and region and outline weekly, month-to-date and year-to-date statistics including: Near Misses First Aid Incidents Medical Treatment Injuries An incident which, in different circumstances, Care is provided to a person who is injured An injury or disease that resulted in basic could have resulted in harm to people, or who suddenly becomes ill (e.g. disinfecting treatment (not first aid treatment) given damage to property or loss to a process a cut, applying a bandage, treating a by a physician or other medical personnel sunburn, etc.) (e.g. prescription medication, sutures, therapeutic treatment, etc.) Restricted Work Injuries Lost-Time Injuries Fatalities An injury or disease that results in a person A work-related injury or disease that resulted Death resulting from a work-related accident being unable to perform their normal duties, in lost time from scheduled work of at least including temporary or permanent transfer one day or shift, a permanent disability or to another job a fatality 46 ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2017 ENSURING CONTRACTOR SAFETY We communicate our minimum expectations regarding contractor health and safety rules as a component of the tender notice and project assignments at our mining facilities. These expectations form an integral part of the agreements Eldorado signs with each contractor and they: ■ Educate contractors on how to carry out work safely and in line with Eldorado’s standards ■ Prevent accidents among their staff, our staff or third parties ■ Avoid damage or harm to facilities and equipment belonging to the contractor, Eldorado or third parties If contractors do not follow safe practices, we require them to cease work until remedial actions have been taken. This may include implementing written procedures for high-risk tasks within the contractor’s scope, documenting training for all personnel, conducting fit-for-purpose audits of machinery, materials, PPE and emergency equipment used by the contractor, and re-inducting their employees to Eldorado’s site safety requirements. SAFETY BEYOND THE MINE Our commitment to health and safety does not end with our employees and contractors. We also consider local stakeholders’ health and safety in our activities. As we transport materials to and from mine sites, the safety of our workers relates directly to the safety of local communities and neighbours. Our workers and contractors follow strict transportation safety guidelines and must adhere to all local transportation laws and regulations. An important part of being a responsible operator and a good neighbour is respecting common areas outside of our mining sites (such as roadways), and Eldorado is committed to transportation safety. To promote health and safety in the communities near our operations, our sites have both informal and formal aid-assistance programs in which Eldorado’s emergency response teams help in community emergencies, if needed. Health programs at our sites provide basic medical treatments and services for employees and contractors, including immunizations and medical checkups. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS By planning for emergencies, we identify, prioritize and implement controls for potential hazards at our sites, which helps minimize their impact while safeguarding our employees, the environment and local communities. Emergency response programs are in place at all our operations. Our emergency response teams comprise employees with additional training in emergency protocols, procedures and equipment. The emergency response programs include extensive emergency drills and training, such as mine rescue drills, fire drills, CPR first aid training, and training in the use of hazardous materials suits and other safety equipment. Our emergency response teams also maintain close working relationships with community-based emergency responders, and provide additional support and resources to local responders in the event of a serious off-site incident. In cases of natural disaster and irregular weather events such as floods and forest fires – which may become more frequent due to climate change – our emergency responders are prepared to assist community-based response teams to protect our workers, assets and neighbours. Our operating regions and corporate head office also have crisis management plans in place that are consistent with the MAC’s TSM Crisis Management and Communications Planning protocol. One of our mine rescue responders in training at the Kassandra Mines in Greece. 47 PROVIDING DECENT WORK Providing Employment and Economic Growth Mining can be an incredible source of value for communities and countries, as it generates employment and investment by producing the raw materials that have become integral to modern life. However, mining is able to generate value for all stakeholders only when companies are able to work with communities and governments. We recognize our responsibilities to the communities in which we operate, and believe that providing decent work is one of the most meaningful ways that we can work together with our stakeholders. Everywhere we operate, we take pride in the relationships we build with our workforce and their communities. LOCAL EMPLOYMENT AND PROCUREMENT Wherever possible, we prioritize hiring local employees and working with local suppliers. We are proud of the contributions we are able to make to communities through direct and indirect employment. Some of the benefits of local employment include skills development, increased income levels and economic diversification. While we do not have a formal policy, we encourage the purchasing department at each site to hire locally, use local suppliers, and work with local businesses to improve their capacity and ability to work with us. This strategy helps build strong working relationships with local communities and industry, brings about operating efficiencies and lowers long-term costs by having an educated and experienced workforce near our sites. Conversely, negative impacts can include inflated local prices for goods and services, as well as income disparity between the mining and non-mining workforce. Our communitybased investments, detailed in the next section, help to mitigate these negative effects and distribute value across a broader range of stakeholders. Our broad target is to increase every year the percentage of materials purchased from companies near our sites. This enables local suppliers to develop their businesses and increases their capabilities with Local contractors at Kokinolakas tailings regards to providing a larger proportion of products and services. facility, Greece. Domestic suppliers of goods and services are the biggest recipients of our supplier expenditure, accounting for 89% and 79% of our host-country investment in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our local procurement practices centre on: ■ Promoting an open and shared culture across all our workplaces ■ Providing ongoing training and education ■ Upholding equal opportunities, diversity and anti-discriminatory practices ■ Hiring employees, contractors and suppliers from the local community Table 5: Payments to Suppliers (1) ($ millions) Brazil Canada Greece Romania Turkey 2017 Total 2016 Total Payments to domestic suppliers 11.00 65.80 177.29 19.09 185.95 459.12 358.40 Payments to international suppliers – – 23.85 3.32 31.78 58.95 92.60 Total 11.00 65.80 201.14 22.41 217.73 518.07 451.00 % spend on domestic versus 100% 100% 88% 85% 85% 89% 79% international suppliers (1) We define “local” as procurement from contractors and suppliers located within the neighbouring villages and communities of our sites. However, for data-reporting purposes, we report on “payments to suppliers” within the categories of domestic and international suppliers only. Domestic suppliers are those where the payment recipient is located in the same jurisdiction. Payments to commercial enterprises are considered “domestic” if the commercial enterprise is registered in the same jurisdiction for tax purposes. 48 ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2017 OUR WORKFORCE Our success is a result of the dedicated employees and contractors who work for us and our global In early 2018, Eldorado adopted subsidiaries.

These partnerships enable us to draw on short-term labour and leverage specific construction expertise that may not be readily available within our own workforce. Doing so also allows us to focus on our core business, while supplementing expertise, experience and labour. All contractors that work on our sites must adhere to Eldorado’s governance policies, including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and our Environmental, and Health and Safety policies. Contractor companies are required to implement systems or procedures that, at a minimum, meet our requirements for social and environmental performance. Examples of our contractor activities include: Activity Description Examples One-off major Significant capital-intensive Mine construction at Skouries projects projects, where short-term contract and Lamaque labour is hired for the duration of Mine development at Tocantinzinho the project and Certej Specialized Minor to major projects, using Construction of the Kokkinolakkas projects skills, equipment and/or labour tailings facility at Stratoni not typically available in the Diamond drilling at exploration sites mine workforce Major support Full-time services for important Catering and employee transportation services non-mining work services at Kışladağ and Efemçukuru Private security services at all sites Minor support Part-time support services Office cleaning services Ad hoc professional services (auditors, lawyers, consultants, etc.) Contractor transport services at Efemçukuru, Turkey. 53 PROVIDING DECENT WORK Table 16: Contractors by Gender and Region Percentage Percentage Total Region female (%) male (%) contractors Brazil 2 98 115 Canada – 100 96 Greece 10 90 1,191 Romania – 100 53 Turkey 4 96 661 Other 100 – 2 Total 7 93 2,118 Table 17: Contractors by National Representation Training of security team Region Local (%) National (%) at Tocantinzinho, Brazil.

In 2017, we renewed each of our agreements in Romania and Brazil, while in Greece we agreed to operate under status quo while we negotiate a new agreement. Existing agreements were extended for one additional year in Brazil and Turkey, and until January 29, 2020 in Romania. There were no significant changes made in 2017 to the terms of our agreements. We also welcomed a new unionized workforce to the Company through our acquisition of Integra Gold’s Lamaque project. In early 2018, the union members at our Lamaque site voted to dissolve their union. As shown by our ability to form agreements with our unions – as well as the trust placed in the Company by our workers in Lamaque, who are no longer unionized – we believe we have good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees. We are committed to resolving employee relations matters promptly and to mutually beneficial outcomes. Eldorado’s labour agreements are overseen by our mine General Managers and country Vice President & General Managers.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT By investing in local, regional and national economies, our mining projects create employment opportunities wherever they are located. Direct jobs are created at the mine itself, while indirect jobs are created throughout the industry supply chain. These immediate jobs in turn create employment throughout the broader economy as demands for local services (such as shops, restaurants, hotels, schools and hospitals) increase. The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) estimates that for every one direct mining employee, three to five people may be employed indirectly elsewhere in the host country’s economy. Furthermore, studies by the ICMM indicate that for every $1 of economic activity invested by a mining project, an additional $3 or more is generated elsewhere in the host economy. The infographic on the opposite page shows the direct, indirect and induced impacts of a mining project. 55 PROVIDING DECENT WORK Economic Impacts of a Mining Project Cash dividends Share price appreciation Lodging for mine Government taxes Payments to suppliers personnel (personal and corporate) DIRECT Sales of metals Payments for land use Royalties impacts result from Community projects Skills development Export revenues the development and operation of a mine.

Partnering with our neighbours and local suppliers to improve health, education and infrastructure is crucial to creating long-lasting, inclusive and sustainable value beyond the life of our mines. 57 WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES Mining is an inherently social venture. From the initial stages of exploration to the eventual reclamation and restoration of a mine site post-operations, Eldorado relies on its partnerships with local Community communities to build long-lasting socio-economic development.

We broadly define our core group of stakeholders as employees, contractors, suppliers, shareholders, local community members, governments, NGOs and industry groups. When determining how and with whom we engage, we consider the type of stakeholder and their concerns to develop a suitable engagement strategy. Each stakeholder group has unique expectations and we therefore tailor our engagement practices to meet their needs. UNDERSTANDING AND ENGAGING Effective two-way communication with our local stakeholders is essential to our continued success, and it has been an integral part of our business practices for over 25 years. To build stakeholder value, we begin with understanding our local communities as best as we can, through meetings, consultations and socio-economic impact assessments (SIAs). SIAs constitute a best-practice approach to identifying the social, cultural and economic characteristics of a community and working with locals to better understand the role of mining in relation to their socio-economic well-being. An SIA will also assist in determining how we can mitigate any negative aspects of mining development in a community. Engagement with local stakeholders is an ongoing process through which we are able to understand and address the concerns of our host communities. We have developed a number of methods through School children near Kışladağ, Turkey. which we can engage in two-way dialogue, and have instituted anonymous feedback mechanisms to enhance the accessibility of our engagement processes. Please see the table on how we interact with stakeholders on the next page.

This is essential when managing disputes regarding our activities and relationships. When grievances are raised, we act and respond with due diligence, and effective grievance mechanisms play an important role in governing and remediating any impacts. As part of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we have a whistleblower policy so that any stakeholder – internal or external – can confidentially report any concerns about our financial statements, accounting practices, internal controls or any suspected or known illegal behaviour that violates laws, government regulations or our Code. Concerns can be submitted anonymously and are managed by an external whistleblower reporting agency. All submissions and investigations are overseen by Eldorado’s Audit Committee Chair and Corporate Secretary. In addition, each of our operations has established various mechanisms for receiving and responding to external grievances. However, as part of Eldorado’s commitment to implement a framework consistent with the Voluntary Principles, we are refining our approach to monitoring, documenting and reporting on community feedback – including grievances – in order to improve the way we track and respond to stakeholder concerns. In 2016, we finalized our global Grievance Mechanism Directive, which outlines Eldorado’s minimum expectations for identifying, classifying, responding to and reporting grievances. In 2017, our sites and regions worked towards adopting and aligning existing grievance mechanisms to this Directive.

Environmental Monitoring in Greece In the Halkidiki region of northern Greece – where our Stratoni and Olympias mines and the Skouries development projects are located – we have developed one of the most thorough environmental monitoring programs in Europe. The program makes use of over 320 separate data points collected around our sites, to provide a comprehensive ongoing assessment of our environmental performance. The data is reported both quarterly and annually to the Government of Greece and the European Union, and it is used by our operations and environmental teams to make adjustments and improve performance. Data is also collected and validated by third parties and is publicly accessible through our online database. The collection of comprehensive environmental data allows us to monitor our environmental protection processes, and it is an important part of building relationships based on transparency, accountability and scientific fact.

Water monitoring in Greece. 65 RESPECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT Climate Change Climate change is an issue of global concern that has the ability to impact our operations, stakeholders, and the communities in which we operate. The ongoing rise in global average temperatures has created, and will continue to create, varying weather patterns that pose risks to all of our stakeholders, from employees exposed to extreme heat, to communities subject to drought, or investors impacted by flooding in low-lying coastal cities. As the mining industry is a contributor to GHG emissions and a consumer of resources that can be affected by climate change and climate-related policies, it is incumbent upon Eldorado to take action The Diverse Effects to reduce GHG emissions and prevent further increases in global average temperatures. (1) of Climate Change The effects of rising global CLIMATE MATERIALITY temperatures vary by region, According to the United Nations SDGs, the effects of climate change include changing weather resulting in the desertification of patterns, rising sea levels, and the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such certain areas while simultaneously as floods, droughts, hurricanes, heatwaves, tornados and wildfires. causing increased precipitation Rising Temperatures and flooding in others. As Rising temperatures pose significant risks to workers, infrastructure, and equipment, and may result Eldorado’s operations are situated in increased operating costs. Regions at risk of extreme heat such as Uşak Province (Kışladağ, Turkey), in geographically disparate areas, Halkidiki (Kassandra Mines, Greece) and Pará State (Tocantinzinho, Brazil) may require more energy for the effects of climate change cooling, while equipment malfunctions may increase in frequency. As the number of warm weather vary by location, but all of our days per year increases, both the intensity and duration of heat poses financial and safety risks. Heatoperations and stakeholders are related health risks – such as heat exhaustion or exposure to hot climate diseases such as yellow fever exposed to climate change risks. and the zika virus – are particularly salient to our Brazilian sites, and we consider heat-related health Climate change may affect many risks within our larger health and safety protocols. aspects of ecological and socioLonger summer seasons may however offer a positive opportunity for Eldorado’s Canadian asset economic life related both directly (Lamaque), by reducing safety and equipment risks associated with cold winter temperatures, while and indirectly to mining. also reducing energy costs attributable to heating. Precipitation Regions that may experience increases in precipitation – such as the Halkidiki region of northern Greece and Pará State in Brazil – are subject to greater risks of flooding and infrastructure damage. Tailings dams, mine pits and shafts, roadways and processing equipment are at risk of damage due to heavy rainfall and flooding, potentially culminating with significant environmental contamination in the event of a tailings dam breach or overflow. Roadways washed out by flooding may result in disruptions to worker and supply transportation and cause operational disruptions as a result. Investments in flood prevention infrastructure and equipment may be necessary. Flooding can also negatively affect local communities and suppliers, meaning that our stakeholders may require our emergency response assistance. Both flooding and droughts have the ability to impact our stakeholders – especially communities that rely on agriculture as a source of economic activity. Droughts, in combination with warmer temperatures, also increase the probability of wildfires. As precipitation patterns become more extreme, sites such as Kışladağ are exposed to greater risks due to their already-arid locations. However, variations in precipitation within our operation regions may be increasing, meaning that rainy seasons become more flood-prone, while dry seasons are simultaneously at greater risk of featuring drought and wildfires. Ensuring we do our part to use water responsibly is an important way we respect our neighbours and continue to work towards sustainable development. You can read more about our water usage practices on page 69. (1) In this Report, we have chosen to highlight climate change as a material topic unto itself, even though the wide-ranging effects of climate change across all socio-economic and ecological activities mean that it cannot be treated as an isolated material topic. For this reason, references to challenges posed by climate change appear throughout the Report. 66 ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2017 Regulation As governments and societies respond to climate change, more jurisdictions are implementing policies intended to reduce GHG emissions. Many of the countries in which Eldorado operates have signed the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and are therefore seeking to reduce GHG emissions with the goal of preventing the global average temperature from rising above 2 degrees centigrade. For example, Eldorado’s Lamaque development project is already subject to the Province of Quebec’s Regulation respecting a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emission allowances. Governments may also enact other regulatory measures designed to incentivize energy efficiency, water conservation or other methods of environmental protection, potentially increasing operating costs. Eldorado believes that consistent and clear regulation has a role to play in addressing climate change solutions, while individual actors responsible for GHG emissions should work together to advance new technologies and practices that contribute to sustainable development. ENERGY Although energy use was not identified by our stakeholders as a material topic, energy use represents a significant proportion of our operating costs and is responsible for the vast majority of the GHG emissions produced by our operations. Our energy consumption is also the primary determinant of our ability to contribute to global climate change goals. We source our energy mainly from fossil fuels such as diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), gasoline and natural gas, as well as electricity. Our heavy vehicle fleet, portable light towers and emergency backup generators operate on diesel fuel, while our light-vehicle fleet uses LPG and gasoline. Electricity is primarily used by our electric excavators, as well as for mining and milling operations. We also use some natural gas for building heating. Electricity is primarily sourced from the national grid, though the Skouries and Tocantinzinho projects will continue to use diesel generators until the construction of site transmission lines and transformers is complete.

Ecosystems that are already susceptible to fires, such as the tree-covered hills of northern Greece, are at specific risk of wildfire damage. In an effort to reduce the risks of wildfires in Halkidiki, Eldorado has partnered with the Thessaloniki Aeroclub, a local aviation organization, to detect fires from the air and prevent them from spreading. By providing supplies and fuel for wildfire surveillance activities, we have worked with local pilots to identify and prevent the spread of several forest fires since 2015. We have also outfitted aircraft owned by the Aeroclub with air pollution monitoring equipment, allowing us to collect air quality data around our sites and throughout the region. Through unique partnerships such as this, we are Airplane used for monitoring and working to improve the safety of our communities preventing wildfires in Halkidiki, Greece. and our workforce, and mitigate the human and environmental risks caused by climate change. 68 ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2017 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS GHG emissions are the key driver of human-made climate change. As a large portion of our operations rely on fossil fuel-generated energy, Eldorado is a contributor to global GHG emissions. As we work to reduce our GHG emissions, we are also motivated by the contributions our products make to green technologies around the world. Our calculated GHG emissions are attributable to all of Eldorado’s operating mines and construction and development projects, with the exception of Perama Hill (no on-site activity) and our Lamaque project (which was acquired mid-way through 2017). According to GRI requirements for measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emission equivalents, we classify our GHG emissions as follows.

Clean and readily available water is vital to human life, as well as the well-being of ecosystems and agriculture that support sustainable development. Given water’s vital importance, access to water can be an issue for communities near our sites. Using water responsibly is a key area of focus for Eldorado’s operations, and it is essential to our environmental stewardship and relationships with local stakeholders. WATER USE AT OUR MINES Water Balancing Availability and access to water is critical for our mining operations. We use water for mineral processing, dust suppression, slurry transport and personal consumption, and so the responsible at Kışladağ management of water resources is essential to our long-term sustainable development. Effective water management and recycling practices help limit our reliance on water sources, and effective Managing water at a mine site governance ensures that water discharges fall within the parameters of our permits and licences. is more complex than simply While we do not set quantitative targets regarding water consumption, we strictly control water collecting enough water to use across all of our sites, and each operation has implemented practices that reduce, reuse and operate machinery and process recycle water. materials. Sometimes mine sites can have too much water, and we Across our operations, we withdrew nearly 9.4 million m3 of water in 2017. This includes water must remove it from site or store removed from our sites following precipitation as well as groundwater that must be continuously it for later use. In wet seasons, pumped out from our underground mines. Overall, we experienced a 14% increase in total water withdrawals in 2017 compared to 2016 volumes, largely attributable to a decrease of groundwater excess water can cause challenges flows and subsequent mine dewatering at our Greek sites. Water use is continuously monitored for operations, just as a lack of using flow meters, and we regularly take water quality samples from groundwater and surface water water can cause challenges at sources within and around our sites. We compare water quality results with the limit values set out other times of the year. in pertinent regulations and our operating permits, and we share these detailed results with regulators and government, typically on a quarterly basis. Because of water’s importance to our operations and to Water availability varies by site. At Stratoni, Olympias and Skouries in Greece, groundwater flowing surrounding communities, we into our underground mines provides the majority of water we require to operate, with small work to collect continuous data additional volumes collected via rainwater and municipal supplies.

In reality, due to the need to dewater our mines, we withdraw far more water than we use, and consequently our actual water efficiency is much higher. As we continue to improve our data collection and reporting, we are investigating new data sources in order to improve our understanding of water balances and calculate our water efficiency as a matter of water used in production per ounce of gold produced. Site water treatment plants operate continuously year-round to reduce our reliance on external water sources. Kışladağ currently uses a leach pad to extract gold from ore; it treats and circulates approximately 50,000 litres of water per minute through a closed system, with minor losses Water treatment plant at Efemçukuru, Turkey. attributable to evaporation. Approximately 21 times more water is recycled and reused by the site compared to new water withdrawals. Other sites, like Skouries, will not allow any contact water to be discharged openly back into the environment. Instead, we use water diversion channels to redirect surface water flows away from the site, and any precipitation or groundwater that enters the site is captured, stored, reused and/or evaporated. For more detailed information on Eldorado’s water use and management practices, please see our annual responses to the CDP’s Water Survey, available on the CDP website: cdp.net. 72 ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2017 DUST SUPPRESSION One of the most water-intensive activities at our operations is dust suppression. Blasting, transporting ore and waste rock, operating crushing units and road traffic can all have negative effects on air quality and the local environment if not properly managed. Our water tank trucks continuously perform on-site watering activities to suppress dust. We also use water spraying and dust collecting systems at primary crushers, fine ore stockpiles, and conveyor belts to minimize dust emissions. For dust control, we use water that has been processed and treated by site water treatment plants. We regularly measure dust levels around our operations and in neighbouring villages to verify the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies. TAILINGS Wherever our operations make use of water-based mineral processing, tailings are produced. Tailings are primarily a mixture of ground rock and water that remain after the mineral extraction process has been completed. These typically liquid mixtures can contain trace amounts of chemicals from the extraction process, making them acidic or alkaline. Safe management and disposal of tailings Dust suppression truck at Kışladağ, Turkey. is therefore critical to protecting environments and communities, making tailings management a major priority for Eldorado. Given both the chemical characteristics of tailings and the quantities in which they are produced, tailings are typically stored in specially designed facilities. We manage these facilities in accordance with robust government regulations, international standards and leading industry practices. Our tailings facilities are all site-specific and have been carefully designed and constructed by specialized engineering firms. These facilities are designed and certified to government regulations to minimize environmental risk. Our Plans for Dry Stack Tailings at Skouries Whenever possible, Eldorado incorporates best-available The key benefits of dry stack tailings include: technologies into our mine designs in order to protect the surrounding environment.

These include: ■ Plans and procedures that identify clear roles, responsibilities and communication channels for personnel responsible for tailings management ■ Ongoing training of personnel responsible for tailings management ■ Operational controls such as real-time monitoring of tailings facilities, routine inspections and risk assessments and regular maintenance programs Dry stack tailings area at Efemçukuru, Turkey. ■ Emergency preparedness and response plans ■ The periodic review of tailings facility design, construction, operation and closure plans to facilitate ongoing relevance and alignment with current best practices ■ Oversight from the corporate head office to verify the completion of any updates or corrective actions and to identify opportunities for shared learning across Company operations Our site teams monitor tailings facilities daily, and every three years facilities undergo an independent audit conducted by recognized tailings management and dam safety experts; our most recent external audit in 2017 did not identify any major deficiencies in our tailings management practices. We are further strengthening our management approach by implementing MAC’s TSM Tailings Management Protocol, which is based on a “plan, do, check, act” system of continuous improvement. In 2017, there were no environmental fines or WASTE MANAGEMENT penalties imposed on Mining generates various forms of waste, including overburden, waste rock, tailings, slag, mine water, sludge and refuse. The largest portion of waste comprises waste rock – material that is extracted from Eldorado’s operating the mining area in order to access ore and which has no economic value. sites and projects. We sort and classify all the waste we generate as being either hazardous or non-hazardous, in line with environmental regulations. Eldorado considers the potential environmental impacts of all waste, and stores or disposes of waste accordingly. Depending on the type of waste generated, we develop and implement management programs suitable for minimizing risks to the environment or human health. For example, at Efemçukuru, where waste rock has acid rock drainage potential, storage areas are lined and seepage is collected and treated before disposal. Where waste rock does not pose any toxicity risk, such as at Olympias, it is partially reused for mine backfill. Waste management activities and objectives represent significant elements of our ISO 14001 environmental management systems. As per local regulations in each of our operating jurisdictions, we record all disposed waste types and quantities in legal disposal documents that are submitted periodically to host governments. We conduct due diligence on our waste disposal contractors, and periodically visit disposal and recycling contractors to evaluate their environmental practices. 74 ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2017 Mineral Reserves Project Proven Mineral Reserves Probable Mineral Reserves Total Proven & Probable Tonnes In-situ oz Tonnes In-situ oz Tonnes In-situ oz GOLD (x1000) g/t (x1000) (x1000) g/t (x1000) (x1000) g/t (x1000) Certej 22,788 1.93 1,414 21,500 1.43 988 44,288 1.69 2,402 Efemçukuru 2,032 7.12 465 2,020 6.34 412 4,052 6.73 877 Kışladağ 113,253 0.83 3,032 5,306 0.60 102 118,560 0.82 3,134 Lamaque 111 8.78 31 3,698 7.25 862 3,809 7.30 893 Olympias 3,610 7.49 870 11,122 7.21 2,577 14,732 7.28 3,447 Perama 2,477 4.44 354 7,220 2.68 621 9,697 3.13 975 Skouries 75,804 0.87 2,132 81,862 0.62 1,641 157,666 0.74 3,773 Tocantinzinho 16,699 1.53 821 22,914 1.36 1,003 39,613 1.43 1,824 Total gold 236,774 1.20 9,119 155,642 1.64 8,206 392,417 1.37 17,325 SILVER Certej 22,788 10 7,004 21,500 12 8,551 44,288 11 15,555 Olympias 3,610 105 12,165 11,122 120 42,756 14,732 116 54,921 Perama 2,477 3 254 7,220 4 897 9,697 4 1,151 Stratoni 0 0 0 497 178 2,844 497 178 2,844 Total silver 28,875 21 19,423 40,339 42 55,048 69,214 33 74,471 Tonnes In-situ t Tonnes In-situ t Tonnes In-situ t COPPER (x1000) % (x1000) (x1000) % (x1000) (x1000) g/t (x1000) Skouries 75,804 0.52 393 81,862 0.47 386 157,666 0.49 779 Total copper 75,804 0.52 393 81,862 0.47 386 157,666 0.49 779 LEAD Olympias 3,610 3.5 126 11,122 4.0 442 14,732 3.9 568 Stratoni 0 0.0 0 497 7.0 35 497 7.0 35 Total lead 3,610 3.5 126 11,619 4.1 477 15,229 4.0 603 ZINC Olympias 3,610 4.8 173 11,122 5.5 610 14,732 5.3 783 Stratoni 0 0.0 0 497 8.4 42 497 8.4 42 Total zinc 3,610 4.8 173 11,619 5.6 652 15,229 5.4 825 Notes on Mineral Resources and Reserves 2.

It is based on a number of assumptions, estimates and opinions that may prove to be incorrect, including the geopolitical, economic, permitting and legal climate in which we operate, the future price of gold and other commodities, exchange rates, anticipated costs and expenses, production, mineral reserves and resources, metallurgical recoveries, the impact of acquisitions, dispositions, suspensions or delays on our business and the ability to achieve our goals. It is inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Actual results and events may be significantly different from what we currently expect due to the risks detailed under “Risks factors in our business” of our AIF and MD&A, which includes a discussion of material and other risks that could cause actual results to differ significantly from our current expectations and risks associated with our business, including the following risks: ■ title, permitting and licensing risks, including the risks of obtaining and maintaining the ■ prices for energy inputs, labour, material costs, supplies and services (including shipping) validity and enforceability of necessary permits and licenses, the timing of obtaining and remaining consistent with expectations; renewing such permits and licenses, and risks of defective title to mineral property; ■ speculative and uncertain nature of gold and other mineral exploration; ■ risks of operating in foreign countries in which we currently or may in the future conduct ■ discrepancies between actual and estimated production, mineral reserves and resources business, including controls, laws, regulations, changes in mining regimes or governments, and metallurgical recoveries; and political or economic developments; ■ failure, security breaches or disruption of our information technology systems; ■ volatility of global and local economic climate and geopolitical risks; ■ development, mining and operational risks, including timing, hazards and losses that ■ regulatory restrictions, including environmental regulatory restrictions and liability, are uninsured or uninsurable; including actual costs of reclamation; ■ impact on operations of compliance and non-compliance with General Data ■ changes in law and regulatory requirements or policies, including permitting, foreign Protection Regulation; investment, environmental, tax and health and safety laws and regulations; ■ increased capital requirements and the ability to obtain financing; ■ competition for mineral properties and merger and acquisition targets; ■ share capital dilution and share price volatility; ■ environmental risks, including use and transport of regulated substances; ■ risks associated with maintaining substantial levels of indebtedness, including potential ■ infrastructure, water, energy, equipment and other input availability and durability, and financial constraints on operations, interest rate risk and credit rating risk; their cost and impact on capital and operating costs, exploration, development and ■ gold and other metal price volatility and the impact of any related hedging activities; production schedules; ■ currency exchange fluctuations and the impact of any related hedging activities; ■ perceptions of the local people about foreign companies operating on their land; ■ taxation, including change in tax laws and interpretations of tax laws; ■ ability to maintain positive relationships with the communities in which we operate and potential loss of reputation; ■ financial reporting risks; ■ community and non-governmental actions and regulatory risks, including the possibility ■ the impact of acquisitions, dispositions, monetization, mergers, other business of a shutdown at any of our operations; combinations or transactions, including effect of changes in our portfolio of projects on our current and future operations, capital requirements, and financial condition and ability ■ risks of not meeting production and cost targets or estimates; to complete such transactions; ■ subjectivity of estimating mineral reserves and resources and the reliance on available ■ the risks that the integration of acquired businesses may take longer than expected, data and assumptions and judgments used in interpretation of such data and depletion the anticipated benefits of the integration may be less than estimated or the costs of of grades or quantities of mineral reserves; acquisition may be higher than anticipated; ■ the loss of key employees and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; ■ risk associated with co-ownership (including joint ventures); ■ employee health and safety risks and potential human rights risks related to our ■ litigation and arbitration risks, including the uncertainties inherent in current and future environmental impacts, economic and social disruption, security incidents, land acquisition, legal challenges we are, or may become, a party to; and indigenous peoples, access to remedy and our supply chain; ■ impact on operations of compliance and non-compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery ■ labour disputes, labour shortages and risks associated with unionized labour; and sanction laws. ■ risks related to natural disasters and climate change; The reader is directed to the discussion set out under the heading “Risk factors in our business” in our AIF for a full discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking information contained herein are reasonable and we have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause actual results to differ materially from those which are anticipated, estimated or intended. Forward-looking statements and information is not a guarantee of future performance and actual results and future events could materially differ from those anticipated in such statements and information. We will not necessarily update this information unless we are required to do so by applicable securities laws. All forward-looking information in this Year in Review Report is qualified by these cautionary statements. REPORTING MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINERAL RESERVES The terms “mineral resource,” “measured mineral resource,” “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” used herein are Canadian mining terms used in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) under the guidelines set out in the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as may be amended from time to time. While the terms mineral resource, measured mineral resource, indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are defined by the CIM, and the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted by the CIM Council, and must be disclosed according to Canadian securities regulations, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not recognize them under SEC Industry Guide 7 and they are not normally permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors should not assume that: ■ any or all of a measured, indicated or inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category or to mineral reserves; or ■ any or all of an indicated or inferred mineral resource exists or is economically feasible to mine. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Under the securities regulations adopted by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), estimates of inferred mineral resources generally cannot be used as the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies. With respect to “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource,” there is a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and a great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of a “measured mineral resource,” “indicated mineral resource” or “inferred mineral resource” will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Information about our mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by US domestic mining companies, including information prepared according to SEC Industry Guide 7. Except as otherwise noted, Paul Skayman, FAusIMM, our Chief Operating Officer, is the “Qualified Person” under NI 43-101 responsible for preparing or supervising the preparation of, or approving the scientific or technical information contained in this Year in Review Report for all our properties. 83 CORPORATE INFORMATION CORPORATE INFORMATION CANADA (HEAD OFFICE) GREECE SERBIA Eldorado Gold Corporation Hellas Gold SA & Thracean South Danube Metals d.o.o 1188 Bentall 5 Gold Mining SA Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 24 550 Burrard Street 23A Vasilissis Sofias Avenue Floor 7, Apartment 9 Vancouver, BC Athens Belgrade V6C 2B5 Canada 10674 Greece 11000 Serbia Tel: +1 604 687 4018 Tel: +30 214 687 0000 Tel: +38 111 715 6860 Fax: +1 604 687 4026 Fax: +30 214 687 0095 Toll-free: +1 888 353 8166 BARBADOS BRAZIL Eldorado Gold (Barbados) Limited CANADA (LAMAQUE) Unamgen Mineração e Metalurgia S/A White Park House Eldorado Gold Lamaque Avenida Olegário Maciel White Park Road 300, 3e Avenue Est 1846 – Santo Agostinho Bridgetown Val-d’Or, QC Belo Horizonte, MG BB11135 Barbados J9P 0J6 Canada CEP 30180-112 Brazil Tel: +1 246 271 5357 Tel: +1 819 874 3100 Tel: +55 31 2101 3750 Fax: +1 246 271 5357 Fax: +1 819 874 0051 Fax: +55 31 2101 3758 THE NETHERLANDS TURKEY ROMANIA Eldorado Gold (Netherlands) BV Tüprag Metal Madencilik Deva Gold SA Barbara Strozzilaan 101 Sanayive Ticaret A.S.
