Creating value for society remains a strong focus for Wolters Kluwer. Our work helps to protect people’s health, prosperity, and safety. We help make the world more sustainable and support our communities. We continue to be committed to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and acknowledge the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals that the United Nations has set for 2030.” Nancy McKinstry, CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board Wolters Kluwer As of 2017, sustainability information2017 Sustainability Data, which used to be reflected in our 2017 Sustainability Report is integrated in the 2017 Annual Report. In this document more information on sustainability and specific data is available. Stakeholder Input for Materiality Analysis We continue to identify economic, social, and environmental topics that are critical to our business. We classified topics that drive or protect value creation important to our business operations. We do this through a process of internal alignment amongst various departments and through engagement with external stakeholders. In line with the value creation model, we engaged with customers, employees, investors, and business partners to revise and update our High Informing Aligning 1 2 4 3 5 7 6 8 10 9 Stakeholder interest 13 12 11 14 19 18 15 16 17 20 21 Monitoring Engaging Low Impact on Wolters Kluwer High Good Governance 11 Product inmpact 1 Privacy and data protection 12 Diversity and equal opportunity 2 Compliance and best practice 13 Brand Management Digital innovation & intellectual property 14 Efficient and effective access to information 4 Operational excellence 15 Capital allocation 5 Effective Policies 16 Financial stability 6 Risk Management 17 Responsible supply chain 7 Employee satisfaction 18 Community involvement 8 Talent Management 19 Well-being 9 Customer retention 20 Circular economy 10 Stakeholder engagement 21 Climate change Wolters Kluwer 2017 Sustainability Data 5 materiality analysis. Representatives from each stakeholder group were asked in 2017 to complete a survey to substantiate the importance of each material topic. Further analysis led to a renewed diagram including 21 new and existing topics. The materiality analysis is divided into four quadrants – Aligning, Informing, Engaging, and Monitoring – based on the relative importance of topics to both stakeholders and our business operations. The analysis showed that the three most important topics are: 1. Privacy and data protection; 2. Compliance and best practice; and 3. Digital innovation and intellectual property. When applicable, we provide data in line with the materiality analysis in this document or in the Annual Report. To ensure continuity and transparency in our reporting processes and performance, we compiled the reporting in accordance with the International <IR> Framework and the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines in 2017. Sustainability data management As of 2017, we have compiled and gathered our Sustainability data with the online data management tool Enablon, the global provider of environmental, health, safety, sustainability, and operational risk management software and SaaS solutions. The clear assignment of responsibilities for data contribution, validation, and final sign-off establishes a coherent management system for complete and reliable data. Furthermore, the tool supports the analysis of the nonfinancial data to support the development and implementation of our sustainability strategy. The Corporate Sustainability team works together with various departments such as Global Procurement, Human Resources, Real Estate, Legal, Group Accounting & Reporting, and Communications to discuss and establish material topics, policies, processes, and targets, and to collect data from divisions and operating entities within the predefined scope. The Corporate Sustainability department reviews the final data. Each Wolters Kluwer division rolls out its sustainability initiatives based on specific local opportunities. These initiatives are required to adhere to our globally-established policies and compliance regulations. When introducing new indicators, we only provide the data for 2017. Where applicable, we report data regarding the last three consecutive years and provide explanations for the fluctuation in the data trends or the exclusion of data. The data presented in this report is collected on an annual basis and represents the reporting period from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017. The data provided in the resource efficient operations section (under Our Society) is reported with a lag of one year to allow for the delay in accessing this information. These are our scoping guidelines for our sustainability data: • We collect data from countries that represent at least 1% of the group’s revenue or 1% of Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs); • All data expressed ‘per FTE’ (emissions from energy consumption, business air travel, water consumption, and staff turnover) is based on the average number of FTEs; • Where we report data in Euro, currencies are converted using the financial year’s average exchange rate; • Corporate governance data is collected globally, although some exceptions may apply due to local legislation; • Data relating to employees and community contributions is collected per country and by division (all data privacy concerns were taken into account when collecting employee data); • Data relating to business air travel and paper is collected per country; • Data related to energy, water, and waste is collected as follows: • Data is collected for facilities that cover more than 1,000 m2 and is extrapolated for all Wolters Kluwer facilities; • For the U.S. we only collected data for owned properties and extrapolate for the leased offices; and • O2 emissions from electricity are calculated with location-specific conversion factors, which are adjusted annually based on the newly released conversion factors of the International Energy Agency (IEA) for electricity conversion factors. CO2 emissions from heating and business travel use source-based conversion factors from the ‘Guidelines to Defra / DECC’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting’. Please note that selected sustainability information is integrated within the 2017 Annual Report.

Wolters Kluwer 2017 Sustainability Data 7 Taking action In 2017, we continue to support our employees and managers to develop their skills, knowledge, and careers. 100% of our employees have access to online trainings to improve their skills.

The risk of health and safety hazards has decreased accordingly. In addition, our local facilities put initiatives in place to safeguard the health and safety of our workforce. This has led to a very low number of health and safety incidents at Wolters Kluwer. At Wolters Kluwer we have health improvement programs in several countries. Our company’s largest well-being program is in the U.S. and is called Be Well. Be Well is designed to help employees get fit, reduce stress, and increase energy levels. Be Well offers a variety of programming to address the whole person, including on-site health screenings and flu shots, and health improvement challenges to encourage year-round engagement. Wolters Kluwer 2017 Sustainability Data 8 Our Society As a company that provides essential information, software solutions, and services, we make a difference in the communities in which we operate. We focus on the world’s most critical areas, touching the lives of millions of people. Resource efficient operations Energy Consumption Energy use is based on electricity, natural gas, heating oil, and district heating. As a result of outsourcing our data centers, electricity consumption has decreased globally. We continue to make the most efficient use of our office space. By reducing the office m2 per FTE we reduced the reliance on electricity and heating sources. This initiative had the largest impact on the decrease of the resources used in 2017. Furthermore, using 100% renewable energy in Germany has led to an increase of the percentage of electricity from renewable sources to 17%. Energy Consumption 2017 2016 2015 Total energy use in GWh 78 92 109 Electricity from renewable sources 17% 14% 15% Total CO2 emissions from energy in metric tons 26,266 31,527 37,705 Tons of CO2 emissions from energy per FTE 1.4 1.7 2.0 Waste Waste consumption has increased due to the clean-up of closed offices globally.

For business travel by plane, relatively more kilometres were travelled in business class than in 2016. This explains the increase in CO2 emissions from business air travel in metric tons even though total millions of kilometres (km) travelled by plane have decreased. Business travel 2017 2016 2015 Total millions of kilometres (km) travelled by plane 99 107 114 Flight use (km/FTE) 5199 5644 5934 Total thousands of litres consumed by car travel 2434 2779 2895 Car use (liters/FTE) 128 147 150 Total CO2 emissions from business travel in metric tons 19,304 19,187 20,622 Total CO2 emissions from business travel per FTE in metric tons 1.02 1.01 1.01 Wolters Kluwer 2017 Sustainability Data 9 Paper usage Historically, our publishing business used large amounts of paper. Our total paper usage decreased during the period 2015 – 2017 as a result of the strategic focus on digital revenues. We have changed the scope of our measurement for paper data for this report, which resulted in the need to restate the 2016 number. Metric tons 2017 2016 2015 Total paper 17,650 17,864 18,821 Responsible supply chain We review our procurement process critically and are striving to achieve an environmentally and socially sustainable supply chain. The six main elements of the Supplier Management Program include: 1. Governance & Oversight 2. Requirements Definition and Risk Assessment 3. Third Party Selection and Due Diligence 4. Contract Negotiation 5. Ongoing Monitoring and Reporting 6. Termination We expect our suppliers to adhere to the standards described in our Supplier Code of Conduct, as well as with local laws and regulations, the articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the core standards of the International Labor Organization. We regularly review the product-specific certifications of our paper suppliers. In 2017, 97% of our paper is sourced from suppliers which are certified by at least one of the following standards: FSC, PEFC, SFI, EU Ecolabel, Nordic Swan, or Blauer Engel.

Besides assessing the monetary value of our contributions, we determine the impact created for the community, for the environment and for the business, such as the engagement of our employees. Wolters Kluwer continues to use the London Benchmarking Group (LBG) community support framework. The LBG framework provides the structure to measure and report on our community contributions. It separates donations, costs, and time invested and portrays it in a transparent and reliable manner. Community contributions in thousands of euros 2017 2016 2015 Community contributions in cash 719 617 724 Community contributions in kind 842 1,765 1,430 Management cost related to community contributions 34 32 29 Total 1,595 2,414 2,183 Our community contributions in cash increased in 2017 based on the donation made to the American Red Cross for the victims of the hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the US. Our community contributions in kind decreased due to fewer downloads of Wolters Kluwer products as part of the Hinari program, our long-term collaboration with the United Nations program. This trend is visible throughout the Hinari program and is not limited to Wolters Kluwer products. Wolters Kluwer 2017 Sustainability Data 11 Corporate Governance The Global Compliance Training Program took place from October 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017. All employees worldwide hired on or before October 1, 2017 were invited. In January 2017, we launched a single performance management and learning approach supported by the expansion of our talent management system. This system facilitated the reporting and completion tracking of our global training offerings. The numbers reflect the status as of December 31, 2017. Employees based in the European Union did not receive the basic IT security awareness training due to pending Works Councils procedures and alignment of policies. The Compliance Training consisted of the following courses: 1. Wolters Kluwer Ethics Training (business ethics, values, anti-bribery, fair competing, sanctions and export control, data protection, reporting issues) 2. IT Security Awareness Training 3. Cyber Security Training, composed of the following modules: • Email Security; • Security Essentials; • Social Engineering; • Security Beyond the Office; • Mobile Device Security; and • Data Protection and Destruction. We are pleased to report that in 2017 97% of our employees worldwide have completed the following compliance training. % employees worldwide that have received Completed 2017 Completed 2016 Completed 2015 and completed the Compliance Training Program Conduct & Ethics Training 97% 97% 99% IT Security Awareness Training 97% 97% 99% Fair Competition & Trading Training Included in the Ethics training 97% 99% Cyber Security Training 97% 96% n/a We provide channels and resources for our employees so that they can communicate their complaints and grievances in a secure environment. All Wolters Kluwer entities have at least one of the grievances channels implemented. To underpin the importance of integrity and to create a culture in which employees are comfortable to speak up and report any issues, Wolters Kluwer recently implemented a global reporting system with 24/7 availability, called SpeakUp. SpeakUp was launched in October 2017, is available for employees worldwide in 22 languages and employees can report any suspected non-compliance on a confidential basis and if desired, anonymously.
