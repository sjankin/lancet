INNOVATIVE SOLUTION FOR DRILLING WASTE TREATMENT Rosneft began drilling waste reinjection trial operations near Nizhnevartovsk, KhantyMansi Autonomous District. The system has a capacity of more than 140,000 cubic meters of drilling cuttings per year. Three wells were drilled for trials after exploration activities. Drilling waste reinjection is one of the most innovative and environmentally safe solutions for the management of drilling cuttings from oil and gas production. Unlike traditional techniques, reinjection into formations prevents cuttings from coming into contact with the surface and doing harm to the environment. The technology converts drilling cuttings and used solutions into a liquid slurry that is injected deep into isolated subsurface formations, without it contacting the ground water. Observation wells were also built for subsurface soil and water monitoring to track the flow of slurry and hydrodynamic properties of the targeted formations. The system has an automated control tool to centrally collect and process data on parameters of the injection process. In 2017, Rosneft also started an innovation project to develop a drilling waste management technology based on a solution already used by subsidiaries to produce artificial soils. The objective of the project is to enable subsidiaries to switch from multiple drilling waste management techniques to one technology adapted for their operating environment, which is cost efficient, environmentally friendly and autonomous to eliminate their dependence on external suppliers. 74 Environment Ministry and the Ministry of Economic Development, to discuss regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including proposals for reducing Cooperation with them in the public sector. governmental and non-governmental In addition, Rosneft participated environmental groups in Arctic 2017 exercises initiated and organized by the As part of commitment to Ministry of Natural Resources develop and promote more and Environment, the Ministry environmentally friendly techof Emergency Situations and nologies, Rosneft participated Rosprirodnadzor to simulate in work on Best Available an oil spill containment and Techniques (BAT) Reference cleanup effort near the marine Documents for processes ice-resistant fixed platform such as oil production (BAT Prilazlomnaya and the onshore 28), natural gas production system Varandei, which (BAT 29), oil refining (BAT 30), involved several companies. and natural and associated gas processing (BAT 50).

When necessary, SAKHALIN TAIMEN The Sakhalin taimen is included in the Red Book of Russia and the Red Book of Sakhalin Region as an endangered indigenous species of the Far East. In 2017, RN-Sakhalinmorneftegaz implemented a project to draw up recommendations and take action for preserving the Sakhalin taimen and other endangered fish species. The key objectives of the project were:   Assessing the current state of Sakhalin taimen populations in the Company’s regions of operation and identifying factors negatively influencing their populations   Increasing environmental literacy for the conservation of the Sakhalin taimen   Creating research capabilities for further studies The research team prepared a detailed description of the morphology of the River Dagi’s ecosystem, evaluating the size and condition of the Sakhalin taimen population. The density of the population was estimated at 0.028 to 0.164 fish per cubic meter depending on the river section, and their condition was described as good. The research team also analyzed environmental impacts from recreational and commercial fishing and poaching on the River Dagi and the Nyyskiy Zaliv. Their findings suggest that poaching and uncontrolled fishing practices are posing a much bigger threat to the Sakhalin taimen population in the River Dagi than oil and gas production infrastructure, which has an insignificant impact. 77 ROSNEFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 Rosneft applies to the administration of the protected area for the approval of such measures. Pursuant to its Environmental Protection Policy, the Company tries to avoid any activities in special protected areas when possible or, when its activities may have an impact, takes action to minimize it and establish strong environmental monitoring programs. In 2017, Rosneft’s subsidiaries conducted oil and gas exploration and production operations at 44 special protected areas and 28 adjacent areas of high biodiversity value. In addition, they carried out environmental monitoring activities in eight resort towns with protected status and parks where filling stations are located. The Company’s environmental assessment did not reveal any risks posed by its operations to special protection areas and areas of high biodiversity value. license blocks: Pritaimyrsky,   Environmental monitoring at Rosneft also drew up biodiKhatangsky, Vostochnothe Temryuksko-Akhtarsky versity conservation plans and Sibirsky-1, Deryuginsky license block in the Azov programs for 19 sites in 2017. and Tsentralno-Tatarsky Sea.

At the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Environmental Experts, Russia’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment awarded Rosneft the Certificate for the Company’s Active Environmental Policy in the Year of Ecology, recognizing its strong engagement in environmental protection initiatives outlined in its trilateral cooperation agreement with the ministry and Rosprirodnadzor. Rosneft also earned a certificate for consistent efforts to reduce its environmental footprint at a ceremony held to unveil 2017 green rankings in Russia’s oil and gas industry, a sign of recognition of the Company’s large-scale environmental programs. Rosneft’s commitment to environmental sustainability was also recognized at the highest government level, as it received a thank you letter from the Russian President for participation in Year of Ecology initiatives in 2017. 79 ROSNEFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 Gas: Sales and distribution This was more compared with   Upgrading of low-pressure   RN-Morskoi Terminal Tuapse the previous year, largely due to flare systems at the complex started the construction of programs run to celebrate the gas treatment plants of a third industrial wastewater Year of Ecology and a 47% rise the Novo-Urengoisky and and stormwater treatin investment, with investment Vostochno-Urengoisky ment system on the left worth RUB 2 billion made by license blocks.
