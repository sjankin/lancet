Breen Edward D. Breen­: Chief Executive Officer of DowDuPont In 2017, we advanced DuPont’s commitment From climate change to workplace diversity, the connection to sustainable growth by strengthening two between our values and our actions is clear. In the pages of this report you will see illustrations of that inextricable link. For example, fundamental commitments that I highlighted in guided by our commitment to safety and health and environmental last year’s report: aligning our cutting-edge science stewardship, our Nutrition and Health business partnered with with defined market needs, and staying true to the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England our Core Values, which continue to guide how we Aquarium, to develop the first sustainable seaweed program engage with each other, our stakeholders, and the specifically for the hydrocolloid industry and Corteva Agriscience™, world after more than 200 years. our Agriculture Division, announced a partnership with Planet — an integrated aerospace and data analytics company — for a program Now, less than a year from the intended creation of three strong, to deliver digital agriculture software solutions for farmers. independent companies following our merger with Dow, the progress Also, knowing that respect for people translates to competitive we have made positions us well to continue to develop solutions for advantage by fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce with some of the world’s most complex challenges.

Many more platforms, as well as our advanced Digital Agriculture solutions, support the economic sustainability of farmers, driving are food processors, suppliers, or retailers. And we productivity and prosperity, and helping shape the future of are all consumers of food. sustainable agriculture. Shared Challenges We face shared challenges around our food supply. To meet the demands of a growing population, our agricultural system will need to produce 50 percent more food and feed in 2050 than in 2012[2]. Rapid urbanization — primarily in developing countries — will accelerate consumption of proteins, dairy, fruits and vegetables, and other foods[3]. Despite projections for improved livelihoods more than 800 million still go hungry[4], many of them farmers. The convergence of population growth and dietary shifts will further stress already strained natural resources. Agriculture, including through land use change and deforestation, contributes more than 20 percent of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. Degradation of existing lands and soils, and water use and scarcity remain concerns. Limited new arable land means that 90 percent of the growth in global crop production is expected to come from higher yields and improved productivity of existing fields[5]. How we achieve those yields and that productivity is vital to our food future. Beginning a New Journey Our shared challenges inform the purpose of Corteva Agriscience™, Agricultural Division of DowDuPont. We seek to enrich the lives of those who produce and those who consume, ensuring progress for generations to come.

As DowDuPont prepares to spin into three industryleading companies, we draw from our combined Alexa Dembek: legacy of innovation, sustainability performance, Chief Technology and operational excellence to define our culture & Sustainability Officer and our path forward. Specialty Products The Specialty Products company will be innovation-driven, applying Division, of DowDuPont science-based solutions to address global challenges in a way that benefits society, meets customer needs, and delivers stakeholder value. Using sustainability as a driver for innovation, we will leverage technology from both Dow and DuPont to improve over 20 end markets, utilizing partnerships to amplify the impact of our science. Our journey starts with our purpose: Empowering the Providing Clean Water: world with the essential innovations to thrive. Sustainable Development Goals 6, 11 To fulfill our purpose, we look to the UN Sustainable Challenge: Approximately 1% of the Earth’s natural water supply Development Goals for inspiration and direction. While the SDGs is readily available freshwater[3]. According to the World Health may be relatively new, our commitment to solving these types of Organization, half of the world’s population will be living in waterglobal issues is not. stressed areas by 2025. Solutions: Advanced technology in our Safety and Construction portfolio enables cost-effective, safe, and efficient means to produce clean drinking water from a variety of sources, such as treating municipal wastewater for reuse. Our technology will continue to be implemented across the globe, making wastewater reuse and even more attainable reality. Promoting Sustainable, Healthy and Nutritious Food: Sustainable Development Goals 2, 3 Challenge: One in three people suffers from some form of malnutrition[1]. Combating this requires a drastic increase in affordable, nutritious food and a significant decrease in food waste — currently about a third of annual global food production[2]. Solutions: Enzymes created by our Industrial Biosciences business helps bread stay fresh for weeks longer, reducing food waste. An animal feed enzyme increases nutrient uptake, while reducing the release of phosphorus into the environment. Our Nutrition and Health business develops cultures that increase cheese shelf life by up to 200%, and produces plant-based proteins with seven to 70 times lower carbon footprint than meat and dairy proteins. In addition to probiotics, fibers, and prebiotics, we develop solutions to reduce sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats in “Our Nutrition and Health business develops cultures that increase cheese food. We will continue to enable better and healthier foods that are shelf life by up to 200%, and produces plant-based proteins with seven to available and affordable to society. 70 times lower carbon footprint than meat and dairy proteins.” 5 2018 Global Reporting Initiative Report Sustainable Development Goals: DuPont Specialty Products Division “Advanced technology in our Safety and Construction portfolio “Lightweight, high-performance transportation resins developed by our enables cost-effective, safe, and efficient means to produce clean Transportation and Advanced Polymers business replace heavy metal drinking water from a variety of sources, such as treating automotive parts, reducing vehicle weight and increasing municipal wastewater for reuse.” transportation efficiencies.” Enabling Renewable Energy: Reducing Emissions in Transportation: Sustainable Development Goal 7 Sustainable Development Goal 12 Challenge: Experts project that world energy consumption will Challenge: In the US, like many other countries, the transportation grow by 48% between 2012 and 20404[4].

In addition to our direct business engagement, DuPont has a long-standing commitment to safety and many of our sites and employees give back through corporate sustainability. We were one of the first U.S. companies to begin philanthropy and volunteerism. Examples of externally developed reporting corporate environmental goals in 1992 and today we principles and initiatives that we support include: continue to report strong progress on our footprint reduction targets. In 2006, we broadened our vision of sustainability to UN Global Compact: Since 2001, DuPont has committed to include goals focused on bringing products to market that help our aligning our operations and strategies with the ten principles of the customers and others in our value chains be more sustainable.
