Keeping in touch 102-14 with the world reporting trends and development, KONČAR was one of the first companies which opted for the implementation of new Global Reporting Inititative (GRI) Standards in 2017. In addition to complying with the GRI Standards, this Report has also been developed in line with the UN Global Compact Agreement principles, the initiative which we have joined from the very start of operations in Croatia. Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions faced by KONČAR Group companies on most markets, business results achieved in 2017 showed a continuation of Group’s stable operations. Revenue from the sale of products and services, accounting for 91 percent of the overall revenue, amounted to HRK 2,823.4 million. Due to taking appropriate activities and measures and expanding its business operation to new foreign markets, KONČAR Group companies increased its revenue from the sale of products and services abroad by 11.2 percent compared to the 2016 results. One of the result of the indepth organization and business analysis, ended in 2017, was merging of companies operating in switchgear, mediumand low voltage machines. The process was completed on 29 December 2017 by merging KONČAR Medium Voltage Apparatus, KONČAR Switchgear and KONČAR High Voltage Switchgear and establishing a new company KONČAR Switchgear Inc. aimed at achieving a major synergy effect by coordinating market presence, a more efficient development of new products, and reducing operating costs. In the course of these activities we have always taken care of the responsibility as an integral part of KONČAR business processes through all the phases. Responsibility to the environment, to the community in which we operate, and primarily to our employees. KONČAR Group systematically supports and encourages the values in which the culture of work, creativity and excellence takes a significant place, and the company development relies on human resources. This is why a major part of this Report is dedicated to the employee-related activities education, personal advancement, sports and humanitarian activities.
