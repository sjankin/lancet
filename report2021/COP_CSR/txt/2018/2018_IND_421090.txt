Stakeholders, All good companies have an ambitious vision for their business. But success, most often, comes with a price tag. Increasingly, it has become imperative that the processes employed in the pursuit and delivery of this vision and profits are socially and environmentally responsible. The challenge for business leaders today is to balance the needs of an organisation with those of the economy, the environment and society at large for today and for future generations. Developing countries like India are even more pressured in the quest to urgently improve living conditions, infrastructure, employment and the security of its citizens while addressing ecological concerns. Sustainability is not a buzzword. For the country as well as businesses, pursuing growth whilst minimising their environmental impact is the only way to ensure a sustainable future. Clearly this is no easy task. At ACC, we’ve had decades of experience in taking challenges head-on, whether it is our recent collaboration that led to pumping of concrete made of ACC cement to a world record distance of 2.43 kms for the Sainj Hydroelectric Power Project in Himachal Pradesh or reducing specific CO2 emissions by 34% per tonne of cement since 1990. On the environmental front, we also significantly reduced our specific electrical energy consumption and made a sizable reduction in overall freshwater withdrawal in our cement operations. On the social front, we enhanced our CSR outreach to ~4.82 lakh people. This positions us well on the path to meet targets of the Company’s ‘SD 2030 Plan’ which is particularly focused on the areas of Climate, Circular Economy, Water & Nature and People & Communities. We are proud that ACC is an innovative and successful company delivering profits to its shareholders and value to all its stakeholders. But more than that, a strong financial performance allows us to make substantial investments in technology that produces superior quality cement, makes our operations safer and contribute more meaningfully to the communities near our plants. We are delivering for our future. As you read through this report, I am confident that you will appreciate the scale of our ambition, the seriousness of our intent, and the rigour with which we are implementing it. I am grateful to the employees of ACC for their commitment and to our extended family of stakeholders for supporting our endeavours to continually improve the way we do business. . Narotam Sekhsaria 4 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 Managing Director & CEO’s Message Dear Stakeholders, We recognise that we are operating in a world where many natural resources that our business relies on, such as limestone, fossil fuels and water, are limited. Managing and measuring our environmental impact is not only important for the planet, it is essential for the financial sustainability of our supply chain and our business. Through ACC’s Sustainable Development 2030 Plan, we manage the company’s most material economic, environmental and societal impacts with the ambition to create shared value for our business as well as diverse stakeholders around the country. Meeting stakeholder expectations creates a more positive role for our business and the industry as a whole. This includes protecting the water resources on which our operations and communities rely, and investing in community programmes that empower stakeholders throughout our value chain. It also includes managing impacts that are fundamental for any company that does business the right way, such as governance and ethics, people and labour, and other environmental issues such as carbon emissions, biodiversity, waste and packaging. For the 11th year now, ACC has been publishing its Annual Sustainable Development Report, upholding a tradition of providing information of value to the reader as well as assessing and Sustainability is deeply embedded reinforcing the internal chain of accountability. In this year’s sustainability disclosure, we in our business model, focused on made an effort to map our SD strategies, approach and initiatives to the 17 United Nations the four pillars of Climate, Circular Sustainable Development Goals . Economy, Water & Nature, and I am sure that our shareholders will be very pleased with ACC’s business performance in 2017 People & Communities and I am its robust revenue and volume growth, improved productivity, capacity utilisation and market proud to state that ACC has done share, as well as the dividend payout. robust work in 2017 to surpass its target in each of these areas. Sustainability is deeply embedded in our business model, focused on the four pillars of Climate, Circular Economy, Water & Nature, and People & Communities and I am proud to state that ACC has done robust work in 2017 to surpass its target in each of these areas. We significantly lowered our carbon footprint and are in line with our target to reduce CO2 emissions by 34%; we have utilised ~10 mn tonnes of waste; reduced freshwater withdrawals by 15%; and our community programmes have benefitted half a million people across the country. ‘Safety’ is one of our overarching values. Our highest priority is to ensure that everyone involved in our business, from employees to contractors, goes home safe every day. Our Health and Safety Improvement Plan involves strengthening leadership and accountability, building employee capability, making H&S systems more robust, a thrust on road safety and organisational health. At ` 21.82 crores, our CSR expenditure of 2.33% of ACC’s net profit has helped transform lives in over 200 villages across the country; improving access to health and sanitation, education, livelihood and income generation opportunities, as well as empowering women. Ever so often, we stop and ask ourselves are we giving back more to society than we take from it? The Management of ACC and I can quite honestly say that we do. We are confident that through this report, you dear reader, will agree with us.

The governance structure within Risk Management Committee the Organization has well defined roles and responsibilities that enable and empower Shailesh Haribhakti the Management to identify and cash in on business opportunities, and manage risks. In Falguni Nayar addition, there is a comprehensive framework for strategic planning and implementation Sushil Kumar Roongta and performance monitoring of the business plan, which, inter alia includes a well-structured Neeraj Akhoury Business Risk Management (BRM) process. With a view to systematically identify risks and opportunities and monitor their movement, a heat map has been developed comprising two parameters viz. likelihood of the event and the impact it is expected to have on the Company’s operations and performance. The risks that fall under high likelihood and high impact are identified as key risks. This structured process in identifying risks supports the Executive Committee in strategic decision-making and in the development of detailed mitigation plans. The identified risks are then integrated into the Company’s planning cycle which is a rolling process to inter alia periodically review the movement of the risks on the heat map and measure the effectiveness of the mitigation plan. (GRI 102-11, 15, 29-32,201-2) Key Business Risks and Mitigation Plans Raw Material Risk Fuel: The manufacture of cement is an energy intensive process. Coal and petcoke are the principal fuels used by the Indian cement industry to produce thermal energy. The Company requires more than 5 mn tonnes of coal and petcoke to meet the requirements of its kilns and captive power plants. During the year, there was a short supply in the availability of linkage coal, and the Company had to source its requirement of coal at higher prices from the domestic open market and from imports. Petcoke prices also witnessed a significant increase during the year. In October 2017, the Supreme Court of India imposed a temporary ban on the usage of petcoke in the States of Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh with a view to curb pollution. The ban was eased in December 2017 for the cement industry, when the Supreme Court allowed cement companies to use petcoke as a feed stock. However, the apex court has sought a nationwide ban on the use of pet coke, which, if imposed, would consequently increase the Company’s dependence on imported coal, the cost of which is ~20% to 30% higher than that of petcoke. This could in turn increase the fuel costs. The procurement of domestic coal was also laden with various challenges mainly availability of wagons. The continuous volatility in fuel prices in international markets, a probable ban on the usage of petcoke, and the uncertainty over availability of domestic and linkage coal, continue to pose challenges for the cement industry as well as the Company. Despite these challenges, various initiatives and proactive measures taken by the Management in bringing about improvements in the overall manufacturing performance has helped in softening the aforesaid inflationary pressures. The Company has progressively increased the usage of AFR, improved fuel mix at certain plants, entered into firm contracts for part volume and balance on spot to capture opportunities, spread out purchases throughout the year and explored long term off take from local refineries. Limestone Availability: Limestone is one of the main raw materials which is used to manufacture cement. It is therefore of paramount importance for the Company to ensure an uninterrupted long-term availability of this vital mineral. As per the new Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Act 2015 (MMDR), leases granted before 12 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 the commencement of the Act, for captive use are extended up to March 31, 2030, or till the completion of their existing periods of renewal, whichever is later. Most of the Company’s limestone leases thereby get an extension up to March 31, 2030. New mining leases will henceforth be allotted through an auction process to the highest bidder. The period of lease will be fifty years from the date of grant. Forest & Wildlife clearances are now a prerequisite and land acquisition is becoming more challenging and expensive. To address this risk, the Company has taken steps for converting its prospecting licenses into mining leases and also plans to secure new mining leases for its existing plants and for new expansions at different locations. Further, considering that limestone is a natural resource, its usage is done judiciously in the manufacture of cement by adding higher percentage of additives by which it is possible to use low grade limestone, thereby conserving minerals and increasing the life of the mine. Market Competition The total installed capacity of the cement industry in India is much higher than its capacity utilization which presently is ~70%. While this imbalance is expected to continue for some time, capacity expansion continues. Thus, the Indian cement industry has become intensely competitive. This could potentially impact the sales volumes, market share and profitability of the Company. To mitigate this risk, the Company is leveraging its newly created capacities at Jamul and Sindri to increase its market share, enhance its brand equity and visibility, and enlarge its product portfolio by increasing the share of its premium products in the retail segment, application based products and value-added services to the B2B segment. The Company is also exploring asset smart options such as tolling and de-bottlenecking at some of its existing plants to increase volume and market share. Cyber Security Globally there has been a growing dependence on computer systems and the use of internet for doing business and storing of important and sensitive data. However, the rapid growth of technology and sophistication of wireless devices and network have made it easy for unethical hacking of sensitive data and has given rise to a higher risk of fraud. The Company’s IT systems are fully geared to meet the threat of “Distributed Denial of Service” (DDOS) attacks which are highly probable. Manufacturing companies are the new targets as evidenced by recent attacks on large Indian and global firms. The ramifications from cyber attacks are not limited to mere loss of data, but could also result in business and reputation loss. The Indian Government having recognized these risks, has also introduced tighter Cyber Security laws. Responsibilities have been thrust on the Directors of the Company under the Companies Act, 2013 to take appropriate steps to ensure cyber security. ACC’s Business Landscape presents a large surface for a possible attack in view of its vast network spread across many remote locations, with complex IT and OT environments. There is however a strong firewall and well established Disaster Recovery System within the LafargeHolcim Group. Most of the hardware and software have been mapped. The Company’s cyber security management framework aligns with industry standards and regulations. LafargeHolcim has launched a robust programme on cyber security called ‘Zenith’. This programme is aimed at facilitating LafargeHolcim Group Companies to stay abreast and vigilant against possible cyber attacks and remain a step ahead by taking immediate remedial action 13 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 2.5 Stakeholder Engagement With a pan India footprint, ACC touches the lives of countless Indians who purchase its cement and concrete through a vast distribution network. The extended workforce comprising permanent employees, contract and third-party workers as well as trade unions are one of the important groups with daily engagement. Other important stakeholders are shareholders, investors and the community living in the vicinity of our plants and mines. Stakeholder Analysis Stakeholder analysis is done periodically. It was done last in 2016 when we undertook a detailed exercise of stakeholder identification, mapping their interface and influence, and thereafter, prioritisation. This year we revisited that analysis through a survey inviting the views of the senior management in order to validate stakeholder mapping and prioritisation. The stakeholders were remapped in terms of their importance to ACC and their levels of influence, threat and cooperation. The accompanying matrix presents Stakeholders’ Importance, Influence & Threat to ACC on X-axis and ACC’s Engagement, Co-operation & Influence on stakeholders on Y-axis.

We continue to engage closely with key stakeholder groups across all functions at different levels depending on the nature of the relationship and transactions. Communication is an important aspect of engagement using direct and indirect means, such as frequent meetings, one-on-one interactions, email messages, informative intranet portals, webcasts and events, which are two-way channels that provide feedback and suggestions to help make continuous improvements in the quality of our services. The aim is to build a strong chain of accountability within the organisation towards meeting stakeholders’ needs and concerns, and the quality of our services. (GRI 102-43) Charters and Memberships At the global level, ACC is an active member of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI), United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), Leaders for Nature (LfN) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and India Business and Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) of the 14 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). (GRI -102-12) In India, ACC is a member of important chambers of commerce, trade and other associations. The benefits from these memberships flow from participation in seminars hosted by these bodies, learning from their vast database of knowledge and best practices, opportunities for networking and partnerships, access to decision makers and experts, understanding global and national trends, and gathering fresh insights into government policies and their impact on businesses. Simultaneously, these memberships often serve as platforms to promote our products, services and best practices.

The exercise was last conducted in 2015-16, the results of which were presented in the report for 2016. In 2018, a comprehensive assessment of materiality was conducted to review the previous assessment, gain new insights and record improvements and changes. We engaged the services of an external sustainability consulting agency Thinkstep to anchor the exercise and provide a clear perspective. The approach comprised focused group discussions and survey responses of a representative sample of external and internal stakeholders. It included the following steps: Identification: All material topics were identified as per the organisational context, through industry peer research, sector initiatives, wider sustainability trends and harmonising with SDGs. Prioritisation: To prioritise business issues, impact of each material topic on our operations, sales, costs and reputation etc. were discussed at focus group discussions with department head, topics were categorized and ranked. Stakeholder concerns were collected from key stakeholder groups through online surveys and interviews, wherein they were asked to categorise all material topics as low, medium or high. Review and validation: Lastly, materiality analysis outcomes were reviewed, validated and finalised in consultation with the SD team. Refining the analysis done in 2016, the material aspects identified this year were aligned with those named by the LafargeHolcim Group in its Sustainability Development 2030 (SD 2030) Plan, and adopted while formulating ACC’s SD 2030 plan. Other than this realignment and refinement, the end results are largely similar, mainly because the organisation has not undergone any significant changes in terms of its business or constituent stakeholders. (GRI 102 10) It may be noted that the Company focuses on all impacts of the potential material topics covered in the materiality matrix, whether or not we have direct control over the material topics. Key material topics according to the business priorities and stakeholder’s concerns are indicated in the matrix below.

The production of cement consumes a considerable amount of mineral resources such as limestone, shale, clay, sand, iron ore and bauxite. Limestone is the primary raw material. ACC is among the largest users of limestone in the country. Each Integrated cement ~10 plant has one or more captive mines to extract limestone. The other raw materials are sourced mn tonnes of externally. Coal and petcoke are used as principal fuel for thermal energy. waste-derived resources (GRI 301-1,2) The bulk of our electrical energy is generated in-house at our captive thermal used in 2017 power plants. In blended cements, limestone based clinker is substituted with by-products from other processes such as slag from steel plants and fly ash from thermal power plants. Most of the cement sold in India is packed in polypropylene and Adstar bags of 50 kg each.

While we co-process waste generated by other industries and processes, no product made by the Company is reclaimed in any way. (GRI 301-3) Ready Mix Concrete is made as a mixture in specified proportions of Portland Cement, water and aggregates made up of sand and gravel or crushed stone.

It has proved to be durable, versatile, cost-effective and possibly the most viable choice until a more worthy substitute is discovered. For the state and society, the cement industry is a big employer, providing jobs and livelihoods, creating a multiplier effect by way of ancillary businesses, and has been economically rewarding by way of substantial tax revenues. Yet cement is at the centre of the global climate change debate because its production is 34% responsible for about 7% of total global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. CO2 emissions reduction in net CO2 Carbon dioxide is generated as a byproduct of clinker production, an intermediary in cementemissions per tonne of making, through the chemical conversion of limestone (CaCO3) into lime (CaO). The industry’s cement since 1990 environmental impact is measured by the proportion of carbon dioxide emitted per tonne of cement produced. The industry has found several ways in which these emissions can be mitigated or sequestered. ACC has demonstrated a deep commitment to environment protection ever since its inception and initiated remedial measures to adopt strict carbon discipline in a bid to minimising its carbon footprint. The Company’s specific CO2 emissions are among the lowest in the cement industry globally. ACC is an active member of the Indian Chapter of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) and an important signatory of the Low Carbon Technology Roadmap for the Indian cement industry, a voluntary commitment by CSI member companies with time bound targets for reduction of carbon emissions leading to the year 2050.

(GRI 305-1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Emissions from Ready Mix Concrete (RMX) The production of RMX is a simple process, essentially involving blending and mixing operations. Consequently, the process entails relatively low levels of carbon emissions. Much of these CO2 emissions are in fact, generated more during transportation and less in the process itself. 34 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 Table 4.2.2 CO2 Emissions RMX Unit 2015 2016 2017 Scope 1 emissions* tonnes 1,796 3,015 4,275 Scope 2 emissions** tonnes 3,836 6,772 5,110 Scope 3 emissions*** tonnes 39,275 41,607 36,961 *Includes CO2 emissions from captive power plant/DG set and calculated using WBCSD CO2 protocol **Calculated by using CM Emission factor – CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector V11 – Apr 2016 by Central Electricity Authority ***Calculated based on assumptions & approximation of the distance travelled for categories of Employee commute, inbound, outbound and logistic. (GRI 305-1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Reducing CO2 Emissions ACC’s SD 2030 Plan, aligning with that of LafargeHolcim, includes targets for “reduction of specific CO2 emissions by 40% per tonne of cement (vis-à-vis the base of 1990)”. The Company is working on five key levers to help in overall CO2 reduction. Clinker factor to raise clinker substitution Use of green energy and waste heat recovery Use of alternative fuels and raw materials Adoption of new low carbon technologies Production of more blended cements Improving energy efficiency Various energy conservation initiatives undertaken in 2017 as explained in Chapter 4.4 helped us lower energy consumption and reduce our CO2 footprint. Reducing Clinker Factor One of ACC’s best practices has been the decisive steps taken to substitute limestone and thus, improve its clinker factor. A notable way is in the production of Portland Slag and Portland Pozzolana cements. In 2017, the share of blended cement increased to 84.7%. Stabilisation of the recently expanded Jamul and Sindri plants has helped in improving the clinker factor performance. Alternative Fuels & Resources (AFR) As a way to reduce the use of fossil-based fuel and other mineral resources, the Company has gainfully utilised industrial, municipal and agricultural waste and biomass to serve as alternative fuel by co-processing them in its cement kilns. Co-processing of various waste streams enabled us to achieve a Thermal Substitution Rate (TSR) of 4.0% in 2017 as compared to 3.2% achieved in 2016. 35 Table 4.2.3 Overall CO2 reduction achieved Unit 2015 2016 2017 (Scope-1&2) On account of thermal savings (1) tonnes 6,847 2,451 35,746 On account of electrical savings (2) tonnes Nil Nil 1,08,113 On account of clinker factor improvement (3) tonnes Nil Nil 5,31,861 Note: (1) CO2 emission reductions on account of thermal energy is calculated value. (2) CM Emission Factor (CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector – V 11 – Apr 2016 – by Central Electricity Authority) was used for calculating the CO2 emissions on account of electrical savings.(3) CO2 emission reductions on account of clinker factor improvement is calculated by using the thumb rule that for 1% improvement in clinker factor there is reduction of 7.5 Kg CO2 / Tonne of Cement (GRI 302-4) Logistics & Transport Logistics and transportation operations entail predominantly CO2 emissions arising out of fuel consumption by the vehicles. The volume of emissions is directly related to the volume of materials transported, mode of transport (road or rail), the nature and efficiency of vehicles and the quality of roads. Some of it can be addressed by regular maintenance of vehicles. Where available, rail movement is preferred for long distances as a more sustainable mode. Vehicular transport also involves dust pollution, particularly of heavy vehicles moving in cities along dusty roads or at speed. Cement trucks at our plants are de-dusted and covered in tarpaulins before they are dispatched. Bulk transport of cement is of particular merit in this respect as the material is fully covered, making it cost-effective and environment-friendly. RMX is transported in fully covered transit mixers. Non-compliance During the year there were no instances of non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations. (GRI 307-1) Biogenic Emissions Biomass and agricultural wastes used in cement kilns also involve CO2 emissions. This is not accounted by protocol in Scope 1 emissions shown in Table 4.2.1. (GRI 305-1) 36 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 4.3 Other Emissions Besides CO2, there are other emissions from the cement manufacturing process such as dust, sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). 2017 was a path-breaking year when the 19,122 Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC) issued directions to the cement industry to ensure compliance with dust, SOx and NOx emission norms by August 31, ` lakhs 2018. Accordingly, ACC was ready with detailed plant-wise action plans to comply with these towards requirements and submitted them to the Central or State Pollution Control Boards. environmental (GRI 305-7) expenditure NOx emission control Primary measures for NOx emission control comprising Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, meal curtain and low NOx burner were implemented at Lakheri, Gagal 1 & 2, Wadi 1 & 2 and Madukkarai. Secondary measures such as Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems are being executed at Gagal 1 & 2, Kymore and Wadi 2. ACC also began the process of executing the SNCR system for Lakheri, Jamul, Bargarh, Chaibasa, Madukkarai and Wadi 1 and has proposed execution of this system for CPPs at Chanda and Wadi shortly. SOx emission control The Company’s SOx emissions are within specified regulatory limits, and hence do not require any emission control measures. However, secondary measures such as installation of limestone feeding systems are being taken at Chanda, Kymore, Jamul and Wadi plants to control SOx emissions from CPPs.

(GRI 305-6, 305-7) In compliance with the disclosure instructions, ACC submits online reports of emissions and effluents for all plants on the websites of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Boards wherever available. (GRI 305-7) Dust emission control In addition to primary measures, some secondary measures undertaken during the year for controlling dust emissions include conversion of Electrostatic Precipitator(ESP) to hybrid filter in captive power plants (CPPs) at Jamul and Chanda, conversion of cement mill ESP to Bag House at Damodhar , upgradation of cooler ESPs at Gagal 1 & 2, parallel bag house for Gagal coal mill, bag house revamping in kiln at Gagal 2, which is in progress. All these measures have together resulted in reduction of stack dust emissions by 6.6% over the previous year. 37 4.4 Energy The manufacturing of cement is very energy intensive. Power and fuel together make up 20% of the total cost of the Company’s operations. Coal and petcoke are the main fuels for thermal energy while most of the power requirements are fed by captive thermal power plants.

(GRI 302-5) Renewable and Green Energy ACC’s renewable energy portfolio consists of 19 MW of wind farms located in the states of Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. These generated 37.37 mn units of green power (Rajasthan 12.90 mn units, Tamil Nadu 21.05 mn units, Maharashtra 3.42 mn units), which helped to fully meet the Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) (non-solar) for the Company’s plants at Madukkarai and Lakheri, besides getting power at a much cheaper cost. In Maharashtra, ACC Thane complex and Bulk Cement Corporation (India) Limited, Kalamboli are operating mainly on renewable energy with negligible cost through ACC’s wind turbines installed at Satara, Maharashtra, resulting in power cost saving of `3 crore. Additional green power of 6.55 mn units of solar energy was procured through Power Purchase Agreements for Wadi, Thondebhavi and Kudithini plants in Karnataka. In all, 43.92 mn units of green energy were used, representing an increase of 15% as compared to the previous year. The RPO of other plants are met by purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates (REC),solar and non solar. Lakheri plant installed a 10 KW rooftop solar plant at its DAV School. The waste heat recovery system at Gagal Cement Works generated 53.01 mn units of electrical energy during the year 2017.

Chaibasa CFD study was implemented for VRM cyclone to reduce pressure drop across the cyclones; installed Medium Voltage Variable Frequency Drive (MVVFD) for slag dryer fan motor. Damodhar CFD study of cement mill 1 aeroclone cyclones was implemented to reduce the pressure drop across the cyclone and improve the Production Rate Index (PRI). Madukkarai CFD was conducted at various locations, raw coal hopper feed chute to improve feeding, fresh kiln feed box to calciner string to improve heat transfer and avoid short circuiting to control free lime, calciner top cyclone to riser duct feed box to improve heat transfer, meal curtain to improve the material distribution at kiln riser, cement mill 8 cyclone to improve the PRI: burner tip modification to increase the momentum, thereby reduce the free lime in clinker. All Plants Focus on arresting leakages and pressure drops through the CFD study; upgradation of the Distributed Control System, capacitor banks have been added to the system across ACC plants to improve plant power factor, and replacement of conventional lights with LED across the plants. ACC invested ` 27.30 crore on productivity / efficiency improvement, besides implementation of low cost measures to reduce energy consumption. The following are some additional projects being implemented to achieve further energy conservation: Process optimisation Upgradation of existing fans with high efficiency fans Installation of VSDs for process fans at clinkering and grinding, Boiler Feed Pump for CPP Online condenser cleaning system for turbine tubes Upgradation of Energy Management System 40 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 4.5 Circular Economy & Managing Waste Circular Economy We follow the LafargeHolcim approach of promoting a circular economy by “repurposing waste through material recycling and energy recovery.” In doing so, we transform waste, create livelihood opportunities and offer gainful solutions for waste management, all of which, ensures a cleaner environment. zero-waste future Cement manufacturing is a resource intensive process, consuming large quantities of limestone as basic input and coal as principal fuel. Both of these are non-renewable minerals. We manage the consumption of limestone judiciously with a mix of additives that enables Network of 9 co-processing the use of lower grade limestone, thereby conserving minerals and increasing the life of our 3 and specialised mines. We also substitute some part of limestone with by-products from other processes that were hitherto industrial waste, such as slag from steel plants and fly ash from thermal power pre-processing facilities plants which are part of our blended cement. Further, we dispose off industrial, municipal and agricultural wastes by co-processing in cement kilns which recovers energy and material value from them, if any. During 2017, we consumed 4.68 mn tonnes of fly ash, 3.58 mn tonnes of slag, 1.32 mn tonnes of crushed rock fines and 0.35 mn tonnes of other waste derived resources. Geocycle Sustainable waste management is the need of the hour. Waste poses a major societal 4 challenge in the world today, but one that can be solved with innovative thinking. We have taken the lead in providing sustainable waste management solutions to industries lakh tonnes and municipalities under the Geocycle brand of LafargeHolcim. Geocycle works with of waste co-processed in waste generators to minimise and repurpose waste more sustainably and responsibly 2017 while providing cost effective waste management solutions to industry, agriculture and municipalities. Co-processing Co-processing technology as employed by Geocycle offers an approach to manage waste sustainably that is practical, cost efficient, safe and environmentally preferred. Co-processing in cement kilns guarantees complete destruction of all waste due to the high temperature and long residence time involved. Backed by our state-of-the-art technology, tailored processes and in-depth expertise, Geocycle provides safe and reliable solutions to its customers, supporting them in transportation and final waste management through pre-processing and co-processing. We have set up co-processing facilities at our network of cement plants. Additionally, we have three state-of-the-art pre-processing facilities with installations for blending liquids, shredding solids and sludge, and homogenising waste prior to its co-processing. These facilities have a waste processing capacity of around 0.3 mn tonnes per annum, which allows us to manage large volumes of waste safely and sustainably. Our Track Record In 2017, we safely co-processed more than 0.4 mn tonnes of waste. This helped us achieve a thermal substitution rate (TSR) of 4.0% as compared to 3.2% achieved in 2016. All our operations are conducted professionally, carefully managing any associated risks. 41 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 This protects employees, communities and the environment. We actively engage with local communities to promote their prosperity and well-being. A range of hazardous and non-hazardous waste is co-processed at our facilities from sludge, waste solvents, packaging waste, expired medicines and trade rejects to agricultural residues and non-recyclable segregated combustible fractions of municipal wastes. . Case Study Partnering with the Petrochemical sector Geocycle is working towards developing newer solutions, extending its service portfolio and moving upstream in its value chain to offer services including onsite management according to customer requirements. Through Geocycle, ACC has been partnering with the petrochemical sector to ensure safe and sustainable management of the waste generated by it. Key challenges are posed by the high volume of waste generation across the industry and difficulties involved in their handling. We now extend complete solutions to the petrochemical sector. One of our petrochemical partners was looking to manage a large quantity of accumulated oil sludge. The extensive scope of services required was challenging – it included excavation of material from a storage tank, packaging, labelling, loading and transportation. While other solution providers were reticent to provide a complete solution, we were able to overcome the challenges and efficiently co-processed the entire quantity demonstrating a high commitment to safety and professionalism. Another petrochemicals partner faced the daunting task of disposing tank bottom sludge. We supported them by connecting them with regulated third party agencies to provide complete solutions from pit cleaning to pre-processing and co-processing. These projects highlight our partnership approach and willingness to work closely with partners to fully understand their specific waste challenges, needs and priorities, respond to their particular situation and provide a safe and environment friendly solution. Such innovative solutions by our team reaffirm our commitment towards a zero waste future. Managing Waste & Effluents at ACC Unlike some other process industries, cement plants are generally not known to emit waste other than emissions outlined in the preceding chapters. Cement manufacture by itself does not generate any waste water or effluents. Water consumed for industrial cooling gets recycled and reused in the process itself and is thus not wasted. Captive Power Plants (CPPs) may generate small quantities of effluents which are sent for treatment to Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP). The sewage from residential township in the plant campus is treated in Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs). All the waste water thus treated through ETPs and STPs is deployed in dust suppression and green belt development. Domestic waste water not amenable for recycling or treatment is ent into soak-pits located within the plant boundaries. The “Zero Discharge” motto at ACC means that no plant or location is permitted to discharge any process effluent in nearby water bodies or elsewhere. During the year, for CPPs, a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system was installed at the CPP in Chanda while another is in progress at Wadi. There is a proposal to install these systems at Tikaria, Kymore and Jamul. (GRI 306-5) Solid waste such as used oil and grease, metallic scrap, etc. may be generated from maintenance and housekeeping activities of a cement plant. The prescribed approach to handling such waste is to first use the 4R Approach (Reduce, Reuse, Recover and Recycle). If permissible, some hazardous waste such as oil may be sent for co-processing. The remaining hazardous waste is sold to authorised third parties for final disposal (GRI 306-2). We do not transport hazardous waste categorised under the Basel Convention (GRI 306-4). Table 4.5.1 shows the quantity of hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated in 2017.

Others includes waste cement bags, conveyor belts, wood, copper, plastic bags, electrical cables, empty glass bottles, aluminum, tyres, paper, PVC drums, HDPE wrapper, etc. The spill management system minimises impacts in the event of a spill. There were no instances of any significant spill in 2017. (GRI 306-3) Cement is sold in 50 kg bags mostly of polypropylene and Adstar. Unusable bags are reused within the plant, while small quantities leftover may be sold as scrap. Empty bags are sometimes used in construction sites for storage of material. Empty cement bags are also used as roof coverings particularly during monsoons. We do not reclaim used packaging material. (GRI 301-3) Plastic Waste Management Rules The Government has notified the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 which supersedes the earlier Rules. These Rules bring in extended producers’ responsibility to ensure a collectback system of plastic waste apart from ensuring other compliances. According to the Rules, the cement industry is obliged to establish a collection system for cement packing bags and the plan of collection is to be submitted to the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) while applying for Consent to Operate. These Rules have huge implications on the cement industry and ACC is gearing up to meet these challenges. New Solid Waste Management Rules Vide a notification on new Solid Waste Management Rules issued by MoEF & CC in April 2016, cement plants within residential townships have been instructed to comply with the practices of segregation of waste at source, collection of waste from source and disposal in line with the prescribed practices. We are taking necessary actions to comply with the requirements. 43 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 4.6 Water ACC was early to recognise the value of water conservation. The proof of that is visible at most plants which have created water reserves and regularly revive and rehabilitate existing water sources. Rainwater harvesting is an established practice at all plants. ACC has resolved to achieve Zero Discharge of water in all its operations. All plant locations make unremitting efforts to comply with this commitment in several ways, beginning with stringent discipline in water consumption and by treatment, recycling and reuse of water. Thus, several ACC plants ~15% are already self-reliant in meeting their water requirements, bringing us closer to our goal of becoming “water positive”. Besides, our withdrawal of water does not impact any water body. reduction in specific (GRI 303-2) freshwater withdrawal vs Table 4.6.1 2015 Total water withdrawal* Cement Unit 2015 2016 2017 Surface water mn m3 5.37 5.44 6.68 Harvested rainwater mn m 3 8.01 6.85 6.76 Municipal water mn m3 0.07 0.07 0.14 Ground water mn m 3 1.23 1.99 2.00 Percentage of sites with water recycling % 88.24 88.24 100 Total Quantity of Water Treated and % 9.84 9.1 10.5 Reused Annually Total Quantity of Water Treated and mn m3 1.45 1.31 1.63 Reused Annually Total water withdrawal* RMX Municipal water mn m3 0.48 0.37 Ground water mn m3 0.871 0.32 0.64 *Partial quantities are based on meter reading where available while the rest is calculated based on pump capacity and running hours (GRI 303-1, 3) Sustainable Development 2030 Plan The Group’s SD 2030 Plan lays down a target to reduce specific fresh water withdrawal by 30% by 2030. To meet this target, various initiatives are being taken such as: Reduction of fresh water intake by lowering water demand in process and non-process areas. Process optimisation and upgradation to water efficient technologies wherever feasible. Installation of Sewage Treatment Plants (STP), Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP), and Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems for effective reutilisation of waste water. Efforts to conserve water through rain water continue at all plants, mines, colonies and community areas. Installation of water metering and monitoring systems at most plants help identify the source of leakages and potential scope for water conservation. Implementing WASH Ensuring a Safe and healthy future Access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. The WASH pledge is an initiative by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and its compliance is one of our SD 2030 targets. During the year, ACC assessed the WASH score at all its plant sites, and developed action plans for each plant to implement the WASH pledge. 44 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 4.7 Biodiversity ACC’s SD 2030 Plan includes an assurance that we aim to create a “positive change on biodiversity by 2030 vis-à-vis 2020.” Mining and Biodiversity Cement is an extractive process and mining is the main activity which could directly impact habitat and biodiversity. This can happen due to erosion of top soil, damage to flora and fauna, noise and dust pollution. We adopt clean mining practices and continuously endeavour to reduce the level of impact of our operations on the environment around us. All our plants and mines work according to comprehensive plans approved by mining authorities. Used and spent mines undergo rehabilitation in a manner designed to protect the local biodiversity, and all our sites have approved quarry rehabilitation plans. With 17 mining sites, by 2017, total Biodiversity Indicator and rehabilitated area was ~758 ha. (GRI 304 2, 3) Reporting System (BIRS) Among our mining sites, three sites are relatively biodiversity-sensitive, where 10 species Achieving the Biodiversity fall under ‘Schedule I’ category for which we have prepared a Wildlife Conservation Plan commitment of the SD 2030 (WCP), duly approved by the authorities.

Other than adopting low carbon practices in its own production processes, the company actively demonstrates a concern to spread awareness among other stakeholders in the construction chain to use methods that are cost-effective, planet-friendly and socially responsive. In addition the company shares 53 GBCs in 2017 its expertise wherever possible through means such as its Indian Concrete Journal, technical 38 active, 15 under seminars and training programmes for masons, contractors and engineers. ACC is inspired implementation by the LafargeHolcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction to promote and encourage sustainable construction projects in the country. Green Building Centers (GBCs) 19,259 affordable The company has long advanced the importance of affordable construction. Expanding homes built through GBCs this concept to incorporate wider aspects of sustainability, ACC launched its unique Green Building centres across the country. These centres actively promote sustainable, green, cost effective and affordable construction in semi-urban and rural India, by supporting local microentrepreneurs and small businesses to make and market affordable cement-based home building components and pre-fabricated materials. During the year, 22 new Green Building centres were set up. GBCs have together utilised 23,749 tonnes of Fly ash, conserving 51,465 tonnes natural top soil and thus avoid 3,622 tonnes of Carbon Dioxide Emission during the year. In all GBCs have helped raise 7,736 low costs housing /shelters. LafargeHolcim Awards for Sustainable Construction ACC has wholeheartedly promoted this global competition in India, using it as an opportunity to spread awareness about sustainable construction in India among a diverse group of stakeholders associated with the built environment. India usually sends the highest number of entries. Conducted continentally in its first phase, the LafargeHolcim Awards are among the most reputed worldwide competitions to adjudge sustainable design in construction. The USD 2 mn Awards competition seeks projects at an advanced stage of design, not finished works. It evaluates project entries for designs that go beyond current standards, showcase sustainable responses to technological, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural issues affecting contemporary construction to deliver visionary solutions to the way the world builds. An Indian project entry emerged as winner of the Gold Prize at the Asia Pacific segment of the Global LafargeHolcim Awards 2017 for the first time. Submitted by architects from Mumbai the design is for transformation of an existing orphanage in Thane using a viable economic model that combines a child-friendly architectural design with social sustainability and novel concepts like passive building technology. 46 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 5.0 Societal & Our SD 2030 Plan for People and Communities and relevant Initiatives contribute to the following Sustainable Development Goals Other Aspects NO POVERTY ZERO HUNGER GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING 5.1 Health & Safety 5.2 People & Employment QUALITY GENDER CLEAN WATER EDUCATION EQUALITY AND SANITATION 5.3 Human Rights 5.4 Community Development & Social Responsibility DECENT WORK AND INDUSTRY, INNOVATION REDUCED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE INEQUALITIE S SUSTAINABLE CITIES PEACE, JUSTICE AND COMMUNITIE S AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS 47 5.1 Health & Safety Zero Harm encapsulates the Group’s approach to Health & Safety (H&S); an overarching value, demonstrated in all our business operations. Despite practicing a vigourous H&S regimen, we regret the tragic on-site fatality of one employee during the year. We have redoubled our efforts to make all our offices, plants and other locations safer and healthier. In particular, we have stepped up our efforts in the area of road safety (GRI 403-2) Table 5.1.1 Parameters 2015 2016 2017 Employee Fatalities (no.) 0 0 1 Fatality Rates (directly employed) 0 0 0.67 Contractor Fatalities on site (no.) 3 5 0 Contractors Fatalities off site (no.) 4 5 4 Employee Lost Time Injury (LTI) 19 16 7 Employee Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate(LTIFR) 1.00 0.90 0.41 Employee Injury Rate (IR) 1.63 1.33 0.94 Employee Lost Day Rate (LDR) 33.00 53.80 18.95 Health and Safety Improvement Plan A new Health & Safety Improvement Plan was formulated and put in place during the year. The plan involved action to achieve seven distinct objectives, each assigned clearly designated leaders and tasks. Programmes were drawn up for implementation in pursuit of each of the objectives. (GRI 403-1, 3, 4) Star Warehouse Rating Programme This programme aims to upgrade our warehouses across several parameters to make them the best in class in the cement industry. The programme rates different warehouses on various aspects of warehousing quality infrastructure, processes, stacking and storing, people skills and other practices. In the process a benchmark is created for warehouse operations standards as a useful reference. Learning and sharing best practices is the key in raising the standards to represent the highest levels of customer service. A jury panel consisting of ACC managers, CFAs (clearing & forwarding agents) and external experts is constituted to rate different warehouses around the country. The key parameters for evaluation are Health & Safety practices, branding, infrastructure and operations, with each parameter having further specific criteria to qualify for 3, 5 and 7 star ratings. The company wants to identify and felicitate the best CFAs and staff and share the winning practices so as to create a learning platform for all ACC warehouse owners and managers. Road shows have already been conducted across regions to appraise CFAs and their staff about details of this programme. Regional and national level reward and recognition events are planned in 2018 to award the best performers. 48 Table 5.1.2 Objective Programmes/ Actions H&S Leadership & “More Boots on the Ground” to encourage more visits to Accountability shopfloor by senior leaders 3600 H&S Leadership Survey E-Module Fostering Feedback and self-introspection launched People H&S NEBOSH International Certificate Program Capability Risk Assessment Training Developing Safety Commitment H&S Management Group H&S Safety Audit System Mandatory Safety Release on “Safe managing of hot material Leakage” Hazard & Operability (HAZOP) “quarry-to-lorry” risk assessment at Bargarh and Gagal “Suraksha Laher” campaign on Working at Heights and Machine guarding in May 2017 Road Safety and Driver Management Centres Logistics Star Warehouse Rating Programme Electrical Safety “Suraksha Laher campaign in Dec 2017 Visible Personal ACC H&S Feedback app launched to provide real-time Commitment feedback for preventive actions Health Industrial Hygiene survey covering respirable dust and noise New health surveillance with profile fitness matrix rolled out EMR infrastructure optimisation done for all plants A pool of employees is monitored via Lifestyle Management program Tie-up with Apollo Hospitals; rate contract with Apollo Pharmacy Skill up-gradation for doctors “Health & Safety” workshop for ACC school teachers 26 doctors and 14 paramedics trained in International trauma life support (ITLS) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) 6 doctors attended Medical Education programme at Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore 49 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 100% of our workforce is covered by formal joint management worker health and safety committees. Guidelines are in place for personnel and property security. Several health and safety topics such as contractor safety directive, use of PPE and related subjects are covered in formal agreements with trade unions.(GRI 403-1,4) Driver Management Centres Driver Management Centres (DMC) were established in 2016 at cement plants to create awareness among drivers and employees on H&S related matters and to inculcate in them the proper behaviour required for safe journeys. The DMCs address issues relating to drivers, vehicles and journey management and use specialised techniques like simulator training, seat belt convincer training and defensive driver training techniques. The focus in 2017 was on scaling up DMCs, upgrading their deliverables and capacity building of counselors. DMCs now include multiple programmes including Defensive Driver Induction (DDI) for first trip drivers, Defensive Driving Course (DDC), In-cab Assessment, tool box talks, Journey Risk Management (JRM) briefing and In Vehicle Monitoring System (IVMS) and Global Positioning System(GPS) based counseling. Select counselors are sent to a driver training institute managed by a reputable organisation to enable them to get expert inputs and hands-on driving experience on a custom-built track. In addition, there is ’Train the Trainer’ programme conducted by professional agencies. Ready Mix Concrete Business RMX is a service-oriented business, where delivery time is critical and is particularly vulnerable to risks mainly in transport and handling. Specific guidelines and procedures were developed and rolled out for eight critical activities of RMX operations based on the risk profiles and for customer site safety and pumping operations. These activities include the ’Seven Mirrors Policy’ for transit mixers, the compulsory use of wheel chokes, IVMS in all transit mixers for monitoring speeding, harsh braking and acceleration by drivers. An expert from LafargeHolcim conducted a world class training at ACC RMX to improve the safety culture in this rapidly growing business. 50 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 5.2 People & Employment In today’s competitive world, companies and people must continue to evolve to stay ahead of the game. ACC values diversity and promotes an inclusive and fair workforce. In the year 2017, the company employed total 7422 people out of which approximately 3.7% equaling to 274, were women.

These women are being trained to become Central Control Room (CCR) operators-cumQuality Analysts. The CCR is the hub of a modern day cement plant. This is a one-of-its-kind initiative in the industry that is bound to break traditional stereotypes in cement manufacturing units and provide an impetus to our gender diversity ambitions. (GRI 405-1) Employee Engagement– Ranked Best Globally in LafargeHolcim Group ACC employees scored the highest in the “Pulse Survey” conducted by LafargeHolcim to assess employee engagement-cum-perceptions among its worldwide group companies. The survey sought to capture employee’s responses to a comprehensive set of parameters, such as My Company New value propositions, My Work – impact, My Deal – what it means to me and Behavioural Pillars of Agility, Collaboration and Empowerment. Will 100% of ACC employees participating in the survey, the findings indicated a very high degree of pride and affinity among employees and a close association with the Company’s vision, mission and core values. The results not only underscored ACC’s highly engaged and motivated workforce, but also endorses the Company’s commitment to create a best-in-class workplace. Industrial Relations Continuing its tradition of harmony and mutual respect with the workforce and trade associations, ACC maintained cordial industrial relations with them throughout the year. The year saw the launch of ‘Sparsh – a caring connect,’ a telephonic counseling service for employees and their families meant to provide them with support and confidential advice to deal with a wide range of mental health issues. Workday During the year, people processes were strengthened by the implementation of Workday, a robust cloud-based HR information platform. Workday empowers line managers by providing them a single source for all employee-related information. This has reinforced the effectiveness of line managers in the vital function of people development and providing agility and collaboration ease to HR managers. 52 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 Employee Benefits ACC’s remuneration package is competitive. Full-time employees benefit from attractive schemes covering education, health, retirement, loans, disability and invalidity coverage, and financial assistance. Plant employees get furnished or unfurnished accommodation according to their entitlement while their families enjoy round-the-clock healthcare at well-equipped healthcare centres; recreational and cultural facilities; and subsidised education at excellent company schools. Temporary or part-time staff, do not receive the same benefits as full-time or permanent staff, though these benefits compare well with local market practice.

A permanent employee receives retirement benefits in compliance with statutory requirements, including leave encashment, provident fund, Officers’ Superannuation Fund, gratuity, additional gratuity as eligible, and amounts due under the National Pension Scheme, if any. Advance notice is served one year ahead of the date of retirement. Some useful advice is offered on health and investment aspects though no specific re-training is provided. (GRI 404-2 and GRI 201-3) Parental leave ACC has recruited women in different positions at the Head Office, sales offices and plants since its inception. Paid maternity leave has been a long tradition that continues in the company. In 2017, 16 women took maternity leave entitled, of whom eight (or 50%) returned to work, six were still on leave, one resigned while one sadly passed away. The majority of women who avail such leave return to work, invariably involving no loss of continuity in position or job content. This facility of parental leave is not open to male employees. (GRI 401-3) A majority of women who avail such leave return to work, invariably involving no loss of continuity in position or job content.

(GRI 401-3) Other Aspects A minimum notice period of 15 -30 days is typically provided to employees and their elected representatives before the implementation of any significant operational change that could substantially affect them. Senior management staff is hired within the country, while nonmanagement staff at most operations is drawn from the local communities. (GRI 202-2) During the year there was no material change in the company’s general remuneration policy for employees vis-à-vis that for its Chief Executive. Since there was a transition in the leadership position within the year, it is possible that the ratio comparing the percentage increase in these two categories may not be entirely meaningful. Hence, this ratio is not included in this report. 53 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 5.3 Human Rights Awareness of Human Rights At ACC, we recognise the inherent All employees are made aware of human rights aspects through online or face-to-face dignity and human rights of training, as part of ACC’s Code of Business Conduct.

These and other interventions have sensitized local communities on issues like immunisation, antenatal care and institutional deliveries at health centres. Project Swavalamban Case Study from Chanda “Financial independence is paramount. If a woman is financially independent, she has the ability to fulfill her dreams and live life on her own terms,” said Veena Rajurkar, a 38-year-old woman, living near ACC Chanda and a beneficiary of its ‘Swavalamban’ initiative. This is an effort to facilitate self-reliance and empower women from weaker sections of the community such as by developing microenterprises through Self Help Groups (SHGs). For Veena, being a part of Jijamata Mahila Bachat Gat for the past 10 years has proven to be extremely fruitful. The group attended a training programme on cattle breeding, following which they took a bank loan to buy their own cattle. Veena soon started selling milk profitably. Starting with monthly deposits of ` 50/-, she now deposits ` 200/per month. She repaid the bank loan and started saving again to expand her business. She attended another training programme to learn how to make dairy products such as paneer, shrikhand, ghee and khoya. Veena has entrepreneurial dreams and wants to be as big as Amul in her region. She is determined to make her and her family’s life better. She believes that every woman must become financially strong and work to support her family. Facilitating Access to Government Social Security Schemes ACC Sindri ACC Sindri’s CSR team played a guiding role in enabling numerous unorganised workers understand and gain access to social security entitlements provided in the state government’s Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. This was done through road shows by teams travelling in mobile vans with information, education and communication(IEC) material, actively supported by members of local communities, self-help groups and Panchayati Raj institutions. The teams advised those who were not fully aware of their entitlements in health, nutrition and social security under the state’s flagship programmes, sharing useful information on registration, schemes and benefit claim processes. In collaboration with state government officials and the PHIA Foundation, over 3,500 unorganised workers were registered online in the Shramadhan Portal at Sindri’s DISHA Centre. Using information provided by the State Labour Helpline number, the plant’s CSR team visited individual households to mobilise unorganised workers with labour identity cards to apply for benefit claim processes. There were 133 beneficiaries for various schemes, such as skill development, educational scholarships, health insurance and maternity schemes. 59 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 6.0 Sustainability Roadmap 6.1 Scorecard for 2017 6.2 The Road Ahead 60 ACC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2017 6.1 SD Scorecard 2017 Table 6.1.1 Parameters Target 2017 Status 2017 CO2 To reduce specific CO2 Specific CO2 emissions emissions by 35% as reduced by 34% as compared to 1990 compared to 1990 ACC Gagal awarded the Sustainability 4.0 Award Thermal Substitution Rate To achieve Thermal Target not achieved. by Frost & Sullivan & TERI, in Substitution Rate of 10% Thermal Substitution Rate the ‘Challengers’ category for in 2017 was 4% vs. the Large Business. target of 10% Water To reduce specific We have reduced specific water consumption for water consumption by 32% manufacturing of cement by in 2017 vs 2012 10% as compared to 2012 Specific Total Energy To reduce by 3% as compared Specific Total Energy Intensity (Metric Tonne of Oil to 2013 Intensity reduced by 11.9% Equivalent (MTOE) per tonne as compared to 2013 of Cement) CSR To continue to expand our CSR CSR expenditure was footprint `21.82 crore, higher than the required 2% of average Focus on inclusive business profit of the last three projects like sanitation, etc. years, benefitting over 4.82 lakh people This is the last year, we are reporting our progress against our SD targets which were set in 2013.
