That mad de us the wworthy leade er in elecctric contactt compositees. Oveer the past 20 years and more, the path we e have takeen has been n extraordinnary, andd the resullts have been spectaacular. Even in this treacherous international environment, We W are stilll adhering to the spirit of the 19th CPC ccongress, never forggetting the original o inteention and keeping the e mission inn mind.

The morre civilized a society is,i the morre respect and a undersstanding it has for human natuure. Therefo ore, as a co onscientious enterprise e with sociaal responsibbility, Hongfeng has written ourr respect fo or human rigghts into ouur employeee handbookk。 Hon ngfeng shall not discriminate agaainst any em mployee for any reaso on such as age, racee, gender, sexual orientation, marrital status, religious beelief, nation nal extractio on or disaability. We are to guaarantee ou ur employees a fair working w environment and prottection from m the losss of their joobs. All em mployees without w anyy discriminaation whaatsoever haave the righ ht to equal pay for eq qual work. Many M emplloyees who o left befoore will retturn to Hon ngfeng again, because the door is i always o open to ourr old emp ployees. Im mplemen ntationss For every new recruit from all over the countryy, we will give g them a training ab bout our company production p line. Make them awarre of the co ompany's basic knowle edge andd production n model. Att the same time, they will have a general un nderstandinng of Page 4 / 26 our overall organization. In this way, they will haave self‐awaareness abo out their career. Every position in the com mpany is eq qual and op pen, and it is needed self‐orientaation thatt needed. We W respect the t individu ual voice and choice of every employee. At the t same time, we alsso provide excellent salary s and learning op pportunitiess for each position. On the on ne hand, we conduct performancce reviews to ensure that emp ployees aree paid in pro oportion to the value of o their labor; on the oother hand, we resist the cultu ure of overtime work. Because overtimeo woork means more time and ort, employyees are lesss motivateed and less productivee in the lon effo ng run. It's not worrth it to the companyy nor the employees. e In the off‐‐duty time,, we hope that emp ployees can n use it to o recharge, regulate theirt physiccal and meental state and impprove their comprehen nsive qualityy. To this end, we provide librariees and gym ms to meeet the physical and meental needs of our emp ployees. You u can ask yo our leaders and colleeagues aboout everything at workk, and therre will be reegular train ning sessionns to enriich everyonne's skill treee. We respect thee legitimatee rights and interests of o our emplo oyees, so ou ur supplierss are wannted. To rooot out hum man rights abuses, com mpanies neeed to go furrther down n the line. The closerr you get too the sourcee, the more difficult resspect for hu uman rightss will become. Only through t onee pass one, can we imp plement hu uman rights defense. Th hat’s wheere UNGC stand. So we signed a supplie er code of conduct to call on our Page 5 / 26 suppliers respect the hu uman rightts. It show ws our deteermination to implem ment perssonal rightss, but also calls on supp pliers to fulffill their bassic obligatio ons. Thee metals wee produce may involvve conflict minerals. Meanwhile M serious human righ hts and envvironmental problems have been n caused byy the explo oitation of rare mettals such ass silicon‐blaack tungsteen coltan an nd gold in the DRC an nd surrounding countries and regions.

To ann enterprise e it’s emp ployee's body. To pay attention to o the health h of employyees is to p pay attentio on to the health of the t enterpriise itself. Heealth checkks for all em mployees weere successsfully com mpleted thiis year. Mo ost diseasees can be turned aw way by preecaution, early e deteection, and early treattment. The employee who failed d physical exxamination can change his posst, take a reest in anothher turn or a long holiday to coop perate withh the doctor. Physiccal sustainaable devellopment iss the foun ndation off a compaany's susttainable devvelopment. We pull full resspect for hu uman rightss to form a company’s managemeent culture..

TThrough sysstem trainning and unitary u arrrangement they are enjoying their workss at Hongffeng. Periiodically theey may be gathered g to o learn ten principles of o the Globaal Compact and we encourage our custom mers and su uppliers to join Global Compact and take acttions to support ten principles. Hon ngfeng respects its employees’ rigght to assocciate freely, form or join organizattions of their choo osing and to bargain n collective ely in acco ordance w with recogn nized inteernational instrumentss, local lawss and regulations, in full freedom and with hout fearr of reprisaal, intimidaation or haarassment. Hongfeng is committted to conduct colleective bargaaining with employee representat r tives of a leggally recogn nized union. Everyone is freee to join the t labor union, u so eaach voice can c be integgrated into o the grou up. At the same s time, we are committed to o eliminatinng all formss of compulsory andd forced labo or. In response to goveernment reggulations, evveryone can n work no more m than n 40 hours a week. Seet Sundays as a mandato ory rest dayys. People u under 18’s shall s Page 11 / 26 6 not be employyed. This reegulation haas been wrritten into our o employyee manual and recrruitment infformation ono poster. Not N only ourr company, had we also o demande ed all suppliers take part p in obeyying labor principles. p Thee company encourages equal diaalogue and communiccation amo ong employyees, betw ween superiors and subordinate s es, between n employeees and the company. And com mmitted to creating harmoniou us, honest relationships, Maintain a worrking atm mosphere off harmony, mutual m trusst and comm mon progresss. Hon ngfeng will treat every employ with w respecct and dign nity and w will not tole erate disccrimination or harassm ment of anyy kind. Emp ployment‐reelated decissions are baased on a variety of relevantt factors such as qualifications,, skills, performance and releevant experiience. Im mplemen ntationss e To ensure an equal, e a free working fair and w environment fo or employeees, we pro ovide mulltiple chann nels of appeeal. If an emmployee's le egal rights and interessts are violaated, he can first send an em mail directlyy to the general man nager or call the gen neral man nager to complain. c O course, there are some other opinion Of ns that can n be pressented to managemeent layer through the e form of a suggestion box. Th hese com mments, of course, c can be made anonymous a ly for the beenefit of the sponsors. We pleddge that no consequen nces or liability will be pursued p agaainst the prroposer. In order o to improve the enthusiasm m of employyees, we allso conductted anonym mous queestionnairess to some im mportant departmentss and employees. The content off the queestionnaire includes thee satisfactio on with the recruitmen nt process aand the exissting worrk. If they have h any Su uggestions, they t can directly feedback on thee questionn naire for us to make improvemeents. Thee combinatio on of work and rest is a sustainable developm ment model for employyees. Page 12 / 26 6 We are graduaally improvin ng from an enterprise that strugggles on the front line every day.. Normalizaation and humanizatio h on are ourr developm ment trendss. Therefore e, in ordeer to adjustt employeess' scheduless reasonablly and keep them in a benign worrking statte, we issued mandatorry rest policcies and Oveertime Worrk Managem ment. Honngfeng is co ommitted tot providing a safe an nd healthy working environmentt, to minnimizing thee risk or accidents. We will providee the facilitiies, trainingg and protecctive equuipment necessary to ensure a safe s workplace for all our employees. We will facilitate reporrting of unsafe factorrs. We are committed d to ensurin ng the phyysical secuurity of all employees. e Page 13 / 26 6 Variious labor protectionss were preepared, acccording to the t environ nment and job content in diffferent workkplace. Weaar earplugss in noisy workshop w sttaff. Wear dust massks in dusty areas. Weaar safety shooes in products transpoorting. Everyone was born equally and freelly, rights off our emplo oyees should d be proteccted. Diffferent from traditional enterprisees, our company respeects the equ ual competition hts of everyy employee when applying for the righ e managemment positio on. So in March andd April of this t year, we w held a competition meeting for qualityy manager and techhnical supeervisor resspectively. Firstly, Caandidates from f differrent positiions, deppartments and a workshops can reggister. And then the co ontestants make a spe eech aboout themselves. Finallyy, the com mpany's exe ecutives and d workshop p managem ment voteed in secrett for the win nner. Page 14 / 26 6 In order to erase e the gap betweeen emplo oyees and company, superiors and subordinates, wew also orgganized a newn round of activitiees for employees’ childdren this summer. Show S them around thee Wenzhou museum, meticulously m y prepare them giftss. Humanisttic care for employees e should alsoo benefit em mployees' faamily membbers. Thiss is Hongfen ng’s unique outstandin ng corporatee culture. Only O when eemployees have h a waarm and haarmonious homeh can th hey complete their work with easee. Page 15 / 26 6 Me easurem ment of outcome o es s Onee figure to show f their freedom to associationn will be ou ur union stafff ratio reacched 83% %. Gifts are delivered d evvery woman’s day and other impo ortant festivvals. By limiting thee age in reecruitment and submitting proceess data, co ompany can nnot empploy child Laabor, Proteccting minorrs receive du ue educatioon at proteccted age. Morre compreh hensive safeety measurees have ressult in fewer workplacee accidents this year than last year. The visible v impro ovement off management level no ot only ensures the life safety of employeees, but alsso reduces the company's risk co osts. Duringg the Page 16 / 26 6 impplementation of the Sunday maandatory rest regulattion and O Overtime Work W Man nagement, the workingg hours of employees e have significantly decreased. It avvoids ineffficient oveertime work, improvves employyee productivity and d reduces the commpany's production cossts and enerrgy consum mption. Man ny purposes were serve ed at the same time;; our busineess has succcessfully opened up an efficient m mode. By conveying c t those four basic laborr principles,, Hongfeng now is in a harmony and highhly motivated atmosphere. Everyyone was born b equallyy and freely, rights off our emp ployees shoould be prottected, rights of every labor shoulld be proteccted. That’ss our finaal goal also UNGC’s U futu ure. Page 17 / 26 6 Chaapter4.Environmen ntal Principles Prin nciple 7: businesses b support a precautionary app proach to environme ental challenges; Prin nciples 8: un p ndertake iniitiatives to promote greeater enviro onmental reesponsibilityy; Prin nciples 9: encourage the develop pment and diffusion of environmentally frie endly techhnologies Assessment, policcy and goals g In thhe spirit of strengthening environ nmental pro otection, savving resourcces, energy and pollution preveention and continuouss improvement, It is also to impleement comp pany environmental policy, Acccording to the t standarrd requirem ments of GB B/ t24001‐22016 idtISSO14001:20 015, we havve established an envirronmental managemen m nt system. Obsserve the laaws and reggulations; strengthen the t processs control; saave energy and consumption; realize r conttinuous imp provement; promoting environmental protecttion; Environmental protection n is not on nly a responsibility, bu ut also a taask. Under the guiddance of th he environmmental policy, the com mpany shou uld set the environme ental goal, and achieeve the goal, make con ntinuous improvement,, and take p practical acttions for the t creation n of a green n homeland. Im mplemen ntationss In order o to prootect the ennvironment,, we first sttart from ou ur own prod ducts. Conssider the ecological at the beeginning off product developmen d nt design. Therefore, our techhnological research r annd development direcction is on environmeental protecction prod ducts. The products recommended to custo omers are mainly in line with RO OHS. Page 18 / 26 6 When the origginal produccts of custo omers are not n environ nmental, wee also offerr the swittching scheme to prom mote the application off environmeental produccts. We also issued d a variety of internal energy con nservation notice. Inclluding setting a reassonable tem mperature range for air conditiioning, app ply LED ligh hting, Prommote papperless office and telecconference system, s pattrol whetheer the comp puter, lights and otheer equipmeent are switched off aftter work. Th hese strateggies help reeduce operaating costts and comp pany's carboon emissionns. In terms t of waater, we also strive too import ad dvanced eq quipment to o realize water w recyycle and reeduce sewaage discharge. Our 2t/h 2 MVR evaporative e e crystallizaation equuipment can n treat up to o 48 tons off waste wate er a day. Th he applicatioon of autom matic senssing water discharge facilities f commpletely avvoids the ph henomenon n of man‐m made wasste of waterr. Because of the specificity of our company's products，p Massive materials can n be recyycled from our customer or next procedu ure. Therefo ore recyclee contract with custtomers helpps us cut doown cost of production and need of o raw mateerial. Packaging materials are also a importaant resources to recycle. Becausee most of th hose are plastic which is extremmely harmful to enviro onment if disposed imp properly. Soo we designed manyy recyclablee package materials. m In n this way, quality of product can n be ensured, econo omy and greeenly. Pictures below show s those materials. Page 19 / 26 6 We also updatted the ISO14000 certificate this year. Manaaging our co ompany by this tooll wins us approbation from customers do omestic an nd overseass. As a rap pidly developing ennterprise, we w realize the t importtance of establishing environme ental image. By redu ucing exhau ust gas emisssions; fightt pollution; and managging equipm ment w also haave been certificated for water purrification, we d by local environme ental auth hority. Page 20 / 26 6 Me easurem ment of outcome o es Throough these measurees, we haave reduce ed electriccity consumption, water w consumption and a carbon n emissionss this year. See the sttatistical ch hart for furrther info ormation. Page 21 / 26 6 For several yeaars, there arre zero penaalties for en nvironmentaal problem. Of course, c thesse achievemments alonee are not enough, whilee developing ourselvess, we also o need to in ntegrate the concept of environm mental susttainable devvelopment into the enterprisee. Actively confront environmen e ntal risks, take t the reesponsibilityy of environmental protection n, and incrrease investtment in environmen e ntal technollogy. Theese strategiees show us the t way forward, ahead of The Tim mes.

Therefo o ore, many operators d do not wan nt to impprove their product qu uality and service level, but to co ommercial b bribery, corrrupt sociial ethos and industry rules, r formiing a viciouss cycle and competition. In order o to effectively e promote the t anti‐coorruption and a anti‐brribery workk of commmercial activities, we w have promulgated p d Anti‐corrruption an nd Anti‐bribery Man nagement. Strengthen n the interrnal control of the enterprise, b be honest and trusstworthy, and establissh the business philosophy with h law‐abiding and quality servvice as the core. Comb bined with the actual situation s off the compaany, strengtthen institutional supervision s and pro omote insttitutional anti‐corrupt a tion. We will streengthen oveersight and managemeent upon pe ersonnel in key and po ositions thatt are prone to corru uption, and ensure thaat undertaking businesss bribes wiill be punished. Stricctly observee the fair competition c n rules. Guid de the com mpany's man nagement layer andd related intterest group ps (such as customers, suppliers, etc.) to actt in accordaance withh the law. Consciously C resist the negative n andd corrupt phenomena such as sellfish, harm m public intterests, lackk of credit and fraud, etc. Establish h a good corporate imaage. Im mplemen ntationss Hon ngfeng Com mpany, its employees e or interme ediaries, sh hould not m make direcct or indirect contribbutions to political p parrties, party officials, caandidates, o organization ns or Page 23 / 26 6 individuals enggaged in po olitics, as a subterfuge e for briberry. An anti‐‐corruption and brib bery commitment is asked to sign on for everyone. Conteents Includee 1） Obey the legislaations abou ut forbiddin ng businesss bribery in Law of the Peoplee's Republic of China on n Anti‐unfaiir Competitiion, Penal CCode. 2） No giftts shall be accepted a in the name of o the comp pany or indivvidual. 3） Do nott claim supp pliers and partners p forr any expenses that sho ould be paid by individ duals. 4 4） Do nott use authority to take claims from m suppliers or partnerss. 5） Do nott participatee in the partner's dinne er and play paid by pub blic funds. 6 6） Do nott arrange reelatives and d friends to contract projects or ssupply prod ducts and eqquipment in n partner. Secoondly, we arranged an a internal anti‐corruption and anti‐compeetition audit in Octoober. The audit a result shows: Thee anti‐corru uption and Anti‐briberry Managem ment meaasures are complete, the signing of the anti‐corruption commitment lette er is timeely and tru ue, the antti‐corruption training and publiccity are in place, and the antii‐corruptionn and anti‐ggraft management wo ork is confirmed to bee effective and com mprehensivee. Page 24 / 26 6 Measureme M ent of outco omes Through T the unrremitting promootion of manage ement layer andd Human resourrces departmentt, anti‐corruptio on has been wid dely recognized in the company. Whhen all people reealize the seriou usness of corruption, people will naturally avoid it. Page 25 / 26 Corruption can occur in any position. The occurrence of internal corruption in enterprises involves almost all business processes, including: Design and development, procurement, production, sales, human resource management, customer service and so on. Therefore, start from the grassroots, strengthen enterprises against corruption, and vigorously develop a clean culture. This kind of enterprise culture atmosphere will definitely affect a large circle of families, social organizations, related enterprises and institutions centered in enterprise. Corporate culture is a double‐edged sword. Fighting corruption can promote a good corporate culture. At the same time, excellent corporate culture can curb the development and spread of corruption. So in the New Year, we will polish a more probity and glorious corporate culture. Contact us Address: No.5600, Oujin Avenue, Oujiangkou Industry Cluster District. Wenzhou.
