Ensure that the organization is not complicit in human rights abuses We at OIL believe that employees are not to be subjected to forced or compulsory labour which is also a fundamental provision of the principle of human rights. The same is also in accordance with UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is subject to ILO Core Conventions 29 & 105. We prohibit the deployment of forced labour across our entire operations. For the current reporting period we did not have a single operation or any significant suppliers exposed to the risk of forced or compulsory labour. 3. Upholding the freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective Bargaining Collective bargaining is the protection of the right of workers to organize collectively in organizations of their own choice. We uphold and support the freedom of association of our employees by recognizing and encouraging the right to collective bargaining. The employees’ union engages with the management Page |4 through structured as well as informal mechanisms. We also keep a close eye on the operations in which the freedom of association might be at risk. For the last three years we have not been able to identify a single such instance and it speaks volumes about the efficiency of our control system. We have organized discussion sessions with the officers’ association for understanding their basic needs and developing plan of action for acting on those requirements. We ensure all around participation in the events of workers union. 4. Organization supports the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour OIL believes in voluntary labour and right to work. As per directives of the Government of India, the Company ensures payment of minimum wages to labour. The Company also abides by the strict statutory guidelines laid down by the Mines Safety Directorate, the Industrial Act and other statutory regulations of the Government of India. We prohibit the deployment of forced labour across our entire operations. For the current reporting period we did not have a single operation or any significant suppliers exposed to the risk of forced or compulsory labour. 5. The organization supports effective abolition of child labour OIL ensures that every single one of its installations is routinely monitored to ensure that no child labour is employed at any of them. We strongly condemn the use of child labour and the nature of our operations that require years of training and experience to carry out are a natural barrier to prevent child labour. We also perform a rigorous process of due diligence before employing suppliers to ensure that there is no incidence of child labour in their operations among other ills. 6. Organization promotes elimination of discrimination in respect of employment The Company is an equal opportunity employer. There is no discrimination for employment or career progression on the basis of caste, gender, colour or religion. Government guidelines are strictly followed for employment of scheduled castes/scheduled tribes and physically challenged persons. 7. The organization adopts a precautionary approach to Environmental Challenges OIL is well aware of the myriad impacts that its operations have on the Environment. Our business operations by their very nature are prone to negative environmental impacts. We take this fact very seriously and have therefore made a commitment to ourselves and our stakeholders to ensure that we mitigate our environmental impacts to the greatest extent possible. OIL follows the precautionary approach to manage its environmental challenges. We also put a lot of emphasis on control of environmental pollution and conservation of energy and have always adopted a proactive approach to the conservation of the environment. This endeavor of the Company is reflected in the vision of the Company which clearly mentions OIL’s commitment to Safety, Health & Environment. Following are the existing environmental standards/rules acts enforceable under mandatory regulations and strictly followed by the organization:  Tolerance Limits prescribed by State Pollution Control Board, Assam and Central Pollution Control Board for effluent discharge.  Environmental Protection Act, 1986 & Rules.

The organization initiates promotion of greater environmental responsibility OIL has adopted key environmental management practices, pollution control measures and environmental management systems as crucial mitigation measures. Several Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies have been carried out for all its upcoming projects. The social issues and societal impacts are assessed & measured and mitigation measures are implemented as per the recommendations of the EIA studies. Some of the key Environment Mitigation Measures Adopted in OIL are detailed below:  As a measure of safeguarding the environment a policy decision has been taken for mandatory use of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Chain of Custody Certified Paper and Print Products in all sphere of OIL, w.e.f. 12.09.2012 and same is followed.  For judicious use of paper, OIL has adopted a policy wef 18.12.2014 on “Economic Use of Paper in Offices” in all spheres of OIL, as the trees are considered the major source of paper pulp production and injudicious use of paper would create bad impacts on the environment. The basic guidelines of the policy are – To use both side of the paper, Single spacing typings, Policy or other circulars through website instead of paper circulation, switching over to e-form system than manual submission of returns etc and recasting of proformaetc in a Simplified & shortened format.  Rain Water Harvesting has been made mandatory for all upcoming projects.  OIL has carried out a full-fledged study on effect of gas flare on surrounding paddy crop and initiated mitigation measures accordingly.  Green belts are developed and maintained around major installations. Annually 7,000-8,000 trees are planted in different operational areas, survival rate of which is about 80-90%. OIL’s endeavor to harness Non-conventional Energy sources:  We, at OIL have installed 13.6 MW & 54 MW Wind Power plants in Jaisalmer district, Rajasthan, which are supplying power to Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd (RRVUNL).  The other major Wind Energy project of OIL is of 54 MW, which is a split project between the states of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh (16 MW Wind Farm at Patan in Gujarat and 38 MW Wind Farm at Chandgarh in Madhya Pradesh). Page |6  The another major Wind Energy project of OIL is of 52.5 MW, which is a split project between the states of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh (27.3 MW Wind Farm at Kotiya in Gujarat which is commissioned and 25.2 MW Wind Farm at Unchhawas in Madhya Pradesh of which 6.3 MW was commissioned & remaining 18.9MW is ready for commissioning).  We also installed mega Solar Power Plants of capacity 9 MW and 5 MW in Ramgarh, Jaisalmer, Rajasthan.  The total installed capacity of OIL’s commercial Wind Energy and Solar Energy projects stands at 169.2MW. OIL generated revenue of Rs. 117.2 Crore in FY 2016-17 from renewable energy sources. Other initiatives:  One 500KW solar project in Pump Station #3, Jorhat, Assam is under execution stage which will supply power to the Pump Station.  OIL has Installed Solar Power Plants of various ratings – 100 KW at Joypur OCS, 100KW at Tanot Village Complex, Jaisalmer, 30 KW at Corporate Office, 20 KW at Jagiroad Repeater Station, Assam , 20 KW at Kishanganj Repeater Station, West Bengal in PipelineWe have plans to install more such solar plants at various locations in Rajasthan, Gujrat & Madhya Pradesh.  Replacement of conventional Generator Sets with a 30 KVA Solar Generator Set in FHQ for night illumination purpose at Work-over locations (05Nos.) has been carried out and is proposed for more locations.  OIL has carried out installation of Solar Lighting Systems, Solar Lanterns & Solar PhotoVoltaic cells atTanot-GGS ,Baghewala (Rajasthan), Security Camp at Well-279. It is also used for MART Communication system at Fields Head Quarters of OIL, and in OIL’s pipeline systems. Its use is proposed for more similar locations. In addition to having a sound Environment Policy, the Company also has a robust Sustainable Development Policy. The Sustainable Development Policy of OIL outlines its commitment towards reducing its carbon footprint. The Company calculates the carbon footprint and greenhouse gas (GHG) Page |7 emission level of various operational units. To reduce GHG emissions, a Low Carbon Strategy is evolved as part of which OIL has identified opportunities for reducing GHG emissions through technology, process improvement levers and a strategic implementation plan. This strategy is then extended in initiating projects such as the proposed 5.0 MW Kumchai Power Plant (KPP), which was inaugurated in November, 2013. The proposed site of power plant is in the Changlang District of Arunachal Pradesh and is about 450 Kms from Itanagar. The power plant is to be fed with the associated gas production (presently approximately of 30,000 SCMD) for running this KPP. It is proposed that the existing 11 KV line would be converted to 33 KV line for evacuation of power.The project will lead to a reduction in GHG emissions because of a reduction in the flaring of gas. It will also lead to the utilisation of high calorific value gas, which is presently flared as a substitute for higher carbon intensive fuels. Finally it is set to have the beneficial impact towards conservation of depleting non-renewable natural resources and thus the promotion of sustainable economic growth via the implementation of an environment friendly technology. Presently the Project is under Environmental Clearance State . OIL aims at reduction of Gas Flaring through initiatives such as the one mentioned above The Company has also planned a project on mass tree plantation in degraded forest landscapes in and around its operational areas, which is set to provide a solution to combat Climate Change through sequestration of GHGs through the plantation of trees with high carbon absorption potential. As such, OIL carries out compensatory & obligatory tree plantation in its operational areas. Page |8 The Company has taken many other proactive measures on the front of environmental management and Sustainable Development, including initiation of projects on conservation of endangered biodiversity in and around its operational areas in India. The company has adopted Rhino calves after the devastating floods during the last monsoon in the Kaziranga Tiger Reserve and is providing support for their rearing and reintroduction in the wild in the next 3 years. The company has also in the past provided financial support for procurement of Solar lanterns for the forest guard posts in the Kaziranga Tiger Reserve.
