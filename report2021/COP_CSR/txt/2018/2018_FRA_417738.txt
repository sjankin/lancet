The Group’s sites were previously individually certified ISO 14001, an international standard related to environmental management, and OHSAS 18001, an international standard for occupational health and safety management systems.

LISI thus got itself audited in order to ascertain compliance with these standards. These audits led to the grant of the ISO 14001 certificate and the OHSAS 18001 (1) certificate. LISI has adopted an HSE policy which embodies its expectations and its vision of Operational Excellence in the field of Health-safety and the Environment.
