The debate was accelerated by continued coverage on the “emission scandal” focusing on local exhaust emissions from diesel engines. We took part in the discussion by expressing our views, for example, with the following: • Our news article “Are local emissions of diesel cars as bad as claimed?” in January highlighted that the global emission debate concerns primarily diesel passenger cars, not all diesel-fueled vehicles. We noted that emissions measurement had already been strict for heavy-duty vehicles in Europe. A new stringent test method was introduced for passenger cars in 2017; the decision to do so had been We announced new exclusive partnerships with four made already prior to the debate.

Global crude the dividend distributed in the previous year. oil inventories have started to decline from their peak levels in the second half of 2017, which has led to a crude price increase to above USD 65/bbl. OPEC’s decision to continue its production cuts into 2018 is expected to support crude oil price and market structure also in the first half of 2018. Oil Products’ reference margin is expected to be below the 2017 average in the early 2018, but to get support from the start of the driving season in the spring. Oil product supply and demand are expected to be balanced with continued robust demand growth. Distillates margins are seen to be supported by lower inventory levels compared to the previous year. Crude oil supply limitations by producing countries are likely to lead to a slightly narrower Urals-Brent price differential compared to 2017. We expect high reliability to continue in OneRefinery operations supporting good utilization rate in 2018. We will implement several scheduled unit turnarounds during the spring and autumn. The new SDA unit commissioned in 2017 reached full design capacity utilization by the end of 2017. In Marketing & Services the sales volumes and unit margins are expected to follow the previous years’ seasonality pattern. Several actions have been initiated to improve financial performance. As a conclusion, we expect 2018 to be a strong year for Neste.

Comparable operating profit eliminates both the inventory gains/losses generated by the volatility in raw material prices and changes in open derivatives, and better reflects the company’s underlying operational performance. Also, it reflects Neste’s operational cash flow, where the change in operating profit caused by inventory valuation is mostly compensated by change in working capital. Items affecting comparability are linked to unpredictable events of a significant nature that do not form part of normal day-to-day business. They include among others impairment losses and reversals, gains and losses associated with the combination or termination of businesses, restructuring costs, and gains and losses on the sales of assets. Only items having an impact of more than EUR 1 million on Neste’s result will be classified as items affecting comparability. 2) FAME = Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (biodiesel), CPO = Crude Palm Oil, SME = Soy Methyl Ester (biodiesel), SBO = Soybean Oil Neste Annual Report 2017 Review by the Board of Directors 01 Strategy 02 Sustainability 03 Governance 04 Review by the Board of Directors 05 Financials 117 Financial Statements Consolidated Statement of Income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 118 Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . . . . 118 Consolidated Statement of Financial Position . . . . . . . . . 119 Consolidated Cash Flow Statement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 120 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity . . . . . . . . 121 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements . . . . . . 122 Parent Company Income Statement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 172 Parent Company Balance Sheet . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 172 Parent Company Cash Flow Statement . . . . . . . . . . . . . 173 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements . . . . 174 Proposal for the distribution of earnings and signing of the Review by the Board of Directors and the Financial Statements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 190 Auditor’s Report . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 191 Key figures 2017 Read more 01 Strategy 02 Sustainability 03 Governance 04 Review by the Board of Directors 05 Financials 118 Consolidated Statement of Income Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income MEUR Note 1 Jan–31 Dec 2017 1 Jan–31 Dec 2016 MEUR 1 Jan–31 Dec 2017 1 Jan–31 Dec 2016 1 Revenue 4, 5 13,217 11,689 Profit for the period 914 943 2 Other income 6 22 71 3 Share of profit (loss) of joint ventures 16 1 14 Other comprehensive income net of tax: 4 Materials and services 7 –10,927 –9,519 5 Employee benefit costs 8 –372 –349 Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss 6 Depreciation, amortization and impairments –371 –366 Remeasurements on defined benefit plans 2 –21 7 Other expenses 9 –399 –386 8 Operating profit 1,171 1,155 Items that may be reclassified subsequently to 9 profit or loss 10 Financial income and expenses 10 Translation differences –15 6 11 Financial income 4 4 Cash flow hedges 12 recorded in equity 69 –20 13 Financial expenses –79 –67 transferred to income statement –15 6 14 Exchange rate and fair value gains and losses –2 –17 Share of other comprehensive income of investments 15 Total financial income and expenses –77 –79 accounted for using the equity method 2 –9 16 Total 40 –17 17 Profit before income taxes 1,094 1,075 18 Income tax expense 11 –180 –133 Other comprehensive income for the period, 19 Profit for the period 914 943 net of tax 42 –38 20 21 Attributable to: Total comprehensive income for the period 956 905 22 Owners of the parent 911 939 23 Non-controlling interests1) 3 4 Total comprehensive income attributable to: 24 914 943 Owners of the parent 952 902 25 26 Non-controlling interests 3 4 Earnings per share from profit attributable to 27 956 905 owners of the parent (in euro per share) 12 28 Basic 3.56 3.67 29 The notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

In management’s opinion, the outcome of these cases is difficult The previous years’ bio mandate disputes were closed favourably for Neste in 2017. In to predict but not likely to have material effect on the Group’s financial position. March 2017 the Supreme Administrative Court decided that the penalty fee of 44 million euros paid by Neste in 2014 and received back from the Finnish Customs in August 2015 (based on the decision of the Administrative Court of Helsinki) was levied without justification. In June 2017 the Administrative Court of Helsinki decided that also the penalty payment of 32 Events after the balance sheet date 1 2 17 million euros levied in 2015 was unjustified and Tax Administration returned the penalty 3 payment to Neste in July 2017 with no intentions to appeal against the decision. The No significant events took place in the Group after the balance sheet date. 4 dispute regarding two shippings placed under an export procedure in 2013 was closed 5 favorably for Neste in August 2017. The representative of Finnish state did not appeal 6 against the administrative court about the Finnish Customs’ decision not to levy excise tax, 7 interest and additional tax totalling approximately EUR 18 million. 8 Neste has one pending dispute concerning the excise tax levied on the exported 9 10 products. Finnish Customs levied excise tax, interest and additional tax totaling approxi11 mately EUR 16 million due to the default of entries to the Excise Movement and Control 12 System (EMCS). The payment was charged to the income statement in 2016. However, 13 Neste considers that excise duty cannot be levied due to the default of entries to EMCS 14 when products have been exported under the customs supervision and when export 15 outside the EU is indisputable. Neste considers that the excise tax levy is in contradiction 16 with the purpose of excise tax legislation of the EU as well as the general principle of 17 proportionality and the interpretations of Court of Justice of the European Union. Neste will 18 appeal the case to Administrative Court of Helsinki in 2018. 19 Neste Shipping is one of the shipping companies party to a dispute concerning refunding 20 of fairway dues. The District Court of Helsinki awarded in February 2015 Neste Shipping 21 approximately EUR 23 million from the State of Finland as a refund for unjustifiably collected 22 23 fairway dues for 2001–2004. The State of Finland appealed the ruling of the District Court 24 to the Court of Appeals which ruled in favor of the State of Finland and repealed the ruling 25 of the District Court in August 2016. Thereafter, the shipping companies (including Neste 26 Shipping) asked for a leave to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, and one of the 27 shipping companies was granted such leave to appeal. As the Supreme Court did not, in its 28 ruling in December 2017, change the outcome of the ruling of the Court of Appeals, Neste 29 Shipping’s leave to appeal will in all likelihood not result in the change of the outcome of the 30 ruling of the Court of Appeals. 31 Neste is currently engaged in arbitration with its joint arrangement’s co-shareholders 32 and considers the co-owners’ claims unfounded. Neste has made counterclaims and the management estimates that the case will be solved in 2019. Neste Oil Bahrain W.L.L. has in January 2018 become aware of claim by the Bahraini Ministry of Finance concerning an initial payment and certain other demands relating to an alleged income tax liability. The company considers the claim to be without merit and it will defend itself in competent courts.

In March 2017 the Supreme Administrative Court decided that the penalty fee of 44 million euros paid by Neste in 2014 and received back from the Finnish Customs in August 2015 (based on the decision of the Administrative Court of Helsinki) was levied without justification. 1 In June 2017 the Administrative Court of Helsinki decided that also the penalty payment of 2 17 million euros levied in 2015 was unjustified and Tax Administration returned the penalty 3 payment to Neste in July 2017 with no intentions to appeal against the decision. Dispute 4 regarding two shippings placed under an export procedure in 2013 was closed favorably 5 for Neste in August 2017. The representative of Finnish state did not appeal against the 6 administrative court about the Finnish Customs’ decision not to levy excise tax, interest and 7 additional tax totalling approximately EUR 18 million. 8 9 Neste has one pending dispute concerning the excise tax levied on the exported 10 products. Finnish Customs levied excise tax, interest and additional tax totaling approxi11 mately EUR 16 million due to the default of entries to the Excise Movement and Control 12 System (EMCS). The payment was charged to the income statement in 2016. However, 13 Neste considers that excise duty cannot be levied due to the default of entries to EMCS 14 when products have been exported under the customs supervision and when export 15 outside the EU is indisputable. Neste considers that the excise tax levy is in contradiction 16 with the purpose of excise tax legislation of the EU as well as the general principle of 17 proportionality and the interpretations of Court of Justice of the European Union.
