International Armored Group | The Ten Principles 7 Human Rights Principles Assessment, Policy and Goals International Armored Group (herein “IAG”) respects the rights of human beings in accordance with the UN guidelines, government laws of each respective country where IAG operates, and moral principles that guide company’s business operations. We believe in our responsibility to respect and support internationally proclaimed human rights, and we will constantly strive to make sure that we are not complicit in human rights abuses of any individuals we are in contact with directly or indirectly. Our global community includes people of diverse ethnicities, colours, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, and a range of other human differences. We understand that fostering a culture of respect and inclusion creates a dynamic and happy workforce. With respect to gender, we seek to foster women leaders in our senior global roles but we are also focusing on ensuring that women are leaders of our most significant client relationships. We encourage all employees to raise concerns about inappropriate conduct, including potentially unethical or illegal conduct, while assuring confidentiality or any form of harassment. Employees are able to raise their concerns via their respective manager or human resources business partner. As part of IAG continued efforts to respect the applicable Universal Declaration of Human Rights, extensive efforts have been made to ensure all aspects of IAG’s policies and goals are in compliance with these standards. As a professional product manufacturer with such an eminent history, we judge that our prime human rights-related risks and opportunities lie in our relationships with our stakeholders, and above all, with our employees. IAG is an Equal Opportunity Employer and has adopted the following policy: • IAG has implemented audit and management review which are carried out on an annual basis and are an integral part of IAG’s policies. • IAG stands committed to its philosophy that all employees are entitled to equal employment opportunities. This policy applies to all personnel actions, including compensation, benefits, discipline, transfers, promotions, lay-offs, leaves of absence, terminations, and participation in IAG-administered activities. • IAG also affirmatively recruits and hires individuals based upon demonstrated abilities, achievements and experience, without regard to race, color, religion, age, national origin or ancestry, sex, pregnancy, citizenship status, marital status, physical or mental disability, medical conditions, sexual orientation, or any other consideration made unlawful by UAE laws. It is the responsibility of all employees to ensure IAG’s policy of equal employment opportunity is implemented in all phases of human resources administration. Violation of this policy by any employee will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. To comply with applicable laws ensuring equal employment opportunities to qualified International Armored Group | The Ten Principles 8 individuals with a disability, IAG will make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or an employee, unless undue hardship to IAG would result. Any applicant or employee who requires an accommodation to perform the essential functions of the job should contact their supervisor or Human Resources representative and request such an accommodation. The individual with the disability should specify what accommodation he or she needs to perform the job. IAG will then conduct an investigation to identify the barriers that make it difficult for the applicant or employee to have an equal opportunity to perform his or her job. IAG will identify possible accommodation, if any, which will help eliminate the limitation. If the accommodation is reasonable and would not impose an undue hardship, IAG will make the accommodation. We do not tolerate harassment in the workplace, we are committed to maintain healthy and safe work environment in all offices. Dangerous, abusive or violent behavior, or the threat of such behavior, is prohibited and will not be tolerated. We believe everyone should be treated fairly regardless of their race, gender, economic status, ethical background, sexual orientation, age, political believes or any other comparable characteristics, and therefore we prohibit discrimination, harassment, forced labour and child labour. It is against IAG policy for any employee, male or female, to harass another employee, based on an individual’s race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry, citizenship status, marital status, pregnancy, age, medical condition, handicap or disability. IAG policy defines “‘sexual harassment’ to mean any conduct, comment, gesture or contact of a sexual nature (a) that is likely to cause offence or humiliation to any employee; or (b) that might, on reasonable grounds, be perceived by that employee as placing a condition of a sexual nature on employment or on any opportunity for training or promotion”. Our employees are able to make an anonymous report if they suspect that an IAG employee is engaged in unacceptable or inappropriate conduct in relation to human rights or any other ethical issue. We are committed to developing the talents and skills of our people, and we actively promote a culture of learning within the company. Employees are encouraged to expand their knowledge and expertise throughout their careers. In addition to respecting human rights and fair labor practices in our company, we believe that one of the most significant contribution we can make is through the support of local communities and their initiatives. Just an example is our commitment to a local Pilipino volleyball club for which we have expressed our support, not only financially but also moral. We take legal advice in the local jurisdiction we operate in about human rights compliance and require managers across IAG to comply with all company policies. Employment contracts are reviewed for compliance in each local jurisdiction and we seek compliance with our policies and contract through governance and management structure.
