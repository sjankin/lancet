A total number of 169 targets are interrelated though the 17 broader goals to achieve. The SDGs cover a broad range of social and economic development issues. These include poverty, hunger, health, education, climate change, gender equality, water, sanitation, energy, environment and social justice. The SDGs are also known as Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development or Agenda 2030 in short. The goals were developed to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which ended in 2015. Unlike the MDGs, the SDG framework does not distinguish between developed and developing nations. Instead, the goals apply to all countries. In September 2015, the General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”, the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development for all. www.epylliongroup.com 4 Corporate social responsibility CSR CSR Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) CSR is the short form of Corporate Social Responsibility. It means for an enterprise is to complete its business without creating negative impacts to the environment and its community. It also can be defined in many perspectives. Corporate Social Responsibility is a management concept where companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business through operations and interactions with their stakeholders. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is consider as a business approach that contributes to sustainable development by delivering economic, social and environmental benefits for all stakeholders. CSR is a very broad concept that addresses many and various topics such as human rights, corporate governance, health and safety, environmental effects, working conditions and contribution to economic development. It is an attempt to align private enterprises to the goal of sustainable global development by providing them with a more comprehensive set of working objectives than just profit alone. The perspective taken for an organization to be sustainable. The concept of CSR is still very new in Bangladesh and the concept is also varies regarding perspectives. In recent years there is considerable pressure from various agencies for companies to act responsibly and be accountable for the impacts they have on social, political and ecological environments. We believe to sustain and grow in the long term, it cannot see itself as being isolated from the community around it. The community must mean people and the broader environment in which we live. Thus business should invest responsibly, avoiding projects where the potential for environmental damage outweighs the economic benefits, and ensure the welfare of different internal and external stakeholders. Key CSR issues for Epyllion Group is environmental management, eco-efficiency, responsible sourcing, stakeholder engagement, labour standards and working conditions, employee and community relations, social equity, gender balance, human rights, good governance, and anti-corruption measures. www.epylliongroup.com 5 Ten Principles of UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Report Sustainability and CSR Sustainability and CSR: CSR is now universal concept with many definitions and practices. It is differently understood and implemented for each company and country around the world. The way it is understood and implemented, differs greatly for each company and country. Moreover, CSR is a very broad concept that addresses many and various topics such as human rights, corporate governance, infrastructure, Education, health and safety, environmental effects, working conditions and contribution to economic development. Whatever the definition is, the purpose of CSR is to drive change towards sustainability. CSR is important, because it influences all aspects of a company’s operationsfrom sourcing to final servicing. It is also Significant for brand differentiation. Conscious consumers want to buy products from companies they know, believe, & trust. Same suppliers want to form business partnerships with companies they can rely on, employees want to work for companies they respect and get honor, reputed. Large investors want to support firms that they perceive to be socially responsible, and welfare, nonprofits want to work together with companies seeking practical solutions to common shared goals which are SDGs. Social concerns are now an area of interest for the business world. Positive initiatives of a corporation are to assess and take responsibility for the company's effects on environmental and social wellbeing. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) simply raises for strategies by which corporations or firms conduct their business in a way that is ethical and society friendly.
