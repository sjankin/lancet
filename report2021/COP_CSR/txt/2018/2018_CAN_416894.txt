Statement of Support Rideau first signed on to the UN Global Compact in 2005, as we have always strived to be an environmentally friendly company focused on promoting sustainable practices both internally and with our clients. Rideau remains highly committed to being socially and ecologically responsible in our business operations and in our interactions with employees, suppliers, clients and the community. Rideau fully supports the UN Global Compact and will persistently seek to go further in maintaining our commitment to respecting and upholding human and labour rights, promoting sustainable development and fighting against corruption. Rideau is dedicated to following the Global Compact’s 10 principles and we truly see these as an extension of our own corporate initiatives. The UN Global Compact acts as both a policy platform and as a practical framework to help our business and our clients’ businesses achieve their goals of being responsible and sustainable. Many of our clients continue to add sustainable initiatives into their recognition programs. We strongly encourage our clients to move as many program communications as possible online to reduce paper use. For clients with employees that may not readily have access to a computer, we still create printed program brochures; however these are printed on 100% post-consumer recycled paper with FSC certification. Another green initiative is the use of reusable gift bags in place of classic paper gift bags. These bags can be used again and again by recipients as a symbol of their recognition moment. We are also a member of ECOAction and RecyQuebec. We are also participating in Plan Montréal Durable 2016-2020, the city of Montreal’s sustainable development plan for 2016-2020. Rideau’s environmental reach extends to our partners and suppliers as well. We are actively seek suppliers who can guarantee responsible sourcing of their materials and metals. Rideau has signed on to No Dirty Gold’s Golden Rules of Responsible Mining, a voluntary campaign that encourages its participants to re-examine gold and metal sourcing, and promotes responsible mining worldwide. Rideau completed another greenhouse gas assessment this year and continues to be CarbonNeutral®. We also continue to plant trees through a Canadian not-for-profit organization. Rideau planted 23,691 trees in 2017. For all of our employees, we have comprehensive rules and a code of conduct. Every new hire receives a training on the Employee Handbook to remind them of their rights, obligations and recourses in the matters of equal opportunity, reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities, harassment at work, health and safety, privacy, gifts and gratuities, amongst others. Rideau is dedicated to nurturing a positive work environment where employees feel safe and can thrive. As an honored member of the UN Global Compact, I hereby uphold that Rideau will continue to improve our business practices in compliance with the 10 UN Global Compact’s principles.

At Rideau, we abide by Global Compact’s human rights principles through our internal policies, our supplier questionnaires and our external commitments. We have comprehensive rules and a code of conduct that are binding on all employees who must sign these on their induction into the company. This protects the interests of the employee and other stakeholders. Our supplier questionnaires pertain to the International Labor Organization’s Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, which incorporate international human rights. Our external commitments to organizations such as No Dirty Gold campaign make us aware of issues and active in the fight for the respect of human rights outside the scope of our regular business. Further, every new employee at Rideau receives an employee handbook delineating their rights, obligations and their recourses. The following are some of the topics in relations to human rights addressed in our Rideau Employee Handbook. a) Equal opportunity Rideau judges individuals by their abilities, not their disabilities; the company seeks to give full and equal employment opportunities to all people capable of performing successfully in the company's position. In our annual employee survey, the employee satisfaction index for the “Diversity” category was at 84% in 2016, an improvement of 7 points since 2007. Under company policy and federal and provincial/state laws, people with disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations that allow them access to company programs, jobs, services, and activities unless the accommodation poses an undue hardship on the company. People with disabilities not only have a right to ask for accommodations, they are encouraged to do so by talking directly with their immediate supervisor and/or the Rideau Human Resources department.

In the event of an immediate medical emergency, a safety threat, a reasonable suspicion of theft or other illegal activity, a search of an employee’s personal belongings may be performed. This will be done in a responsible manner that protects the employee’s privacy and dignity, and must first be approved by senior management and be done in the presence of Human Resources Department. Also, confidential matters between an employee and supervisor should not be discussed with co-workers unless they have a legitimate business reason to know.

Environment Principal 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Rideau supports a precautionary approach and looks to anticipate and prevent environmental problems before they occur. Rideau conforms to the strictest air and water quality standards set by federal, provincial and municipal authorities. We also go beyond the standards issued by legislation to take a stand on environmental issues. a) Climate CarbonNeutral Certification In February 2011, we became the first company in our field in the world to offset the greenhouse gas emissions generated by its entire practices, thus becoming carbon neutral. This was a really exciting first. We hoped to inspire others to take a similar stance on climate change issues. Rideau is supporting a precautionary approach to climate change, and is very proud to maintain the CarbonNeutral certification again in 2016-2017. b) Water At Rideau we carefully monitor all of our water waste generated in our factory operations. Our electroplating water effluent is tested and recorded daily. A sample of waste water is sent to an independent testing laboratory twice a year to ensure conformity with all laws and regulations. These reports are sent to the local authority twice a year in compliance with local laws. As for the municipal drinking water available to employees, in 2009 a water filtration system was implemented throughout the entire facility to ensure purified water is available at all times. Rideau and its employees contribute to support the elimination of plastic water bottles on its premises. Rideau strongly recommends all employees to bring their own water bottle and have installed many water filtered stations throughout the company. c) Waste generation and efficient use of resources Our modern manufacturing facility uses the latest environmental technologies and procedures and is equipped with antipollution equipment and alarm systems. All chemical waste is stored and disposed of with an accredited company twice a year. Since 2005, Rideau has seen the elimination of Tri-chlorethylene from 2547 kg to 0, the reduction of Sulphuric Acid from 10 gallons per week to 0.5 gallon per week, and the reduction of Nitric Acid from 5 gallons a month to 0.5 gallon a month. Rideau continues to recycle all gold, silver, pewter and brass excess material used in our manufacturing processes. April 2018 11 | P a g e Corporate Confidential © Rideau Recognition Solutions Inc. Principal 8 Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; Rideau’s environmental program is highly dedicated to educating employees on environmental issues and fostering an ecologically responsible lifestyle at work and at home. As various initiatives and programs are implemented, employee communication sessions are held to ensure that the processes are followed properly. Rideau’s head office features a full-scale recycling program designed to reduce waste throughout the company. This program includes the recycling of paper and light cardboard materials as well as plastics, glass and metal products. Rideau also recycles used batteries and electronics. Recycling bins are strategically placed throughout the offices, cafeterias, factory, shipping and receiving areas. All recyclables are collected daily and periodically collected by external recycling facilities (separate for paper and other materials, as paper can be sold). Since 2009, Rideau is certified by Quebec’s recycling program “ICI ON RECYCLE” developed by the Government of Quebec. In 2016, Rideau has received a higher level of certification, moving from level 1 to a level 2 certification, with level 3 being the top level of certification. In the spring, Rideau continues to grow its flower garden with perennial flowers along the entrance of its offices and in the picnic areas.

In addition, our employees and managers must run our business in compliance with all the applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. Any violation of the following standards and/or laws and regulations are not tolerated. Moreover, it is everyone’s responsibility to report to the company or to the Human Resources Department any violations of applicable laws and regulations without fear of retaliation. Employees should not accept or offer gifts, favors or entertainment, other than infrequent items of nominal value. Appropriate gift giving can serve to build relationships. However, this should never be done if the possibility or even the appearance of improper influence exists. Rideau expects that its employees will exercise good judgment, will lead by example, and will seek guidance, when necessary for their own conduct. Rideau is a member in good standing of the Québec Lobbyists Registry, the provincial tool used to materialize transparency. Lobbyists declare their lobbying activities carried out with public office holders in Quebec. When consulting the registry, you can learn who is seeking to influence policy-makers, in which areas, to whose benefit and for what purpose. The Lobbyists Registry is public.
