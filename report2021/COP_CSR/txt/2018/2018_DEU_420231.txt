Further changes to products are planned for 2018. Fruit and vegetable cultivation: reducing pesticides and herbicides Our suppliers must comply with strict regulations for the cultivation of fruit and vegetables. We always go beyond the statutory regulations in these areas. Since 2016, for example, we have banned the use of eight active ingredients in the cultivation of German fruit, vegetables and potatoes because they were suspected of being responsible for the decline of flying insects like bees, butterflies and hoverflies. In late 2016, ALDI held a second round of talks on “active ingredients toxic to bees” with various representatives of producers, associates and organisations, plant protection advisors and agencies, and testing labs. Further approaches to the protection of bees are currently being reviewed, and gradual implementation is already under way. In 2017, ALDI France introduced a product featuring the BEE FRIENDLY label conferred by the organisation of the same name. In Germany, the company has been selling bee-friendly perennials and plants for several years now.

Packaging & cycle SDG 12, 14, 15 GRI 301/103-1 Waste avoidance is a key pillar of sustainable development. At almost 82 per cent, packaging waste accounts for the biggest proportion of the total waste generated by the ALDI North Germany. For many products, packaging is essential for protection and quality assurance, making it impossible to avoid it completely. That is why we focus on recyclable materials and, in some cases, on multiple-use systems for fruit and vegetable outer packaging. Moreover, we are reviewing ways to contribute to a circular economy that helps conserve resources through packaging and through our products and carrier bags. Our approach GRI 301/103-2 When it comes to our transport and outer packaging, we use multiple-use systems whenever it makes economic and ecological sense to do so. Most of our fruit and vegetable products are transported in multiple-use boxes instead of conventional cardboard packaging. However, single-use packaging is unavoidable in many cases in order to protect our products during transport. In Germany, we use foils and boxes made of recyclable materials so that these can be recovered. What is more, our disposable cardboard packaging already consists partially of recycled and/or certified material in many ALDI North Group countries.
