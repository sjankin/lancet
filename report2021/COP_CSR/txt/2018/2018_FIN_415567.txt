A special emphasis was put on mobile usability, as we wanted the service to be readily available anytime and anywhere. The service is supported by a nationwide network of pick-up points. A real-time chat service was also introduced. Over the chat service, Ramirent’s own rental advisors offer instruction and tips on choosing and safely operating the right equipment. The online rental service has been met with very positive feedback. While still new, the outlook of the new service is promising. The network of pick-up points in Finland was expanded during the first year. Ramirent always strives to make its expertise and first-class equipment even more easily available. An easy to use online rental site is a logical part of that drive, and new approaches to better meet our customers’ needs are continuously being developed.

In the wake of the world news regarding harassment in the fall of 2017, Ramirent’s Executive Management Team wanted to show their support by letting every Ramirenter know that we have a zero tolerance policy for harassment and that everyone should feel safe to anonymously report harassment misconduct to our “Speak-up”-line, to members of the Management Team, or to the local HR. A question on harassment was also included in the Rami Ear Survey.

In Ramirent’s renewed strategy, safety is stated as a key part of building a great place to work and the safety KPI on the Group level was renewed. In 2017, we continued developing new safety tools, trainings and products. Ramirent is unique in having its own R&D department focusing on developing improved safety features of existing products. As an equipment rental company serving the still highly accident-prone construction industry, we want to actively ABSENCES DUE TO SICKNESS ACCIDENT FREQUENCY (LTIF*) promote the safety culture to our customers and provide (%) them with training in matters related to a safe working 3.2 Group 8.6 Group environment.

RAMIRENT ANNUAL REPORT 2017 22 CHAPTER HEADLINE IMPROVING TRAFFIC SAFETY WITH RAMIRENT’S SAFEPASSTM ROAD BARRIERS Uncommon for a rental company, Ramirent designs and produces its own products with superior safety features based on its extensive product user experience and on identified safety gaps in existing products. We see growth opportunities especially in the fall protection and traffic safety market.. Ramirent’s latest addition to its range in 2017 was the Ramirent SafePass™ road barriers. Construction projects spread beyond the actual work area, and transport and people passing by must be taken into account. When it comes to safety, sturdy barriers that prevent access to the work site are a necessity. Ramirent’s SafePass™ barriers were designed to be durable, stackable and easy to install. Instead of using concrete alone, we decided to reduce the weight by pairing concrete with steel. Special rubber feet give the highest possible friction and fences or signs are easily installed on top of the barrier. The SafePass™ barrier has been in the market in Sweden and Norway since July 2017, and it will be introduced in more countries in 2018. Other Ramirent proprietary safety products include the Ramirent SafePass™ for cyclists and pedestrians, the EnterSafe™ staircase, and the GuardLite™ fall protection system. RISK ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES SETTING A NEW BENCHMARK WITH OWN ROOTED IN DAILY WORK LINE OF UNIQUE SAFETY PRODUCTS The risk assessment guidelines for internal assessments In terms of safety, we have identified development needs of Ramirent locations are rooted in our operations and in current product lines and ways of working, and we have projects.

CUSTOMER SAFETY IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY In 2017, we launched a protective barrier for roads to join the roster of previous products such as SafePass™, Our customers’ growing safety demands drive us to EnterSafe™, and GuardLite™. The products have all been develop new innovations and applications. In addition launched in Sweden and selected products have also been to offering machines to rent, we provide our customers introduced in Norway and Denmark. In 2018, the products with user guidance, safety instructions and necessary will be rolled out in further Ramirent operating countries. safety equipment.

RAMIRENT ANNUAL REPORT 2017 24 CHAPTER HEADLINE BETTER SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCY THROUGH IMPROVED INTERNAL COMMUNICATION During 2017, Ramirent Finland identified a number of issues arising from communication issues, such as working in silos and poor cross-functional information flow. These issues were perceived to stem at least partly from several organizational changes, which have resulted in unclear roles and responsibilities. To tackle the challenges head-on, we initiated a project aimed at improving internal communication. The project was named Baton in the spirit of relay racing, where the baton is never dropped but diligently passed on. The Baton project began within our Customer Center, Fleet and Solution Sales departments by introducing a new hub organization, internal digital ticketing tool, and yard logistics, among others. As a result, the quality and efficiency of processes in Southern Finland was enhanced. Best practices will be shared within all countries in our aim to build the industry’s best performing supply chain.
