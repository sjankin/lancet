(2) The relative performance criterion of the Rexel share compared to the SBF 120 GR index replaces the previously determined TSR criteron based on a panel of selected companies.

The SBF 120 GR index, which Rexel is a part of, better integrates some of these criteria. The weighting of this criterion, the triggering threshold, the target and maximum vesting have been determined based on a comparable structure to that of the TSR criterion previously used, in line with market practice.
