I believe these outcomes are the result of systematic and disciplined action to focus on mission critical aspects of the business. MANAGING PEOPLE Taking a holistic approach, we deployed multiple strategies to focus on enhancing not only our ﬁnancial performance, but also crucially looking at how we can enrich the lives of our people. Taking a deliberate decision to build knowledge and skills of our workforce, the investment on training was intensiﬁed, with the highest-ever number of managers and executives being sent overseas for industry-speciﬁc training activities.

Our organisation aligned its focus and goals to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in year 2015, with the underlying objectives of contributing to sustainable development and work for the betterment of society. For example, the Group adopted the International Sustainability and Carbon Footprint Certiﬁcation to support the SDGs. KVPL had adopted a framework on sustainability, referred to Promote Sustainability practices, as organisational winning key sustainability aspects in the production of Tea and Rubber.

STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION Main stakeholders are identiﬁed and evaluated on the basis of their importance to the Company. Consideration is given to the priority they give to various issues in the numerous initiatives in which they are involved. Together, the results represent materiality assessment. Stakeholder involvement is required to achieve the required goals as stipulated by international standards such as Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); in doing so we have put in place a structure materiality process to plot relevant environmental, economic, social and governance issues of concern. The ﬁndings are used to determine associated risks and opportunities for KVPL’s reputation and sustainable operations. The issues are then placed on a Materiality Matrix that displays their position relative to the degree of stakeholder concern and potential business impact. A comprehensive value chain analysis allows for greater precision in the scoring and ranking of our material issues. It also includes a robust assessment of business impact, with greater focus on socially responsible operations and their impact on the business and commercial relevance.

Materiality assessment was carried out through various channels, including interviews with the population to sound out ideas on the future reuse of the plant, and a series of meetings with category associations as well as the direct involvement of local institutions in the assessment of the projects. The materiality assessment process also serves as an effective risk control and management information tool that enables the Company to respond effectively to stakeholder needs.

Risk Monitoring The ﬁnal step of the risk management process which is risk monitoring can be divided into two parts as follows:  Monitoring: Through the monitoring process the Company’s main aim is to evaluate the efﬁciencies of the risk strategies which have been implemented to mitigate the risk within the year. This process is basically executed at multiple levels in the organisation including Management team and Audit Committee.  Review: KVPL’s risk proﬁle is reviewed quarterly. Through this process it was revealed that there is no substantial diversion of KVPL’s risk proﬁle for the year. RISK PORTFOLIO OF THE GROUP KVPL actively monitors its risk in a diversiﬁed environment to proactively manage and mitigate the risk exposures. KVPL entered into the agro-tourism segment through Kelani Valley Resorts (Pvt) Ltd., where the risk exposure of the Group increased whilst the diversiﬁcation also resulted in risk mitigation.

The cost of immature trees is treated as approximate fair value particularly on the ground of little biological transformation has taken place and impact of the biological transformation on price is not material. When such Plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from Immature to Mature. The fair value of matured managed trees were ascertained in accordance with SLFRS 13. The valuation was carried by Messrs. Sunil Fernando Associates, chartered valuation surveyors, using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methods. In ascertaining the fair value of timber, a physical veriﬁcation was carried out covering all the estates. 238 KELANI VALLEY PLANTATIONS PLC Annual Report 2017/18 14.2.1 Change in Fair Value of Biological Assets Group/Company As at 31 March, 2017/18 2016/17 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Change in fair value of consumable biological assets (Note 14.2) 17,315 15,515 Change in fair value of produce on bearer biological assets (Note 17.1) (5,983) 11,002 11,332 26,517 14.2.2 Information About Fair Value Measurements Using Signiﬁcant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Non Financial Asset Valuation Unobservable Range of unobservable inputs Relationship of technique inputs (Probability weighted average) Unobservable 2017/18 2016/17 inputs to fair value Consumable managed biological assets DCF Discounting rate 17.5% 17.5% The higher the discount rate, the lesser the fair value Optimum rotation 25-35 Years 25-35 Years Lower the rotation period, (Maturity) the higher the fair value Volume at rotation 25-85 cu.ft 25-85 cu.ft The higher the volume, the higher the fair value Price per cu.ft.

It is assume that the felling of trees will be undertaken at maturity for the period not covered under the Forestry Plan. 2. The price adopted are net of expenditure. 3. Though the replanting is a condition precedent for harvesting, yet the cost are not taken in to consideration. 4. Pre commercial stand are valued on cost approach. 5. Contiguous area of trees with trees a similar specie silviculture and other characteristics. The valuations, as presented in the external valuation models based on net present values, take into account the long-term exploitation Financial of the timber plantations. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with the valuation at fair value of the biological assets due to the Reports volatility of the variables, their carrying value may differ from their realisable value. The Board of Directors retains their view that commodity markets are inherently volatile and that long term price projections are highly unpredictable.

This require an entity to determine how much beneﬁt is attributable to the current and prior periods and to make estimates about demographic variables and ﬁnancial variables that will inﬂuence the cost of the beneﬁt. The following key assumptions were made in arriving at the above ﬁgure. According to the actuarial valuation report issued by the actuarial valuer as at 31 March 2018 the actuarial present value of promised retirement beneﬁts amounted to Rs. 886,008,628/(2016/17 Rs. 791,914,041/-). If the Company had provided for gratuity on the basis of 14 days wage & half months salary for each completed year of service, the liability would have been Rs. 930,428,985/(2016/17 Rs. 1,000,871,814/-). Hence, there is a contingent liability of Rs. 44,420,357/(2016/17 Rs. 208,957,773/-), which would crystallise only if the Company ceases to be a going concern. The following payments are the expected contributions to the deﬁned beneﬁt plan obligations in future years.
