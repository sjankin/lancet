Our regular CSR meetings are valuable in order to create new ideas for reducing our carbon footprint as well as for improving our relations to staff, candidates and clients. We have policies in place to secure no tolerance in relation to harassment and to secure equal opportunities for all staff in regards to race, gender and age. It is essential for us constantly to monitor the quality of our service to clients and candidates. We use Net Promotor Score internally and are active with external evaluating sites like Trustpilot. Bi-annual staff surveys makes it possible for us to determine how our staff feel about a number of elements of their employment in the JuhlerGroup: Induction, Ongoing training, management’s ability to support and motivate etc. This is valuable information that enable us to improve elements that score low in satisfaction. Our ongoing investments in solar panel companies as well as our marketing activities involving campaigns where we support initiatives like planting trees.

Those companies can organise this campaign together with a picnic or BBQ as a bonding exercise after the volunteer work. Very positive feedback was received from those who participated. 1.3 Solar Panel and Forest investment JuhlerGroup decided to cover our total electricity consumption through green investments. Nordic Solar Energy – a Danish Solar Cell company is the partner in the project to calculate how much we need to invest in proportion to our energy consumption if we want to be CO2 neutral. The goal of JuhlerGroup is to cover 100 percent of our CO2 emissions within the group. Page 9 of 28 JuhlerGroup 2018 Corporate Social Responsibility Report In 2017, our annual consumption of electricity was equivalent to that of about 7,744 normal households in Denmark. It is our goal to be CO2 neutral in the long term. We want to invest not only for profit, but also to benefit the environment.

Employee engagement 2.1 Ongoing training and survey As CEO of JuhlerGroup, Mr Erik Juhler always asserts that our staff are the most important assets in the company, ongoing training and regularly survey feedback are the essential tools to the group. Onboarding, a HR Ecosystem to ensure that the organisational integration of new hires is a necessarily structured Onboarding approach. We believe with an essential Onboarding program we can retain staff longer, not only saving costs on staff turnover, but also aiming to get staff to adapt to the company culture quickly so they can start to contribute efficiency. The measurement system across six dimensions – culture, compliance, connections, collaboration, competence and results, in order to demonstrate how far the new hires have come on in the Onboarding process.

Feedback of CSR survey by CEO in August 2018 Our recent staff satisfaction survey was answered by about half of all staffs. We hope that more staffs will participate in the next survey. Overall satisfaction level increased to 8 out of 10 from 7 in 2017. This was quite positive. However the survey clearly indicates that we must be better in a number of areas: 1. We, managers must be better in supporting, motivating and lead the team 2. Quality of introduction and on-going training must be improved considerably It is positive that Conflict and Stress level seems to be quite low in our organisation. The individual comments are quite important for us in order to improve the situation.

CSR overview of each operating company [Temp-Team Denmark] Focus on CSR-activities 2018 ! Temp-Team Herlev was the only branch which handed out the leftover 1,500 Refleks from last year. The event went well but hey have a hard time to see how it benefits the business vs the time they spent.

Overall, this is still a meaningful activity. !
