In 1991, when our first development cycle began, we had eight Renner stores in operation. In 2017, now the fourth cycle, we have 512 Renner, Camicado, and Youcom stores, in all five regions of the country, and we are just e­ merging internationally. In this chapter you will find details of our strategy and the initiatives of our fourth development cycle undertaken in 2017.

Considering all three businesses, we closed 2017 with 512 stores and 655,000 m² of sales space, an ­i ncrease of 15.3% and 12% respectively. GRI 102-10 Our expansion plan foresees a total of 450 Renner stores, 125 Camicado stores, and potential for 300 ­Youcom stores by 2021, in addition to a new platform with exclusive brands for e-commerce. An important milestone for us was Renner’s debut at the JK Iguatemi mall in November 2017, when we reached 500 stores in operation. I N T E R N AT I O N A L O P E RAT I O N In September, we launched our brand in Uruguay and by the end of the year we already had three units in operation in that country. Uruguay has a stable economy and high per capita GDP, and it bears some resemblance to Brazil’s southern region, home to our headquarters and one of our distribution centers. The stores’ positioning is the same as in Brazil, focusing on middle/high class women. This expansion is a key step for testing our business model abroad, consolidating technological i­ nfrastructure and processes, and learning. The outlook is positive, with good acceptance by the Uruguayan audience, and we plan to open two new stores in the country in 2018. We also have an office in China, which increased its staff in 2017. 47 CONTENTS MESSAGE FROM THE MANAGEMENT 2017 HIGHLIGHTS WHO WE ARE SCENARIO OF O U R O P E R AT I O N S S T R AT E G I C CYC L E RESPONSIBLE FAS H I O N HOW WE C R E AT E VA L U E A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 7 TECHNOLOGICAL Transformation We have worked hard in the technological revision and modernization of our operations for the past few years, increasing our business ­e fficiency and getting ready for future challenges in an ever more digital and ­c onnected world.
