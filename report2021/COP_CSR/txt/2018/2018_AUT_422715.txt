CSR Update 2017 | 8 Focus Area – Gaming Compliance on All Levels » Compliance plays a central role for companies in the gaming industry. Compliance in the handling of the games and the battle against corruption and money laundering and the provision of the highest possible standards of safety for customers and guests are absolutely imperative for a licensed gaming operator. In 2017, we updated the Casinos Austria and Austrian Lotteries Group Code of Conduct, which serves as the basis for our conduct in all our activities. The long-established and periodically reviewed pillars of compliance in the Casinos Austria and Austrian Lotteries Group are as follows: » Anti-corruption (ISO 37001) » Data protection (GoodPriv@cy Standard) » Anti-money laundering (ISAE 3000 Standard adapted to the provisions of the 5th EU Anti-Money-Laundering Directive) » Information security (ISO/IEC 27001:2013; Security Control Standard (WLA-SCS)) We have a systematically structured and sustainably managed compliance management system based on the ISO 19600 standard in place. We have also begun checking our suppliers for any compliance-related infringements using the Dow Jones database. Compliance applies to everyone When our employees know, understand and act in compliance with the applicable laws and corporate guidelines, they become role models. Each and every new hire in our group is required to complete training on the key local laws and regulations as well as our own corporate rules and guidelines. Highest quality data protection In 2017, we worked intensively on the requirements that would be placed on our group when the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in May 2018. A project was set up to analyze the required changes and produce a roadmap for their timely completion prior to this date.

CERTIFIED RESPONSIBILITY To ensure our CSR activities remain fully up-to-date, we have our processes and content regularly audited and certified by the European Casino Association (ECA), the World Lottery Association (WLA), the European Lotteries (EL) and GamCare – the UK’s biggest support organization for people with gambling problems. CSR Update 2017 | 10 Focus Area – Environment Climate Protection » We fully recognize our ecological responsibility. The continual reduction of our ecological footprint to protect the environment is absolutely imperative and can only be achieved through constant improvements and concrete measures. Our focus here lies on energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. We adhere as a matter of course to all relevant environmental protection laws and regulations. We also do our utmost to ensure that our employees think and act in a sustainable manner in both their professional and private lives. Climate protection is one of the biggest global and regional challenges of our time. At the Casinos Austria and Austrian Lotteries Group, we have set ourselves the goal of making a significant contribution to tackling this problem. Our mission here is to act in an environmentally and energy-efficient manner at all levels. Energy efficiency as contribution to climate protection In 2017, total energy consumption for the Casinos Austria and Austrian Lotteries Group amounted to 44,313,279 kWh. Around 16% of this energy was consumed in our headquarters at Rennweg 44 and 46 in Vienna (including the internal computing center) and in our computer center in Wiener Neustadt, 77% in our casinos and 7% in our WINWIN outlets.

Some of the data for 2017 was partly deficient in its annual accuracy or was not available (e.g. data for thermal energy) at the time this report was prepared. Energy efficiency measures in 2017 The latest energy efficiency technology was used in the construction of our 16th WINWIN outlet in Bischofshofen. Further measures to protect the climate were also taken at the 12 Austrian casinos. In the refurbishments of Casino Graz (completed in fall 2017) and Casino Salzburg particular attention was placed on energy efficiency. The project to switch to LED lighting in our casinos was also continued throughout 2017. We extended the number of charging stations for electric vehicles at the Rennweg 44 building in Vienna to eight. All members of staff can make use of these charging stations. Our IT landscape also became “greener” through our focus on low electricity consumption and higher performance “Green IT”. CSR Update 2017 | 11 Focus Area – Environment Sustainable Use of Resources » Even services companies that do not maintain energyand waste-intensive manufacturing plants have plenty of opportunities to contribute to improving their environmental balance sheet. To ensure we make sustainable use of resources, our procurement activities are sustainable and fair, and we apply detailed waste management concepts. We strive to make sustainable use of the resources that we require to conduct our business. This means making sure that our procurement activities are sustainable and fair and that we have efficient and sustainable waste management concepts in place. Sustainable and fair procurement Our goal is to ensure that our procurement activities are sustainable and fair. To achieve this, we buy goods locally wherever possible and give due consideration in our procurement activities to ecological and social criteria like environmental sustainability, energy efficiency, resource conservation and respect for human rights. % OF TOTAL PROCUREMENT PROCUREMENT IN AUSTRIA 94% To ensure that our suppliers also conduct their business in line with our understanding of sustainability, we introduced our new Code of Conduct for Suppliers in 2017, which can be accessed by all suppliers via our Procurement Portal and comes into force upon signing of the contract. SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS IN OUR CODE OF CONDUCT FOR SUPPLIERS: » Employee protection and working conditions pursuant to the provisions in the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code » Environmental protection and efficient use of resources based on established management systems (ISO 14001, EMAS) » Adherence to general rules of conduct including those related to compliance topics like anti-corruption and data protection HOW CAN SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT BE ACHIEVED? The sustainable procurement approach taken by the Casinos Austria and Austrian Lotteries Group anchors sustainability as far as possible in our value chain. We already produce, for example, all our printed materials in accordance with the Austrian ecolabel guidelines. We are also making increasing use of Austrian products in marketing: WINWIN uses chocolate coins from Salzburg, while Casino Wien serves tea from the Lower Austrian company Sonnentor.
