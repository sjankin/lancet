The agreement includes an action plan to limit global warming to well below 2°C. The plan encompasses the period from 2020 and onwards. The most important points in the agreement concern a longterm global climate goal, that world leaders are to draw up comprehensive national action plans, and that countries are to report on the progress they make towards fulfilling the plans. Another important element of the agreement is that developed countries are to contribute climate financing to help developing countries,” says Torbjörn Brorson, head of sustainable development at HEXPOL and professor at Lund University. “Climate change is an important global issue that impacts us all.

GRI’s guidelines (version G4) place requirements on reporting sustainability data in terms of economic, environmental and social performance indicators. According to GRI, sustainability reporting should provide a balanced and reasonable picture of the organisation’s results within the field of sustainability, including both the positive aspects and the negative aspects. The GRI Guidelines are the most widely accepted Global Reporting and used standard for sustainability reporting. If an organisation wishes to demonstrate that the report is ”in accordance” with the Guidelines, it Initiative (GRI) must self-declare how GRI’s Guidelines have been applied in their sustainability report.
