The Hebrew version was Published in July 2018 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 22 Identifying Material Topics for Reporting10 Most corporate social responsibility reports published by Bank Leumi were prepared in accordance with the GRI guidelines, which define the guiding framework for reporting on this subject. The current report is first to be prepared in accordance with GRI Standards. The material topics identification process allows Leumi to focus its social corporate responsibility activities on 11 material topics. The Bank works to enhance its commitment to advancing these topics and improving processes in accordance with the objectives it has set. During 2016, the Group conducted a comprehensive and detailed dialogue process with its stakeholders to re-examine and update its material topics for reporting. For more information on this process, please see p. 23 in the 2016 Corporate Social Responsibility Report. Process of Validating and Revising of the Material Topics for Reporting LA Towards the writing of the 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report, the Bank conducted a validation and revision process of the material reporting topics, in cooperation with management. In the spirit of the times, and to obtain comprehensive and objective information, it was decided to map and evaluate stakeholders’ positions and their expectations from the banking sector through social media (especially Facebook and Twitter). For the analysis, about 400,000 posts about Israeli banks were encoded throughout 2017 and classified according to whether they referred any of Leumi’s 19 corporate social responsibility topics. The analysis included qualitative and quantitative aspects and was carried out holistically, taking into account the general public sentiment and its impact on businesses in Israel, as well as the discourse on the banks in general and on Bank Leumi in particular. In addition, at a discussion held at the Bank, the material topics for the Bank were also validated and revised. 10 102-46 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 23 As part of the revision process, the Bank decided to add the topic of fair employment terms and remove biodiversity from its list of material CSR topics, having found out that the stakeholders, as well as the Bank, do not view it as consistently material, far behind than other topics. The Materiality Matrix and Reporting Topics for 2017 LA Following the above process, Leumi's materiality matrix was validated and revised. Stakeholders’ positions have been revised, and are based on two components: a. The stakeholder dialogue process which was carried out ahead of the 2016 Corporate Social Responsibility Report (80%) b. The process of analyzing the discourse and positions of stakeholders on social networks in 2017 (20%) The Bank’s positions axis was structured according to the above revisions. The power of social media to reflect the relationship between businesses and their stakeholders Sagi Chen, Senior Consultant, Wisdom Dot Com Ltd. In the past few years, social media has gained significant momentum in Israel, and has actually become, a central unprecedented meeting place for everyone involved in shaping public opinion. Today, a daily, direct ongoing dialogue takes place between all stakeholders: businesses and brands, customers, elected officials, the media outlets and media people, social organizations, employees and the general public. Social media in Israel is highly varied, featuring a lively discussion around a wide range of topics on various platforms. Each platform has its unique features and meets specific needs Facebook, for example, serves as the “town square and has a great impact on public opinion; Twitter is widely used by elected officials, media professionals and other influencers; Instagram is an escapist, self2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 24 expressive platform; forums allow users to seek anonymous advice; blogs function as the new press , etc. As a result, social media serves as a microcosm which reflects public sentiment in Israel as a whole, and towards corporations and businesses in particular, and it is capable of shaping public opinion and influencing policy makers at the political and economic levels. Due to its key role in our lives, social media serves as the primary, bottomless source for understanding the needs and expectations of various stakeholders today. Much like a diamond mining, it is full of insights that cannot be found anywhere else. Mining these “diamonds”, polishing and setting them in the corporate context is made by tracking the dialogue and analyzing users’ content. This research method has 5 key advantages: (1) Authenticity The users’ content is extracted from organic conversations of stakeholders in their natural online environment, without any intervention;( 2) Trend prediction Social media exposes the undercurrents affecting consciousness, and the ability to examine where these undercurrents are going over time constitutes a unique predictive tool;( 3) Involvement Users who write about a particular topic on the web are hot audiences” highly involved in the topics being examined; ( 4) Influence Online conversations have a great impact beyond its circle of participants, and, as mentioned above, social media has enormous influence on public discourse; ( 5) Know the unknown unknowns Research allows us to discover things we did not ask ourselves before and which are not necessarily under the streetlight. We believe that, as a rule, strategic user content analysis is the best research tool available today to map stakeholder expectations from corporations, especially ones that strive to conduct an ongoing dialogue with their stakeholders.

The reporting organization should present an organized managerial approach, work processes that show the organization’s commitment, and objectives for the coming years, alongside a report on the organization’ indicators under each specific standard disclosure. The process for identifying material topics resulted in 11 topics identified as material (out of the 19 topics presented). The 11 topics include (as described below) 18 topics that are in accordance with the definitions of the GRI Standards. According to the standard, as soon as the Bank has identified the material topics for reporting, it is required by definition, to report on them.

The reporting framework includes full response to 36 specific performance indicators (specific standard disclosures) that fall under these 18 topics, alongside 56 organizational profile indicators (general standard disclosures). In addition to these topics, the report provides more information on additional topics not identified as material in the materiality process but which Leumi has found necessary to report and elaborate on in 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 30 order to maintain reporting continuity and transparency on the topics of: Economic performance, integrating social and environmental considerations in procurement processes, reporting on energy consumption, carbon footprint, and materials (paper consumption and electronic waste). The full reporting index appears on p. 210. In addition, for each topic, Leumi defined the reporting boundaries and examined whether its impact is within the organization (in which case the Bank will focus on managing the issue, methodically measuring its performance, improving its performance, and periodically monitoring while setting objectives) or is outside the organization (in which case Leumi will focus on its dialogue with outside parties, periodic monitoring of their performance, and encouraging responsible conduct). Some of the topics have been defined as material both within the organization and outside of it.

As a financial group with major impact on Israel’s business and public culture, we regard our commitment to the community as a social and ethical anchor we will continue to cultivate. Our customers constitute the core of our business. They expect professional, courteous and efficient service, and that we listen to them in the moment of truth and offer them appropriate and useful value propositions. “Yes, we can” is a world view that opens the door to new ideas coming alive. It is a world view that honors and respects challenges, placing doing at its heart but also making room for possible errors, out of recognition that “nothing ventured nothing gained”. We live in a reality that places the value of sharing in the foreground. To produce a force multiplier, we will enhance interand intra-unit collaboration, with each of us thinking “Leumi,” and thus ensuring the achievement of our goals. In addition, we will show openness and courageously share our opinions, thoughts, and ideas 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 34 Each and every one of us serves as a role model for someone. We must aspire to serve as role models to those around us . The challenges we face and the changing reality obligate us to strive constantly to improve and achieve better results. As employees of the Bank, excellence, for us, is knowing that our work has helped our customers and created business value for the organization. Statement on Business Ethics Leumi’s worldview and the norms to which the Group is committed grew and developed out of recognition of its significant role in maintaining Israel’s economic and social fabric. In 2005, they were drafted into a comprehensive, binding framework entitled the Leumi Way, the Israeli banking system’s first Code of Ethics. A second, revised draft was issued in 2014. The Leumi Way Vision, Ethics and Core Values 12 is an expression of Leumi’s corporate spirit since its founding and its constant striving to comply with the highest standards of ethical, moral and responsible conduct with all its stakeholders: Customers, investors, employees and suppliers. The document outlines the Group's vision and core values and provides a practical plan for handling ethical dilemmas, as well as details ways of contacting those in charge of the issue. The Group operates in accordance the values and way defined by the paper, which continually examines the changes taking place in the social and business environment, adapting itself and outlining the courses of action the Group wishes to follow and the desired behavior according to them. 12 Leumi Way: Vision, Core Values, and Ethics. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 35 The Code of Ethics obligates all those involved in working for the Group and on its behalf members of the Board of Directors, management and employees and is assimilated in all of the Bank’s units, in line with the nature of their activities. In the spirit of the Leumi Code of Ethics and in collaboration with professional units, documents and charters have been written in recent years to regulate the desired behavior in specific areas of activity: A code of ethics for investment advisers; a charter for relations with suppliers; a pension advisory charter; social media conduct for employees; a charter for ethical conduct in Leumi’s intranet environment; and a charter for employees serving in reserve duty. These are attached as appendices to the Code of Ethics. In 2017, a fair banking charter was drafted as well (see p. 67). The Leumi Group takes steps to foresee possible conflicts of interest and prevent them from occurring. In any case involving concern for conflict of interests, employees are instructed to act in accordance with Leumi's internal procedure on the issue. The field of ethics is managed by the Organizational Development and Learning Subdivision of the Human Resources Division, which is responsible for: implementing the Code of Ethics, conducting training on the subject, managing the Ethics Hotline, distributing information on ethical dilemmas, and producing learning materials. The field is managed by: The Ethics Committee LA: A cross-group body that meets throughout the year, as needed. From time to time, ethics representatives in the organization’s units examine the Code of Ethics’ relevance in light of the changing business reality, discuss general ethics issues which arise and develop methods for instilling the Code of Ethics in the various units. Implementation of the Code of Ethics in all units LA: Each year, Leumi conducts crossorganizational activities to implement ethics and core values using tutorials, incorporating the topic in the messages issued at the corporate and unit levels and holds customized activities on the topic in the divisions and units. The topic is also incorporated in employee surveys and employee review processes. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 36 Integrating ethics into training programs LA: The topic of ethics is integrated into training programs and orientation days held for newly hired employees. Appointing ethics trustees in the units LA: Each unit at the Bank appointed an ethics representative, who is responsible for the preparation and implementation of an annual work plan. In addition, divisional ethics committees were established, headed by ethics representatives; the committees are responsible for discussing intra-divisional ethical issues and for developing and executing the divisional implementation plans. Ethics HotlineLA: The Ethics Hotline is available to employees by phone or email and they are welcome to contact it, anonymously or openly, for advice on ethical issues. The hotline is committed to providing a quick, efficient and professional response. Mechanisms for protecting the identity of parties reporting unusual activity LA: Leumi attaches great importance to maintaining reporting channels that will allow the Bank’s employees to report on various issues and to establishing mechanisms for protecting the identity of the reporting parties. The Bank regards each and every one of its employees as a partner to the proper management of the organization and as such expects them to report any unusual activity immediately. Leumi offers employees several channels to report any unusual activity. Contact information is published to employees as part of an internal procedure, with the commitment that any report by an employee through one of these channels will be handled uniformly, promptly and efficiently, while allowing for strict confidentiality regarding the identity of the reporting party. Each year, the information is issued to all employees via email. Under the procedure, the status and position of employees expressing fears of, or reporting on, bribery and corruption violations, will not be harmed as a result of their reporting. Initiatives and Achievements regarding Business Ethics during the Reporting Year LA In 2017, Leumi's ethics hotline received 53 enquiries, 44 of which involved questions regarding conflict of interest, 5 regarding gifts and 4 were concerned with other issues. Leumi Card’s ethics hotline received two inquiries. In 2017, 74% of Leumi’s employees successfully completed a course on ethics and core values. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 37 Procedure prohibiting conflict of interest: Once a year, Leumi employees are required to certify that they are not in conflict of interest while performing their duties. If an employee declares that they are in conflict of interest, his/her managers review the matter. In 2017, 97.6% of the Bank’s employees signed a statement regarding conflict of interest. In 2017, all Leumi Card’s employees completed a refresher tutorial on the Code of Ethics13 and the prohibition on being in a position of conflict of interest. 91% of the company’s employees completed the tutorial. Compliance Statement The Leumi Group is subject to a wide range of domestic and international laws, ordinances and regulations, including directives issued by the Banking Supervision Department, the Securities Authority and the Antitrust Authority. In accordance with the Leumi Group’s organizational culture, compliance with legislation is incorporated into work processes. The Group regards regulatory compliance as a way of life and part of its corporate culture, which is incorporated into work processes, leading to quality implementation of objectives. Due to the changes and trends in the field of compliance both local and global, and the development of the business environment, Leumi invests significant resources in implementing, assimilating and complying with legal provisions to ensure adequate business conduct at a very high level. The Group assimilates procedures relating to that which is permissible and prohibited for its employees as part of their duties, and for preventing the abuse of position or authority to obtain benefits or personal gains. All Leumi Group employees are responsible for understanding the professional, legal and ethical issues in their field and for the proper conduct this entails. Leumi recruits employees with adequate 13 Leumi's Code of Ethics 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 38 qualifications and develops supportive automated systems to comply with the changing legal requirements. Compliance is the responsibility of the Leumi Group’s Chief Compliance Officer, who assists management and the Board of Directors in fulfilling their role in instilling a culture of compliance and operating in accordance with the laws and provisions in various areas. The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Leumi Group’s General Counsel. The General Counsel is also the Board of Directors’ legal advisor and attends all of the Board meetings to provide ongoing legal advice. The Chief Compliance Officer is also responsible for prohibition of money laundering and terrorist financing; enforcement of securities laws; and is also responsible for handling FATCA (taxation of US citizens) issues. In addition, the Chief Compliance Officer is involved in complex transactions, participates in formulating work processes and new product development, and provides advice on complex transactions. In addition, the Chief Compliance Officer presents to the Audit Committee and/or Board of Directors an annual report on the various matters for which she is responsible, including a work plan and a planning vs. execution report and updates these parties as necessary. The compliance policy is the Group’s and applies to all subsidiaries and offices in Israel and abroad. All compliance risks are evaluated each year and a compliance risk map is drawn therefrom, forming the basis for a multi-year compliance risk hedging plan. The significance of compliance lies in protecting customers, the Bank and its employees alike; it is incorporated in a wide range of activities, which are conducted for all employees, using various means. The Group's commitment to compliance involves several focal points: Prohibition of money laundering and the financing of terrorism: Banks and other financial institutions are often used to carry out actions aimed at laundering money or transferring funds to terrorist organizations, and hence the banks’ important role in preventing them. Leumi complies with the relevant legislation. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 39 Declared money policy: The Bank has adopted a declared money policy, the purpose of which is to deal with the risks arising from the possibility that the funds managed and received by the Group are not reported as required by the tax authorities in the customer’s tax residence country. In addition, under the aforementioned policy, a riskoriented plan was devised for handling new and existing risks embodied in customers' cross-border activity. Risk-mitigating policies: As part of the Group’s risk management and compliance policies, several areas of activity have been defined in which Leumi aims to avoid or reduce business activities. These include, among other things, gambling and pornography. Initiatives and Achievements regarding Compliance during the Reporting Year Tutorial on compliance and money laundering: The compliance tutorial is one of the tools for teaching various compliance issues to all Bank employees. The computerized tutorial includes a knowledge test and is given to all Bank employees, who are required to pass the test. Bank employees are divided into various populations, each of which has its own test, with content and questions relevant to its business and level of knowledge required. The tutorial includes questions on the prohibition on money laundering, prohibition of financing terror, compliance, the declared money policy, FATCA and administrative enforcement of securities. About 100% of Leumi’s employees have completed the tutorial in 2017. Anti-Bribery and Corruption Statement The concept underlying Leumi’s commitment to fight bribery and corruption is that the latter are prevalent phenomena which undermine good governance and economic development, distorting competition in the global market. Leumi is committed to taking part in the struggle against bribery and corruption and shall ensure that, in its business 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 40 activities which embody such risk, partners and customers comply with anti-bribery and corruption provisions. The issue of bribery and corruption prevention is addressed on two levels: prohibiting Bank employees from receiving or granting benefits to public servants, customers or office holders in a corporation, with the intention of attaining, either directly or indirectly, either a personal benefit and/or benefit for Leumi; and prevention of bribery in customer activity. The Leumi Group is subject to regulation against bribery and corruption in every country of operation. Group employees are forbidden to offer, guarantee, accept, or grant payment or any other item of value, including employment opportunities, in order to influence the recipient to perform, or refrain from performing, any official act, in order to cause the recipient to engage in business with the Leumi Group or to gain an unfair competitive advantage. The system for engagement with suppliers is based on quality, availability, reliability, service and terms. The Leumi Group makes every effort to avoid discrimination among suppliers, along with maintaining the best interests of the Group, ensuring confidentiality of the information provided by the suppliers and making objective and impartial decisions. On December 30, 2015, the Group approved a compliance risk management policy that includes, among other things, the decision that customers whose activity is riskoriented in this respect will sign a statement regarding the prevention of bribery or breach of trust. This decision was intended to reduce the scope of potential situations where assistance to, or cooperation with, customers performing illicit activities could be attributed to Bank. In 2016, the Board of Directors discussed and approved a bribery and corruption prevention plan. As part of the plan, guiding principles were drafted, procedures were updated, risky activities were identified and red flags were published. In addition, branch managers underwent training courses, a letter was sent to managers, an online chat mechanism was set up, and all employees received a “read and sign” request (a digital signature approving that the employee has read the document). The compliance and enforcement system monitors, and examines the effectiveness of, the plan on an 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 41 ongoing basis to prevent corruption, in cooperation with the business lines and relevant units. Measures for monitoring and preventing fraud and embezzlement: Relevant units in the Leumi Group have centers and tools which work on an ongoing basis to monitor and track incidents of fraud and embezzlement. When this type of incident is discovered in Leumi, an investigation is launched, conclusions are drawn and systems are amended accordingly. Incidents are reported to the Bank of Israel, as required, and, if necessary, to the Israel Securities Authority and the Israel Police. If customers incur damage, the Bank will work with them to restore the status quo ante, so as to ensure that they incur no further damage. Employee fraud and embezzlement incidents are handled by the Internal Audit Division and Human Resources Division. Prohibition on receiving gifts and benefits: The Group has a strict procedure prohibiting the acceptance of gifts and benefits from customers, suppliers and any other parties with whom the Group has working relations. Gifts, benefits or special terms will be awarded to customers only in accordance with the Bank’s policy, by those authorized to do so, and after exercising due judgement. In case of doubt, a supervisor’s advice and approval should be sought. Having suppliers sign an anti-bribery declaration: Agreements with suppliers performing work through the Procurement Subdivision of the Financial Division include the supplier’s undertaking whereby it is not involved, and shall not be involved, in giving or receiving bribes, and that no criminal proceedings have been filed against them due to violation of laws related to giving or receiving bribes. The supplier must confirm it is aware than the Bank should be informed effective immediately of any change in the above. Initiatives to Prevent Corruption, Embezzlement, and Fraud Reporting channels: Leumi regards every one of its employees as a partner in the proper management of the Bank. Leumi therefore expects employees to immediately report any unusual action to their managers. Each employee, at every level, may also contact and report any unusual activity related to banking work through several other channels such as telephone, email, mail, fax, and any other way available to them. Periodically, 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 42 refresher material is sent to all employees regarding the reporting mechanisms available to them. In 2017, all Leumi employees underwent a refresher on reporting channels for illegal or unethical activity. Embezzlement and fraud risk survey: In 2017, as part of a risk assessment on embezzlement and fraud, Leumi mapped at-risk customers in its business lines and an action plan was prepared for them. The risks exposed by the survey serve as a basis for risk control and hedging of bribery and corruption and were translated into work plans. Training and tutorials: In 2017, the Bank incorporated bribery and corruption prevention into training conducted at branches and dedicated forums. In addition, a tutorial entitled senior public officials” was distributed to all bank employees. Identification of corruption incidents involving customers and business partners : Leumi monitors publications on bribery and corruption incidents of customers and/or upon receiving relevant legal orders involving such activity. If a customer is allegedly involved in a bribery or corruption case, Leumi's compliance array examines the matter and account activity in order to identify suspected irregular activity and, if needed, report to the Money Laundering Prohibition Authority. Implementing FATCA regulations: Bank Leumi fully implements the provisions of Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), under a treaty between Israel and the United States since June 2014. A policy has been approved on the matter, information about appropriate procedures have been distributed, training has been conducted, and changes were made to the supportive computer systems. Bank Leumi files the necessary reports with the Israel Tax Authority on time. During the reporting year, the issue of corruption was communicated to the employees and managers as part of the revised Code of Ethics. In 2017, no incidents of bribery or corruption by employees were identified, and therefore no disciplinary measures were taken in this area. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 43 Risk Management The Leumi Group emphasizes its commitment to act responsibly and minimize risk. Risk management is a necessary precondition for meeting the Group’s current and longterm objectives. The Group is engaged in a wide range of activities that involve financial risk-taking, including credit risk, market and liquidity risk, as well as other, non-financial risks, such as operational risks including technology and cyber risks, legal risk, regulation risks, reputation risk, strategic risks, compliance risks and conduct risks. The main responsibilities of the Risk Management Division comply with those set in the Proper Conduct of Banking Business Directive 310 on risk management. These areas include: responsibility for risk management at the Group and Bank level; drafting Leumi’s risk policy for all main risks; assisting the Board of Directors to formulate the Bank’s risk appetite; leading the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), including its various components. The Risk Management Division is also responsible for credit and market activities’ authorizations; monitoring and control of main risk limits; development and validation of models; risk assessment and validation of internal rating of borrowers in specific credit portfolios according to preset thresholds; overall responsibility for proper classification and loan loss provisions and setting the Group’s provision rates. The division is involved in: managing assisting major strategic projects in real time; conducting independent analyses when making strategic decisions and for approval processes of new products; and creating a comprehensive and up-to-date picture of the risk for decision-making in real time. The risk management methods and work procedures in Israel and overseas are regularly assessed and updated, taking into account the changes taking place in the business environment and requirements of the Bank of Israel and other Israeli and foreign regulators. This framework, which is used as a basis for estimating and managing risks and decision-making, includes: Determining the risk appetite, which sets the limits for regular business activity and stress scenarios, as well as setting the policy and limits for each type of risk. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 44 Determining the work processes for analyzing and managing the risk at the individual transaction and portfolio levels. Preparing periodic reports for risk assessment, taking into account the changes in the environment in which the Bank operates; running potential scenarios at various severity levels to assess potential losses and their impact on the Bank; setting general and specific operating plans for dealing with, and mitigating, risks. Risk assessment, at both the general group level and at the individual transaction level, is based on multiple structured methodologies; some are based on expert assessment in each area of activity while others are based on various types of statistical models. Changes in the Israeli and global risk environment and in the risk perception require Leumi to update its assessments and the methodologies it uses, which are constantly challenged by in-house parties and, from time to time, by external ones. Internal Auditing The Internal Audit Division is responsible for auditing the entire Leumi Group and all its units in Israel and overseas, in accordance with the multiyear work plan that assists the Group in achieving its targets. The Audit Division sees its mission as assisting proper and effective operations of the Group, a management tool for supporting the Bank’s managerial backbone, and aiding the Board of Directors and management in fulfilling their responsibilities. Pursuant to Proper Conduct of Banking Business Directive No. 307, the Audit Division undertakes an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control structure, in order to maximize value and improve the operations of the Bank and the Group. The functions of the Audit Division include:  Verifying that the Bank’s operations comply with the law, regulations, and bank policy and procedures.  Verifying that the decisions and directives of the Board of Directors and its committees are implemented. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 45  Reviewing and assessing internal control systems and their effectiveness.  Reviewing the implementation and effectiveness of risk management procedures and risk assessment methodologies.  Reviewing of the steps taken to maintain the Group’s assets, with an emphasis on cost effectiveness.  Conducting special inspections and handling employee complaints about unusual activity and concern for the compromising proper conduct or integrity. Rotation of Internal Auditors The internal auditors at Bank Leumi and its subsidiaries are appointed to their positions, which means that the Board of Directors carries out the appointment process and terminates their work, in accordance with suggestions made by the Audit Committee (pursuant to Article 53(a) to the Proper Conduct of Banking Business Directive No. 307). However, in accordance with the Audit Division’s vision from 2015, the internal and external rotation of internal auditors refreshes the perspectives and innovation in auditing and supports the preservation and implementation of career paths. The auditors are the ones to initiate the rotation, after a minimum period of time, or at the initiative of the Audit Division, in line with procedures and maintaining a 12-month cooling off period when transitioning from a business unit to the Audit Division. The Audit Division will strive to undertake internal rotation after a period of about five years.

This recognition gives rise to our worldview and the norms to which we are committed.” 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 49 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 50 As one of Israel’s largest banking groups, the Leumi Group has extensive economic impact on the Israeli economy and its stability. This impact is both direct and indirect. Direct impact on the economy and society in Israel: The impact stems from the Group being a leading financial entity in the economy, which provides services to millions of customers, whose business success is related to the social and economic strength of the community in Israel. In addition, as one of Israel’s largest employers, the Group has impact on employees and their families – on their terms of employment, their health and safety and their professional and personal development, as well as on promoting employment in various sectors. The Group’s impact is also reflected in the scope of its engagement with local and international suppliers. Indirect impact on the economy and society in Israel: The impact stems from the payment of taxes to the State treasury, financing of infrastructure projects, support of growth sectors (such as small businesses and the conversion of plants to natural gas), involvement in the capital market, services with social and environmental value, local procurement, hiring employees and financial contribution to the community.

Empowering Small and Medium Businesses 99.3% of the businesses in Israel (approx. 560,000 businesses) 14 belong to the micro, small, and medium business sector, which is one of the Israeli economy's growth engines. The sector provides about 1.75 million jobs in Israel and is responsible for about 53% of the business sector's GDP. 15 Enhancing the survivability of small and medium businesses is important to strengthening the economy and supporting the younger, weakened sectors and the periphery. 14 Data for 2016, Central Bureau of Statistics, Annual Statistical Report 2017, Table 18.3. 15 As of 2015. From the Periodic Status Report on Small and Medium Businesses in Israel, Israel Small and Medium Enterprises Authority, Ministry of Economy, 2017 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 56 Small and medium businesses are sometimes burdened by bureaucratic difficulties, lack of managerial knowledge and limited access to credit. Many small and medium businesses find it difficult to cope with conventional credit tracks due to lack of capital or appropriate financial collateral. In 2017, the Leumi Group continued to focus on this sector, promoting several measures such as a state-guaranteed fund, cooperation with the European Investment Fund (EIF) to promote technological innovation among small and mid-sized businesses, the Small Business School, “Leumi Right to your Doorstep”, and more. For more information, please see p. 96. Alongside the range of services and credit tracks, the Leumi Group offers unique tracks and benefits to small businesses operating in peripheral areas and organizations engaged in social activities. Total credit provided to small and micro-businesses as at the end of 2017 was approximately NIS 54.3 billion and the total credit extended to the mid-sized (commercial) business sector as at the end of 2017 was approximately NIS 25.7 billion, for a total of NIS 80 billion. 16 Deposits of small and medium businesses with the Leumi Group amounted to NIS 73.1 billion as at the end of 2017. Empowering Corporations The Leumi Group provides banking and financial services to the leading corporations in Israel, including corporations in fields such as construction and real estate, infrastructure, industry, transportation, chemicals and technology.

The services given include, among other things, ongoing financing according to the customers’ needs; financing investments to maintain and expand operations; providing financing solutions in the area of international trade; financing and supporting national and international projects; financing mergers and acquisitions; organizing syndicates; 16 The credit does not include off-balance sheet credit and derivatives. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 57 financial instruments to hedge against currency risks, interest risks and changes in commodity prices; investment services and capital market activities. Total credit provided to the large business segment as at the end of 2017 was NIS 56.5 billion.17 Deposits of large businesses with the Leumi Group as at the end of 2017 amounted to NIS 54.9 billion. Empowering the Israeli High-Tech Industry Leumi regards the Israeli high-tech industry as the economy’s growth engine, and has therefore decided to expand its activity in the industry as part of the Group’s strategy. LeumiTech which works to advance the high-tech industry in Israel and abroad was established for this purpose; the division provides credit advice to high-tech companies, develops products and programs adapted to the industry and provides growth financial solutions to technology companies at all stages. LeumiTech offers companies a solutions package adapted to their needs; global support in high-tech centers worldwide in Silicon Valley (Palo Alto), New York and London; dedicated teams of bankers that are well-acquainted with the industry and the financial needs of companies of various types and stages. In addition to financial tools, LeumiTech has partnered with the main players in the industry to maximize the benefits it can provide to companies. Thus, for example, LeumiTech collaborates with, and sponsors, organizations that encourage the establishment of start-ups in specific communities, investment in which is of social importance, such as Kamatech the first accelerator for the ultra-orthodox community, which promotes start-up companies of entrepreneurs, both men and women, from the ultra-orthodox community; and Tech for Good an accelerator for startups developing products that benefit the community either financially or socially. As of 2016, LeumiTech has been cooperating with the European Investment Fund (EIF) 17 The credit does not include off-balance sheet credit and derivatives. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 58 to offer preferential loans to small and medium-sized businesses promoting technological innovation. Empowering the Capital Market The Group’s activity in the capital market includes investment consulting and pension consulting for retail customers; investment counseling for customers of the Corporate and Commercial Array; securities brokerage including activities carried out through the dealing rooms; customers’ forex and derivatives activity and market-making in the dealing rooms; banking and financial services for entities active in the capital market; as well as brokerage and custody services. Through the activities of the Capital Markets Division and Leumi Partners, the nonfinancial investment arm of the Leumi Group, the Leumi Group helps its customers manage risk and plan their activity, creates growth opportunities for companies in various stages of the business and supports mergers and acquisitions. In addition, Leumi Partners is engaged in the management and underwriting of offerings (private and public) of securities in the Israeli capital market. Shareholder, Investor and Annalyst Relations Leumi’s relations with the capital market (shareholders, potential investors and analysts) is maintained by the Investor Relations Subdivision of the Financial Division. The Bank's shares are traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and listed on the leading indices in Israel, as well as on various foreign indices, such as MSCI and FTSE4GOOD. The Bank’s shareholders include investors from Israel and abroad. Ongoing relations with the capital market are maintained both in Hebrew and in English through several channels: the investor relations website, group and personal meetings, conferences, quarterly conference calls relating to the financial statements, press releases and reports to the stock exchange. An emphasis was placed in that respect on several issues, including: Creating value for shareholders while maintaining quality: We are committed to presenting leading and improved financial results, which are assessed on an 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 59 ongoing basis, under meticulous and responsible management, creating the highest possible economic value for shareholders. Transparency and accessibility: We shall continue to provide information to all parties, in the most transparent and accessible manner possible. Ongoing contact with the shareholders and the feedback they provide enable us to continue to improve in this area as well. Upgrading operational excellence: Every year we invest in streamlining and optimize the manner in which the organizational resources are managed in order to achieve the objectives. Leumi’s leadership in the shift to digital banking has resulted in a significant improvement of our efficiency rate. We shall continue to lead those processes and upgrade operational excellence. Corporate social responsibility: More and more institutional investors take into account social and environmental criteria when looking into making an investment in a company. There are even cases where clear-cut corporate responsibility criteria are catalysts for investment. We take care to make the relevant information available to investors and research bodies. Statement on Considerations in Credit and Investment Procedures Environmental Risk Assessment In line with the directives of the Banking Supervision Department, Leumi's credit policy includes environmental risk considerations, in an attempt to identify, manage and minimize environmental exposure in granting credit, as far as possible. To incorporate the process of identifying and managing the environmental risks in the credit activity, the Group held training for relevant parties in its business lines, which involved analysis of customers’ risk levels by operational segment and raising awareness of the importance of using means to mitigate environmental risks, such as an internal environmental policy and the customers’ compliance with environmental laws and regulations. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 60 Wherever relevant, credit-granting decisions include environmental risk considerations as part of the customers' risk profile. Thus, for example, when the Bank receives an assessment of a real estate property where pollution is suspected, an environmental assessment is carried out, usually with the assistance of external consultants specializing in the field, the results of which are taken into account when making credit decisions about the portfolio. Refraining from recommending harmful products: Leumi's investment advice professionals, who are responsible for issuing recommendations to the investment advisors at the branches, refrain from recommending securities of companies whose main business is not in line with Leumi's ethical principles. Considerations when Making Investment Decisions in Companies Leumi Partners is the Leumi Group’s investment arm. The company is responsible for making and managing the Group’s investments in corporations, providing services such as underwriting, research, mergers and acquisitions, and raising any type of capital or debt. The company is subject to Bank Leumi’s risk management, credit and investment policies. The regulation to which Leumi Partners is subject and its investment policy limit the company’s investment amount in other companies, barring the Group from holding more than 20% of the means of control in non-financial corporations. When considering investing in a company, a strict due diligence process is conducted in order to identify all risks and opportunities. In addition to due diligence of financial and managerial capabilities, Leumi reviews “black lists” such as those of the US Treasury Department (OFAC), the European Union, the Prohibition of Money Laundering Authority, the Ministry of Defense, etc. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 61 Social and Environmental Loans The Leumi Group attaches business value to promoting sustainability, and reviews the challenges facing its customers in this area in an effort to develop products that provide them with solutions to their needs. These challenges are set to affect, inter alia, the agriculture, construction, transport, energy and water sectors, requiring them to adjust their mindset regarding environmental challenges and climate change. In recent years, the Israeli economy has undergone significant changes in the area of renewable energy and a shift to natural gas, while reducing consumption of polluting energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Group offers its customers a range of finance products to support their adaption to these changes, to reduce the latter’s’ adverse impact and enhance their positive impact on the environment, while recognizing the potential risks embodied in some of its areas of activity and taking care to hedge them, in order to avoid causing harm. Social and environmental loans are provided by the Business-Commercial Division and Banking Division. Following are several examples of credit products with environmental value: Financing environmental infrastructures projects: In 2017, Leumi participated in the financing of several projects with a positive impact on the environment, such renewable energy and waste treatment facilities.

These relationships are based on trust, on providing appropriate and useful services and products, and on a quality service experience. To this end, we rely in all of our activities on high standards of compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of the state and regulators, in addition to ensuring our values and professional ethics. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 65 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 66 Fair Conduct Statement Leumi customers are at the heart of the daily work of the Group’s employees. They expect fair, available, accessible and transparent banking, and having their money managed fairly, responsibly and professionally, out of an understanding of their needs and attention to their wishes. They have high consumer awareness and are in contact with other consumers, especially through social media. The Leumi Group is committed to building relationships with its customers and to nurturing and preserving them over time. These relationships are based on transparency, fairness and on providing appropriate and useful services and products to customers. To this end, we adhere to our system of values and professional ethics, including preserving human dignity, protecting privacy and refraining from discrimination and prejudice, while complying with the laws, rules and regulations. Leumi’s Fair Banking Charter outlines the rules of conduct expected of the Group's employees, with emphasis on giving top priority to the customer’s best interests, upholding transparency, providing full and accessible information and adapting each product to the customer's needs and capabilities. The Charter also addresses the issue of fair pricing and the importance of providing support to customers even when handling complaints. The Company has a Conduct Risk Management Policy in place for the Bank's retail customers. The management of this risk is based on the understanding that the best interests of the customer and the best interest of the bank are one and the same and on the aspiration to create and maximize mutual value – an aspiration which underlies the bank’s vision and its core values. Following are several existing mechanisms to ensure the provision of fair service to customers: Adequate disclosure to customers: When a service or product are sold (credit/deposit) adequate disclosure is provided regarding the product and service cost. Before executing a transaction, the customer is required to approve 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 67 the terms and conditions presented to him/her by signature, and state that he/she would like to execute the transaction. Only after the customer’s automated approval and signature have been received is the transaction carried out and the customer receives confirmation of its completion, terms and conditions. Clarity regarding fees: Bank Leumi notifies customers who open an account about the fees the Bank charges and the current fees plans. The Bank also grants longstanding customers and customers with disabilities additional benefits on fees beyond those awarded to regular customers. Each branch has a document that summarizes comprehensive information about the fees in the different plans, which is provided to any customer, upon request. The fees schedule is also published on the Bank’s website, which also features a calculator for calculating various scenarios and repayment schedules. Fair conduct when offering credit to customers: Leumi has a Code of Ethics for offering loans to customers and there are work procedures and supporting computer systems that provide proper conduct guidelines to employees who offer loans. Identifying customer needs fairly: Bank Leumi seeks to identify the needs of its customers in order to adapt the products and services offered to them. The Bank carries out a needs identification process for customers applying for credit from the Bank. The process includes a discussion with the customer about his/her age, the purpose of the loan, and his/her assets and previous liabilities. The objective of the process is to understand the customer’s needs and financial condition, from both the Bank and the customer’s perspectives. If the customer applying for credit has deposits, the Bank is required to inform him/her about them as an alternative to the credit requested. Emphasis is placed on defining needs, setting targets, adapting the product or solution to the customer’s needs and abilities, taking into account his/her assets and liabilities, and fair disclosure. Preventing customer debt increase: Bank Leumi strives to detect severely overdrawn accounts at early stages, by reviewing all accounts on a daily basis. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 68 Customers with problematic accounts receive two letters, at different dates, stating that they must settle their debt to the Bank. In addition to the letters, a representative from the Customer Call Center calls customers who have exceeded their credit lines. In addition to informing the customer about the problem, the representative’s job is to guide the customer and help him repay the debt by various means, such as changing interest rates and granting a loan to help control the debt repayments. A call from the call center and the letters are usually enough to prompt customers repay their debts. The Problem Debt Subdivision and Problem Debt Units are responsible for reaching rescheduling agreements through the units’ managers and employees, thus preventing legal proceedings and saving costs to the benefit of the Bank and its customers. The Problem Debt Subdivision meets debtor-customers in face-to-face meetings on customer days taking place in legal firms to conclude legal proceedings and reach settlements to the benefit of the Bank and the debtors. Leumi holds direct, sensitive, speedy and businesslike dialogues with customers in financial difficulty, by examining their individual ability to settle their debts and finding the most convenient solution Fairness in Capital Market Activity Traders in the dealing rooms uphold the rules of fair competitiveness and respect for competitors banks and non-bank brokers. Furthermore, traders in the dealing rooms are well versed in all the regulatory requirements and rules of professional ethics. These issues are given emphasis and significant managerial attention by the Head of the Capital Markets Division and managers of the dealing rooms. Transaction fees are regulated and traders in the dealing rooms undergo training sessions that focus on this issue and their phone calls with customers are monitored to make sure that customers’ interest is not adversely affected under any possible circumstances. Fairness in capital market consulting: Investment and pension consulting at Leumi are carried out professionally and objectively, in accordance with the customers’ needs and subject to all relevant provisions of the law. Leumi's consulting services always place 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 69 the best interests of the customer at the top, embracing high professional standards and presenting a complete picture to the customer, with sensitivity to conflicts of interest. Leumi’s consultants are guided by the values of the Bank's Code of Ethics for Investment and Pension Consultants and the values of the Leumi Way. Code of Ethics for Investment and Pension Consultants: In 2011, Leumi was the first Israeli bank to launch a code of ethics for investment and pension consultants. The Code provides clear guidelines on dos and don’ts for the consultants, reflecting the uniqueness, sensitivity and complexity of the investment consulting profession. The code helps consultants prepare for providing service tailored to each customer’s specific needs, exercising significant caution in managing the customers’ money, as well as transparency and sensitivity to any conflict of interest. Fairness in advertising Prior to launching any significant advertising campaign, legal advisors examine its integrity, including in respect to regulatory requirements and reputational and ethical considerations. According to the Banking Rules (Customer Service) Advertising for Minors, 1995 (Revised 11/02), the Bank set out principles and rules for targeting minors in advertising, prohibited content and internal and external procedures were outlined (with the advertising agencies) regarding advertising to minors. The rules require, inter alia, that advertising aimed at minors be consistent with the values of Leumi's Code of Ethics and positive social values (e.g., mutual guarantee, kindness, honesty, justice, tolerance, equality, non-violence). The rules also require that ads are in line with the target audience’s level of knowledge, understanding and maturity and that the information contained in it is clear, precise and correct. Regulation and Public Policy The Regulation Subdivision, which is part of Leumi’s Strategy and Regulation Division, is responsible for handling, and interfacing with, the various regulators in Israel, serving as liaison between them and the Bank’s units, managing relevant work processes and 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 70 responding to the regulators’ requests. The Subdivision is responsible for the work processes and representing the Bank vis-à-vis the Association of Banks, the Knesset and government ministries. The Subdivision also handles, with the relevant professional entities, invitations to Knesset committee meetings, bills, directives and regulations, and is responsible for analyzing their implications for the Group’s activity. When making strategic decisions regarding major changes, such as regarding restructuring or the launching of new products and services, the Bank examines the possible impact of these decisions on its stakeholders, with emphasis on accessibility and adaptability of the services to the needs of specific population groups, such as small businesses, senior citizens, the ultra-orthodox sector, Arab society, marginalized populations, people with special needs, etc. Antitrust Activities The Bank's business activity is conducted with strict adherence to the antitrust laws that govern the Bank, and whose purpose is to ensure free economic competition. To ensure compliance with the provisions of the law, the Bank has an internal enforcement program for the Antitrust Law, which includes training, audit, reporting and supervision mechanisms, as well as a procedure for the Bank’s employees, which governs the Bank’s activities in the field of antitrust, according to its various interfaces with competitors, customers and suppliers. The enforcement program is managed by the Legal Division. The procedure is intended to enable the Bank’s employees to act within the framework of antitrust laws and to seek legal advice and obtain guidance where needed. The procedure is updated from time to time in accordance with regulatory changes. Business Conduct Initiatives and Measures In 2017, managers at Leumi underwent a knowledge assessment on antitrust, as part of an annual program on the topic. The Advice Law and securities laws: Every two years, all employees are required to complete a tutorial on restrictions that apply to them when conducting 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 71 securities transactions; each year, consultants are required to complete a tutorial on the Advice Law. In 2017, all of Leumi’s investment consultants completed a tutorial on the topic. 90% of the employees completed the tutorial successfully. Engaging and Conducting Dialogue with Customers Customer Satisfaction with the Service LA In 2017, about 90,000 surveys were initiated to monitor Leumi customers’ satisfaction with the service they receive from the branches, call centers, divisions and various units. The surveys use various measures, according to the type of customer and topics under focus at Leumi. For example, this year, under examination were Leumi’s availability to its customers; its response time to customers’ queries; its initiative, flexibility, understanding and familiarity with its customers’ needs; personal attention; the professionalism of its bankers, etc. In 2017, the general customer satisfaction score (on a scale of 1-10) in the Banking Division (the largest) was 8.95. In cases of abnormal results, Leumi uses quality control measures while identifying failures and ways to correct them. In addition, branch staff contact customers at their own initiative in order to learn from positive feedbacks, understand the reasons for customer dissatisfaction and how to improve the service. Leumi encourages and strengthens the focus on service and customer experience by training employees and by continually measuring customers’ satisfaction with the service. Additional Measures Taken to Measure and Improve the Quality of Service in the Banking Division: Listening to the customer’s voice is one of the cornerstones on which the service improvement process at the Banking Division is based. A number of service quality control measures exist for this purpose: 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 72 Regular service surveys, in which customers are asked about their satisfaction from all service channels the branch, Leumi Call, website and app. Undercover inspections: Monthly inspections designed to identify the customer experience from the moment he/she enters the branch, with an emphasis on support by digital channels and the branch’s appearance, the waiting experience at the branch, and the process of opening an account for a new customer. The inspections are designed to allow a thorough understanding of customer needs and the development of adequate personalized solutions and services. Routine inspections of branches and customer call centers’ availabilty in accordance with the targets set. Leumi CardLA Throughout the year, Leumi Card carries out regular quality of service surveys among private and business customers, as well as surveys that focus on specific processes carried out by the customers in an effort to improve them. In 2017, approx. 20,000 customer satisfaction and customer experience surveys were conducted among Leumi Card customers (by telephone and email). The following results were obtained from analyzing 6,000 of the surveys:  36% of the respondents indicated that the service they received was beyond their expectations.  49% of the respondents indicated that the service met their expectations. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 73 Dialogue with Customers on Digital Media and Social Networks Leumi’s activity on social networks and in digital media channels is based on several principles: Accessibility and availability to the customer, inviting dialogue, openness and transparency. Activity in digital media channels allows the Leumi Group to conduct direct and continuous dialogue with customers, include them in processes, understand the issues that are important to them, and act accordingly. These measures help to increase the trust between the Group and its customers. In addition, these channels allow Leumi to offer customers its specialty services in various financial categories, in an accessible and creative manner. Leumi customers can express their opinion and comment on the Bank’s products and services, offering ideas for streamlining and development, and consulting with experts in special-purpose blogs and in the financial arena, all done quickly, openly and without the need for intermediaries. Handling Inquiries from the Public and Employees The Public Inquiries Bureau is responsible for handling complaints and inquiries received by the Bank from the public and employees. The bureau is headed by a public inquiries commissioner, a Bank Leumi executive who reports to the Bank’s General Counsel. The public and employees can contact the Public Inquiries Bureau through various means: sending an online form through the Bank Leumi website, sending a letter by mail, sending a fax, and by telephone. The contact information for filing an inquiry with the Bank is available on Bank Leumi’s website, at the Leumi information kiosks, and on signs at the branches and headquarters (specifically for security, catering and cleaning contract workers). Inquiries reach either the Public Inquiries Bureau directly, from employees and customers, or via parties such as the Bank of Israel, the Office of the President of Israel, and MK’s bureaus. Public inquiries are handled as an integral part of the service Bank Leumi provides its customers. The commissioner and public inquiries officers handle any type of inquiry received by the Bureau – complaints, requests for information, or requests for help 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 74 seriously and professionally. The Bureau evaluates them fairly, efficiently, and independently, working objectively and impartially to reach conclusions, and, wherever relevant, decide on remedies for the inquirer. Inquirers receive a generous, clear, and thoroughly explained response (except in cases in which the bank secrecy obligation prohibits explaining the decision) within reasonable time. The decision-making of public inquiries officers reflects values of honesty, fairness and responsibility towards customers. Depending on the case, the Public Inquiries Bureau is prepared to lean in favor of the inquirer, ex gratia, even if the complaint is found to be unjustified or in cases where the customer is in severe distress or special personal circumstances. A customer’s complaint sometimes reveals a flaw with potential consequences for other customers. In such cases, the issue is sent for the relevant official at the Bank for handling, and the Bureau monitors the issue until the flaw is corrected in full.

Initiatives and Measures Regarding Customer Privacy and Information Security Protected or Risky : To raise employees' awareness of information security risks and implications of the digital world, in 2017, Leumi developed a unique board game for employees and their families. The game exposes participants in an experiential and fun way to information security issues, providing useful information about various risks in the digital world, such as phishing, information theft, and more. The game raised awareness to these issues’ implications on the employees’ private domain and consequently on the workplace. The game was distributed to 4,500 employees and was accompanied by a series of powerful video clips on the importance of adhering to information security and privacy guidelines. 72% of Bank employees completed an information security tutorial in 2017. Phishing attempts (fraudulent attempts by hostile parties to collect customer information in order to access their accounts), in any, were handled so that if customers incurred any damage, the Bank worked to restore the status quo ante, to ensure that they incur no further damage. There were no cases of information leakage. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 81 Information Security and Protecting Customer Privacy at Leumi Card Leumi Card complies with all provisions of the law and regulations with respect to privacy protection and cyber defense, including Bank of Israel Proper Conduct of Banking Business Directive 357, which includes guidelines for protecting the privacy of the company’s customers and guidelines for cyber defense and information security.

As part of its preparations for dealing with the different cyber threats, Leumi Card undertakes in-house and external procedures to mitigate cybersecurity risk to the Company and its customers. Cyber risks are managed by several security and control circles at a number of layers with the objective of reducing potential exposure to this threat. Leumi Card considers both the information in its systems and that held by its customers and suppliers a primary asset, and invests heavily in the implementation of advanced information security control defense mechanisms and procedures. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 82 Examples of these measures include system hardening, writing and updating procedures and work processes (such as the management of Leumi Card’s authorization procedure), hacking tests, information and cyber security reviews, raising employee awareness to phishing attacks and monitoring such attacks against websites, imposter mobile apps, etc. Reducing Gaps and Empowering Population Segments Statement on Accessibility for People with Disabilities About 21% of Israeli adults have disabilities: Physical, sensory (audio and visual impairments), mental, or emotional. This group consists of approximately 1.1 million people, for some of whom accessibility is critical; i.e. its absence is liable to be a barrier to consuming services. 19 Accessibility is the way to overcome these barriers. Under the Equal Rights for People with Disabilities Law, 5758-1988, “accessibility” means “the ability to reach, to be mobile and to be oriented in a place, to use and to enjoy service, to receive information that is given or produced in a place or a service or in connection with them, to use given facilities and to participate in programs and activities that take place there.” Leumi attributes great significance to providing equal, respectful and customized service to all customers and to improving the service offered to people with disabilities. The Group invests much thought and resources in providing customers with disabilities full access to the Bank’s various services, both at branches and through direct and digital channels (the website, application and automated devices).

The issue of accessibility is incorporated into undercover customer surveys held at the branches. Leumi is working on making the Bank's branches accessible according to the timetable set by the Buildings, Infrastructure and Environment regulations.

The Group works at all times to meet its customers' expectations, while maintaining the highest level of professionalism, providing high quality service, an attentive ear and personal attention at all junctures of business decisions and opportunities. Financial literacy is the ability to read, analyze, and understand financial data that impact an individual's economic welfare; it is the ability to assess economic possibilities, use money wisely, plan for the future, as well as respond intelligently to the present situation and to economic changes. A considerable portion of the population is unaware of the financial products and tools available to them for managing their finances wisely and lack the knowledge and tools to reach informed economic decisions at critical life junctions. In addition to managing its customers’ funds, the Leumi Group also invests efforts in providing these tools and knowledge: The Group believes that this issue is closely related to consumer protection, and that acquiring such knowledge is mutually beneficial. In this manner, the Group not only enhances its customers' trust but also the public’s perception of the financial sector as experts in this field and promotes the involvement of employees in the community in which they work. The task of making financial knowledge available is shared by the Banking Division’s Business Development Subdivision, the Digital Division’s Marketing Subdivision, and by the Corporate Development and Learning Subdivision of the Human Resources Division. This area is managed on two levels: Enhancing the customer’s financial knowledge: A better understanding of financial issues can lead to an improvement in customers’ economic situation, especially among younger people.

As leaders of the digital financial industry, Leumi has realized that along with hundreds of thousands of customers who are actively using digital channels, hundreds of thousands of others have not yet crossed the digital divide and taken advantage of the digital revolution. For this purpose, we launched a unique flagship project: Israel IL A nationwide project that allows Leumi’s customers to obtain digital training by “digital guides”, who individually guide them through connecting to a digital channel of their choice, presenting and providing guidance on the various transaction opportunities that the customer wishes to make and pursue. The project targets all customers, of all ages. However, Leumi has decided to allocate additional resources to the elderly population, first and foremost through the Israel-ILMobile Bank Branch that makes a variety of services accessible to elderly people residing in assisted living facilities. The Israel-IL-Mobile Bank Branch features ATMs accessible to customers of all banks and allows Leumi’s customers to carry out 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 91 transactions and obtain information through the digital kiosk installed in the vehicle. The Israel-IL-Mobile Bank Branch also features a banker, who assists customers in using banking services performed directly with the branch. Digital assistants have been placed at the Bank’s branches where the teller stations have been converted into digital stations, to help teach customers how to carry out transactions using automated devices and mobile phones. Digital developments have also been implemented to help customers communicate with bankers and carry out digital transactions without the need to reach their branches. The project also features brief training sessions conducted in the ATM section of all Leumi’s branches and in central locations across Israel, teaching customers how to obtain information and carry out transactions on Leumi’s website and apps one-onone sessions across Israel, nationwide digital customer conferences (such as Digital Cafe, how-to videos, special trainings for Bank employees, and more. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 92 Alongside Israel IL, Leumi cooperates with various entities to make the digital world accessible to the general public: ORT's Web Surfing Club: The project focuses on empowering and on developing leadership skills and social involvement of youth through volunteering with adults in order to reduce digital divides.

Paid summer work for employees’ children: Children of employees aged 14-18 are offered summer jobs in Leumi Card’s adopted NGOs. This platform is of great value to both employees and their children, due not only to the paid work but to the value provided to society, as well as the NGOs who are given free manpower and assistance. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 158 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 159 Measuring the Effectiveness of Investing in the Community The “Leumi Tomorrow Centennial Fund for Endowing Israel's Future Generation” NGO is evaluating the effectiveness of its activity, including objectives, measurement, and evaluation programs, with emphasis on the measurement of long-term results. The unit for employee involvement in the community at Leumi engages in the measurement, ongoing evaluation, and data collection concerning the scope of volunteering by Leumi employees, by number of volunteers and hours of volunteer work. At Leumi Card, community involvement activities are monitored throughout the year. Discussions are held with the volunteers and with the communities in which the activities are held, concerning the degree of the activities' success and their impact on the target population. In accordance with feedback, and where necessary, improvements are made in the activity programs. Meeting Objectives Investment in the community by Leumi Objective for the end of 2017 Status Details Enhance coordination between Done Emphasis was made on engaging donations and volunteer employees in organizations to activities in order to boost which Leumi makes donations, shared value while assessing the possibility of donating to organizations where Leumi’s employee volunteer At least 3,400 employees will Done 3,755 of Bank Leumi’s employees participate in at least one volunteered in the community volunteer activity in 2017 At least 1,000 volunteers Done 1,156 employees volunteered in participated in the activities of the “Follow Me! activities the “Follow me!” organization 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 160 Investment in the community, Leumi Card Objective for the end of 2017 Status Details Launch another Book a Done In November 2017, the eighth Success Story project in the class of the “Book a Success 2017-2018 school year Story” was launched Maintain a volunteer rate of Partially 36% of the Company's employees 40% of the company's implemented participated in various volunteer employees activities.

Source: Main Points of the Supplier Charter. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 163 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 164 Supply Chain Leumi’s procurement activity includes the ongoing purchase of projects, equipment, products and services, as needed. 34 Most of the procurement activity is carried out in a centralized manner for all of Bank Leumi’s units, including for some of the subsidiaries. Leumi’s Procurement Subdivision is responsible for identifying suitable suppliers, screening vendors, requests for proposals, conducting negotiations, contracting suppliers and managing the ongoing relations with them. Procurement at Leumi is divided into technology procurement (hardware, software, product maintenance, consultants and communications) and general procurement (office equipment, security and safety, printing and mail, marketing & advertising, transportation, construction, cleaning and maintenance). The Group also works with several suppliers that provide products specific to the banking industry, such as ATMs and machines for counting banknotes. More than 94% of Leumi's purchases are from local suppliers registered in Israel. Procurement Data In 2017, the Group contracted more than 4,400 suppliers (including direct purchases by the units). About 75 new suppliers started working with the Bank's Procurement Subdivision during the year. All suppliers newly contracted by Leumi’s Procurement Subdivision have undertaken to meet the Bank’s employment environment criteria (terms and conditions of employment, safety, etc.). 34 Most of the procurement activity is carried out by the general procurement function, which is responsible for procurement processes and for carrying out large transactions. The Procurement Subdivision of the Finance Division is responsible for these processes. In addition to these procurement activities, direct purchases are made by the headquarters units and branches. The information in this section refers to the general procurement activity only, unless noted otherwise. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 165 As applicable, and depending on the type and extent of engagement, Leumi's contracts with its suppliers include clauses regarding commitment to employee rights. All construction and maintenance suppliers newly contracted by the Procurement Subdivision (32 suppliers in 2017) have undertaken to meet the Bank’s environmental criteria. Mapping of Supplier Characteristics In 2017, around 60% of the suppliers working for Leumi’s Procurement Subdivision were small and mid-sized businesses35 The Leumi Group strives to maintain long-term, proper, and responsible relations with suitable suppliers, while maintaining an open dialogue with them in all areas of activity. 35 Small suppliers Businesses with 0-20 employees; mid-sized suppliers Businesses with 21-100 employees. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 166 Implementing corporate social responsibility in procurement and in the supply chain requires looking at two key aspects: responsible conduct with suppliers and enhancing the positive impact on the community through procurement: Responsible Conduct with Suppliers Fair and ethical conduct towards suppliers: In 2013, a charter was drafted based on the Leumi Way, outlining the Group's conduct towards its suppliers, with an emphasis on equality, transparency, sensitivity to conflicts of interest, exercising discretion, confidentiality, fairness, professionalism and protecting the environment. Payment Terms to Suppliers 36: o As a rule, Leumi's policy of paying its suppliers is EOM + 30 (payment of up to 30 days after the end of the month in which the supplier’s invoice reached the Bank), unless the purchase order indicates other payment terms. o Payments are made earlier in case of a supplier experiencing liquidity problems by special request and according to a hierarchy of authorizations. Dialoguing with suppliers: Leumi operates a secure supplier portal, allowing the exchange of contract documents and invoices for payment in an efficient, rapid, and transparent manner between Leumi and its suppliers. Initiatives to Promote Responsible Conduct with Suppliers Where material transactions are concerned, the Bank strives to manage the price quote processes through an online system, which allows for the submission of questions and providing a uniform response to all the suppliers participating in the procurement process in a quick and uniform manner. In addition, the phase of 36 The data refer to payments made by the central payment unit. There may be differences in payments made by other units. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 167 selecting the winning supplier is conducted while maintaining separation between aspects of quality and cost, with emphasis on fairness. Some of the procurement procedures such as real time tenders take place online, in order to increase transparency. Leumi’s Procurement Sub-Division manages procurement processes using mechanisms that help maintain fairness and transparency, such as a FAQ mechanism for suppliers participating in the purchasing process. A supplier survey is conducted every two years, with the purpose of assessing suppliers’ perceptions of their interfaces with the Procurement Subdivision, with emphasis on applying the values of the supplier charter (fairness, equality, confidentiality, etc.). The most recent survey was conducted in 2016; an additional survey is expected in 2018. Before bidding for construction projects, the Procurement Subdivision initiates a preliminary tour for subcontractors, with the aim of enabling potential suppliers to coordinate expectations, understand the nature of the project and in order to maintain transparency and equality. Enhancing Positive Impact on the Community through Procurement The growing awareness about supply chain managing and its impact on the environment and the community is embedded in the selection process of suppliers and products. Suppliers are required to state, as applicable, their compliance with requirements pertaining to issues such as air and water pollution, soil contamination, noise, odor, ionized and non-ionized radiation, waste, hazardous materials, business licensing, nuisances, causing harm to public health and the environment, liability for damage, and liability for employee safety and hygiene and that they are not involved in the giving and/or taking of bribes. Currently, supplier CSR evaluation includes three main topics:  The supplier’s employment practices: Fair and lawful employment.  The supplier’s conduct with respect to the environment, if applicable: Air pollution, waste in production processes, and the use of green materials. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 168  Proper and ethical conduct by the supplier: When collecting information about suppliers, if relevant, warning signs are checked, including prior convictions of the supplier. In addition, as part of their contract terms and conditions with the Bank, suppliers undertake that they are not involved, and shall not be involved, in giving or receiving bribes, whether in Israel or abroad, and that no criminal proceedings have been filed against them due to violation of laws related to giving and/or receiving bribes. Supplier are required to report immediately to the Bank of any change in the above. Suppliers are selected in cooperation with other units at the Bank. Below are the relevant procurement processes and actions applied by the Group: Employment conditions oversight: The Leumi Group takes care that the signing of contract procedures include a declaration by companies providing services such as cleaning, security and catering (under the Law for the Enhancement of Labor Law Enforcement), that they comply with the provisions of labor laws. The Leumi Group conducts periodic sample inspections of its suppliers through an accountant on its behalf, in order to verify that their employment conditions comply with the law. If the inspections uncover deficiencies, the companies are asked to amend them. Cleaning, security, and catering service providers are required to issue collateral to ensure the terms of the contract. These collateral are saved and used, inter alia, to ensure that suppliers correct deficiencies that they were requested to correct, and to guarantee payments in accordance with the law and the protection of workers’ rights. Furthermore, by law, the Bank’s Public Complaints Bureau is a key factor in the handling of complaints by suppliers’ employees (if such complaints are received). If a supplier is replaced for any reason, the replaced supplier’s employees have the legal right to switch to the new supplier and keep their seniority. The outgoing supplier must pay the employees severance by law and the new supplier signs an agreement stipulating that it must comply with the law. In 2017, 5 inquiries and complaints were filed by cleaners and security guards. The complaints were thoroughly examined and treated accordingly. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 169 Weighted assessment of suppliers: Bank Leumi uses various methods for assessing suppliers, which help assess their performance and uses the data as a tool to assess suppliers in procedures which are exercised from time to time. Giving construction suppliers an opportunity to participate in the procurement process: New suppliers are invited to present their operations before the construction suppliers search committee, which convenes from time to time, with the objective of giving numerous and diverse suppliers an opportunity to provide services to Bank Leumi. The committee examines new suppliers based on their suitability to the Bank’s requirements. Following the committee’s approval, the supplier is entered into the Bank’s automated supplier database, from which suppliers are chosen through various procurement processes. Meetings with key suppliers: Procurement Sub-Division representatives meet with representatives of key suppliers. In the meetings, the parties discuss their satisfaction from the joint work. In addition, the supplier is asked about its corporate social responsibility practices. As of 2017, suppliers participating in procurement procedures with quality criteria are asked to answer a corporate responsibility questionnaire. Controls over suppliers' compliance with environmental requirements: The Real Estate Subdivision carries out inspections and audits for suppliers whose activities may have adverse impact on the environment, such as cleaning and construction companies. Among other things, materials used by the suppliers are tested and, if necessary, the suppliers are asked to present relevant certificates, such as: Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs), landfill permits, standard certification, etc. Promoting Social Procurement To expand the scope of Leumi’s diverse and social procurement, targets were set for purchasing from social or diverse suppliers, such as NGOs and social businesses, small and mid-sized suppliers, green purchasing, etc. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 170 In 2017, Bank Leumi’s Central Procurement Subdivision purchased NIS 0.9 million in products and services from Israeli NGOs and social businesses, with the objective of supporting and developing these businesses. In addition, Leumi procures services from companies that promote the hiring of people from underemployed sectors, primarily the ultra-orthodox. In 2017, Leumi’s purchases from these companies totaled approximately NIS 4.6 million. As a principle, Bank Leumi supports the activity of Israeli start-ups, prioritizing technological purchases from them. Initiatives to enhance positive impact on the community through procurement Establishing criteria for environmentally-friendly procurement: To reduce the Bank’s environmental impact, environmental best practices are applied to procurement procedures of construction, maintenance, and electronic products. The list mentions cleaning detergents, product packaging, biodegradation rate of the materials, use of recycled or easily recyclable materials, modularity and convenience of reuse, use of hazardous materials, energy and water resource conservation, and others. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 171 In 2017, Leumi continued its collaboration with Maala, as part of which Leumi asked suppliers to fill out Maala’s questionnaire for medium-sized businesses, in order to check their compliance with corporate responsibility norms and to promote this issue among the suppliers. In 2016-2017, 16 suppliers joined the Maala rating following Leumi’s requirements. Leumi was even given a recognition award by Maala for its efforts to add suppliers to the rating and promote corporate social responsibility in Israel. Its collaboration with Maala allows Leumi to promote the implementation of the corporate responsibility agenda within the Israeli society and among the Bank’s suppliers. In 2017, Leumi continued to support the WESOURCE initiative of the NGOs Jasmine and Zionism 2000, in order to set up an online pool of diverse and social suppliers. The objective of the supplier pool is to make it easier for large organizations to increase the scope of their procurement from social businesses, small businesses, NGOs and businesses that employ people from underemployed populations. In 2017, Leumi was given a recognition award by Maala for its efforts to add suppliers to the rating and promote the corporate social responsibility agenda in Israel Employment conditions oversight: During 2017, monthly meetings were held between representatives of the placement firms with their workers at Leumi Card to enable them to identify and address issues in real-time, as well as to enable the placement firms to provide answers to questions by their workers. In addition, as part of the ongoing activity, a semi-annual audit was carried out, in which contract workers’ pay slips are checked, with the findings taken up with the supplier. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 172 Meeting Objectives Impacting the Community through Procurement Leumi Objective for the end of 2017 Status Details Have mid-sized suppliers join Done In 2017, ten of Leumi’s suppliers Maala’s rating joined the Maala's rating Training suppliers Encourage Not Due to other priorities, it was small-size suppliers to enroll in performed decided to move the objective to Leumi’s Small Business School 2018 Set objectives for sociallyDone Total purchases: NIS 0.9 million conscious procurement Future Objectives Impacting the Community through Procurement Leumi Objective by end of 2018 Main actions planned Continue collaboration with Maala to Incorporate Leumi’s suppliers in Maala’s have Leumi’s suppliers join Maala’s rating rating of mid-sized businesses of mid-sized businesses Make socially-conscious purchases Map and execute relevant transactions according to the work plan with diverse or social suppliers Encourage small-size suppliers to enroll Contact potential suppliers in Leumi’s Small Business School 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 173 Creating Value for the Environment Bank Leumi attributes supreme value to the quality of performance and service provided to its customers, maintaining an integrated system for managing safety, hygiene, energy conservation and environmental protection. The Bank takes a proactive approach to minimizing environmental risk and pollution factors and shall resolve safety, hygiene, and environmental hazards, as well as waste of resources, while developing and fostering an organizational climate that encourages sustainable activities From: Leumi’s Safety and Environmental Policy Paper 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 174 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 175 The Leumi Group is aware that environmental issues are an inseparable part of the worldwide system of financial and business considerations, and the impact of these issues on its current and future markets. The Group recognizes its environmental responsibility and the fact that its business activity can impact the environment, both directly and indirectly. All Group companies aim to conduct their activity in such a way as to consistently diminish adverse impacts on the environment, in compliance with legal obligations and, in the absence of legislation, with the aim of voluntarily adopting the accepted and leading standards in the sector. The main impact of the Leumi Group on the environment is derived from three main factors:  Energy consumption: Consumption of electricity, consumption of gasoline for transportation purposes, and consumption of diesel fuel for transport and emergency generators.  Carbon footprint: Derived from direct emissions (especially fuels) and indirect emissions (power consumption).  Waste and water: Responsible removal of electronic and paper waste, and the total water consumption. The Group's activities are characterized mainly by office work, and most of the energy consumption is derived from the consumption of electricity in the headquarters of the Group’s subsidiaries, branches and units. The Leumi Group makes significant efforts to identify actions that will improve efficiency and conserve energy. These efforts are reflected in steps taken to increase energy efficiency, which not only benefit the environment but also streamline operations in terms of power consumption, air conditioning, lighting and fuel consumption. When planning new facilities, Leumi promotes energy savings and improves energy efficiency and resource savings in existing facilities. The Building and Maintenance Subdivision of Leumi’s Real Estate Division is responsible for systematic annual measurement and management of environmental issues by the 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 176 Bank (at the headquarters and branch level) and for providing guidance to the subsidiaries in this area. As part of these efforts, a large amount of data is gathered, such as on power consumption, fuel consumption, water consumption, paper consumption, recycling of paper, and electronic waste. In addition, the Sub-Division initiates processes to install systems and solutions leading to power savings and savings in fuel consumption, in collaboration with other units:  Installation of power consumption control systems  Installation of energy-saving systems and devices in A/C systems  Installation of energy-saving lighting systems  Use of green building elements in new construction and renovation of existing branches  Operation of an employee shuttle system between the Bank’s main headquarters buildings  Installation of automated systems for control of water consumption (including the overall management of water consumption, identifying leaks and abnormal consumption) This streamlining allows for a substantial reduction in both emissions of pollutants and the consumption of non-renewable resources. Initiatives and Actions to Promote Environmental Issues Bank Leumi and Leumi Card are certified for Environmental Management Standard ISO 14001 (in 2012 and 2009, respectively). As part of managing this issue, quarterly discussions are held regularly by the Group on its environmental impacts, accompanied by external parties (a consultancy company and the Standards Institution of Israel). Leumi is also certified for Energy Systems Management Standard ISO 50001, Safety Standard ISO 18001, and Quality Standard ISO 9001. Furthermore, in 2014 the Bank was the first financial institution in Israel to be certified for the Green Label for Service by the Standards Institution of Israel and the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The certifications for the standards were renewed in 2017. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 177 In addition to external standards, an internal standard for Green Conduct was introduced at Leumi. It provides for internal annual inspections on a series of environmental criteria to be carried out at the branches.  Environmental trustees have been appointed for all of Leumi's branches as well as for headquarters. The environmental trustees are responsible for managing environmental issues (including energy conservation), and for monitoring power and water consumption data in their respective units.  Employee training: Leumi Group attaches great importance to instilling environmental content among employees. In addition to the activities of the environmental trustees and the Green Forum, Group employees are required to undergo training and refresher courses on environmental issues from time to time.  Earth Day: As part of an efforts to raise its employees’ awareness of environmental protection, Leumi celebrated International Earth Day with a festive event at the main headquarters building in Tel Aviv. The event featured recycled and ecological products as well as pedaling stations for making fresh fruit shakes without the use of power. Participating employees pedaled the bicycles and prepared 900 cups of fruit shake for their colleagues. The event also featured photos that were exhibited in a themed photo competition entitled Preserving the Environment.  Provision of reusable bags: As part of its efforts to raise employees’ awareness to the importance of protecting the environment, in 2017, Bank Leumi gave employees reusable fabric bags. In addition to managing direct environmental impacts as a result of the Bank’s activities, the Bank also examines the indirect impacts of its activities. These impacts are derived from the development of products of environmental value and from managing environmental risks (for more information, please see the section entitled Economic, Social and Environmental Impacts). Leumi is also working to reduce indirect impacts resulting from energy consumption. In this context, the Bank offers digital solutions that allow customers to receive service 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 178 without having to visit the branch. This helps to reduce the distance driven by customers in order to receive service at the branches and to reduce air pollution and fuel consumption by the customers. Note: The data in the Creating Value for the Environment chapter refer to the environmental performance of Bank Leumi and Leumi Card. References in this chapter to Leumi Group include these companies only, unless otherwise stated. Energy Consumption The total energy consumption of the Leumi Group in 2017 was 392,073 gigajoules, which represents a 6% increase. This increase is attributed to the improvement in measurement and data collection; as of 2017, the report also includes data on gasoline consumption for all company-leased vehicles (until 2016, only data on executives’ leased cars were reported). In addition, as of 2017, the data include diesel fuel consumption for Bank Leumi’s vehicles. According to data adjusted to last year’s consumption figures, there was a 2% decrease in energy consumption. * The indirect power consumption figure for 2016 was revised. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 179 Power Consumption Due to the nature of banking activity, most of the Group's energy consumption (76%) arises from power consumption by Leumi and Leumi Card. Accordingly, the companies implement projects and processes aimed at reducing their power consumption alongside processes to reduce their use of fuel. As of 2015, the Group improved its measuring and reporting of power consumption data that now include power consumption in the branches and in properties in which power is paid for directly to the property management companies. 37 Comparing the 2017 data to those in 2016, there is a 1.3% decrease in the Group’s power consumption 38 The total power consumption includes 85,000 kWh that were produced by photovoltaic cells and sold back to the Israel Electric Corporation. * The indirect power consumption figure for 2016 was revised. 37 The Bank makes every effort to gather regular power consumption data from all its properties and branches in which the electricity charge is paid directly to the property management companies. The total consumption in these properties may vary from time to time, depending on the availability of the information. These changes should not be viewed as an increase or decrease in the Bank’s total power consumption. 38 When comparing data on direct consumption only (excluding properties in which electricity is consumed indirectly), there was a 2.6% decrease in the Group’s consumption in 2016 vs. 2015. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 180 Energy Intensity The Leumi Group measures its energy intensity to test the effectiveness of measures taken to reduce power consumption. The intensity is measured by area (m 2).39 Between 2012 and 2017, there was a decrease in energy intensity, on the back of the measures taken to increase energy efficiency. * The indirect power consumption figure for 2016 was revised. Initiatives to Reduce Energy Consumption Transitioning to consuming power generated from natural gas: As of 2014, Leumi consumes most of its electricity from a company generating power using natural gas. This move greatly reduced Leumi's carbon footprint and negative environmental impact. Replacement of lighting fixtures by cost-effective ones: In 2017, steps were also taken in this area in branches and headquarters buildings. Obsolete and inefficient lighting fixtures were replaced with new, more efficient fixtures. 39 A total of 280,080 m2 in 2017. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 181 Furthermore, several LED lighting fixtures were installed, which are characterized by high-energy efficiency and a very long life. Remote energy monitoring: Installing of remote monitoring and control systems for power consumption at the branches and expanding existing systems for building control in Bank Leumi’s headquarters buildings. Analysis of energy consumption patterns at the branches: In the framework of renovation and energy efficiency projects, the Bank frequently installs energy monitoring systems and smart building systems at the branches and headquarters buildings, to enable analysis of energy consumption patterns. Circulated air filtration system: Following a successful pilot at a branch in Beer Sheva, two additional circulated air filtration systems were installed in Bank Leumi’s Lod Service Campus, in order to reduce the entry of warm and moist air from the outside. This system results in energy savings. Green Building: When opening a new branch and in a massive renovation of an existing branch, environmental aspects are integrated, such as thermal window coating on warm facades, remote control systems, etc. Carbon offset: As part of setting goals to reduce energy consumption, and taking into account that it leases space in shared buildings, Leumi Card decided to invest in carbon offsetting. Such offsetting can be made by financing a project to reduce greenhouse gas emissions outside the organization. Leumi Card chose to support one of the entities the Company has adopted as part of its investment in the community. The selected initiative is funding of an installation of a solar roof in Kfar Ofarim, a home for autistic adults in Ramat Hasharon. The solar roof generates approx. 25,000 kWh annually, resulting in reduced consumption of electricity from the Israel Electric Corporation and reduction of the facility’s power consumption. The meter has been defined by the Israel Electric Corporation as a “net meter”, enabling the facility to save power consumption in the next 20 years. Improving energy efficiency: In every renovation or construction of a new building undertaken by Leumi Card, light bulbs are replaced with energy saving LEDs; a Virtualization Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) system that virtualizes 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 182 desktops across all computers in the organization has been installed; air conditioning and lighting are turned off at a certain time at the end of each workday; and controllers have been purchased to reduce energy consumption by lighting circuits. Fuel Consumption Most of Leumi Group's fuel consumption is made by its fleet of vehicles. In 2017, 2,896,553 liters of gasoline and 29,155 liters of diesel fuel were consumed. This figure represents a 43% year-on-year increase. This increase is attributed to the improvement in measurement and more extensive reporting; as of 2017, the report also includes data on gasoline consumption for all company-leased vehicles. Previously, only data on executives’ cars were reported. According to data adjusted to last year’s consumption figures, there was a 3% decrease in energy consumption. Initiatives to Reduce Fuel Consumption Shuttle service for employees: To save fuel and optimize employees’ transit between the headquarters and service centers located in Tel Aviv, Lod, and Bnei Brak Leumi contracted a transportation company to provide a regular shuttle service between the two sites. Transportation service for employees: Leumi offers employees roundtrip transportation to and from work. Bicycle parking and showers for cyclists: As part of the promotion of sustainable transport at Leumi, bicycle parking spaces were created at Bank Leumi headquarters in Tel Aviv and in the Leumi Service Campus in Lod (where Administration and Operations are located). Showers were also installed for employees who choose to come to work by bicycle and wish to freshen up after a morning’s ride. Some of Leumi’s employees indeed prefer to come to work by bicycle and give up fuel-consuming car travel. Use of energy efficient vehicles: As part of the Leumi Card's efforts to reduce its fuel consumption, during 2015-2017, fuel-efficient car models replaced some 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 183 of the Company's vehicles. This move led to an 8.6% savings in the Company's fuel consumption. Reducing the distance driven by employees: As part of its efforts to reduce the distance driven by employees, Leumi Card has set a limit on mileage covered during leisure time for employees using company vehicles. Under this procedure, the Company allows its employees a maximum of 2,000 km per month for driving during leisure time. If an employee exceeds this average, they are charged for the extra mileage. In addition, Leumi Card encourages employees to come to work by bicycle as well, and has installed dedicated parking spaces for this purpose. Carbon footprint As part of its environmental policy, and in addition to monitoring its resource consumption, the Group regularly calculates greenhouse gas emissions resulting from its activities (energy consumption, fuel combustion, distance traveled, etc.). Data is reported by Bank Leumi under several reporting platforms: the international reporting initiative Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection's voluntary Greenhouse Gas Emissions Registry in Israel, the annual Social Corporate Responsibility Report and the Maala rating. The systematic management of the issue relates to two main areas:  Direct emissions: In accordance with the reporting standard for greenhouse gas emissions, the Leumi Group's direct impact (Scope 1) of greenhouse gases stem mainly from the combustion of gasoline by the organization’s vehicle fleet, from the combustion of fuel by emergency generators, and from emissions of fire extinguishing gases. 40  Indirect emissions: The indirect emissions (Scope 2) stem from power consumption and depend on the composition of fuels and the technologies with which the electricity is produced. 40 GHG Protocol for quantifying and managing emissions: http://www.ghgprotocol.org/about-ghgp. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 184  Other indirect emissions: Indirect emissions (Scope 3) that are related to the organization's activity, but do not result from it. These emissions include, inter alia, the consumption of various products and services. The carbon footprint of the Leumi Group in 2017 was 47,629 tons of CO2eq. 41 This figure includes emissions for all three scopes for Bank Leumi and Scopes 1 and 2 for Leumi Card. In 2017, there was a 25% year-on-year increase in the carbon footprint. The reason for the increase is the report’s greater scope (see the report on fuel consumption) and a revision of the emissions coefficient by the reporting companies’ primary power supplier. Compared with last year’s adjusted reported consumption data, there was a 19.6% increase in the carbon footprint. About 83% of the electricity consumed by Leumi in 2017 was produced by independent power producers using efficient technologies and natural gas. 41 The carbon footprint components were calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Calculator of the Ministry of Environmental Protection in Israel, published in June 2017. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 185 Carbon Footprint Reduction As mentioned above, the Leumi Group invests significant efforts in identifying measures that would result in greater efficiency and energy savings that would have direct impact on the Group's carbon footprint and on climate change. These efforts are mainly reflected in steps such as the transition to using electricity produced by natural gas. Compared with 2016, there was an increase in Leumi and Leumi Card’s carbon footprint. As aforesaid, the increase is mainly due to the change in the primary power supplier’s emission coefficient. Compared with last year’s adjusted reported consumption data, there was a 21% increase in the carbon footprint intensity. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 186 Recycling and Responsible Disposal The Group's commitment to environmental protection includes responsible disposal of its waste.

Management is responsible for A. the preparation and the presentation of the report in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI-SRS”) as described in pages 210-222 of the Report, and the information and assertions contained within it B. for determining The Bank’s objectives in respect of sustainable development performance and reporting C. for establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management and internal control systems from which the information is derived, to be free from omissions and material misstatements whether due to fraud or error D. the identification of stakeholders and material issues for reporting. Our responsibility is to provide a limited assurance engagement and to express a conclusion based on the work performed. We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). That Standard requires that we comply with applicable ethical requirements, including independence requirements, and that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Report is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement, regarding data and information included in the corporate responsibility report, consists of making interviews and inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the report, and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate. These procedures included:  Examination of the material aspects in the report, for the purpose of performing a limited assurance, based on public information sources, knowledge of The Bank business and other comparative information of similar organizations.  Inquiries of management to gain an understanding regarding the material aspects to the stakeholders of Bank Leumi le-Israel B.M.  Interviews with senior management and relevant staff at The Bank group level and selected business unit level concerning corporate responsibility strategy and policies for specified parts, and the implementation of these across The Bank business. Somekh Chaikin, an Israeli partnership and a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity. 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report | 205  Interviews with relevant staff at The Bank corporate and business unit level responsible for providing the information in the Report.  Visits to The Bank’s sites in Tel-Aviv (Beit Leumi, Beit Meni, Beit Lin) and Bnei Brak, on the basis of a risk analysis including the consideration of both quantitative and qualitative criteria regarding the report.  Comparing the information regarding the material aspects presented in the Report to corresponding information in the relevant underlying sources to determine whether all the relevant information contained in such underlying sources has been included in the report.  Where relevant, conducting interviews regarding the calculation, aggregation and methods used to collect and report the information in the report.  Reading the information presented in the Report to determine whether it is in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the corporate responsibility performance of Bank Leumi leIsrael B.M. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope that a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to the evidence-gathering and review of supporting information procedures performed. As a result, the level of assurance obtained regarding the bank’s corporate responsibility report is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. We believe that the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. Conclusion Based on the limited assurance procedures performed and the evidence we have obtained, described in this report, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that Bank Leumi le-Israel B.M. 2017 Corporate Responsibility Report is not presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRISRS and The Bank’s reporting criteria. Our limited assurance report is made solely to Bank Leumi le-Israel B.M. in accordance with the terms of our engagement.
