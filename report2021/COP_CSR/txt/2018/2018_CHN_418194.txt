It is simply the right thing to do. As a professional service firm, we believe that the best way for us to contribute to our society is to leverage our professional expertise and network to foster good ESG practices. As such, we have been very supportive of sponsoring and participating in professional and public seminars, researches and studies, and public engagement on a variety of topics regarding ESG due diligence. MESSAGE FROM THE CEO Sustainability reporting is hardly foreign to us as we operate a sustainability consultancy business. Having said that, this is our very first year to prepare corporate sustainability report according to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, rolling up our sleeves to prepare our own sustainability report certainly takes sustainability development of our company to another level. “Goodness is the only investment that never fails.” During our report preparation, we acquired valuable market insights, which can be readily turned into profit through better risk management and strategic alignment. Sustainability reporting allows us to evaluate our position, rethink and map issues that are material to us or impacted by us, reconnect with our stakeholders by understanding their concerns, report on the concerned issues, and realign our business strategy. The process of preparing our own sustainability report puts our corporate core values into practice and allowing us to go beyond perceptible changes that a corporate restructuring can create. It is a worthwhile perusal for corporations in all sizes, from SMEs to multinational corporations. While we are enjoying some immediate benefits, fruits of sustainability reporting are yet to come. After all, sustainability is a long-term mindset. I look forward to updating you more about our success in discharging our social responsibilities in the years to come, and I hope you enjoy exploring the report.
