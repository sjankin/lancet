We endeavor to create the unchanging value of improving people’s health worldwide and continue to provide the value to society. *Nutraceuticals=nutrition + pharmaceuticals Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 02 The DNA of Otsuka Generates About Otsuka Holdings Innovative Products From Tokushima to the World The Otsuka group will soon celebrate the 100th anniversary. The DNA of our group, cultivated ceaselessly over the years, is connected to the challenges that the group undertakes in all of our businesses. We share our unwavering corporate philosophy of “Otsuka-people creating new products for better health worldwide” with all our employees around the world and are continuing to create and provide new values to the world to this day. Otsuka’s Goal and Business Strategy Business Results Chemical Raw Materials from Bittern, the Salt Pan Residues A Global Company Started in Tokushima CSR and Governance The origin of the Otsuka group goes back to 1921, when Busaburo Otsuka, the founder of the Otsuka group, established Otsuka Seiyaku Kogyo-bu in Naruto, Tokushima Prefecture. The Company had just ten employees, when it started as a chemical raw material manufacturer, making magnesium carbonate from the resiFinance and General Information dues (called “bittern”) left over after taking the salt out of seawater by the salt-production industry that was widespread in Tokushima back then. In the Meiji period (1868-1912), Tokushima was one of Japan’s ten largest cities. In addition to Japan’s largest indigo dye industry, the city boasted secondary industries such as pharmaceutical and salt productions. It also had prosperous agriculture, forestry, and fishing industries that reaped the bounty of nature. With the modernization of Japan at that time, entrepreneurial businesses began to spring up all over the country. In the Seto Inland Sea Coast area, an industry that made effective use of bittern from the area’s natural salt pans emerged, and many companies in Tokushima participated in the industry. Our group was also founded on that trend, which marked the beginning of a global company today operating in 28 countries and regions with 46,000 employees worldwide. 03 Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 Creation through Paradigm Shifts The Giant Tomato Tree in Our Birthplace The Human Resource Development Institute, the training center for employees located in Tokushima, Japan, has several monuments depicting Sozosei (creativity), a concept that lies at the root of our group’s corporate philosophy. One of them is the Giant Tomato Tree. Whereas a normal tomato plant yields only about 50 to 60 fruits, our tomato tree puts forth around 10,000. The secret behind this lies in a paradigm shift. We abandoned the preconception that, “since tomato plants grow in soil, soil is essential.” This enabled us to set the tomato plant’s roots free from soil, using hydroponic cultivation instead. By drawing out the fecundity of the tomato tree, it yielded an amount of fruit that no one had considered possible. Our Giant Tomato Tree and other monuments break through preconceptions and speak to the importance of paradigm shifts, while also communicating the message that we need to remain as a company brimming with creativity. Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 04 About Otsuka Holdings Otsuka’s Goal and Business Strategy Business Results Never-give-up R&D A Drug developed Over 26 years of Effort Brings Hope to Renal Disease Treatment CSR and Governance For us, the DNA of our group is found not only in displaying the creativity to do what others do not, but also in our stance of challenging what we believe correct over a long period of time with never-give-up spirit. A demonstration of this is Samsca/JINARC*/JYNARQUE**, a V2-receptor antagonist that has grown into a core product of the Otsuka group. This drug discovery project began in 1983 with a physician’s request: Finance and General Information “I want a diuretic that excretes only water.” Following 26 years of persistent research, the project came to fruition in 2009 with the launch of an aquaretic agent Samsca. For a typical company, closing down a drug discovery project extending to 26 years midway would be no great surprise. But the Otsuka group’s commitment to actualize our corporate philosophy—“Otsuka-people creating new products for better health worldwide”—led to continuation of the research and development, and eventually the development of the product. Following the launch, we have expanded the indications of Samsca/JINARC/JYNARQUE to the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a disease that did not have any curative medicines. Our never-give-up R&D has opened a new path to the treatment of an intractable kidney disease. *Brand name for ADPKD treatment in multiple regions outside Japan **Brand name for ADPKD treatment in the U.S. 05 Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd.

INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 Message from the President Delivering Next-generation Total Healthcare to the World An Enduring Corporate Philosophy and Value Creation for Further Leaps Forward The Business Contributing to People’s Health Worldwide Environment and In the healthcare field changes are occurring constantly. Due to facOur Goal tors such as the ageing of populations, changing patterns of disease prevalence, and earlier diagnoses, and the accompanying increase in demand for medicines, the global pharmaceutical market has continued to grow and is now valued at more than one trillion U.S. dollars. Competition for scale and growth is also intensifying, reflected by the frequency of mergers and acquisitions and the often-related industry restructurings. Also, escalating research and development costs necessitate huge investment, encouraging risk-sharing alliances. Simultaneously, measures to control and optimize medical costs are expanding in the U.S. and many other countries, with the aim of curbing increasing drug costs. A big wave of technological innovation has extended to the healthcare sector. Companies are utilizing the latest technologies, including big data analysis and artificial intelligence, for drug discovery and development. This has led to rising expectations of medical breakthroughs, such as development of new drugs for previously untreatable conditions. As a result, we are seeing improving healthcare outcomes in Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 18 About Otsuka Holdings Otsuka’s Goal and Business Strategy Business Results Tatsuo Higuchi President and Representative Director, CEO CSR and Governance different diseases and geographies around the world. As the healthcare sector approaches these major inflection points, we constantly ask ourselves what we need to do to contribute and to thrive in this environment. And the answer is simple—unwavering goals and continued innovations. Since its foundation, the group has maintained an unwavering commitment to its corporate philosophy—“Otsuka-people creating new products for better health worldwide.” Guided by this philosophy, we have constantly pursued what only we can achieve, ideally pre-anticipatFinance and General Information ing changes in the business environment, and when that is not possible, responding flexibly and swiftly to the changes. Seeking to meet the universal aspiration of people around the world to be healthy, we regard healthcare as a whole-body domain, and our activities are based on two pillars: the pharmaceutical business, which extends from the diagnosis of diseases through to treatment, and the nutraceutical business, which helps people maintain and improve dayto-day health. Walking alongside customers to identify and meet their healthcare needs, we have introduced innovative products and services that have created markets that previously did not exist. 19 Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 Message from the President Otsuka’s Business Contributing to people’s health through Model pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals In recent years many pharmaceutical companies, based on a business review and concentration strategy, increasingly have focused on areas that require deep and specific expertise. For example, some emphasize new drug development in areas such as oncology while others are dedicated to generic drugs in emerging economies. Amid such trends, why did the Otsuka group boldly choose a business portfolio encompassing both pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals? It is not that these two areas of health are unrelated to each other; in fact, they are as closely related as the two sides of a coin. Through these two businesses, we can contribute to the health of “all” people, and this is the most compelling reason why we have built a portfolio covering both. Second, we apply the exacting scientific standards that apply in our prescription drug business to our development of new nutraceutical products and to our evaluation of their health benefits. This assures our customers that the standards underpinning our products are highly credible. The creation of products for the treatment and prevention of diseases, as well as for the maintenance and improvement of health, is precisely the role of the Otsuka group of companies. Once we have fulfilled it, we will be far advanced toward our ultimate goal, which is to become an indispensable contributor to people’s health worldwide. Furthermore, there is a positive momentum to spur to our strategy. Healthcare increasingly is about not only curing diseases but also about maintaining and improving everyday health. This trend is anticipated to eventually improve quality of life and extend healthy life expectancy. Accordingly, products and services with the themes of maintaining and improving health are showing excellent growth. By developing our pharmaceutical and nutraceutical businesses, we can build a resilient portfolio and a business structure conducive to sustainable growth. Pharmaceuticals is a higher-risk, higher-return business. If our R&D succeeds, we can look forward to commensurate returns once products are launched. On the other hand, multiple factors can adversely affect our earnings. These include expiration of drug patents and government measures to reduce and optimize medical costs, exemplified by the lowering of drug prices in Japan. In contrast, nutraceuticals is a medium-risk, medium-return business. Although we cannot expect profits margins akin to the pharmaceutical business, we can build a stable, long-term earnings foundation if we are able to provide added value through innovative products while continuing to invest in a solid brand image. In order to achieve sustainable growth, a company must lay the foundation for it and we believe that having a diversified business portfolio gives us strength to do so. Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 20 About Otsuka Holdings The Otsuka group has a long and proud history and will soon celebrate the 100th anniversary of our founding. At this point in time, the pharmaceutical business is our main growth driver. In the 1990s, however, our nutraceutical business was larger in scale. Without the nutraceutical Otsuka’s Goal and Business Strategy business, our R&D efforts, resulting in multiple drugs that are current growth drivers, would not have succeeded. DNA and Core Beliefs inherited since our foundation Competency From our foundation in 1921 to the present, based on enduring principles, Otsuka has always been committed to manufacturing innovative and creative products that contribute to the health of the people around the world. In our quest to create and deliver new value, we ask ourselves the key questions: What are the things that only we can Business Results achieve? Are we pursuing an innovative approach without being captive to existing concepts and notions? Do our products appeal to consumers, patients and healthcare providers around the world? Are we contributing to an improvement in people’s health? Whenever we encounter difficulties, we return to the enduring prinRyukan godo A calligraphic work by Otsuka founder, ciples implicit in our corporate philosophy and pursue our business withBusaburo Otsuka out wavering from our goals. This is how we have succeeded. Take POCARI SWEAT as an example. Here, we have consistently conveyed the concept of a “rehydration drink” that enables people to easily replenish fluids and electrolytes lost through perspiration. Over a period of time, this led to the creation of a new market for ion drinks and CSR and Governance the establishment of our brand. The growth of POCARI SWEAT is not the result of short-term factors and trends but proof of the correctness of decisions and actions based on our corporate philosophy. We have inherited the three elements of Otsuka’s DNA passed down by three past generations of Otsuka family leaders—Ryukan godo (by POCARI SWEAT created the market for ion drinks sweat we recognize the way), Jissho (actualization), and Sozosei (creativity). Ryukan godo means the core substance of something that can be discovered only through hard work and practice. Jissho is self-actualization through achievement, completion, and the discovery of truth. Sozosei, or “creativity,” epitomizes Otsuka’s corporate culture. Finance and General Information Today, we are a corporate group with consolidated net sales of nearly USD 11 billion. The aforementioned three terms that have been passed down by Otsuka’s family leaders, together with our venture spirit implicit in our corporate philosophy, are shared with each and every employee, and deeply penetrate our organization and systems as unchanging values that govern our daily business activities. 21 Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 Message from the President Becoming an Diversified Human Resources Drive Indispensable Company Business Growth What else is required for the Osaka group to become an indispensable contributor to people’s health worldwide? The answers lie in “human resources” and “innovation.” Using these two elements as a driving force, while applying knowledge and technologies accumulated to date, fosters a harmonious environment for product creation. When this happens, innovative products are born—products help us address health issues and achieve sustainability. The Otsuka group comprises employees with diverse backgrounds. We encourage them to learn our corporate culture and share Otsuka values, which emphasize creativity, then we foster and promote them as appropriate. At present, the Otsuka group has around 46,000 employees across 28 countries and regions, with employees outside of Japan representing approximately 60% of our workforce. By accepting and sharing different languages, cultures, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, we create a flexible and open-minded corporate culture that can respond appropriately to the diversification of social needs and the globalization of our business. Among various initiatives, at the end of 2017 Otsuka became a signatory to the Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs)*, a set of action principles to guide companies seeking to foster the advancement of women. We will continue strengthening our organization by promoting the advancement of women. Developing human resources as next-generation leaders is an important management priority for sustaining the group’s growth and increasing its value as an innovative organization. The Otsuka group undertakes a wide range of human resource development programs. These include opportunities for employees to learn corporate culture, to share values that emphasize creativity together with management, and to study abroad. The mental and physical health of each employee is also essential to achieve sustainable growth, and providing a healthy and supportive work environment is key to this endeavor. In April 2017, we issued the Otsuka Group Declaration on Health. In line with this, we strive to create a work environment where employees can exercise their full abilities and display their originality, promote health of employees, and enhance our organizational strength. * Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) is a set of action principles prepared jointly by the United Nations Global Compact and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.

In the pharmaceutical business, we developed a drug tablet embedded with microchip—the world’s first digital medicine which integrates a pharmaceutical and a medical device. By recording ingestion of the medication, the aim is to advance the care that can be offered to patients with schizophrenia. We also developed one of only two new therapeutic agents in the past 50 years for the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), which has become a serious health problem in some countries. In the nutraceutical business, meanwhile, we utilize both our new and in-line assets, cultivated through experience and achievements to date, Business Results to create various new innovations. These include a food product containing soybean-derived equol, resulting from R&D on women’s health, and Our Giant Tomato Tree symbolizes the nutritious foods that aim to help extend healthy life expectancy. importance of paradigm shifts, necessitating the abandonment of preconceptions Through a diversified workforce and the valuable perspectives they contribute, the company can create sustainable value together with local communities, accumulate assets, and repeat a cycle of virtuous innovation that also returns a portion of profits to society.

The plan’s emphasis is on investment for sustainable growth, Management Plan4P.25 structural reforms aimed at revenue diversification, and reinforcement of core therapeutic franchises in the pharmaceutical business and the pursuit of transformation and structural reform in the nutraceutical business. Finance and General Information In fiscal 2017, the fourth year of the plan, according to schedule, we posted healthy increases in sales of new pharmaceutical products and invested aggressively in R&D with a view to our next medium-term management plan. We also entered numerous transactions, including business acquisitions, alliances, and licensing agreements, as set out in the current plan. We achieved year-on-year increases in revenue and profit and continued on a solid growth path. In the pharmaceutical business, we posted steady increases in sales of three products marketed in many countries. ABILIFY 23 Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 Message from the President MAINTENA, a long-acting injectable antipsychotic of ABILIFY; the new antipsychotic agent REXULTI; and Samsca/JINARC, an aquaretic agent with several indications such as cardiac edema and also as a treatment for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) —while sales of the anti-cancer agent LONSURF in Europe greatly exceeded initial targets. Thanks to growth in these new products, we solidified our business foundation. We further reinforced the group’s business foundation with regulatory approvals in the U.S. for two products: Abilify MyCite, the first-ever digital medicine and JYNARQUE for the treatment of the inherited kidney disease ADPKD. With respect to product development, we obtained the rights to centanafadine, for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), through our acquisition of Neurovance. We also formed an agreement covering Japan with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for fremanezumab, for the prevention of migraine. In addition, we expanded the geographic coverage of our collaboration with Akebia Therapeutics for the joint development and marketing of vadadustat, a treatment for renal anemia. In these ways, we laid many cornerstones for our next stage of growth. In the nutraceutical business, we reported solid performance, posting steady growth for existing products, while expanding our portfolio to boost synergies. Specifically, in the U.S. we posted healthy growth in the nutritional supplements businesses of Pharmavite and FoodState, while in Europe Nutrition & Santé performed steadily under difficult economic conditions. To further expedite global expansion, we acquired Daiya Foods, which develops, manufactures, and markets plant-based foods in North America, and we launched EQUELLE in the U.S. to support women’s health. In Japan, we fostered new products that parallel our global expansion efforts. Highlights included the launch of BODYMAINTÉ, a new brand of conditioning food to support athletic performance. As a result, the nutraceuticals business achieved an operating margin of 12%, maintaining the 10% or higher numerical target of our medium-term management plan. Fiscal 2018, the final year of the Second Medium-Term Management Plan, will be a year for continuing the diversification of our revenue structure. When the plan was launched, the antipsychotic agent ABILIFY accounted for around 40% of total net sales, and our challenge was to secure other sources of revenue. Since then, however, we steadily implemented the priority measures of the plan, and thanks to growth in each core field, we are achieving revenue diversification. However, some initiatives have been insufficient and some targets remain unattained. To address these issues, we will again formulate and execute strategies according to our corporate philosophy, in our quest to further increase corporate value. Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd.
