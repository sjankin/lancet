And why. No company in the world has a greater or more varied repertory of talent. 203,000 people work for WPP companies. Between them, they offer more than 80 distinct skills on which our clients can draw. They can do figures and they can do fantasy. They can learn from the past to make sense of the future. They can buy time and space with a heavyweight’s efficiency and they can fill that time and space with a storyteller’s delicacy. No two clients are alike, so the task of client management is both complex and simple. You need first to understand each client’s needs: in depth and in detail. And then you need to know which of those 80-something skills – working in harmony and ignoring traditional divisions – will best meet those needs. The management skill lies in the tailored application of talent to task. Because it disdains the vertical silos that can deter liberated collaboration, we call it horizontality. • 4 WPP Annual Report 2017 5 WPP Annual Report 2017 What we do Media Data Investment Investment Advertising Management Management Client Teams Country and Regional Managers Digital transformation, ecommerce and shopper Production management Shared services 6 WPP Annual Report 2017 Specialist Communications Public Relations Brand Health (including digital, & Public Affairs Consulting & Wellness direct and interactive) 7 WPP Annual Report 2017 Where we are WPP companies operate in 112 countries.

Modern slavery Respect for human rights is a fundamental principle for WPP. We do not tolerate any form of modern slavery in our business or supply chain. We have assessed the risk of modern slavery for WPP. This found that the risk of modern slavery occurring in our operations is very low. As part of our due diligence processes we have also assessed the risk of modern slavery amongst our preferred suppliers in nine categories. This showed that almost 90% of our spend with preferred supplier partners is in mediumor low-risk categories for modern slavery such as HR and professional services. Higher risk categories include facilities and promotional goods suppliers.

Afterwards, he offered to drive me back to my office. I protested – my office was no more than 10 minutes’ walk away – but Len insisted. And when we got to his car, I understood why. It was a shining, stunning, elegant, arrogant, latest-model Aston Martin. It was the first time I’d been inside an Aston Martin and it didn’t disappoint. “You may be interested to know why I bought this car,” said Len. “I bought it because I saw an advertisement for it.” “Well, fancy that,” I said. “But that’s not the interesting bit,” said Len. “What’s interesting is that I saw that advertisement when I was 14.” > *** 63 WPP Annual Report 2017 The annual essay A 20th Century Lesson for 21st Century Brands I’ve never tried to track that advertisement down but I For an advertisement to have enough potency to generate don’t feel the need to. We can know with some confidence a £50,000 sale 30 years later, we can be certain of much a great deal about it: not only what it was like but what it more.

Its intention would have been to reinforce brake horsepower and its powers of acceleration and any the facts and feelings about Aston Martin that already other factual aspects of its competitive performance that existed; to increase its wantability; and so to sell as many could be expressed in hard, verifiable numbers.

Advertising’s evangelists have long wanted advertising to be recognised not as a cost but as an investment. And it’s true that it can be. That Aston Martin advertisement was delivering a return 30 years after it had first appeared. A bold claim, certainly; and one impossible to quantify; but no one in marketing can doubt its truth. Not all advertisements, however, have such investment value. A price promotion advertisement, for example, will contribute nothing to the worth of the brand; indeed, it may actually devalue it. Online advertising can be exceptionally effective at triggering immediate action; but research studies reveal it to be far less effective than traditional mass media at building and nourishing brands over time; though not, it’s important to emphasise, at the expense of immediate sales. 64 WPP Annual Report 2017 The growth of short-termism in marketing has been well-documented.

Copies available from thinkbox.tv. a small degree of artistry Over 60 years ago, David Ogilvy wrote: “Every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the complex symbol which is the brand image.” Please note: every advertisement. Properly conceived, every advertisement should be an investment in the value of the brand. But too many advertisements, and increasingly so, seem content to be no more than impersonal sales pitches. It costs no more to be consistently true to the voice of your brand and it greatly increases the value of your marketing investment. All it demands is diligence – and a small degree of artistry. Nobody questions the necessity of capital expenditure in the protection of a company’s tangible assets. For many companies, their most valuable assets are classified as intangible: their consumer brands. And that intangibility, if it is to be preserved – and quite as much as plant and machinery – needs regular, budgeted maintenance. It needs the protection and regular nourishment that only singular brand communications can deliver. All advertisements, however modestly, should strive for the Aston Martin effect. Astonishingly, it’s free. • 65 WPP Annual Report 2017 66 WPP Annual Report 2017 Who runs WPP Board of Directors Executive Chairman Board analysis (all directors) Roberto Quarta Tenure Chairman of the Nomination and Governance Committee Member of the Compensation Committee 0–3 years 18% 4–6 years 55% Executive Director 7+ years 27% Paul Richardson Group Finance Director Non-Executive Directors Gender Jacques Aigrain Nicole Seligman Chairman of the Audit Committee Senior Independent Director Female 27% Member of the Compensation Member of the Compensation Male 73% Committee Committee Member of the Nomination Tarek Farahat and Governance Committee Member of the Audit Committee Hugo Shong Sir John Hood Member of the Nomination Chairman of the Compensation and Governance Committee Committee Nationality Sally Susman Ruigang Li Member of the Nomination UK/ Brazil/ Member of the Nomination US 1 Egypt 1 and Governance Committee and Governance Committee Italy/ New Zealand 1 Solomon D.

At the Board level, we have worked with the executive team to accelerate the development of senior female leaders and to monitor the pipeline of female talent. The Company’s UK Gender Pay Gap Report was reviewed by the Board. Although it revealed a gender pay gap below the national average, it highlighted the need for further, faster change in the profile of the operating companies’ leadership teams, and we support the initiatives the Company has put in place to achieve that change. On the Board itself we have excellent diversity in terms of nationality, with nine countries represented, but we still have work to do on gender balance. Charlene Begley’s departure from the Board last year meant the proportion of women on the Board fell to 25% as at 31 December 2017. As we actively review Board composition we are seeking to improve this statistic, and diversity of all kinds, without increasing the size of the Board. 82 WPP Annual Report 2017 Review of the Company’s governance and the Nomination and Governance Committee Report by Roberto Quarta During 2017, the Senior Independent Director agreed role descriptions for different succession scenarios, based Chairman of the Nomination on the views of all of the Non-Executive Directors and and Governance Committee the Executive Directors.

There has been no change in base salary over 2017 and the differences between the 2017 and 2016 values is because of a change in exchange rates. 3 The benefits, and therefore total annual compensation, set out in the table above exclude the disclosable value of expenses related directly to attendance at Board meetings that would be chargeable to UK income tax. The expenses were for Sir Martin Sorrell £4,492 (£2,578 in 2016) and Paul Richardson £8,307 (£13,826 in 2016). Details of benefits are set out on page 94. 4 Sir Martin Sorrell receives payments in accordance with the approval granted by share owners of amounts equal to the dividends that would be payable during 2017 totalling £2,169,831 (£1,757,739 during 2016), in respect of the shares reflected in the UK and US Deferred Stock Units Awards Agreements, these agreements that now comprise the awards granted under the Capital Investment Plan in 1995. 2017 is the final year in which such payments will be made. 5 This is the aggregate amount awarded for the 2016 financial years’ performance.

Therefore, the amounts included in the table above represent six months under the old policy at 40% of base salary and six months under the new policy at 30% of base salary. There was no change for Paul Richardson. 94 WPP Annual Report 2017 Variable elements of pay The purpose of the short-term and long-term incentives is to drive the achievement or the Group’s business and strategic priorities and maximise alignment with share owner interests. The performance measures used in the incentive plans are linked to the Group’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as outlined on page 32 in the strategic report.

Financial control Demonstrating measures taken to improve operating company balance sheet control and management. The Committee acknowledges that good progress has been made against the Executive Directors’ strategic objectives. WPP achieved first position at both Cannes 2017 and the Effies 2017, as well as making some strategically positive movements in terms of acquisitions during the year. Typically, such strong strategic performance would warrant a portion of the short-term incentive to be paid out. However, in view of the financial performance for the year, the Committee has used its discretion and determined that it would be inappropriate to award a bonus for 2017. 96 WPP Annual Report 2017 Short-term incentive weightings and measures for 2018 The Committee has reviewed the performance objectives for 2018 to ensure continued alignment with Company strategy. The Group financial measures of headline PBT growth, revenue less pass-through costs margin improvement and revenue less pass-through costs growth will remain the same. Further detail will be provided in next year’s Annual Report. The Committee is of the view that the targets for the STIP are commercially sensitive and it would be detrimental to the Company to disclose them in advance of or during the relevant performance period. To the extent targets are no longer commercially sensitive they will be disclosed at the end of the relevant performance period in that year’s Annual Report, as we have done in previous years.

The EPSP replaced the Leadership Equity Acquisition Plan (LEAP) and was designed to take account of share owner views gained during an extensive consultation process. Vesting of the 2013 EPSP awards was dependent on performance against three measures, all assessed over a five-year performance period: •• WPP’s relative TSR measured in common and local currency, against a custom group of WPP’s comparators (Dentsu, GfK, Havas, Interpublic, Ipsos, Nielsen, Omnicom and Publicis), weighted by their respective market capitalisation. •••• Compound annual growth rate of diluted headline EPS. Average annual ROE. Over the five-year performance period: ••WPP’s TSR outperformed 63% of the weighted peer group on a common currency basis resulting in vesting of 46% of the maximum for that element. ••WPP’s TSR outperformed 77% of the weighted peer group on a local currency basis resulting in vesting of 73% of the maximum for that element. ••The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in headline diluted EPS was 10.40%, which was between the threshold and maximum targets, resulting in a vesting of 59% of maximum for that element. ••The Group delivered strong ROE over the five-year performance period of 15.75%, resulting in vesting at maximum for that element. In aggregate, WPP’s performance against the three measures resulted in an overall achievement level of 72.8% of the maximum award. 97 WPP Annual Report 2017 How we behave and how we're rewarded Compensation Committee Report 2013 EPSP award performance achievement % of maximum Performance measures Weighting Threshold Maximum Actual achieved Relative TSR (common currency) Between median 46% 50% of weighted peer 90% of weighted peer and upper decile 1/3 Relative TSR (local currency) group outperformed group outperformed Between median 73% and upper decile Headline diluted EPS (CAGR) 1/3 7.0% 14.0% 10.40% 59% Average annual ROE 1/3 10.0% 14.0% 15.75% 100% Total vesting (% of maximum) 72.8% Value of vested Number Additional shares 2013-2017 of shares in respect of Number of Share price EPSP awards awarded dividend accrual shares vesting on vesting 000 Sir Martin Sorrell 1,032,540 147,003 858,730 £11.6554 £10,009 Paul Richardson1 52,026 7,478 43,320 $81.0566 $ 3,511 1 Paul Richardson’s 2013 EPSP was granted in the form of ADRs. 98 WPP Annual Report 2017 2017 EPSP awards granted In 2017, the Executive Directors, along with a select number of senior executives within the Group, were granted awards under the EPSP. The 2017 awards for Executive Directors were granted at the lower level approved by share owners in the latest compensation policy. The 2017 awards are subject to three equally-weighted independent performance conditions, being relative TSR, EPS and ROE. The table below summarises the awards granted and the performance conditions against which participants will be measured.

As in previous years, WPP’s TSR performance is compared to companies representing our most relevant, listed global competitors, weighted by market capitalisation. For 2017 EPSP awards, the comparator group comprised Dentsu, GfK, Havas, Interpublic, Ipsos, Nielsen, Omnicom and Publicis. GfK and Havas, two of the comparator companies, have been taken over since the start of the performance period by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Vivendi, respectively. In line with the guidelines previously established by the Committee, the two companies will be removed from the comparator group as neither will be listed for more than 40% of the eventual performance period. TSR performance is calculated on a market capitalisation-weighted basis in both common and local currency (weighted equally). Using a dual basis ensures that the interests of both local and international investors are reflected in the performance measures. EPSP measures and targets for 2018–2022 The Committee is reviewing both the measures and the targets as part of its regular annual review. If the Committee determines that changes are required, major share owners will be consulted prior to awards being made later in 2018. 99 WPP Annual Report 2017 How we behave and how we're rewarded Compensation Committee Report Aligning pay and performance As set out in the Directors’ Compensation Policy, the Committee’s objective is to align variable compensation with the key strategic priorities of WPP, maximising the dynamic between pay and performance. This dynamic is contingent upon the Committee setting challenging targets each year.

The taxable benefits of the Group Chief Executive have reduced due to the application of the new benefits policy. The taxable benefits of employees has increased in line with inflation. The rationale for the decrease in the Group Chief Executive’s bonus is detailed on page 96.

The annual bonus data for the Group Chief Executive uses the short-term incentive figures set out on page 95. 2 Taking into account the worldwide structure and size of the Group, and given the need to calculate benefits on the basis that an individual is resident in the UK for tax purposes, collating data on all employees was not practicable.

Deferred tax The Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the end of each period in accordance with IAS 12 Income taxes. The recognition of deferred tax assets is determined by reference to the Group’s estimate of recoverability, using models where appropriate to forecast future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets have only been recognised for territories where the Group considers that it is probable there would be sufficient taxable profits for the future deductions to be utilised. Based on available evidence, both positive and negative, we determine whether it is probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realised. The main factors that we consider include: –– the future earnings potential determined through the use –– the history of losses carried forward and other tax assets expiring; of internal forecasts; –– the timing of future reversal of taxable temporary differences; –– the cumulative losses in recent years; –– the expiry period associated with the deferred tax assets; and –– the various jurisdictions in which the potential deferred tax assets arise; –– the nature of the income that can be used to realise the deferred tax asset. If it is probable that some portion of these assets will not be realised, then no asset is recognised in relation to that portion. If market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations, our existing recognised deferred tax assets may be adjusted, resulting in future tax benefits. Alternatively, if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected, future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realisable. As a result, all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may need to be reversed. Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset as they relate to the same tax group. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: As As Gross Offset reported Gross Offset reported 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 £m £m £m £m £m £m Deferred tax assets 411.8 (251.5) 160.3 598.0 (457.6) 140.4 Deferred tax liabilities (765.2) 251.5 (513.7) (1,150.0) 457.6 (692.4) (353.4) – (353.4) (552.0) – (552.0) The following are the major gross deferred tax assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon in 2017 and 2016: Accounting Retirement Property, Other Deferred provisions benefit plant & Tax losses Share-based Restructuring temporary compensation & accruals obligations equipment & credits payments provisions differences Total £m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m 1 January 2016 41.9 49.5 91.0 44.7 71.3 78.8 16.9 16.6 410.7 Acquisition of subsidiaries – 7.1 – – – 0.2 – 15.0 22.3 Credit/(charge) to income 39.5 8.5 28.3 19.2 6.2 (1.8) (11.7) 7.7 95.9 Credit to other comprehensive income – – 1.8 – – – – – 1.8 Charge to equity – – – – – (15.0) – – (15.0) Exchange differences 14.2 15.5 20.3 6.9 12.2 13.6 0.7 (1.1) 82.3 31 December 2016 95.6 80.6 141.4 70.8 89.7 75.8 5.9 38.2 598.0 Acquisition of subsidiaries – – – – – – – 2.6 2.6 (Charge)/credit to income (5.5) 6.6 (10.2) 6.9 (34.4) (0.4) (1.5) (21.7) (60.2) Impact of US tax reform (30.8) (8.1) (29.1) (6.8) 23.1 (10.9) 1.6 (1.1) (62.1) Charge to other comprehensive income – – (20.9) – – – – – (20.9) Charge to equity – – – – – (27.3) – – (27.3) Exchange differences (5.8) 5.8 (5.6) (2.5) (5.7) (4.2) (0.2) (0.1) (18.3) 31 December 2017 53.5 84.9 75.6 68.4 72.7 33.0 5.8 17.9 411.8 Other temporary differences comprise a number of items including tax deductible goodwill, none of which is individually significant to the Group’s consolidated balance sheet.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of the tax benefit of £1,539.3 million (2016: £1,104.4 million) of such tax losses and other temporary differences. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £3,169.9 million (2016: £4,048.8 million) of losses and other temporary differences as the Group considers that there will not be enough taxable profits in the entities concerned such that any additional asset could be considered recoverable. Included in the total unrecognised temporary differences are losses of £33.4 million that will expire within 1–10 years, and £2,945.2 million of losses that may be carried forward indefinitely. At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of the temporary differences in relation to the investment in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £3,898.0 million (2016: £3,270.8 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and the Group considers that it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 16.

This gain resulted from a £9.9 million 25. Financial instruments loss on hedging instruments and a £12.7 million gain on hedged items. Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows and the exchange risk arising on translation of the Group’s investments in foreign operations. The Group is a party to a variety of foreign currency derivatives in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group’s principal markets. The Group designates its foreign currency-denominated debt as hedging instruments against the currency risk associated with the translation of its foreign operations. During 2017, the Group held no currency derivatives designated as hedges. At the balance sheet date, the total nominal amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedges was £177.7 million (2016: £122.0 million). The Group estimates the fair value of these contracts to be a net liability of £2.5 million (2016: net asset of £0.1 million).

Acquisitions The Group accounts for acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations. IFRS 3 requires the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities (other than non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale) to be recognised at fair value at acquisition date. In assessing fair value at acquisition date, management make their best estimate of the likely outcome where the fair value of an asset or liability may be contingent on a future event. In certain instances, the underlying transaction giving rise to an estimate may not be resolved until some years after the acquisition date. IFRS 3 requires the release to profit of any acquisition reserves which subsequently become excess in the same way as any excess costs over those provided at acquisition date are charged to profit. At each period end management assess provisions and other balances established in respect of acquisitions for their continued probability of occurrence and amend the relevant value accordingly through the consolidated income statement or as an adjustment to goodwill as appropriate under IFRS 3. The Group acquired a number of subsidiaries in the year. The following table sets out the book values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and their fair value to the Group. The fair value adjustments for certain acquisitions have been determined provisionally at the balance sheet date.

Goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes is £63.9 million. Non-controlling interests in acquired companies are measured at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The contribution to revenue and operating profit of acquisitions completed in the year was not material. There were no material acquisitions completed between 31 December 2017 and the date the financial statements have been authorised for issue. 156 WPP Annual Report 2017 29.

The Group’s Media Investment Management sub-sector is increasingly buying digital media for its own account on a transparent opt-in basis and, as a result, the subsequent media pass-through costs have to be accounted for as revenue, as well as billings. In addition, the Data Investment Management sector, which forms a significant part of the Group’s revenue and in which none of the Group’s direct competitors are present, includes pass-through costs, principally for data collection.
