All our financial goals were met and operating profit amounted to SEK 2.4 billion with an improved operating margin of 4.8 percent. The record high level of orders received totaled over SEK 45.2 billion, which gave us an order backlog of SEK 38.5 billion at the end of the year. Even better, the positive The operative operating margin development was reflected in all the four business areas. The contract operations in improved to 4.8 percent compared Construction and Civil Engineering continued to deliver stable results and there were to 4.5 percent in 2016. substantial margin improvements in the more capital intensive Industry and Project Development business areas. On top of that we had a strong cash flow and low net debt and can conclude that our financial position provides us with a solid platform for the future. STABLE MARKET PROSPECTS With a strong economy, low interest rates and a growing population market prospects appear stable for both other building construction and civil engineering in Peab’s markets. Housing construction is expected to roll back from the current heights in Sweden and Norway while an increase is expected in Finland. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 3 Comments from the CEO HOUSING MARKET A surplus of houses in a higher price bracket has occurred in some sections of the market which, together with more stringent requirements for financing homes, has “Our business model with led to longer sales processes. Peab develops and builds housing all over Sweden four cooperating business and in large parts of Norway and Finland. Our homes are primarily in the mid-priced areas creates opportunities segment and we see that there is still a big need for new housing in this range. throughout the entire value chain in our projects.” A SOUND INDUSTRY A major challenge and success factor in both the short and long run is handling the Construction resource and competence shortage the industry struggles with. Our stance is that both Swedish and foreign labor is needed to handle the situation. At the same time there should be no doubt as to what rules apply. Healthy competition on equal terms is crucial to creating a construction industry in Sweden that has the long-term capacity 15,000 employees to sustainably deliver whatever products are in demand. Project welded together in Civil Development Engineering a strong company RECRUITING COMPETENCE culture It is important to create the conditions needed to broaden our recruitment base and make the industry more attractive. In November 2017 we, together with trade colleagues, signed a statement of intent and thereby took a shared stand for zero tolerance Industry regarding harassment and abuse in the industry. This was an important signal that we are serious about creating a sound, safe and attractive industry. Peab has been working actively for a long time with these matters in order to both attract new employees and keep the ones we have. Among other things, we have a comprehensive internal education program on equal treatment and good and fair workplaces to reinforce an inclusive culture that welcomes everyone. This has led to broad support for these vital issues and also contributed to the fact that we continue to attract more women to our company. A good example of a concrete investment that also increases the recruitment pool in Sweden is Peab School’s three year upper secondary construction and civil engineering program. The so-called 100 club is another important initiative that makes use of the new expertise arriving in Sweden. Our ambition is, by the end of 2018, to offer internships to 100 newly arrived immigrants in Sweden as a path to integration. RESPONSIBLE ENTREPRENEURSHIP Peab runs the business responsibly based on the UN Global Compact, our core values, business concept, vision, strategic goals and Code of Conduct, which was updated in 2017 under the concept Fair and good construction. We have adopted our focus areas and business plan goals for the period 2018-2020 taking into consideration the sustainability aspects Social, Environment and Economic. This is the foundation for further work on integrating sustainability aspects into our business. At Peab we work sustainably and care about both big issues and little details! FOUR BUSINESS AREAS We have a unique position through our four complementary business areas and all our employees welded together by a strong company culture. Our business model creates opportunities throughout the entire value chain in our projects and provides us with a good platform to deliver comprehensive solutions to our customers. Our four business areas are also a good source of diversity where we are not dependent on demand for a single product or in a particular place. Our business model provides Förslöv in March 2018 us with a good basis for creating stable and profitable operations. From this foundation we continue to strive towards our strategic goals of having the most satisfied customers, being the best workplace and the most profitable company in the industry. Jesper Göransson In conclusion I want to heartily thank all our employees. You, through your great President and CEO engagement, make our success possible.

PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 6 External circumstances and the market Nordic construction and civil engineering market E22 Linderöd Global financial growth The global economy continued to strengthen in 2017. The political unrest that characterized the start of 2017 subsided after the French election in May as populist and protectionist currents did not win a stronghold in European politics, as previously feared. There were also positive financial statistics for the Euro zone that showed a clear increase in GNP growth and a continued decrease in unemployment. In Europe growth is expected to continue in 2018 and 2019 as the global economy grows. Growth is strong in the US and is expected to increase further in 2018 since the Republicans’ tax bill made it through Congress. Inflation tendencies continue to be weak in the Euro zone, while they have been apparent in the US. The Federal Reserve is expected to continue increasing interest rates and European Central Bank politics are also geared towards a normalization through lower buybacks of bonds. Despite an overall positive trend there is growing concern regarding the development of both stock markets and inflation. The economy in Peab’s markets Sweden Norway Finland Swedish growth continued in Financial growth The Finnish economy showed 2017, albeit at a slower rate increased in 2017 strength in 2017 with GNP than in 2016.

Although housing construction is loosing Initiated construction projects speed there is still a lot of construction in private and public premises, and particularly MSEK in industrial construction which experienced a renaissance after the weak development 150,000 of the past few years. There are strong indications that collective building construction will have a horizontal development in 2018. Civil engineering construction had a 125,000 much better development compared to other building construction due to private 100,000 investments.

ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 16 Social The Nordic Community Builder cares about people For Peab caring about people is fundamental to working sustainably. The area Social includes everything from external issues like local community projects for empowering young people to an internal perspective that spotlights our Sustainability own employees’ wellbeing and development. The contribution to sustainable aspects conditions for people starts with our own business. Health and work environment Skills recruitment EMPLOYEES ARE PEAB’S GREATEST RESOURCE  Equality, diversity and equal An attractive employer brand is based in ensuring good internal conditions for all treatment employees. We want to build an including company together, one characterized by Educating youths good development opportunities, diversity, equality, good leadership and a safe work environment – and at the same time achieve our ambition to be the best workplace.  Local community building projects SAFE AND SECURE WORK ENVIRONMENT IS OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY Mentorship The construction and civil engineering industries are complex and filled with risks. Sustainable sponsoring Our employees are our most important assets and their wellbeing at work is our responsibility as employers. This is why Peab’s work in the area of the work environment has top priority. For the GRI index and The industry’s best workplace must be safe and secure. Through working systematically sustainability data see with the work environment, which includes risk management and preventive measures peab.inpublix.com/2017 paired with an exchange of knowledge and experience, we continue to strive to reach our zero vision for accidents on Peab’s work sites. Two important factors for success are good cooperation with the unions and regular follow-up. In 2017 we continued to develop this work through, for example, educational workplace revisions and quarterly follow-ups. Peab has an annual focus week when everyone in Peab’s management visits workplaces to talk to employees and gain an understanding of the challenges and good ideas for solutions found there. This year 791 (615) managers and members of PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 17 Social Group functions visited workplaces and 798 (662) discussion meetings were held about the work environment. The dialogues generated a number of improvement suggestions and the common denominator was the need for simplification and support. In other words, it should be easy to do the right thing at Peab's workplaces. In 2018 we will continue to work on our zero vision for workplace accidents. We focus on early risk observations combined with preventive work, increased clarity and a more advanced follow-up of systematic work environment work. This includes initiating more in-depth work on developing a safety culture and continued work on connecting good leadership to cooperation. It is also important to underline the responsibility of the individual for their own and their colleagues’ work environment. CONTINUED WORK WITH ORGANIZATIONAL AND SOCIAL WORK ENVIRONMENT (OSWE) The aim of the comprehensive training of Peab’s managers in OSWE, initiated in 2016, is to provide them with better tools for delegating work environment tasks as well as for informing about factors that lead to unhealthy workloads. Safety representatives and supporting resources such as the HR department and people working with quality, the environment and the work environment also took part in the training. So far 459 people have been trained in OSWE. During the autumn of 2017 OSWE work was integrated into Group equal treatment work in order to underline the connection between In 2017 we continued to develop the work the work environment and the work climate. This will continue in 2018 with a focus on environment work through educational raising competence and follow-up. workplace revisions and quarterly follow-ups. RECRUITMENT CHALLENGES FOR BOTH THE INDUSTRY AND PEAB Recruiting the right skills continues to be a critical matter for the construction and civil engineering industry. This is why Peab took a number of initiatives in 2017 to further 798 develop work on attracting, recruiting, developing and retaining expertise. Our long tradition of accepting interns from industry-related programs as well as practicing professionals is an important part in ensuring that the employees of tomorrow choose Peab as their employer. Peab also offers students at university level to do their master thesis at Peab. It is equally important to retain existing competence and ensure that During the annual focus week on the work employees choose to stay and develop in the Group. environment 798 dialogue meetings were held in order to learn about challenges and CAREER MAP AND COMPETENCE DEVELOPMENT hear good ideas for solutions. In 2017 an extra effort was made to open lots of doors to personal development in the Group and make it more accessible for all our employees. We developed a career map in order to illustrate more clearly the different career paths in Peab. We will continue to develop the career map in 2018 by providing a good overview of the many career options available at Peab: from introduction and existing role to taking steps toward a new position. In order to provide the right foundation, customized and operations-­ related skills development is connected to the various career paths charted on the map. Statement of intent against harassment and abuse “We will take our responsibility to act in such a way that no one is subjected to harassment or abuse in the construction industry.” This is an excerpt from the statement of intent against harassment and abuse that almost the entire construction industry signed on site at the office of the Minister for Housing and Digital Development, Peter Eriksson, on 30 November 2017. The construction industry, just like other industries, faces problems with sexism and macho attitudes. This became particularly apparent through all the testimonies in the #metoo campaign. Our common initiative is clear: enough is enough and we are all responsible for putting an end to this! PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 18 Social Goal and developmental discussions are an important tool for employees so that, in dialogue with their supervisor, they can take responsibility for their own development. Our goal is that 100 percent of Peab’s employees have a goal and developmental discussion annually, and the latest survey (2016) showed that this was true for 75 percent of employees. This means that the area remains a priority in 2018 as well. One of the most important projects of the past few years is the new leader development program within the concept Leading Peab. A total of 1,300 of Peab’s employees in leading functions have been trained in leadership development, 498 in 2017 alone. Besides developing individual leadership, the program has also led to good effects such as business development throughout the Group and more internal cooperation. Experience and evaluations show the importance for a new employee of a good introduction to the business and their role in it. In 2017 1,119 (1,046) people participated in an introduction day for new employees aimed at broadening their knowledge about Peab’s operations and core values. A good introduction needs to continue out into the When Ylva Johansson, Swedish Minister for workplace.

In the past few years we have built the foundation for a more down-to-earth and systematic way of working with equality, diversity and equal treatment in Peab. Our starting point is UN’s Global Compact, Peab’s Code of Conduct and our core values. One important part of this work is an active, often local, commitment to integrating immigrants into the labor force. Another is the decision to train all of Peab’s employees in equal treatment. At the end of 2017 we can conclude that this concrete, down-toearth way of tackling a great challenge in the industry has resulted in major and material steps forward: 3,380 In 2017 a third of Group employees received training in ethics and anti-corruption through courses suited to their positions consisting The equal treatment plan with its associated action plan against discrimination of both legal and practical cases. and victimization that we developed in 2017 has now been implemented.

In addition there were courses focusing on ethics, cooperation, the work environment and safety culture. These will continue in 2018. The percentage of women in the company continues to grow and it reached 13 percent (12) at the end of 2017, which corresponds to an increase of around 200 women.

ANNUAL SALARY SURVEY TO ENSURE EQUAL PAY At Peab the nature, performance and skills level of an employee’s job decide their pay level, independent of gender, age or ethnic background. In accordance to Swedish law a salary survey is conducted every year containing an analysis of wages paid to women and men. Peab’s analysis of salaries paid in 2017 detected 49 cases of incorrect wages. Correcting this is underway. There are corresponding processes in Norway and Finland that follow the laws of each country. When the Gothenburg Award for Sustainable Development was awarded in November 2017 students from the Peab School participated THE PEAB SCHOOL CONTINUES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMPETENCE OF with their vision for future sustainable cities. TOMORROW Peab’s independent upper secondary school, the Peab School, continues to develop. In 2017 we consolidated our five units to three schools in Solna, Gothenburg and Malmö. At present we have 300 students in the upper secondary construction program and 100 students in the program Language introduction for immigrants. Statistics show that about 70 percent of the 800 students who have graduated from the Peab School have found employment, most of them in Peab. The founding idea of the school has been to create a high quality, modern upper secondary construction program with just as much focus on creating a secure, aware citizen as on creating a skilled and employable worker.

New for 2017 was that the immigrants in the Language introduction at the Peab School were given the opportunity to take part in the individual mentor program. SPONSORING WHERE IT MATTERS THE MOST Peab is deeply involved in sponsoring. It is particularly geared towards youth, innovation, diversity and our engagement usually has a strong local connection. In 2017 we greatly increased sponsoring of young people and social projects and in 2018 we will continue to develop sponsoring focused on contributing to the community where it is needed the most. CONTINUED HUMANISTIC COMMITMENT IN THE SOCIAL DEBATE As a part of our responsibility as a community builder Peab continued to participate in the social debate in 2017 in order to ensure a safe, sound and attractive construction industry. Fundamental to creating the prerequisites for a sound industry where order reigns is establishing clear rules for all players on the Swedish construction market. The dialogue with politicians, labor market parties and other decision-makers also includes the industry’s competence recruitment challenges and job and education opportunities for young people.

Parallel with our work on reducing, and in sustainability data see the long-run completely replacing, fossil fuels with renewable fuels we have also peab.inpublix.com/2017 prioritized making our operations more energy efficient.

In 2017 our use of diesel, that included less than 50 percent non-fossil fuel, amounted Peab’s compreto about 38 percent of total use. We have been using a completely fossil free diesel, hensive environHVO 100 since 2015, but accessibility is still limited.

Another initiative for advancing developments is the active position Peab’s subsidiary Swerock took in 2017 for a sound transportation  Environmental and health hazardous substances phased industry by joining Fair Transport initiated by The Swedish Association of Road out by 2030 Transport Companies. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 21 Environment ECO-ASFALT® CONTINUES TO CONTRIBUTE TO LOWER CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS Bio-oil is used for drying and heating the gravel material in the manufacture of Peab’s ECO-Asfalt®, which is the process that requires the most energy. The bio-oil is made from vegetable surplus products from food production and is classified as climate neutral by the Swedish Energy Agency. Because it completely replaces fossil fuel oil this greatly reduces climate impact. At the end of 2017 ECO-Asfalt® represented 95 percent of Peab’s total production at stationary plants in Sweden. This represents a reduction of around 39,000 (19,200) ton carbon dioxide emissions annually. Since January 2015 the collective environmental measures in these plants, that also include recycling, reduced climate impact by 61 percent. In 2017 a life cycle analysis was In 2017 Peab’s subsidiary Swerock actively made for the total environmental impact of ECO-Asfalt® production, from the extraction chose to support a healthy transportation industry by joining the initiative Fair Transport. of the raw materials to the delivery of the finished aggregate. This was reviewed by a third party and resulted in an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). This broad revision gives us knowledge we can use to prioritize the right actions when we continue our environmental work. WE OFFER GREEN MACHINES FOR RENT Peab’s subsidiary Lambertsson now offers construction equipment driven by electricity: compaction equipment, excavators and wheel loaders. Electrical excavators are high in demand and they also have a positive impact on the work environment because they are quiet. Other machines follow demands for bio-hydraulics oil and have the highest possible environment classing. We plan to expand our offer of green machines in 2018. ENERGY MAPPING CONTINUES IN OTHER BUSINESS AREAS In 2016 and 2017 we commenced work with energy mapping in two business areas, In 2017 ECO-Asfalt® represented 95 percent Industry and Construction. In 2018 we will continue mapping a third business area, of Peab’s total production at stationary works Civil Engineering. Our main ambition is to gain knowledge about energy consumption, in Sweden. This is estimated to reduce in part by implementing a system for energy follow-up that will also facilitate the carbon dioxide emissions by about 39,000 tons, which is equal to 30,000 cars driving analysis of energy streamlining measures. 1,300 Swedish miles each. ECO-LABELS AND CERTIFICATION THAT SHOWS CONSIDERATION More and more of Peab’s newly produced apartment buildings receive the eco label the Swan. This means that the buildings are evaluated from a live cycle perspective and that they comply with demands for low energy use, sustainable construction products, material and chemical products as well as a quality-ensured construction process. The Swan label is also combined with electricity labeled Good Environmental Choice (Bra Miljöval), which, simply put, means that the electricity comes from renewable sources. Lifting the Environment – a project that raises awareness In the autumn of 2017 business area Construction actualized environmental issues by starting project Miljölyftet (Lifting the Environment), aimed at raising environmental awareness in employees and creating greater engagement in reducing the environmental impact of the business area. The project included a number of environmental rounds and workplace meetings in different parts of construction operations. Both white and blue collar workers were involved and many suggestions for improvements were compiled. In order to expand environmental knowledge in general, eleven E-education courses were developed based on various positions in the company. Hopefully this will increase awareness on how we can work to reduce our environmental impact in every project. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 22 Environment In Norway Peab’s office operations have been environmentally certified according to Miljöfyrtårn, which includes the work environment, purchasing profile, energy use, transport, waste and emissions. In Finland Peab’s Property Development has become a specialist in office properties with sustainable LEED certification. COOPERATION IN EFFICIENT MATERIAL USE Just as the construction and civil engineering operations in general, Peab’s operations generate large amounts of waste. Peab aims to have the most material-efficient production possible in all our operations, in part by creating less waste material and in part by taking care of and recycling as much as possible. Material efficient work The two concrete hybrid trucks are equipped methods also have an impact on the climate in the long run and this makes the work with electrical rotators that are fueled by the even more prioritized. It is crucial to develop new and better solutions together with fossil free diesel HVO100. The rotator is charged by a generator when the engine is our suppliers in order to manage materials as efficiently as possible, both when it running and one charge drives the rotator comes to logistics and mounting methods. for four hours. Besides less emissions it also contributes to a better work environment RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF WASTE PRODUCTS with less exhaust and noise. All waste material, regardless of its origin and parts, should be handled in an environmentally correct way following the laws, regulations and industry agreements that are applicable. The primary aim is to prevent the occurrence of waste in all of the operations. This is why Peab is working on a more precise calculation of the amount of material and masses needed in production. In business area Construction, where waste products mainly consist of waste, packaging and temporary constructions, there are ambitious goals for recycling. Clean material flows are also needed in order to create circular flows. One example is drywall where the recycled material can be used directly when manufacturing new drywall. In business area Civil Engineering most waste products consist of landfill material. In 2016-2017 development work was initiated in order to get most of these waste products classified as resources and not as waste. This work will continue in 2018. Innovation competition for future infrastructure The vision of zero emissions is the idea behind the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency’s innovation competition which challenges players in the industry to find common solutions. A total of 28 players are participating and they are entrepreneurs, material manufacturers, consultants, academics and authorities. The object of the competition is the Öresund Bridge in Sweden and the challenge is: How do we build the bridge with zero emissions in 2045? The competition runs 2017-2018 and among the participants are four employees from Swerock and Peab Asfalt. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 23 Environment CONTINUED RECYCLING OF MASSES IN SWEROCK The recycling operation that is part of Peab’s subsidiary Swerock is all over Sweden and equipped to handle all kinds of projects. The main focus is on handling excess masses from construction and civil engineering operations, from managing polluted masses to using masses in constructions aimed for civil engineering. Recycling also manages other construction and demolition waste, provides equipment for water purification and operates a construction logistics center in cooperation with other players in the Peab Group. JOINT WORK BEHIND THE PHASING-OUT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH HAZARDOUS MATERIALS Peab’s ambition is to phase out as much as possible of the environmental and health hazardous materials from production by choosing the right material and increasing traceability in the materials used. This demands internal cooperation between operations, purchasing and the environmental organization, as well as externally with manufacturers, suppliers, industry colleagues and customers. It all begins by choosing the right material from the start as well as by choosing materials that are traceable. The latter is important as there might be materials that are not considered hazardous today, or that have not been sufficiently researched, that in the future might be found to have an impact on humans and nature. As a rule in the cases where there are no alternatives and that therefore products with less suitable materials need to be used these must at least be traceable. In Peab’s Swedish construction and civil engineering operations the choice of material and construction goods must be made within the frames of mainly two systems: BASTA and the Byggvarubedömningen. In the Norwegian operations we use CoBuilder-ProductXChange for environmental assessments on products that are purchased for projects. MORE SUSTAINABLE ROAD MARKINGS WITH NEW SPRAY Since 2017 there is a new marker spray on the market that has been developed jointly by Peab and industry colleagues. The marker spray does not contain any organic solvents and since it is based on green DME there are no net emissions of greenhouse gasses. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 24 Economic ULSTEIN ARENA Ulsteinvik, Norge Safe, sustainable, good and fair every time Working sustainably and responsible entrepreneurship means that every business dealing must be sustainable, safe, good and fair for everyone involved. This requires proactive, risk-conscious, preventive and development oriented Sustainability work. A sustainable supplier chain is essential and so is ensuring good conditions aspects at Peab’s workplaces. Each business deal must be safe business through  Customer and supplier cooperthe application of good business ethics, transparency and sustainability in ation everything we do.  Responsibility in the supply chain  Ethics and anti-corruption CODE OF CONDUCT IS OUR GUIDING STAR Peab’s Code of Conduct was updated in 2017 under the title Good and fair construction. Together with the Group’s core values it is the most important guidance we have. The Code of Conduct contains guidelines for how we should behave in our profession; For the GRI index and towards each other, customers, suppliers and society at large. The Code is based sustainability data see on Peab’s core values, business ethics, business principals, human rights, work peab.inpublix.com/2017 conditions and the environment. The Code of Conduct is applicable to everyone in the Peab Group, from the Board of Directors and executive management to each and every employee. We also require that the Code of Conduct be respected and complied with by our business partners. The Board of Directors establishes Peab’s Code of Conduct annually. In the autumn of 2017 Peab began launching the updated Code of Conduct to employees and this will continue to in 2018. The Code of Conduct is supplemented by three new policies which have replaced Peab’s previous Company Policy: the Environmental Policy, Quality Policy and Work Environment Policy. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 25 Economic PEAB WANTS TO HAVE THE MOST SATISFIED CUSTOMERS IN THE INDUSTRY The purpose of Peab’s annual SCI (Satisfied Customer Index) surveys with external and internal company customers and private housing customers is to provide us with a good understanding of our customers’ differing needs and requirements along with fostering long-term customer relations. In 2017 the total SCI result for the Peab Group was 75 (73) on a scale 1–100 which is above the average of 70 for all industries. This means that the Group met its goal for 2017. ON THE ROAD TOGETHER WITH PARTNERING Partnering as a collaboration form is gaining speed in the construction and civil The sustainable supplier chain is fundamental engineering industry and makes up an increasing part of Peab’s total project portfolio. together with ensuring good working Partnering is, as the name suggests, a partnership in which the general contractor conditions at Peab’s workplaces. and the customer, together with architects, consultants and other key players, organize and take responsibility for the construction process. This way of taking shared responsibility for value creation in a project is beneficial for all parties and is particularly 75 suitable for complex projects. The key factors in partnering is openness, transparency and cooperation, all of which are completely in line with Peab’s core values and working method. COMMUNITY RESPONSIBILITY INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO BUSINESS At Peab we welcome the increasing importance in companies’ responsibility for the In 2017 the total SCI result for the Group was 75, which means that the Group’s goal community in connection with procurements. Demands such as asking companies for 2017 was achieved. to create employment locally for youths, immigrants or people who are physically impaired in connection to commissions are completely compatible with how we work to facilitate integration and contribute to the education and employment of youths. DECISIVE FACTORS FOR SAFE BUSINESS Peab’s business concept is based on quality every step of the way. The Group’s four business areas are in their turn dependent on a large number of suppliers and subcontractors. Peab’s purchases make up more than 70 percent of net sales and involve more than 40,000 suppliers annually. Quality-ensured suppliers and responsible purchasing characterized by a comprehensive view are all crucial to safe business. PURCHASING DEVELOPS AND BECOMES MORE SPECIALIZED During 2016 and 2017 our purchasing organization developed intensely. A large part of this work has been focused on implementing category-based purchasing that The Code of Conduct is applicable to everyone complements project purchases. The method focuses on building up competence in the Peab Group, from the Board of Directors and collecting volumes in a particular supplier market in order to use as much leverage and executive management to each and every employee. We also demand that our as possible from Peab’s size and potential. Category steering has in part focused on business partners follow the Code of Conduct. specialization and reinforcing resources from a purchasing perspective and in part on raising cooperation between business units and functions. The cross-function category team that was created in 2017 now continues its structured improvement work to ensure we are making the right deals and doing safe business. QUALITY-ENSURED SUPPLIERS A cornerstone of the concept safe business is making sure we work with quality-ensured suppliers in the right way in order to be able to handle risks and prevent irregularities. A clear set of demands and written contracts are part of the process of quality ensuring our suppliers. All contracts that Peab signs with suppliers clearly state the rules and requirements that apply to the particular project and to doing business with Peab in general. The Code of Conduct is always included in contracts and there is always an ethics paragraph. The ethics paragraph states the demands on the suppliers and applicable consequences if they do not live up to the Code of Conduct, proper working conditions as well as safety regulations on the work site. We are continuously improving the competency of the purchasing organization to ensure that they are well acquainted with the demands that we have on suppliers. In Sweden we learn from the work we have done in Finland with identification and tax controls. Please find more information about our Risk prevention work in Finland on page 27. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 26 Economic THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTROL AND FOLLOW-UP It is of the utmost importance for a safe business to, from a sustainability perspective, regularly follow-up on how purchasing is handled throughout the organization and check suppliers. Among other things, we make quarterly supplier base controls resulting in approval or rejection. There are semi-annual checks at Peab’s workplaces concerning the work environment, work climate as well as working conditions and purchase-related issues. In 2018 we will focus on follow up our subcontractors in the so-called risk categories. This includes conducting revisions, targeted measures and following up supplier markets and subcontractors based on risk assessments. EDUCATION AND STRICT CONSEQUENCES DEVELOP OUR WORK WITH ETHICS Peab’s work with ethical issues and against Peab does not tolerate corruption. Peab is one of the partners in the Joint Initiative corruption is long-range and systematic. Against Bribes and Corruption (JIABC) that works to jointly counteract bribes and Strict consequences and education and training are important factors for success. corruption in the publicly funded construction and real estate sector. Peab’s work with ethical issues and against corruption is long-range and systematic. An important factor in our success is that we work with strict consequences in cases of infringement. Another is education. In 2017 we held a number of workshops at production workplaces where groups supervised by teachers from the Peab School went through ethical, production-related cases. This training will continue in 2018. Employees responsible for business deals are required to take a course in competition law which can be taken through E-education. In 2017 Peab also developed an E-education in ethics and anti-corruption which will be launched in 2018. This course is also obligatory for employees responsible for business deals. Healthy competition and Maintain Zero Peab is highly engaged in the construction industry's complex challenges that we as community builders face. Through problem-solving cooperation with trade colleagues we work to create the most sustainable social, environmental and economic solutions. One example of such cooperation within the industry in Sweden is the organization Håll Nollan (Maintain Zero) that works to eliminate accidents in the Swedish construction industry. Maintain Zero focuses on four prioritized areas: leadership and culture, knowledge and competence, common work methods and standards as well as demands and follow-up. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 27 Economic Risk prevention work in the supplier chain Finland works proactively with preventing risks in every aspect of a project. Suppliers are quality-­ ensured through structured purchasing, characterized by openness and dialogue. The existence of a public supplier registry ensures that statutory requirements are met and that identity controls, including checks on the taxability of every individual on the work site, are being made. They have developed a support system in the form of a mobile application to facilitate registration of risk observations in daily work. Peab’s Ethical Council ensures that incidents in the Group such as infringement of laws 4,958 and the Code of Conduct receive the same consequences, regardless of context or position. The mission and working methods of the Ethical Council will be further developed in 2018. NEW CHANNELS FOR WHISTLE-BLOWING In 2017 4,958 people were trained in ethics Transparency and openness are the watchwords for Peab’s development of the and anti-corruption, corresponding to a business and work climate. Employees have an important role in reporting any law third of Peab’s employees. infringements or serious irregularities. We prefer open reporting but this is complemented by an external web-based whistle-blower system that guarantees the anonymity of the reporter. As of the first part of 2018 the whistle-blower system will also be accessible to external reporters. EVENTS DURING THE YEAR During 2017, no incidents of anticompetitive activities, breaches of the competition law or monopolistic behavior leading to legal action have occurred. In 2017 Peab discovered one case of suspected corruption and nine internal incidents of suspected financial irregularities. The responsible manager handled the incidents with support from members of the Ethical Council. All of these incidents led to labor law measures and five of them, including the corruption incident, were reported to In 2017 a large number of workshops were the police. held at production workplaces where teams were trained in ethical and production-related examples of cases.

For this reason, as of 1 January 2017 properties for a total recorded value of SEK 619 million have been reclassified as operations property and Sweden properties for a total value of SEK 629 million have been reclassified as investment property. Norway Finland HOUSING DEVELOPMENT Peab’s position on the Swedish market is good. Being spread all over the country creates a local organization that builds up close customer relationships and effectively meets the demand for new production of homes in varying price classes. Our range of housing forms is broad; tenant-owned apartments, condominiums and apartments for rent as well as homeowner or tenant-owned single homes. The strong development of housing construction in Sweden slowed down towards the end of the year and sales took longer than before. This is believed to be due to a surplus of homes in some areas, the more stringent amortization requirements put in place by the government and higher requirements from banks for loans. Peab’s housing is primarily in the mid-priced segment and we see that there is still a big need for new housing in this range. The development rights portfolio for Swedish operations is spread across the country. Peab has had a central role in the development A number of development rights were acquired in 2017. Among them were some of Vallastaden in Linköping, which was the 600 development rights in Kvarnholmen in Nacka, some 700 development rights in location for Sweden’s largest Living Urban Upplands-Bro, some 700 development rights in Norrköping, some 500 development Expo 2017. Peab built 136 apartments in the new city district in a mixture of rentals, tenantrights in Södra Änggården, Gothenburg and several land allocations in the areas owned apartments and condominiums, Peab is established. which reflected Peab’s offer of different housing forms. Peab’s strives to be a forerunner in sustainable urban development and build attractive and sustainable projects that meet economic, environmental and social goals. Peab considers social sustainability essential, which means creating vibrant and safe neigh­ borhoods with meeting places. As of September 2017 all new, own developed apartment buildings will be certified according to the Swan with Bra Miljöval (Good Environmental Choice) labelled electricity. Hyllie is Malmö’s largest expansion area and will be a global model for sustainable urban development. Peab is building 179 apartments in the city block Tor in a mixture of housing forms with both rentals and tenant-owned apartments, along with a preschool, and all of them share a courtyard. To promote bicycling instead of driving all the tenantowned apartments come with an electrical bicycle. The roof of the construction is covered in solar panels that provide electricity for the building and charging the bikes. The project Hämeenlinnan Henrietta with 52 Partille Port in Gothenburg is Peab’s single largest housing project with around 900 apartments is being built on cultural land in apartments, commercial space, senior housing, a garage and parking.

The Norwegian housing market developed positively in the beginning of 2017. However, more stringent loan requirements from banks led to falling housing prices which became apparent in the spring of 2017. The negative development in prices mostly affected the market in Oslo but even other large cities felt the effect.

The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 28-105 in this document. In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act, and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2017 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2017 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. Board of Directors' report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the AGM adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the Group. Our opinions in this report on the the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11. Basis for Opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the Group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the period in question. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
