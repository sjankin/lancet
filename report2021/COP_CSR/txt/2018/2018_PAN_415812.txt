Increased Neopanamax locks demand confirms that we made the right decision and demonstrates the confidence of the maritime industry in the safe, reliable and efficient service provided by the Panama Canal. The container vessel segment contributed to our exceeding the amount of tonnage estimated for this fiscal year. Consequently, this generated a considerable amount of merchandise for Latin America, and created strong competition between the different ports of the region. Committed to the environment, the Board of Directors guarantees the responsibility granted by law to the Panama Canal Authority to manage, maintain, use and conserve the Canal watershed’s water resources.

The most relevant aspects of the company’s operational, financial, labor and socio-environmental performance are included in this report in a transparent and timely manner, complying with our commitment to accountability. During fiscal year 2017, the first full year of operation of the expanded Canal, the Canal exceeded expectations and marked a series of far-reaching milestones and achievements, thanks to the unrestricted support, dedication and assurance of each of the employees that make up our workforce, as well as the trust that customers have placed in the Panama Canal brand. Regarding the cargo, the Canal reached the record figure of 403.8 million PC/UMS tons (Panama Canal Universal Measurement System), which represents an increase of 22.2 percent with respect to the 330.4 million tons of fiscal year 2016. This was made possible because of Jorge L. Quijano the strong performance of the container, liquid bulk, dry Administrator bulk and passenger vessels segments, with increases in Panama Canal billable tons of 19 percent, 54.5 percent, 20.2 percent, and 13.3 percent, respectively. This was achieved while the market was influenced by purchases and acquisitions of shipping lines, new deals between operators, and by alliances between shipping companies, resulting in a change in the outlook of liner services that transit the Panama Canal. The Neopanamax locks have allowed for customers to take advantage of the benefits of the economies of scale on the Panama route. This is reflected in the number and size of the ships that transit the Canal today. Currently, the daily transit average is around five vessels, a figure higher than the one estimated for fiscal year 2017, and which is expected to increase in the short term.

Since its opening, more than 2,000 Neopanamax vessels have transited the new Cocoli Locks, on the Pacific side, and Agua Clara Locks, on the Atlantic. The container segment accounted for about 54 percent of these transits, while liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels represented 29 and 9 percent, respectively. Bulk carriers, tankers, car carriers and passenger vessels also transited the Expanded Canal. Other interesting elements were incorporated into the maritime scenario during this period. For example, the Panama Canal, with its expansion, registered a 22.2 The same applies to LPG traffic, which has grown percent increase in tonnage and a 15.3 percent increase to become the second largest traffic segment of the in revenues, as compared with the previous fiscal year.

The majority of these liner services connect ports in Asia and the U.S. East Coast. The positive impact of the Expanded Canal – which was built with almost a 90 percent Panamanian workforce – has led countries, such as the United States, to invest in their ports and logistics facilities to boost their local economies.

Other changes included the merge and acquisitions of shipping lines by larger ones and new deals between operators, such as the purchase of Hamburg Sud by Maersk Line, OOCL by the Chinese line COSCO, and the creation of the Ocean Network Express by the Japanese lines K-Line, MOL and NYK. Also, the reorganization of shipping alliances during this year into three mega alliances, changed the outlook of liner services that transit the Panama Canal. 2 A liner service is defined as a regular service for the transportation of goods using vessels with established itineraries with fixed intervals or frequencies port calls. 24 Fiscal year 2017 started with 28 liner services deployed through the Canal, 20 of them Panamax-sized or smaller, and the rest, Neopanamax-sized. Variations took place during the year, such as the market consolidation into three large shipping alliances and some mergers and acquisitions. The year-end balance was 29 liner services, of which 15 use Neopanamaxsized vessels and 14 use Panamax-sized or smaller vessels.

A total of 75.9 million long tons were transported during fiscal year 2017, 26.2 percent more than the previous fiscal year, driven primarily by an extraordinary spur of The upward trend in transits was due to traffic growth in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which increased from the Neopanamax locks, plus the fact that it reflects the 6.2 million long tons in fiscal year 2016 to 15.3 million first full year of operations of these locks3. It is particularly in fiscal year 2017, and by the LNG flow that went from noteworthy the increase in VLGC (very large gas carriers), 549.8 thousand long tons of cargo in fiscal year 2016 to followed by LNG (liquefied natural gas) carriers, and 6.4 million long tons in fiscal year 2017.

The most on the west coast of Canada. significant growth for tankers was reported in diesel transportation, which increased 2.1 million long tons compared with the previous fiscal year, mainly on routes originating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to the west coast of Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, Panama and Chile. Gasoline was the second most significant commodity carried in tankers vessels through the Panama Canal during fiscal year 2017. This commodity registered a total of 9.2 million long tons, 25 thousand additional long tons compared to fiscal year 2016, in the route from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to the west coast of Mexico. Gasoline exports from the United States to Mexico have increased as a result of low production in Mexico’s refineries. 26 Along the same lines, gas carriers had an excellent 9.1 million long tons, of which 92.5 percent was propane performance, registering record numbers in transits, and 6.8 percent was ammonia. Liquefied petroleum gas billing tonnage and toll revenues, surpassing fiscal year remains the most important cargo of this segment. The 2016.

Dry Bulk Carrier Segment During fiscal year 2017, bulk carriers recorded a total such as the Cape of Good Hope and the Strait of Magellan, of 2,915 transits, 79.1 million PC/UMS tons and B/.382 to reduce operating costs, which also affected the transits million in toll revenues. The PC/UMS tonnage increased through the Canal. However, partly due to the operation 20.2 percent compared to fiscal year 2016. of the Neopanamax locks, dry bulk transits loaded with coal and in ballast improved in fiscal year 2017 compared This year industry overcapacity was one of the main to fiscal year 2016, along with a slight increase in iron reasons for low freight rates, which had an adverse effect ore shipments. As a result, cargo tonnage increased 7.5 on this segment. As a result of low fuel prices, some percent in fiscal year 2017, 6.7 million long tons more vessel operators were enticed to use alternative routes, than in fiscal year 2016. 5 LNG aggregator: Acts on behalf of a group of producers in order to collect the product, negotiate better prices and sell gas in mixed blocks to the end user.

This decline was due to less of Canada to Europe and Egypt. soybean, sorghum and corn flows from the United States ports in the Gulf of Mexico to northern Asia, In general, because of the Canal’s competitive toll rates, especially China, Japan and South Korea, as a ballast transits increased 78.9 percent through the result of the increased competition from Brazil Panamax locks in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year and Argentina as alternate sources of grains. At 2016. These ballast transits, -including the brand new the same time, because of lower fuel costs, the ballast transits through the Neopanamax locks related deviation of Panamax vessels transporting grains to the coal trade from the Caribbean coast of Colombia through the Cape of Good Hope increased during to the western coast in Mexico-, also contributed to the fiscal year 2017. good performance during the fiscal year. At the same time, there was a slight improvement in iron ore shipments, particularly from Chile and the Pacific coast of Mexico to terminals located in Europe and the United States East On the other hand, coal and coke movements during Coast, including the Gulf of Mexico. this twelve-month period, -petroleum coke included-, increased 90.4 percent compared to fiscal year 2016, mainly due to greater flows of thermal coal from Puerto Nuevo, Colombia, -mostly in Capesize6 vessels, to Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico’s Pacific coast.

A comparison of these numbers with those in fiscal year 2016 shows a The downward trend in the refrigerated cargo segment reduction of 80 transits, with a corresponding 6.5 percent registered this year was due to several factors, such as decrease in billable tons. Despite the 3.7 percent increase the migration of perishable goods from conventional in on deck TEUs, toll revenues were 2.2 percent less than reefer vessels to container vessels with high reefer TEU last year. capacities, which was evidenced by the increase in the refrigerated capacity deployed in Neopanamax liner services that serve the west coast of South America to Europe, the most important route of this segment. Bananas continue to be the main refrigerated cargo Another factor that had an impact on this drop, was that transported through the Panama Canal, representing Ecuadorean banana producers were forced to curtail 54.5 percent of mobilized cargo for the segment. production between the months of July and August, due This cargo decreased 1.8 percent compared to last to the oversupply of the fruit coming from Colombia, Costa fiscal year, mainly due to diminishing levels of fruit Rica, Honduras and Guatemala, which caused a fall in cargo from Ecuador and Peru. banana prices in the United States, European and Russian markets, Ecuador’s main market.

ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | PANAMA CANAL 65 Conservation of the Watershed The Panama Canal has invested in programs focused on taking nature conservation to a modern vision of sustainable development by articulating economic growth with social welfare, so that economic, social and environmental components receive an equal treatment aligned with sustainable development goals and promoted by ISO 26000 CSR Standards. These investments in nature generate measurable, verifiable and quantifiable returns, which confirm that by protecting nature we preserve humanity’s most important resource. 66 Cadastre and Land Titling Land titling has been the basis on which a series of one of the largest and most important conservation areas conservation projects and initiatives in the watershed in the country. have been successfully implemented. In particular, the Panama Canal has regarded the respect for the cultural value and love of the land that its residents profess as the pillars of this program. Based on the above, this year, 8,931 hectares of land have been registered in the provinces of Panama, Western Panama and Colon and 785 property titles were conferred. This represents a significant increase in the legal security and land tenure regularization in the watershed. The titling process in Salamanca as a buffer zone for the Chagres National Park is noteworthy. This is a strategic site of the watershed because 44 percent of the water required by the Canal for its operation, human consumption and electric power generation is produced here, making it Environmental Economic Incentives With this program, the Panama Canal has promoted the protection of existing forest cover and the adequate use of land in the watershed by developing reforestation projects in agroforestry, conservation, commercial, silvopastoral and protection modalities and forest surveillance. ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | PANAMA CANAL 67 In fiscal year 2017, 225 hectares of reforested land were Azuero Peninsula, as part of the reforestation program established under the agroforestry and silvopastoral for compensation due to the construction of a bridge modality, while 90 beneficiaries were encouraged to across the Canal, located in the Province of Colon, and protect and monitor 650 hectares of forests in the Ciri and the reforestation of 252 hectares of coffee trees in Trinity River watershed. the Chucunaque River Watershed, in the villages of Nuevo Vigia and Alto Playon in the Province of Darien, The beginning of the planting cycle of 65 hectares under in compliance with the provisions of the Environment the agroforestry modality was very important. It took Ministry (MiAmbiente) for the ecological compensation of place in the middle watershed of La Villa River in the the Canal Expansion Program. Monitoring of Forest Cover and Heritage Areas The elements that directly impact the environmental were detected, three due to land invasion, which were quality of the watershed are the forest cover and land relocated by the authorities; one due to starting forest use; these are constantly monitored by the Canal, in close fires and 12 cases of illegal logging in secondary, young coordination with MiAmbiente. forest and shrubs and bushes.

Also, 18 follow-up tours were scheduled with the participation of CTPA members and 15 review meetings for the evaluation of findings and formulation of joint action plans were held. Community Relations During this fiscal year, capacity-building activities for community-based leaders were carried out, as well as the effective coordination of State institutions and local governments. In the same way, the Panama Canal has successfully integrated the private sector members in the advisory councils as part of the economic sector, thus facilitating integral management of environmental solutions in the Canal watershed. Thirty workshops and two regional forums were held in the Panama Canal watershed to strengthen the community platform in six consultative community councils of six Canal watershed regions. Environmental safeguard systems were implemented and the Immediate Action Plan was updated; this is an essential baseline for the development of decisionmaking scenarios. 70 In addition, 900 community leaders, representatives of State institutions, non-governmental organizations and more than 15 entrepreneurs in Cleaner Production (CP) were trained in leadership, accountability and financial management, and the integrated solid waste management project in Chilibre and Chilibrillo were implemented. This project included 443 participants and benefitted 420 households in the pilot community of Nuevo Progreso, which has been considered by the Municipality of Panama in its Cero Solid Waste Integral Management Program. Also, three strategic river committees were established to monitor level 100 in Ciricito, Escobal and Cuipo, as well as five community committees that monitor environmental quality in the watershed. These initiatives contribute to the consolidation of the socioenvironmental process that is being undertaken in the Panama Canal watershed. Education for Sustainability In terms of environmental education for sustainable development, we were able to reach around 100 schools, train about 7,000 students in rural-peri-urban areas and establish two experimental projects in Nuevo Vigia and Ciricito schools, east and west of the watershed, respectively. In addition, within the framework of the Junior Achievement-ACP Partnership, 100 percent of Our Canal and its Watershed Program was achieved. Under this partnership, 75 volunteer employees taught 85 courses, 2,400 hours, to 1,500 graders of 38 schools in the Panama Canal Watershed. Also the creation of an environmental network of 60 young inhabitants of this important basin were trained in water governance issues and prepared as the next generation of environmentalists, future members of the consultative community councils of the six working regions in the Panama Canal Watershed. Approximately 320 employees of diverse skills and working areas participated in the Panama Canal Environmental Education Program which is aimed at improving their environmental performance in themes such as: our environmental responsibility, energy efficiency in shipping operations and the proper management of materials and waste. In addition, 177 persons, hired to perform contracting projects in the Canal operations areas, were trained on environmental subjects.

Much of the success of the Panama Canal is due to the continuous implementation of a maintenance culture, which is synonymous with reliability, in its operations. Studies were carried out to introduce improvements in the three spillways: Miraflores, Gatun and Madden, in addition to preventive maintenance works. 80 Sustainable Energy and Innovation The Panama Canal promotes projects based on nonconventional renewable energies in its areas of operation. Naturally, photovoltaic plants have been studied and, more recently, their use on bodies of water. To this end, the Panama Canal began in 2016 the construction of a floating facility in the Lake View area in Miraflores, to study the energy production and effects on the implementation of of energy; establishing the Panama Canal as a leading large-scale projects. It is worth mentioning that all the and innovative organization regarding the production of installation was carried out by Panama Canal employees, floating photovoltaic energy in the country and the region. who applied science and innovation for the successful assembly and operation of this important initiative.

Aware of this reality, the Canal is always seeking to enhance its communication channels and maintain a permanent contact with the community. The interaction with thousands of Panamanians continued this year and the messages of the institutional advertising campaign “We Love Challenges” were focused on the challenges that lie ahead despite the completion of the expanded Canal and the long road ahead. 90 During fiscal year 2017, the Panama Canal developed a communications plan to disseminate the milestones achieved by the expanded Canal on its first year of operations, confirming its impact in global maritime trade, and the actions that have been taken on environmental sustainability, as part of The Green Route, and the Canal’s role in the National Water Security Plan. Additionally, more than 50 briefings were given to approximately 6,000 attendees, mostly students, at universities and schools in the provinces of Panama, Colon, Cocle, Herrera, Los Santos, Veraguas and Chiriqui as part of the “We Love Challenges” campaign. Moreover, 20 Panama Canal spokespersons reported in the regional news media about performance of the expanded Canal on its first year of operations and the upcoming challenges. In celebration of its 103rd anniversary, the Panama Canal organized the well-liked Magical Nights event at the Miraflores Visitor Center. The event had a record attendance of more than 6,000 people, where families shared musical evenings, live characters exhibitions, and enjoyed Panamanian traditions. ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | PANAMA CANAL 91 The traditional Canal Summer Festival brought together more than 30,000 people of all ages for the three-day event in the surroundings of the Panama Canal Administration Building that included the presentation of a movie, a theatrical presentation and musical performances to please everyone. The Panama Canal participated in 17 fairs and events throughout the country, reaching approximately 481,578 people, while the traveling informative bus shared the history and operation of the waterway in 23 roadshows to 22,125 people. As part of the Canal of All program, 18,164 people including students, local authorities, trade organizations, civil society, and non-governmental organizations, had the opportunity to learn more about Canal operations during their tours to the Miraflores Visitor Center or to the Agua Clara Visitor Center, in Colon, which offers a new window for tourism in the Atlantic side of the country. Since its creation in 2003, the Canal of All program has brought 155,024 to the Canal. Geographical distance has not been an obstacle for the Canal to build a bond with Panamanians from different regions of the country by means of its eight information centers located in Changuinola (province of Bocas del Toro), Aguadulce (province of Cocle), David (province of Chiriqui), Chitre (province of Herrera), Guarare and Las Tablas (province of Los Santos) and Santiago (province of Veraguas). More than 69,000 people, especially young students, took advantage of these free meeting point centers. 92 Even beyond physical borders, social media has opened an additional communication channel for interaction with several generations of Panamanians. This has been possible through websites and the social networks Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, with a monthly average reach of 5.9 million users in 2017. In addition to informative content and social campaigns shared via social networks, public participation was promoted. Consequently, events such as the Canal Summer Festival, the Visitor Center’s Magical Nights, and contests to attend guided tours to the expanded Canal had massive participation. Moreover, the Panama Canal increased content production in its different platforms, moving its daily Canal TV schedule from three to four hours, and subscribing a cooperation agreement with the University of Panama for the transmission of programs and documentaries from the University Cinema Experimental Group (GECU). In addition, the Panama Canal extended its scope by launching live broadcasts of special events on Canal TV, its corporate channel, YouTube and Facebook Live. These transmissions included emblematic activities such as the first anniversary of the expanded Canal, forums about the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties and the Role of Youth in the Panama Canal, in partnership with the Youth United for Education Foundation. ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | PANAMA CANAL 93 To accomplish the organization’s commitment to the National Water Security Plan, the Panama Canal organized the launching of the documentary “Cuando Vuelvan los Bosques” (When the Rainforests Return), produced by Vertical and Albatros Media, which became part of the programs to promote the importance of protecting and identifying new water sources. The Canal continued to be the main point of interest for tourists arriving in the country, who are drawn by recent attractions such as the new simulator at the Miraflores Visitor Center. The two visitors centers received a total of 995,824 people as of September 2017, of which 29 percent were nationals and 71 percent were foreigners, representing a revenue of B/.10.1 million. In order to develop a comprehensive plan to promote the waterway’s tourism potential, a consultancy was awarded to the Canadian company FORREC. Meanwhile, the project to build the first getting to know about the Canal center in the countryside, in the city of Santiago province of Veraguas, is still underway. At the end of fiscal year 2017, its progress was at 16 percent. The expanded Canal contributed to Panama’s good international reputation, being recognized with the Lloyd’s List Americas award “Newsmaker of the Year” for the historic inauguration of the Neopanamax locks and its impact on news media around the world. 94 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | PANAMA CANAL 95 FINANCE Proven Financial Strength of the Panama Canal The start of commercial operations of the Third Set of Since Panama took over Canal administration back in Locks of the Panama Canal has prompted the redesign 2000, the Canal has maintained a track record of financial of many regional and global supply chains, and has growth and contributions to the National Treasury with influenced changes in maritime trade patterns, which management focused on business sustainability, the favor users and contribute to the progress of Panama. implementation of improvements, and the maximization Canal users and clients benefit from the economies of of financial returns. scale that result from the use of larger vessels on the Panama route, as well as a very competitive toll structure, specially designed for each market segment.

The Neopanamax vessel traffic generated B/.819 million in toll revenues, which represents 37 percent of total toll revenues for the year and 34 percent of the tonnage that went through the Canal, after 1,828 vessels transited the new locks. These transits are equivalent to an average of 5 vessels per day and 76,000 PC/UMS tons per transit. The non Neopanamax vessels generated toll revenues of B/.1,419 million.

The additional tonnage per ship through the Neopanamax locks represents 3.4 times more tons on average per transit compared to the original locks. The average for the original locks was 23 thousand tons per transit, equivalent to an average toll revenue of B/.448 thousand per transit in the new locks; this is 3.7 times more in average toll revenue per transit than the Panamax locks, which has an average income of B/.121 thousand per transit. Risk Management Guarantees Canal’s Reliability The Panama Canal actively manages risks with a variety of permanent actions and mechanisms as part of its business continuity and reliability strategy. Prior to the commissioning of the Third Set of Locks, the Canal raised the multi-risk coverage policy up to B/.2,500 million to include assets of the Panama Canal Expansion. The coverage ensures business continuity in the face of catastrophic risk scenarios. This coverage and adequate liquid reserves, in addition to its financing capacity, represent the backbone of the conservative and rigorous risk management policy of the Canal. 100 Excellent Financial Performance The Canal ended fiscal year 2017 with record revenues of B/.2,886 million, B/.383 million or 15.3 percent above fiscal year 2016. This increase is mainly attributed to the additional 73.4 million PC/UMS tons that transited during the year, which represented B/.343 million in transit revenues. The higher tonnage is credited to increased cargo volumes from Asia and the East Coast of the United States and the economies of scale on shipping routes due to the new locks. Transit-related services represented 94 percent or B/.2,707 million of the income for fiscal year, energy sales represented three percent or B/.84.6 million, while the remaining 3 percent or B/.94.4 million is composed of water sales B/.28.4 million, B/.33 million interest earned and other miscellaneous income for B/.33 million.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Authority as of September 30, 2017, its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Basis for the Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are described in the section Responsibilities of the Auditor with regards to the audit of the financial statements in our report. We are independent from the Authority, per the Code of Ethics for Accounting Professionals of the International Ethics Standard Board for Accountants (IESBA), together with ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Panama, and we complied with all other ethics responsibilities per these requirements and the IESBA Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not express a separate opinion on these matters. For each key matter outlined below, we describe how this matter has been addressed in the context of our audit. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities Regarding the Audit of the Financial Statements” section of our report, including those related to key audit matters. Accordingly, our audit included the execution of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the key audit matters detailed below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

Advances and other accounts receivable from contractors are considered one of the significant issues because the recoverability assessment and determination of the recoverable amount of advances and other accounts receivable includes a high level of judgment and estimation by the Authority’s Management. Our audit procedures to cover the significant risk in relation to advances and other accounts receivable, net, including the following, among others: • Submission of balance confirmations. • Evaluation of the Authority’s process to determine the recoverability of advances and other accounts receivable. • We analyzed the classification of current and non-current balances. • We evaluated the validity of bank guarantees. • We evaluated the model, approach, and method used by Management to determine the recoverable amount. • We evaluated the disclosures made by Management. Contingencies for Contractor Claims According to note 29, as of September 30, 2017, the Authority maintains claims presented by the contractor for B/.5,863 million. The evaluation of provisions and contingencies requires important judgments and analysis by Management due to this we consider that it is one of the significant issues. Our audit procedures to cover the significant risk in relation to disclosures for contingencies and/or provisions, included the following, among others: • We obtained the analysis made by Management and its legal advisors. • Together with our construction and legal specialists, we evaluated the conclusions reached by Management and its legal advisors. • We sent confirmations to the Authority’s legal advisors. • We evaluated the disclosures made by Management. Other Information The other information consists of information included in the annual report which is different from the financial statements and our corresponding audit report. Management is responsible for the other information. The Authority’s annual report is expected to be available to use after the date of that audit report. Our opinion on the annual reports does not cover the other information and we do not express an opinion or any other type of assurance in that regard. Ernst & Young Limited Corp. P.O.

If we determine that the other information contains material deviations, we are required to report this. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with the Authority’s Corporate Governance for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such the internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Authority’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. Those charged with the Authority’s Management are responsible for overseeing the Authority’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a significant error when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered significant if, individually or in the aggregate, they could be reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions made by users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit under ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. As auditors, we also: • Identify and assess the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements, due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of a material misstatement due to fraud going undetected is higher than one due to error, since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, intentionally mistaken statements, or the circumvention of internal control. • We obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are adequate under the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control.

If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we are required to call attention in our audit report to the corresponding disclosures in the financial statements, or if those disclosures are not adequate, to express a modified opinion. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained as of the date of our audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Authority not to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether those statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with the Authority’s Management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and the significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we have identified during our audit. We also provided the Authority’s Management with a statement that we have met the applicable ethical requirements regarding independence and communicate all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear our independence and, where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged auditor’s with governance, we determine those that were the most significant in the audit of financial statements as of September 30, 2017, and therefore constitute key audit matters. We described those key audit matters in our auditor’s report, unless a law or regulation precludes a public disclosure about the matter, or, in extremely rare circumstances, if we determine that the matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The fair value of an investment fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in in securities is generally determined based on the quoted an active market.

If a reliable quoted market price is not available, effective interest rate method, less any impairment. the fair value of the instrument is estimated using models for price calculation or discounted cash flows techniques. Advances to contractors and advances and other accounts receivable to contractors Advances to contractors for the acquisition of physical assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are initially classified as a non-financial asset because the recovery is expected to be made through work and not with cash or another financial instrument. When these advances are expected to be settled in cash or through the execution of third-party guarantees, the ACP reclassifies the advance 130 Derecognition of financial assets Borrowings and bonds issued The ACP derecognizes a financial asset only when the Borrowings and bonds issued are initially recognized at contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the fair value at their respective contractual dates, including asset have expired; or when the ACP has transferred the costs attributable to the transaction.

In addition, the reimbursement policy provides protection in each year of its term against the risk that the ACP suffers any financially incapacitating event to meet payment of obligations to its employees, for any reason, including illiquidity, if occurred during the term of the policy, as long as the ACP is current in the payments of the premium and the defined benefit plans for voluntary retirement are in effect. The policy does not cover the risk of default of the ACP that could arise from internal fraud, catastrophic physical risks, nuclear war, terrorism, and epidemics, which has been estimated at 3.41% of the total insured amount. Changes in the reimbursement right to ACP during fiscal year 2017 are detailed as follows: Statement of Stament of Statement of Financial Comprehensive Financial Position Income Statement Income Position Reimbursement right Reimbursements Actuarial Oct. 1, 2016 cost of the year Net interest during the year adjustments Sept. 30, 2017 Reimbursement right to ACP B/. 308,568 B/. 35,703 B/. 6,094 B/. 23,175 B/. 1,421 B/. 328,611 At September 30, 2017, the ACP paid the insurer B/.24,300 (2016: B/.15,200) in premiums of the reimbursement policy. ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | PANAMA CANAL 153 26. Risk management The ACP maintains a conservative and prudent financial policy oriented to preserve its capital and generate optimal performance with low risk, for which various risk management activities are performed throughout the year, including: analysis, evaluation and risk mitigation. This allows management to plan and make decisions that enhance the economic contribution and operational excellence, improving the chances of achieving the strategic goals. The ACP’s capital structure consists of net debt (borrowings and bonds as detailed in notes 17 and 18), compensated by cash and bank deposit balances, other financial assets (See note 10) and equity of the enterprise (consisting of contributed capital, reserves, other equity accounts, and unappropriated retained earnings, as disclosed in notes 13, 14, 15 and 16, respectively). Historically, the ACP has operated with its own resources due to its high levels of cash generated by its operations to afford its costs of operation, investment, functioning, maintenance and modernization up to December 2008, when the ACP subscribed to a common term financing agreement with five development agencies which committed to grant borrowings totaling B/.2,300,000 to partially finance the Canal Expansion Program, and more recently, in September 2015, when it issued bonds in the international market totaling B/.450,000 in order to partially finance the building of the bridge on the Atlantic side of the Canal.

The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Canal Expansion Program and the new bridge at the Atlantic side of the Canal. The ACP also has cash, bank deposits, operations with settlement in progress, trade and other receivables, and funds invested in short term debt instruments held until maturity. The ACP also contracts hedging instruments. 154 The ACP is exposed to credit, market and liquidity risks. ACP’s administration monitors and manages these risks. ACP’s Treasury coordinates the access to international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks related to ACP’s operations through internal risk reports, which analyze the exposures depending on their degree and magnitude. These risks include market risk (exchange risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Teams of specialists with the appropriate knowledge, experience and supervision perform all the activities related to risk hedging. The ACP maintains policies that provide written principles about foreign exchange risk management, interest rate risk, credit risk, and the use of hedge financial instruments and liquidity investment. Internal auditors periodically monitor the compliance with the policies and exposure limits. The ACP does not subscribe or negotiate financial instruments for speculative purposes. The ACP’s treasury quarterly updates the Board of Directors Finance Committee and follows up the risks and the implemented policies to mitigate risk exposure. The Office of Inspector General periodically audits treasury operations and reports to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors revises and approves the policies for managing each of the following risks: Market risk ACP activities are primarily exposed to financial risks due to variations of currency exchange, interest rates, and commodity prices out of its control. With the purpose of managing these risks exposure, the ACP subscribes a variety of hedge financial instruments approved by its Board of Directors based on the recommendations of the Liquidity and Hedging Committee, including: • Interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of increases in interest rates. • Diesel price swaps to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in the price of this commodity, which is required for the regular Canal’s operations. Exchange rate risk management The ACP has established a policy to manage foreign currency risk related to its functional currency. The ACP only accepts payments in dollars of the United States of America and the investment criteria and applicable guidelines require that all deposits and investments inbanks, shall be in the dollarsof the United States of America or in other currencies authorized by the Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, the ACP does not maintain commitments in other currencies. It only maintains deposits in the currency of the United States of America. Interest rate risk management The ACP is exposed to interest rate risk because it borrowed funds through financings and bond issuances at both fixed and floating interest rates. The ACP manages this risk with interest rate swap contracts. Given market conditions, ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | PANAMA CANAL 155 hedging activities are evaluated regularly to consider interest rate volatility and risk tolerance, ensuring that the most conservative hedging strategies are applied. Interest rate swap contracts Starting on March 2010, the ACP established, without collateral, interest rate swap contracts, to fix the interest rate on B/.800,000 variable rate loans. The notional amount and principal amortizations on the swap instruments coincide with the dates, disbursements and amortizations of the underlying loans: B/.200,000 were disbursed on March 1, 2010, B/.300,000 on October 29, 2010, and B/.300,000 on April 13, 2011. Semi-annual amortizations for B/.40,000 are programmed to begin on May 15, 2019 until their maturityon November 15, 2028. On July 2016 the ACP contracted an additional interest rate swap contract, without collateral, to fix the interest rate on B/.1,400,000 variable rate loans, even though this transaction would be effective starting on November, 2016. Later, on June 2017, the ACP contracted an additional interest rate swap contract, without collateral, to fix the interest rate on B/.1,400,000 variable rate loans, even though this transaction would be effective starting on November 15, 2017 up to November 15, 2018. Principal amortizations would be B/.70,000 semi-annually starting on May 15, 2019 until its maturity on November 15, 2028. According to interest rate swap contracts, the ACP agreed to swap the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on the agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts allow the ACP to mitigate the risk of interest rate changes over the cash flow of part of the hedged debt, agreed at a floating interest rate. The fair value of interest rate swaps at the end of the reporting period is determined by discounting future cash flows using the curves at the end of the period in question and the inherent credit risk in the contract, as it is detailed further ahead. The following table details the notional principal amounts and the remaining terms of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at the end of the reporting period: Cash flow hedges (Notional: B/.800,000, effective date: May 17, 2010, maturity: November 15, 2028) (Notional: B/.1400,000, effective date: November 15, 2016, maturity: November 15, 2017) Contracts with floating interest rates Average contracted fixed and outstanding fixed payment rates interest rate Notional principal value Fair value 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Less than 5 years 1.03% 1.03% B/. 1,400,000 B/. 1,400,000 B/. 2,899 B/. 3,255 5 years or more 4.67% 4.67% B/. 800,000 B/. 800,000 B/.

Since October 20, 2009, risk management for price fluctuations on this commodity is performed mainly within the fiscal year, period that is considered representative for the implementation of appropriate commercial policies. The ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | PANAMA CANAL 157 Credit risk management It refers to the risk that the borrower or issuer of a financial asset may not comply, completely and on time, with any payment to be made in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed upon when the obligation was acquired. To mitigate the credit risk, the liquidity investment policy set limits by industry and by issuer as a result of the categorization of the Risk Assessment System adopted by the ACP, which includes the following factors: short-term risk rating, issuer leverage index, economic factor, liquidity index, and deterioration index. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of a counterparty defaulting in the payment of a security purchase transaction. The ACP does not have counterparty risk, as it buys all of its securities using the method of payment on delivery (“delivery versus payment”) through payment systems, using a custodian account. Credit risk refers to the risk that one of the parties does not comply with its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the ACP. To address this risk, ACP’s policies only allow depositing funds in banking institutions and financial instruments that have more than one short-term international investment quality risk rating not less than the following: A-2 by Standard & Poors, P-2 by Moody’s Bank Deposit Ratings, or F-2 by Fitch Ratings; and up to seven percent of the portfolio in financial instruments that have more than one short-term international investment quality risk rating not less than the following: A-3 by Standard & Poors, P-3 by Moody’s Bank Deposit Ratings, or F-3 by Fitch Ratings.

This advance is guaranteed by five letters of credit issued by a bank with a credit risk rating of A+ granted by Standard & Poors. Liquidity risk management The ACP manages the liquidity risk through continuous monitoring of the forecasted and actual cash flows, and reconciling the maturity profiles for the financial assets and liabilities. Historically, the cash generated by the ACP’s operations has been enough to cope with its operations and the requirements of its investments program, while generating adequate returns to the ACP. However, on December 2008 the ACP obtained financing in order to complement the necessities of the Canal Expansion Program. Subsequently, in September 2015, the ACP issued bonds in the capital markets in order to partially finance the new bridge across the Canal on the Atlantic Side. The credit facilities available to the ACP to reduce the liquidity risk are detailed afterwards. Interest and liquidity risk tables To finance the Canal Expansion Program for B/.2,300,000, the ACP has a Common Terms Agreement with five multilaterals agencies. Currently 4.3% of the debt is contracted at a fixed effective rate of 5.31%, and the remaining 95.7% has a moving average effective rate of 2.56%. The effective rate for the financing is 2.68%.

When such prices are not available, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. 162 Fair value measurements recognized in the statement of financial position The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequently to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels from 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observed: • Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from indicators other than quoted prices included within Level 1 which are observable for the assets or liabilities either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). • Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include indicators for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable indicators). 2017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total ASSETS: Financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income Investments available for sale B/. 1,457,096 B/.

A. for B/.30,684; this contract corresponds to the Panama Canal Expansion Program.

On November 18, 2016, the ACP learned that a bailiff of the Republic of France had ordered a cautionary measure on a time deposit of approximately B/.49,356 owned by the ACP, deposited in the New York branch, of a bank whose head office is in the United Kingdom. The measure imposed was based on an arbitration award issued on January 27, 2005 in favor of a French individual against the Transit and Land Transportation Authority of Panama and the Republic of Panama. The French individual alleges in his claim that the ACP was jointly and severally liable with the Republic of Panama for this obligation. The ACP, which is an autonomous legal entity, as established by the Political Constitution of the Republic of Panama, is not part of the controversy that originated this award, nor in solidarity with the Republic of Panama; therefore, the ACP, challenged the legitimacy of the cautionary measure and filed a request to lift the measure, as it is not a part of the dispute. On April 26, 2017, a French judge of first instance issued his decision ordering the lifting of the cautionary measure. As a result of the foregoing, the counterpart filed with the Court of Appeals of the Republic of France a request for suspension of this order and announced the filing of an appeal against this decision. On July 20, 2017, the Court of Appeals of the Republic of France rejected the request for suspension of the order issued by the judge of the first instance on April 26, so that all of the funds subject to the cautionary measure were released and transferred to the ACP. ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | PANAMA CANAL 167 Nevertheless, the appeal is still pending to be resolved in a hearing to be conducted by the Court of Appeals of the Republic of France for May 3, 2018. The notes contained herein relate to claims against the ACP and cannot, nor should not, be considered as support or proof of acceptance of responsibility on the part of the ACP. In the opinion of the Administration and its legal counsel, the determination of these matters will not have adverse effects of a significant nature on the financial position of the ACP. 30. Events that occurred after the reporting period On October 31, 2017, GUPCSA and one of its shareholders filed a request for annulment of the final award, related to the CCI 19962/ASM arbitration that was issued on July 31, 2017, at the courts of Miami, United States. The ACP considers that the likelihood of the result of this annulment request impacting the arbitration award of the cofferdam is very remote. The Board of Directors approved at its meeting on December 14, 2017, the transfer to the Treasury of the operating and functioning economic surplus corresponding to fiscal year 2017 by the amount of B/.1,193,809.
