The AIA code includes a rule related to Human Rights (rule 1.401). Where AS+GG has indirect dealings with external companies specifically manufacturers/suppliers of products that we specify for use in the buildings that we design we will develop a code of ethics that will be included as part of our product specifications. Measurement In the past year AS+GG has not been the subject of any investigations, legal claims or other action relating to human rights. LABOUR PRINCIPLES Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

This guide expects that our suppliers do not use child labour or forced labour, are committed to equal opportunities and ensure that employees have the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. Implementation All AS+GG Employees are able to join a trade union of their choice. All employees of AS+GG are expected to adhere to anti-discrimination and equal opportunities policies and confirm annually that they are aware of and adhere to these policies. In addition, an employee training programme regarding equal opportunities has been implemented and the code of conduct, described for the Human Rights Principles above is applicable in terms of elimination of discrimination. Additionally AS+GG is committed to proactively seeking opportunities to work with Minority and Women owned business Enterprises and we will begin reporting this as part of our annual Corporate Sustainability Reporting procedure. AS+GG has a balanced workforce of male and female staff but senior leadership remains male dominated, as it does throughout most architecture practices, and we are actively trying to address this situation while at the same time demonstrating leadership and providing advocacy for females in senior positions. As part of our design process we include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In our design for communities we have introduced a KPI that requires design for equal opportunities including specific strategies to support it. Measurement In the past year AS+GG has not been the subject of any investigations, legal claims or other action relating to discrimination. ENVIRONMENTAL PRINCIPALS Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture LLP 111 West Monroe Suite 2300 Chicago IL 60603 T 312 920 1888 F 312 920 1775 smithgill.com Assessment, Policy and Goals AS+GG is committed to on-going reductions in energy and resource consumption in both the buildings that we design and the way we operate From a design perspective we are globally recognized for our leadership in high performance buildings. We have developed a robust process to sustainable design working from a vision, through goals and targets and in to strategies and key performance indicators. We adopt this approach on all projects, regardless of whether the project is attempting to seek some form of green building certification or not. Our policy is to always design to exceed prevailing codes and, accepting that our buildings have to be resilient to the potential effects of climate change, we simulate performance against current and predicted weather patterns All AS+GG sub-consultants are expected to work towards the goals and targets set forth at the commencement of the project and through a rigorous design review process we are able to ensure that the buildings are designed such that the goals are met. Within the building occupied by our firm AS+GG has an environmental policy that allows us to meet the reporting requirements for the Green office Challenge. We also publish an annual Corporate Sustainability Report (CSR), in which we report on energy and resource use within the office and set targets for the upcoming year. Implementation AS+GG is a signatory to the Architecture 2030 challenge, and typically project energy targets are established based on meeting their goals. At the outset We are also corporate sponsors of the Carbon Leadership Forum, where we contribute to promoting the development of Environmental Product Declarations. We have taken a leadership position by including the requirement for suppliers to provide such declarations when we specify certain materials – notably insulation, concrete, steel and some furnishing materials. We undertake whole of building life cycle analysis (operational and embodied emissions and environmental impacts) and have established a baseline against which we can develop improvement targets. We develop and use advanced building performance simulation software throughout the design process. AS+GG has recently reviewed most of our specifications to include stringent requirements relating to life cycle assessment and use of products containing PVC. We have bi-weekly performative design lunch and learns in the office where staff present their projects and the lessons learned and technologies developed and / or implemented are shared throughout the firm. We encourage vendors and manufacturers to host lunch and learns in the office and typically we have one or sometimes two each week, to which all staff are invited and encouraged to attend. Within the office, we have replaced most of the lighting with LEDs, the remainder being CFL. We provide recycling bins throughout the office and work with the janitorial staff and building management to measure segregation performance so that we may report it within the CSR. We have funded additional staff training in Passive house design and CEEQUAL assessment for infrastructure, public realm and landscape. Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture LLP 111 West Monroe Suite 2300 Chicago IL 60603 T 312 920 1888 F 312 920 1775 smithgill.com Measurement Environmental targets for our work are continually assessed throughout the design period. We work in an integrated manner with our sub-consultants and therefore as we improve the performance of the building envelope, or integrate low water consuming fittings, the engineers are able to incorporate these savings into their design. We report project performance annually to the American Institute of Architects and in our CSR. Some buildings will undergo formal Green Building Certification and the predicted energy savings as well as other environmental performance information is reported as part of the certification submittal. Internally we report our own office’s environmental performance through the CSR and through the Green Office Initiative. ANTI‐CORRUPTION PRINCIPLES Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.
