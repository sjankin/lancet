GRI Index 67 Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company PLC A Memorable Brew Welcome to the Dilmah Sustainability Report, which covers our economic, social and environmental performance and significant events for Dilmah during the fiscal year 2017/18. We want to create a truly sustainable tea industry which is good for people, communities and the planet. For Dilmah, sustainability is a core business imperative that underpins our strategy to build a more valuable enterprise. We believe that business is a matter of human service and thus our mission is to build value through operational excellence and leading the transition to a sustainable planet and society. By emphasizing sustainable development, both as a concept and in practice, we aim to be a more robust, competitive and a resilient business in the long term. We are working to catalyze systemic changes across our own operations and the wider industry to ensure that we can continue to produce tea in a sustainable manner for many generations to come. As a family company we all share the same values, the same belief in fairness, diversity, equality and the same ambition to produce better products and enhance livelihoods. Dilmah is intensely involved in the communities in which it operates as well as indigent communities in Sri Lanka. We understand that in order to continue to succeed, we need to play our part now in conserving the environment by addressing related issues such as climate change waste management and build sustainable collaborations. We also continue to address biodiversity issues and work towards becoming more resilient. Despite current economic challenges, we continued to invest in development that makes our business more sustainable. Through Dilmah Conservation and MJF Charitable Foundation we offered additional support for projects which can deliver long term benefits. Such support is intended to improve our overall sustainability performance, contributing to long term growth in shareholder value. We want to continue to produce ethical tea for many generations to come. In line with our strategy we will continue to search for ways to make our business more sustainable and to work with others who share our values. 1.
