Local waste receivers are also used on some construction sites. The Group is currently seeking to have as many as possible voluntarily using the waste receivers with which the Group has entered into co-operation agreements. The Group is also seeking to influence some of the waste receivers, e.g. to commit to a higher degree of recycling. MTH GROUP CSR Report 2017 – Appendix 28
