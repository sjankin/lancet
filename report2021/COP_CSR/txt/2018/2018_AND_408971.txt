Once again, in 2016, we renewed the commitment we acquired in 2011 by joining the United Nations Global Compact, the principles promoted by this international initiative being the backbone of our company's policy. The ten principles of the Global Compact are always present when we plan the strategy and growth of our company. Tag Systems has renewed all its ISO certificates following all the standards of ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18000:2007, and working on the migration of ISO 9001:2015 throughout the next year. Our global objective is that TAG Systems becomes a sustainable company in terms of environment, finance, society and corporate governance, which means that in the objectives to be met year after year, we always have some that refer to these principles (this year, specifically the reduction of waste that we generate and the improvement in the working environment). With our employees, we promote different actions to improve health, well-being, quality of life and the happiness of each one of them. We are working to make the company more and more attractive to the people that work with us. We all gain, the employee is happier, the company is more efficient, and it benefits the society. For our customers, we strive to do things better every day, transmitting our commitment to them and towards the company's principles of governance: honesty, transparency, professionalism, sustainability and ethics, in all its aspects. In relation to our suppliers and the different agents with whom we have relations, we ask them to acquire the same commitment to society, human rights, the environment and we invite them to subscribe to the United Nations Global Compact, as it gives them positive points in the evaluation. We will continue to do our bit to make a fairer society and a better world. Without forgetting to thank you for your support, all this would not be possible without your collaboration.

In line with our international focus, we're strongly committed to cultural, social and religious diversity. That's why we take particular care with our external communication materials, producing content that respects such diversity. 5.2 We pass on our commitment to our suppliers At Tag Systems we extend our commitment to sustainability by incorporating social and environment criteria in our procedure to evaluate suppliers. We're aware of the importance of the materials used in manufacturing our cards and therefore select the best raw materials applying a strict approval procedure. We apply the following criteria to select our suppliers: • Whether they have any certificates and/or systems for quality, the environment or occupational health & safety • Local suppliers take priority • Environmentally-friendly products • The product's technical adaptability Every year, the Purchasing Department is responsible for monitoring suppliers who have a direct impact on the quality of our final product. This monitoring is carried out by controlling external supplies following the procedure described in the procurement policy. The Quality Department also controls materials as they are delivered, detecting any imperfections or mistakes in the material supplied, helping to avoid problems in the future with production. If any defect is detected, the Quality Department opens a Quality Non-Conformity file for the supplier and this information is used subsequently in the follow-up. Finally, the findings from evaluations are regularly passed on to our suppliers.
