Estimados amigos, 5th ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 Me da mucho gusto comunicarles a través de este medio nuestros avances y logros como empresa durante el año 2017, en el que con orgullo estamos celebrando nuestro quinto aniversario de adhesión al Pacto Mundial y sus 10 principios. Ellos han sido un pilar fundamental en nuestros esfuerzos de consolidación como una empresa socialmente responsable. El 2017 ha sido un año de retos a nivel mundial, pero también de grandes oportunidades. Lamentablemente un fuerte sismo sacudió vastas zonas de nuestro territorio nacional, sin embargo, la solidaridad y entrega de la población están haciendo posible una recuperación paulatina de los damniﬁcados. Nuestra empresa y sus colaboradores hemos levantado la mano para apoyar en la medida de nuestras posibilidades. Un logro importante de nuestra empresa este año ha sido el establecimiento de un robusto Sistema de Gestión Estratégica, que nos permitirá planear nuestras iniciativas y proyectos de una manera más profesional y posibilitará su monitoreo eﬁciente y oportuno. Este sistema, que fue implementado gracias al esfuerzo y capacidad de nuestro gran equipo directivo y gerencial, nos está preparando para afrontar un futuro de grandes retos con la idea clara de salvaguardar el bienestar de cada uno de nuestros grupos de interés. A través de las páginas de este Informe de Sustentabilidad podrán darse cuenta de las actividades más destacadas que hemos impulsado en nuestro programa de Responsabilidad Social. A nombre del Consejo de Administración de Multiceras, ratiﬁcamos nuestra adhesión al Pacto Mundial del cual nos sentimos muy orgullosos de formar parte.

PRESIDENT AND CEO’S COMMITMENT LETTER Dear Friends: It is a pleasure for me to share with you our progress and achievements in 2017, a year in which we are proudly celebrating our ﬁfth anniversary of adherence to the UN Global Compact and its Ten Principles. These principles have been a fundamental pillar in our commitment to being a socially responsible company. This was a year of great challenges worldwide, but also of great opportunity. In 2017 two massive earthquakes that caused the widespread loss of life, injuries, and destruction struck Mexico City and Oaxaca. But the solidarity and generosity of the Mexican people are helping its victims gradually recover their homes and businesses and rebuild their lives. Our company and our employees have raised our hands in support as much as possible. An important achievement this year has been the establishment of a robust strategic management system, which will allow us to plan initiatives and projects in a more efﬁcient manner and facilitate more timely monitoring. The system was implemented thanks to the efforts of our talented management team who are always focused on improving the welfare of all of our stakeholders. Throughout the pages of this report you will see highlights of the activities we have promoted in our social responsibility program in 2017. On behalf of the Multiceras Board of Directors, we reafﬁrm our adherence to the Global Compact, of which we are very proud to be a part. Sincerely, Raúl Marmolejo Vélez President and CEO -12. ABOUT US Multiceras is a Mexican company specializing in the design, fabrication, and commercialization of natural, synthetic, and petroleum waxes, as well as related products for industrial applications. Our production facility is located in García, Nuevo León, México.

In 1978, the company was founded under the name Baldini, S.A., by Noé Marmolejo and Robert Baldini to export beeswax to the United States. In 1986, Robert Baldini sold his shares to the Marmolejo family, and since then the company has been 100% Mexican-owned.

MULTICERAS AND SUSTAINABILITY From the company’s beginnings, Multiceras founder Noé Marmolejo has fostered a culture of social responsibility within the community, contributing to different causes to help vulnerable and unprotected groups. In 2012 our Board of Directors decided to formalize these efforts, which led to our achieving the Socially Responsible Company award granted by CEMEFI (Mexican Center for Philanthropy) to companies that undertake actions that have a positive impact on society. We have continued to integrate social responsibility into all aspects of our operations and are proud to have received the CEMEFI Socially Responsible Company award for ﬁve consecutive years. Lorem ipsum In the past ﬁve years we have implemented several initiatives aimed at supporting two of our most important stakeholders: 1) our employees and their families, and 2) the Candelilleros (the people dedicated to the A great success for the program was our adherence to extraction of candelilla wax). Our Healthy Life program, the UN Global Compact, as it has helped us to focus our which includes the access to a nutritionist, has helped efforts on the important things. Thanks to the webinars employees lose weight and increase their quality of life, organized by the Mexican chapter of the Global Comas has our support of their participation in sports pact, we have been able to learn from other companies’ activities, such as monthly races and soccer leagues. best practices.

We have been able to beneﬁt 911 children with school supplies and Christmas gifts. Through collaboration with clients such as L'Oréal and Yokozeki, we operate projects to improve the quality of life of Candelilleros and their families. Also, we have worked diligently to ensure the sustainability of the candelilla plant allowing Candelilleros to continue using the plant to produce candelilla wax well into the future. There are still many things to do, roads to travel, and lessons to learn. But with our enthusiastic, innovative, and committed employees to help us, we will face the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities the future holds for us. -3-44. OUR COMMITMENT TO UN 2030 AGENDA In 2015 world leaders at the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the related 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which govern participating countries’ efforts to achieve a sustainable world in the year 2030. The achievement of these Sustainable Development Goals will lead to a reduction of social and economic inequality, giving rise to a more just society, with populations that have greater welfare, and the development of activities conducive to protecting and preserving the environment. At Multiceras we recognize our ethical duty to contribute to social and economic development. We align our business strategy and our operations with the Sustainable Development Goals and strive to exceed the expectations of our customers while complying with international production standards and environmental and labor best practices. We also set social targets for donations, volunteerism, and creating economic opportunities for marginalized communities. In each section of this report we present the different Sustainable Development Goals we are trying to achieve along with our actions and results to date. -45. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY POLICY Multiceras is committed to operating through a sustainable work model based on the continuity and ﬁnancial health of our business, respect and care for the environment, and our contribution to society’s well-being. Multiceras has established the following objectives for our stakeholders: SHAREHOLDERS Maximize the economic value of the business with sustained performance, assuring its leadership and continuity while promoting ethical and transparent behavior. CUSTOMERS Respect customers’ rights by providing clear information about our products and services, developing improvements to increase customer satisfaction, and implementing fair and transparent trade policies. SUPPLIERS Lorem ipsum Deem our suppliers as allies and long-term strategic partners within our value chain by arranging win-win agreements that align with their objectives and contribute to their development. EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES Provide a welcoming work environment by encouraging quality working life initiatives throughout the company, ensuring physical integrity, promoting diversity and equal opportunity in the workplace, and creating programs for employees’ families. COMMUNITY Promote improvements in quality of life of the communities near our operations and those where our employees live. ENVIRONMENT Use manufacturing processes that do not negatively affect the environment, including operations and new technologies that minimize residues, reduce energy usage, prevent air and water pollution, and comply with environmental regulations. CANDELILLEROS Support the Candelillero community by encouraging personal development and training, improving work safety conditions, promoting the settlement of local families in rural areas, and supporting sustainable development programs. -56. IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS Thanks to good 2016 ﬁnancial results, in 2017 we were able to implement various improvement projects, such as increasing our plant’s capacity to satisfy customer demand and improving the comfort of our employees whose numbers have swelled in line with the growth of our business. 6.1 Changes in Dining 6.2 Water Softeners for 6.3 Press Filter Room Emulsions Improvements We purchased new dining room A pair of water softeners with a In order to obtain the HACCP (Hazard furniture to increase its capacity and capacity of 8,500 gallons was installed Analysis and Critical Control Point) installed new lamps with greater to eliminate water hardness (Calcium, certiﬁcation, the press ﬁlter was energy efﬁciency.

This project helped us increase the key personnel. capacity of the emulsions area by 50%, which will satisfy current demand and prepare us for future growth. -67. HUMAN RIGHTS At Multiceras we are not just a company; we are an organization — that is, a group of people working towards a common goal. In this sense, protecting human rights is fundamental to maintaining our integrity and ideals as a socially responsible company. We respect and adopt the principles of the Global Compact as a mutually beneﬁcial objective in our operations, and we support the protection of the rights of individuals, not only from our employees but from all those over whom we have inﬂuence. In accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals, we are committed to never being accomplices in the violation of these rights, and we have created and continuously monitor mechanisms within Multiceras that combat discrimination, harassment, and inequality through the promotion of communication, health, education, and professional development. Multiceras supplies the wax that our sister company Aztec Plumbing uses to make its wax rings. The two companies share Administration, Human Resources, and Social Responsibility departments, so many of the following targets are common to both. -77.1 Employees 7.1.1 Communication and Transparency We ﬁrmly believe that communication and transparency at work is vital, as it is very important that employees are focused on organizational objectives. a) E-mail and Suggestion Box We have an e-mail account for employees to communicate with management anonymously (cuentanos@multiceras.com). Our Human Resources Manager and Sustainability Leader receive these e-mails. We also have a suggestion box at our plant entrance, which is monitored by the Social Responsibility department. All complaints received are handled conﬁdentially and, depending on the complaint or suggestion, are resolved immediately or included in an action plan, which is monitored by the Social Responsibility department. b) Breakfast with the CEO In order to encourage greater communication between the areas and to learn about employee concerns ﬁrst-hand, breakfasts are held periodically with our CEO and two members of the administrative team. During 2017 three breakfasts were organized with 39 employees who shared their expectations, experiences, and concerns. The Human Resources department has followed up on the 24 issues that were raised during the breakfasts of which 67% have been resolved as of this writing. c) Quarterly Communication Meeting Each quarter our CEO conducts a Skype meeting with all employees to report on company progress and activities. The meetings are recorded and can be accessed by employees who work on other shifts. d) Newsletter Our Marketing department publishes a quarterly newsletter containing highlights from managers on what is happening in each area of the company. -87.1.2 Safety Safety plays a vital role in our day-to-day operations, and we are committed to maintaining and promoting this value among all employees. We have strict regulations, which are constantly promoted and mandatory for all staff. Each new hire is required to undergo induction training on our Safety Policy, as well as follow-up training. a) Fire-Fighting System b) Health and Safety Committee c) Ministry of Labor and We have had a ﬁre-ﬁghting system Multiceras has a Health and Safety Social Welfare Self-Managesince 2014.

We provide an ofﬁce near the reception area where a registered nurse monitors the health of all employees and provides ﬁrst aid. The nurse is also responsible for assessing contractors to ensure that they are ﬁt for their work. -107.1.3 Personal and Professional Development We contribute to the development of employees through practices, programs and events that motivate their work performance and improve their quality of life. a) Training David Estrada Professional development within the Certiﬁcate in Industrial Environmental organization is very important, which is Protection why we seek to keep employees (IPA Instituto para la Protección up-to-date in their respective areas.

This year we provided six English scholarships, one technical school scholarship, and one Yessica Maritza Valencia Luna master’s degree scholarship. Studying English I joined Multiceras in February 2017 as a shift leader in the production area. I am grateful to Multiceras for accepting my request for a course to improve my English. This opportunity has encouraged me to continue with my studies and to improve my job performance. I feel more confident when I have contact with our foreign clients during visits and tours within the company and communicate more effectively. -11c) Activities and Events We organize recreational activities to promote family life while preserving and celebrating Mexican traditions and holidays. All employees are invited to participate if they wish. Events are also held to celebrate important dates where all employees are invited to attend along with their families. A total of MXN$504,361 was invested in activities in 2017. ACTIVITIES EVENTS •Rosca de Reyes (January 6) •Children’s Day and Mother’s Day •La Candelaria Day (Candlemas) (February 2) •End of the Year Celebration •International Women’s Day •Father’s Day •Independence Day •Day of the Dead •Guadalupe Virgin Day d) Running Club e) Football Team We have a running club named “MAZ + RUNNERS” Since 2011 we have sponsored a soccer team in the where Multiceras sponsors 50% of the race registraLomas Soccer league in Garcia, Nuevo León, by donation fee for each employee and one family member.

Vision A Visual Health campaign is organized every year, where Multiceras invites different suppliers to perform a vision assessment on all staff. In 2017 39 people were provided with eyeglasses, representing an investment of MXN$31,200. School Supplies Support Multiceras provides a bonus for school support to employees’ children from kindergarten to high school to purchase school supplies at the start of classes. In 2017, 30 children beneﬁted from this program, representing an investment of MXN$38,000. Transportation Multiceras has a ﬂeet of three minibuses to provide transportation for employees to and from work. Event Facility Spending time with our families and friends helps us improve our physical and emotional well-being. Multiceras has a recreational facility that provides space for employees to conduct celebrations with family and friends at no cost. During 2017, 12 employees made use of this facility. Christmas Present Bonus Every December Multiceras gives a MXN$450 Christmas present to employees’ children under the age of 12. In 2017, 93 children were given the present, representing an investment of MXN$41,850. Birth, Death, and Marriage Support •Birth: A cash bonus is given to employees who have a new baby. Twelve employees received this bonus in 2017. •Death: When an immediate family member of an employee dies, a cash bonus is given to help with expenses. Five employees received this bonus in 2017. •Marriage: A cash bonus is given to employees who get married. Three employees received this bonus in 2017. Healthy Eating Program In January 2016 we started the Healthy Eating program, where a nutritionist comes to our facilities and makes an anthropometric assessment to interested employees. Everyone is given advice and a diet. The company subsidizes 80% of the cost. During 2017, 63 employees participated, achieving the total loss of 285 kg, which constitutes an improvement of 85% against last year’s results of 154 kg. To motivate employees to meet their personal goals to lose weight, in September we launched a contest called Challenge 87. Each week, the 34 participants went to the nurse to follow up on their weight. The challenge lasted 87 days, and winners were awarded cash prizes and days of paid leave. Anti-stress Massages This year we started an anti-stress massage program for administrative staff. Every month, a masseuse from the National School of the Blind comes to our facilities to provide 20-minute massage to employees. -137.2 Candelilleros One of our most popular products is candelilla wax, which is made from an indigenous plant that grows wild in the Chihuahuan Desert. The well-being of the Candelilleros who harvest the candelilla plant and extract its wax is fundamental to our operations. In 2017 we implemented several strategic social responsibility projects to support the communities where these rural producers live, providing them with economic opportunities through self-employment, promoting education, and linking them to critical social services. 7.2.1 Candelilla Region in Mexico The Chihuahuan Desert is located in the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosí, Zacatecas, Durango, Nuevo León, and Coahuila. It is in this last state, Coahuila, where we ﬁnd most of the Candelilleros dedicated to the extraction of Candelilla wax. 7.2.2. Guaranteed Production Purchase Multiceras purchases candelilla wax from 1,800 Candelilleros throughout the region. We offer Candelilleros a guaranteed production quota, and, as we have the widest collection network of any company in the business, we can reach the most remote communities. We have an ofﬁce in Saltillo, as well as a storage facility in Cuatrocienegas, which is where much of the candelilla wax is produced. We support our Candelilleros by installing a paila (a rectangular metal container where the candelilla wax is processed) and providing them with the chemical agent that is used for the extraction of the wax, either sulfuric acid or citric acid. In addition, they are provided with a cutter, which is a metal tank where they semi-reﬁne the wax. 7.2.3. Sustainability of the Candelilla Plant To be able to harvest candelilla on their land, Candelilleros must have a study done by a registered forestry technician, who issues a harvesting permit to SEMARNAT (Mexico’s Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources) for approval. Multiceras is aware of the importance of such studies to ensure the sustainability of the candelilla plant, and we provide the Candelilleros with advice, training, and ﬁnancial support to obtain this permit. In 2017 Multiceras increased its agri-business personnel, and we now have 12 forestry technicians dedicated to managing harvesting permits. These technicians work closely with candelilla wax producers to ensure the permits are carried out in accordance with SEMARNAT standards. -147.2.4 Decent Working Conditions One of the variables that directly inﬂuences Candelilleros’ quality of life is the income they receive for what they produce. During 2017 a signiﬁcant increase in the price of candelilla wax, combined with the introduction of social security beneﬁts, provided Candelilleros greater satisfaction in their daily lives. This complemented our efforts to improve their productivity by providing them with training and equipment. Multiceras also helps producers to adopt better and safer production practices. In 2017 Multiceras invested MXN$2,950,000 in the following activities: • 43 technical studies • 40 hours of training on forest regulation • 40 hours of training in candelilla plant reforestation, • Installation of 75 new pailas • Repair of 20 pailas Additionally, Multiceras helped to carry out technical studies in ﬁve communities with resources contributed by CONAFOR (National Forestry Commission). We also participated with CONAZA (National Commission of Arid Zones) to equip three extraction modules that included a laminated roof, concrete ﬂoor, hoist, and cyclonic mesh, which beneﬁted 20 Candelilleros. 7.2.5 Production Incentives In December 2017, 581 food baskets were delivered to Candelilleros who sold us 600 kg or more of wax throughout the year. We also offer our candelilla collectors (those who collect the extracted candelilla wax from the Candelilleros) with economic incentives for their services. In total we invested MXN$152,220 in these initiatives. 7.2.6 Improvement Project In late 2013 we began a project to use citric acid to extract candelilla wax instead of the traditional sulfuric acid. Citric acid is safer to handle because it is less corrosive, but it is more expensive than sulfuric acid. The change in the process cannot be implemented in all production sites at the same time, as there is a training period during which the Candelilleros gain experience with the new process to ensure a successful transition. During 2017, 25 communities completed the training process in the use of citric acid. We now have 45 communities in total enabled with this new extraction agent, and we plan to expand to at least 10 other communities in 2018. -157.2.5 Supplier Development Program In 2015 we formed a strategic partnership with INNOVAGRO (Consultants for Agricultural Innovation North SC) to begin a supplier development program dedicated to improving the working conditions of Candelilleros by creating rural production societies or SPRs (Sociedades de Producción Rural in Spanish) for candelilla wax producers to formalize their activities and obtain beneﬁts from membership. The SPRs ease the administrative burden on Candelilleros by generating invoices for them. Candelilleros are also given access to lines of credit and government funds to improve their facilities, as well as social security beneﬁts through the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS). At the end of 2017, 382 Candelilleros were enrolled in the program. So far, eight Candelilleros have retired and are receiving their pensions. In March 2017 L'Oréal and Multiceras entered into a candelilla sustainable sourcing agreement with INNOVAGRO as veriﬁer. The agreement has two objectives: 1) to increase Candelilleros’ quality of life through access to IMSS beneﬁts, and 2) to improve safety conditions by substituting citric acid for sulfuric acid in the wax extraction process. L'Oréal and Multiceras each pay 50% of the cost of participating Candelilleros’ social security contributions. In addition, L'Oréal pays any incremental cost associated with the use of the safer citric acid (instead of sulfuric acid) for the candelilla wax it purchases. The objectives for the ﬁrst year of the agreement were met. Multiceras is proud to work with global sustainability leader L'Oréal. 7.3 Community We consider “community” to not only include the people living near our facilities, but also the neighborhoods where our employees live, the organizations that help people in Monterrey, schools, universities, and, in general, all those groups of people who every day face their own problems and whom we can support either with our money or our time. It is a privilege to be in a position to help others, and we encourage our employees to contribute where they can — for example, through donations, participating in rafﬂes, and volunteering. -167.1.2 Seguridad La seguridad tiene un rol vital en el desarrollo de las actividades del día a día en Multiceras y es nuestro compromiso mantener y fomentar este valor entre todos los colaboradores.

Since 2014 the Families of Love project has placed children with adoptive or foster families. In 2017 we donated MXN$10,000 that was used for the maintenance of 70 children. We hope to continue helping them in the future. c) Football Soccer Uniforms A football soccer team was formed in our ofﬁce in Saltillo, Coahuila, with employees and students who help with sampling activities. They requested our support to buy their uniforms. d) Support for victims of the earthquake In support of all the people who suffered damages during the September 2017 Mexico City earthquake, our employees donated non-perishable food, ﬁrst aid supplies, and protective equipment.

After inviting all staff, 27 employees and their families gave their time and dedication to personally assist the community and perform maintenance and painting tasks for the school. To determine what work needed to be done, our volunteers visited the school ﬁrst to meet with teachers and parents, who were invited to participate hand-in-hand in the improvement of their school. e) Yokozeki Donation In 2016 our Candelilla wax client Yokozeki generously offered a donation to help Candelillero communities. This year they again decided to donate US$4,300 to support two Candelillero communities: Cosme and Noria La Sabina in Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila. The money was used to buy material to improve the Ezequiel Chávez and Morelos schools. Three rigid roofs were also installed in pailas, with the aim of protecting Candelilleros from the weather when extracting candelilla wax. Additionally, in Cosme, a pump was ﬁnanced to extract water from the community's dam. Several Yokozeki employees visited the communities to better understand the wax extraction process and to get to know the communities they were aiding and see the improvements they were helping to implement. -197.1.2 Seguridad 8.

Thanks to the support of my colleagues and the trust of my superiors, I had the opportunity to receive training and get involved in other activities in the administration area.

Since 2013 I have held the position of Administration and Finance Manager, where I seek to contribute my knowledge to the achievement of the company's objectives. Belonging to the Multiceras family these 15 years has meant a lot to me personally and professionally. I thank the Board of Directors and my colleagues for the trust placed in me.

In recruiting, hiring, promoting, rewarding, and terminating employees, we do not discriminate with regard to religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or social status. -249. ENVIRONMENT At present we are living with the consequences of a linear production model characterized by excess demand for resources, water stress, and incessant pollution. The transition to a society that is friendlier to the environment and respectful of natural resources is one of the greatest challenges of our time. This is why we continuously strive to make the most of our resources and reduce our waste. 9.1 Efﬁcient Use of Resources We seek to reduce the consumption of water, gas, and energy in our operations, as well as to make our processes more efﬁcient so that these resources are used efﬁciently. 9.1.1 Water and Gas In the year 2017 we had an increase of 47% in the production of emulsions, which caused a similar growth in water consumption. In terms of gas, we had a consumption reduction of 8%, as a result of lower demand for our solid products. 9.1.2 Energy The reduction in energy consumption in all operations not only brings signiﬁcant beneﬁts to the environment, but also results in competitiveness by reducing costs. During 2017 the demand for some of our products increased, so we increased the capacity of an electrical substation from 300 kVA to 750 kVA, taking advantage of the power factor in peak demand, as well as creating capacity for future growth. We also installed 18 50-Watt LED reﬂectors in our raw materials warehouse, improving lighting and eliminating the use of incandescent lamps. These lamps consume 60% less electrical energy. 9.2 Climate Action In October 2017 Dr. Rodolfo Morales Ibarra gave Multiceras employees a talk on Global Warming and the Climate Crisis. Dr. Morales received his training as a volunteer with The Climate Reality Project from former US Vice President Al Gore. Volunteers on this project have a mission to inform the public on this topic and possible solutions in their communities. 9.3 Environmental Responsibility At Multiceras we are committed to complying with the environmental legal framework that applies to our industry: • COA – Annual Operating Certiﬁcate (It includes air emissions report, sewage water and dangerous residues) • DAR – Report of wastewater discharge in accordance with the provisions of the norm NOM-002-SEMARNAT-1996. • MIA – Environmental Impact Statement. In this study, adverse environmental impacts that may arise during the operation stage were evaluated. This document was authorized by the Secretariat for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. -259.4 Campaign 3-R’s: Reduce. Reuse. Recycle. A good practice to save our environment is recycling. Some of our raw materials come in cardboard packaging, so recycling this material can help safeguard the environment. Approximately every ton of recycled cardboard saves 140 liters of oil, 50,000 liters of water, 2m³ of landﬁll space, and 900 kg of CO2. In parallel with this practice, we are also seeking to reduce the purchase of raw materials packed in this manner. 9.4.1 Reduce Leased Computer Equipment: At present 80% of our equipment is leased from Hewlett-Packard Mexico under contracts of 24 and 36 months. At the end of these contracts we return the equipment or, if advantageous, we acquire the equipment at a reasonable cost. 9.4.2 Reuse Remanufactured Print Cartridges: Our supplier provides us with remanufactured print cartridges, as well as service, repair, and quality guarantees for them. This is good for the environment and saves us up to 70% in our cost of supplies. 9.4.3 Recycle Cardboard and Wood: We recycle cardboard and wood that we use in our processes. We also recycle small quantities of aluminum cans, PET, and used batteries. 2015 2016 2017 Pallets 2,619 3,690 4,751 (wood) pieces pieces pieces Cardboard 26,731 31,203 34,233 kg kg kg 9.4.4 Green Week Campaign To commemorate World Environment Day (June 5), all employees were given a reusable water bottle, and 25 employees received a tree to plant. -269.5 Candelilla Plant Domestication Project In March 2017 we began a domestication and acceleration of the growth of the candelilla plant (euphorbia antisyphilitica) project for the production of wax using the abiotic stress technique. The objectives of this project are to: 1. Identify macro elements to use as fertilizers to accelerate and induce the production of biomass in the candelilla plant and explore the possibility of using wastewater from Candelillero communities as a water supply for the crop. 2. Establish conditions to induce abiotic stress in candelilla at the ﬁeld level during the rainy season. 3. Discover genetic lines of candelilla that perform better. 9.6 Candelilla Plant Reforestation In 2015 Mexico’s National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) provided resources to the Candelillero community of Las Ánimas, Municipality of Parras, Coahuila, to help reforest 240 hectares of the Candelilla plant and to train rural producers on the care of the approximately 150,000 small plants. In order to understand the factors necessary for the plants’ survival, a follow-up project is being carried out in three Candelilla plantations in the state of Coahuila: • Hipólito, Municipality of General Cepeda • Las Ánimas, Municipality of Parras • Lucio Blanco, Municipality of Cuatrociénegas Multiceras has been a facilitator within these communities to obtain authorization to carry out the research. We have also provided economic assistance and vehicles for the transfer of the teams that obtain and analyze the ﬁeld data. As a result of the monitoring project of these plantations, it was concluded that the plants with the highest survival rate are located in higher altitude areas above sea level, such as Las Ánimas, which is 1,890 meters above sea level. Regarding the number of stems or rods, better results are obtained using at least 20 stems with rhizomes. In 2018 the aforementioned plantations will continue to be evaluated to determine the rate and causes of mortality, as well as regrowth, in order to have more data on better reforestation techniques. -279.7 Drawing Contest As in previous years, in 2017 we organized a drawing contest for employees’ children. The contest helps to promote family values, and participants are invited to reﬂect on the environment. This year the theme was Animals in Danger of Extinction, and we had a record number of participants, with 42 children up to 12 years old submitting their work. The winners in 2017 were: Gerson Ismael Gallardo González 6 years old Most original drawing prize We liked his drawing very much because in addition to drawing a Mexican Gray Wolf with great skill, he explained that this animal symbolizes Chantico, the pre-Hispanic goddess of ﬁre. Alondra Abigail Rangel Vázquez 11 years old Most artistic drawing prize Her drawing is excellent, and Alondra included various details, such as feathers and tree leaves from the habitat of the Red Macaw. Luis Sámano Saavedra 11 years old Most scientiﬁc drawing prize Luis included an explanation of the plight of the habitat of the Macaws and why they are in danger of extinction. Dactima Yuriria Arroyo Santos 9 years old Most colorful drawing prize We chose her drawing because she used the whole range of greens and blues, achieving a very nice drawing with a funny turtle. -2810. ANTICORRUPTION AND FAIR TRADE Corruption and abuses seem to be inherent in government. However, these would not be possible without the protection of the population and the companies that facilitate and sometimes promote it. As part of our ideals, our values, and the principles of the Global Compact, we categorically reject any kind of corruption, extortion, or bribery. At Multiceras we know that the only way to ﬁght corruption is to do the right thing. In addition to avoiding bribery, extortion, and other forms of corruption, we have also developed speciﬁc policies and programs to address these issues. We pledge to respect the law and to promote our corporate values both inside and outside the company, especially when dealing with our customers and suppliers. 10.1 Ethical Finance Multiceras has a Department of Administration and Finance that is responsible for managing and safeguarding the assets of the company with an eye toward proﬁt and growth for the company and for its stakeholders. We strive to maintain best practices by establishing policies and procedures to help us achieve our goals, which are aligned with the mission, vision, and values of the company. Furthermore, and to ensure proper compliance with the obligations of the business, we conduct periodic reviews with tax and accounting experts to validate that the operation of the business is conducted in accordance with all laws and regulations. 10.2 Industry Associations Multiceras participates in various chambers and associations aimed at promoting better business practices, sharing information, and lobbying national and international regulatory bodies to support the market. The organizations in which we participate are: • CANACINTRA – Industry and Transformation National Chamber • CAINTRA – Industry and Transformation Chamber of Nuevo Leon • Clúster Agroalimentario – Agribusiness Cluster • Sociedad de Químicos Cosmetólogos de México A.C. (Mexican Society of Chemical Cosmetologists) • European Wax Federation -2910.3 Conﬂict of Interest Multiceras has a Conﬂict of Interest Policy to prevent the personal interests of an employee from inﬂuencing his or her judgment on decisions made on behalf of the company. When starting to work for the company, all employees must read and sign this policy. 10.4 Software Copyright We respect copyright, and 100% of the software we use has a valid license. 10.5 Ethical Commercial Relations We have speciﬁc objectives for our customers and suppliers. We are aware of the important role these stakeholders play in the success and permanence of our company, and this is why we seek to establish greater clarity in business relationships. 10.5.1 Customers Multiceras has a number of practices to establish a win-win relationship with our customers: a) We have a sales team, which is responsible for ﬁnding new customers and servicing current customers. b) Our customer service team tracks orders and is responsible for following up on customer satisfaction indicators. c) We have established quality management indicators to measure customer satisfaction on items such as delivery time, quantity delivered, and functionality. d) We set contribution margins to allow us to be competitive in the markets we serve. e) According to customer needs and speciﬁcations, contracts are established or purchase orders are created. f) If an order does not meet a customer’s speciﬁcations our quality team follows a protocol to solve the problem. g) For international sales, all legal requirements are veriﬁed and met to export our products. -3010.5.2 Suppliers Multiceras has a number of practices to establish a win-win relationship with our suppliers: a) We have a supplier selection process in which we evaluate value propositions and choose the most suitable supplier for our requirements. b) Approximately 75% of our suppliers are Mexican, which helps to promote the local economy. c) We are constantly working with suppliers to improve products, processes, and prices to the beneﬁt of both parties. d) We make and receive plant visits for current and potential suppliers to conﬁrm capacity and standards that may be needed to meet future customer requirements. e) We attend wax conferences organized by the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, attend the annual meeting of the European Wax Federation, and cultivate vendor relationships at these events. f) We encourage open communication at all levels of the company: buyer, purchasing manager, CEO, and president. g) We establish terms that are successful for both parties. Negotiations are summarized in a series of clauses in the purchase orders, mainly on product features, price, and delivery time. If suppliers do not meet these criteria, we have a direct communication with them to ﬁx the problem in the best way. -3111.
