Temporary earth drains with a concrete lining and silt traps are erected. Sunway adopts a minimal cut and fill approach to avoid importing soil for environmental and cost reasons. When constructing buildings and infrastructure, excavated soil is temporarily stored on the site for use once the foundations and basement structure have been completed. Natural lake water is used to water down construction sites to minimise dust. All trees that do not hinder construction are untouched; others are relocated to preserve the environment. TREE PLANTING PROGRAMME Sunway Property supported Penang Municipal Council of Seberang Perai (MPSP) by contributing 300 Tecoma trees to Bandar Perda, Seberang Perai. The tree planting event was held in conjunction with Malaysia’s 60th National Day on 27 August. On 11 November, Sunway Property planted 135 trees in ‘The Most Number of Amenity Trees Planted within 24 Hours’ event organised by Penang Island City Council (MBPP). The trees were planted at Sunway Cassia and Sunway Valley City. Employees, family members and friends joined forces to make Penang a greener and liveable city. 51 | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 GREEN TOWNSHIP Our tree-planting programme is facilitated by our own nursery company, Tajul Green Sdn Bhd. The selected trees are ideal as they are fast growing, canopied and require little maintenance. There are 31,779 native and 142,291 adaptive plant species in Sunway City.

E-WASTE MANAGEMENT Sunway holds an annual e-Waste Disposal Campaign. Electronic gadgets such as mobile phones, batteries, chargers and other electronic components belonging to employees and students (at Monash University and Sunway University) are disposed of in e-Waste collection bins placed in strategic locations. 54 | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 CLINICAL WASTE Sunway Medical Centre segregates clinical waste where it is disposed of in yellow step-bins which are collected several times each day and are wheeled to the interim Clinical Waste Storage Chamber. They are collected by a licensed contractor and transported to the incineration plant. A clinical waste summary collection report, along with copies of all consignment notes for the month, is sent to Selangor State Department of Environment as per regulations. WHAT HAPPENS ONCE OUR CLINICAL WASTE HAS BEEN COLLECTED BY A LICENSED CONTRACTOR? Clinical waste arriving at the incineration plant is weighed before being transferred for disposal. Bins are unloaded into a hopper and cleaned for reuse. The waste is incinerated at over 1,000°C, which is gradually reduced to 280°C in the quenching system and 200°C by the air preheater. The flue gas is passed through a mixture of lime and activated carbon prior to entering the multi-cyclone and filter bag house. The clean flue gas is extracted by an Induced Draft Fan and passed through a 15-metre stack. This process is monitored in real time using a Continuous Emission Monitoring System as required by the Department of Environment. Daily collection of Clinical Waste from wards in lockable wheeled bins Daily wastes are collected, weighed and kept in Sunway Medical Centre’s clinical waste storage Dedicated trucks collect clinical waste from Sunway Medical Centre and deliver it to the incineration plant Received clinical waste is weighed to check it is the same as that despatched from the hospital Clinical waste is sent for incineration 55 | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 RECYCLABLE WASTE Recyclable waste separation is practised in all Sunway properties. Recyclable bins are placed in public common areas or back-of-house. WHAT HAPPENS ONCE OUR SCHEDULED WASTE HAS BEEN COLLECTED BY A LICENSED CONTRACTOR? Sunway adheres to the waste packaging and labelling requirements set by the Department of Environment When our scheduled waste arrives at the incinerator plant, the trucks and their contents are weighed. A waste inspection and sampling team inspects and takes samples of the waste. The waste containers are bar-coded. Following laboratory analysis, the waste consignment is transferred to temporary storage for treatment or disposal. The Incineration Plant ensures a thermal destruction efficiency of 99.9999%, which meets DOE licensing conditions for incineration emissions. Scheduled wastes are incinerated and transformed into carbon dioxide, water vapour, hydrogen chloride gas, sulphur dioxide gas, slag and fly ash. Inorganic liquid wastes such as spent acid and alkaline, chromate and cyanide wastes are treated in the Physical/Chemical Treatment (PCT) Plant. The solidification/stablisation plant continues the process of rendering the treated waste from the Physical/Chemical Treatment (PCT) Plant and other processes by solidifying the waste via fixation before being disposed of in secured landfill. 56 | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 WATER MANAGEMENT Sunway does its utmost to protect this valuable resource and use it sparingly wherever IMPORTANCE possible.
