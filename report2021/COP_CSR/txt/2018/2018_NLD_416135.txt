In 2017 Stahl made significant progress towards achieving its goal of a transparent supply chain. The acquisition of the BASF Leather Chemicals division, completed in October 2017, is an important step towards that goal. The renowned “We see sustainability product leadership of BASF and the complementary activities related to sustainability and transparency that as a great opportunity were undertaken in recent years are already integrated into Stahl’s strategy implementation. to drive positive change In 2017 we expanded our activities to include more of in the industry” the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals to which we are aligning and we remain committed to the UN Global Compact. I am glad to report that Stahl is on course to We hope that you enjoy reading about the sustainability meet its 2020 target of C02 emissions reduction, thanks projects that we are working on around the world, and to sourcing renewable energy and to investments at our we look forward to sharing them with you during the manufacturing sites in recent years. We have also included coming year. information based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Core disclosures (see annex), with a view to a more Best regards, integrated reporting structure in the future. In my travels during 2017, I have observed how environmental and social responsibility have become the main topic of conversation with our customers and Huub van Beijeren partners in the industry. Whether it is eliminating restricted CEO substances, substituting solvent with water, using alternative energy sources, reducing pollution, improving water effluent management or implementing codes of conduct, Stahl is deeply involved in initiatives that are having a positive effect on the industry. Indeed, while Stahl is fully aware of the challenges, we continue to view them as a great opportunity, to take action and create a better future. 4 Sustainability Report 2017 5 Highlights 2017 New Center of Excellence bluesign® system partner Post Graduate Certificate course VOC emissions laboratory In June 2017, Stahl opened a Stahl achieved bluesign® system partner status in with the University of Northampton At our headquarters in Waalwijk we invested in state-ofnew Center of Excellence in Parets July 2017.

The Sustainability team meets regularly with communications, marketing, SBU managers, researchers, product stewardship, procurement and operations staff to monitor the implementation of its strategy and to discuss progress on new initiatives related to innovation, portfolio management and environmental performance. The Sustainability team also supports commercial activities initiated by customers that are related to sustainability. KPIs related to safety, health and environment are reported monthly by regional operational staff at the Stahl manufacturing sites and a consolidated report is issued by the Sustainability team. Strategy, governance Implementation: The Stahl Sustainability Standard To achieve our sustainability goal, we have identified five focus areas: and implementation � Raw Materials suppliers and the products and services they provide � Responsible Operations all activities associated with our laboratories, offices and manufacturing sites � Trusted Partnerships cooperation with third parties throughout the supply chain � Innovative Solutions the products and services that we offer to our customers � People & Society employees and the communities around us Our Sustainability Scope � The promotion of environmentally and socially responsible practices � The use of natural and renewable resources wherever possible, as long as the environmental impact of their use is favorable People & Society � The reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions Raw Materials Goals & Strategy Stahl’s goal is to achieve a ‘crystal clear’ supply chain and our strategy is to initiate and sponsor projects that promote greater transparency in the markets that we serve. This involves deep cooperation with our partners in the supply chain. We chose this strategy because we believe that only through Innovative Solutions The Stahl transparency can a more sustainable industry be achieved. We also recognize that sustainability Sustainability represents a significant opportunity for Stahl, to gain competitive advantage in the marketplace Standard and to drive operational excellence throughout the company. Responsible Operations A sustainable future Trusted Stahl’s membership in the UN Global Compact and its alignment to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Partnerships Goals is a clear indication of its commitment to a more sustainable future. To demonstrate its progress, the Stahl sustainability report is submitted each year to the UN Global Compact. Information on the UN Global Compact can be found on page 25. 8 Sustainability Report 2017 9 Restricted Substances chain is long and complex and the Stahl RSL A fundamental element of most ZDHC foundation is cooperating In addition to adhering to companies chemical management closely with its members to drive the Manufacturing Restricted system is a Restricted Substances industry-wide change.

Stahl is therefore committed to Operations the highest standards as outlined in its policy statements and documents. Stahl’s SHE organization Stahl believes that all employees are responsible for safety. To support this we appointed a Global SHE and The impact of our operations on the environment Process Safety Manager who will set the Safety, Health and Environment strategy, standards and policies of the and the well-being of our employees is a priority company. He also coordinates and ensures the fulfillment for Stahl. We have many policies and initiatives of such policies and standards, and implements them in place to ensure continuous improvement. throughout the company, including changes of behavior and training for the required competencies. All Local Managers and General Managers are responsible for implementing the Stahl SHE Policy and Principles in areas under their control. This responsibility includes systems for the recognition of hazards, assessment of risks and provision of effective controls. 12 Sustainability Report 2017 13 Safety Key Performance Indicators Focus on CO2, Energy, Water and Waste To ensure continued improvement in the evaluation and prevention of risks, Stahl tracks indicators of progress Stahl is continuously upgrading its production sites and footprint. Stahl monitors and reports CO2, energy, waste on safety. Each month we report our injuries, incidents, audits, trainings, engineering projects and other prevention laboratory facilities in order to achieve energy, waste and and water consumption at its manufacturing sites methods internally and to our shareholders. water efficiencies that lead to an improved environmental on a monthly basis. 2017 2016 CO2 Emissions Target Reportable (LTA) injuries 6 3 In line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, Stahl has scope 2 only (emissions including business travel) and Serious injuries 4 5 a global CO2 emissions reduction target of 10% (per tons uses 2015 emissions as a baseline, per tons produced.

Even though the production volume increased in 2017, the energy per tons produced slightly decreased. Deliveries are made in liquid form, in bulk, and the material is stored in a heated vessel. This simplifies the current procedures of cooling, drumming, re-melting and discharging the solid polyol from drums.
