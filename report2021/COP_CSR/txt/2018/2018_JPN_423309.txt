and environment technology, we are contributing to the creation of responsible and sustainable societies. On behalf of Fuji Electric, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to our stakeholders for their continued support and commitment to the Company. Turning an eye to the international stage, we will see a movement to realize a sustainable society by achieving economic growth, while also addressing social issues pertaining to energy, the environment, human rights, and other areas. This movement is exemplified by the adoption of the Paris Agreement, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, a set of international goals to be accomplished in order to realize a sustainable society. Efforts to address global warming, air pollution, and other environmental issues are being advanced through the spread of renewable energy, the development of more energy efficient equipment and devices, and the promotion of electric vehicles, or EVs. At the same time, the evolution of IoT, AI, and other technologies bring with them the potential to revolutionize manufacturing. These factors are driving the transformation of society as a whole. In the midst of this progress, Fuji Electric remains committed to further developing the energy and environment technology it has honed over the more than 90 years since its founding in 1923. Through this process, we will turn a sincere eye to the issues faced by our customers and the ever-changing society as we work together with them to resolve these issues. As responsible corporate citizens in a global society, we pledge to strengthen our trusting relationships with stakeholders and contribute to the creation of responsible and sustainable societies.

Moreover, the system goes further to make contributions to a low-carbon, recycling-oriented society by generating electricity using the heat energy given off during the waste incineration process. Switchboards are used to distribute the generated electricity for use within the facility, with surplus power being sold. The end result is energy savings and subsequently a smaller environmental footprint. A major strength of Fuji Electric is its ability to propose systems that combine electrical equipment, measuring instruments, and control equipment. Capitalizing on this strength, we are moving forward with system bundle proposals and order acquisition activities to contribute to the optimization of entire production lines and even entire facilities. 17 Fuji Electric Report 2018 Factory Automation Improvement of EV Storage Battery Quality and Productivity Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to become increasingly By merging our control technologies with mechatronic more mainstream going forward. In China, the drive to adopt technologies, we are able to achieve timely development and EVs is being supercharged by plans to introduce regulation on proposal of systems matched to the needs of each customer. new energy vehicles (NEVs) in 2019. Furthermore, over half of the world’s lithium-ion batteries, which are indispensable to EVs, are produced in China. Fuji Electric is supplying major Chinese lithium-ion battery production equipment manufacturers with its motion control systems, which boast industry-leading control capabilities. Lithium-ion batteries are comprised of coiled layers of film coated in materials that are able to store electricity. If these coils are not sufficiently tight, it can have a significant adverse impact Business Report on the lifespan and performance of the battery. For this reason, manufacturing these batteries requires sophisticated technological Verification-use film coiling system capabilities to control the strength and speed at which film is stretched. Fuji Electric’s motion control systems contribute to improved product quality and productivity for customers with their ability to realize high-precision, high-speed motion control. When it comes to business negotiations related to systems, the competitiveness of proposals hinges on the ability to swiftly meet customers’ needs. In this regard, Fuji Electric’s in-house design and production of equipment is a huge advantage.

Another approved option is to use ship exhaust gas cleaning systems, of which SOx scrubbers are a key component. The market for these systems is expected to grow rapidly as they represent a SOx reduction solution that enables ship operators to continue using the same fuel. Fuji Electric has developed SOx scrubbers that employ a proprietary cyclone technology. We offer these scrubbers to domestic ship operators and have been moving forward with verification tests, leading to the acquisition of our first order in fiscal 2017. Conventional SOx scrubbers utilize a technology in which seawaters is sprayed on exhaust gas to remove SOx by taking advantage of a chemical reaction between SOx and the alkalis in the seawater. As such, achieving large processing capacities required massive overhauls to ships, which was a significant obstacle to introduction.
