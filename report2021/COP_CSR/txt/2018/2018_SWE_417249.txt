Beautiful Change is a concept that communicates Oriflame’s sustainability initiatives and achievements in a simple, emotional and engaging way. It is the heart of Oriflame’s sustainability communication and the main target group is our Consultants. We want to educate them in the sustainability subject and show that it should not be difficult to make a positive change in the world we live in. It can be as simple as remembering to turn off the tap when you wash your hair. If we all do it – we can truly make a difference. We want to spread a very simple message that can have a very big impact – everyone can Make a Beautiful Change. This is an opportunity for us because many of our Consultants and customers are in markets with low interest and understanding of sustainability issues. That is why one of our most ambitious commitments has been to reduce consumer impact by providing educational information to one million people. 12 13 CASE STUDY CASE STUDY Unveiling the beautiful change 50 th Anniversary Cruise INTRODUCTION Oriflame India launched the Beautiful in the fulfilment of their dreams, and how small actions Oriflame’s 50th Anniversary Cruise was (1,000 olive trees).

In addition to the immediate profit of around 20 % that Consultants make when they sell a product, in 2017 we distributed almost €390 million in bonuses and other forms of recognition. It is very important that we understand how all our Consultants are getting on – wherever they are in the SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE world and however much they are earning. Measuring their satisfaction provides insights to how the brand is meeting their expectations and is essential for our long-term success. In 2014, we introduced a new method of measuring Consultant satisfaction on an ongoing basis, the Net Promoter System (NPS), that allows us to see how likely our Consultants are to recommend Oriflame to a close friend or relative. The NPS program was successfully introduced in all Oriflame markets by the end of 2017, accordingly our ambition. One of the last parts of our implementation covered the emerging markets in Asia and Africa. Oriflame wants to understand the Consultant’s needs and help them grow by providing experience matching their expectations. We also get feedback about what the Consultants expect from us and indications on where we can improve. By analysing the results, we have been able to identify the main areas in each market, in which we should focus our improvement efforts. During 2017, we focused on improving the online experience, in particular, we put a special emphasis on the site navigation and improving the design and look of our application. Feedback from the Beauty Consultants globally has been received and we are very proud that the majority of our Consultants highly recommend Oriflame, and are very satisfied with the quality of Oriflame products. 34 35 Employees In 2017, Oriflame saw an increased recruitment internally to the program, a development we truly want to continue.
