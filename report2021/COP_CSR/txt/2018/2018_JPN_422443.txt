In recent years, efforts for building a sustainable society have unfolded on a global level, such as CEO’s enforcement of the Paris Agreement, as well as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) message and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). To help build a sustainable society from a mediumto long-term perspective, companies are required to create and provide diverse value through their products and services, utilizing their management resources effectively. On the social front, as we enter an age of the Internet of Things (IoT), where almost everything is connected to the internet, it is expected that new business models and lifestyles will develop resultant of big data, new applications such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies are put to practical use. In addition, on the back of the planned introduction of 5G— the next-generation telecommunications standard—progress is also being made in the development of associated infrastructures. Supporting all these trends are semiconductors. In the area of flat panel displays (FPD) too, in addition to growing demand for smalland medium-sized panels, there also appears to be a shift to larger screens and higher resolution, as well as a widespread adoption of organic electroluminescent displays,* and a broadening of design characteristics and their applications. Semiconductors and FPDs are in a new growth phase, playing a key role in our social infrastructure, and raising the expectation of further development attributable to technological innovation. Our Corporate Philosophy urges us to “contribute to the development of a dream-inspiring society through our leading-edge technologies and reliable service and support.” We see sustainability as an important focus for management, and in addition to steadily promoting effective governance and compliance, we believe it is vital that we improve our corporate value in the mediumto long-term by contributing through business to the resolution of social issues. We will strive to create value for society through our high-value-added, strongly competitive products and services, maximizing the effective use of precious management resources, such as the funds generated by our business activities, the knowhow along the value chain, our world-class personnel, and our trust-based relationships with customers and suppliers. In fiscal year 2017, we redefined the issues that are material in the sustainable growth of TEL, such as enhancing product competitiveness, reinforcing responsiveness to customers and improving productivity. This fiscal year, we will again join together in engaging in various activities aimed at achieving our short-term, medium-term and long-term goals related to these material issues. By continuing to promote sustainability-focused management, our aim is to remain a company which is loved and needed by the community, and in which our employees take pride. To promote sustainability management in line with international frameworks, we became a signatory to the UN Global Compact in 2013, and have since implemented initiatives for SDGs on a company-wide basis. Your continued support and patronage is very much appreciated by all of us at TEL.

In addition, the balanced composition of Audit & Supervisory Board members provides the knowledge required for operational audits and accounting audits, and we believe these board members are able to perform the company’s auditing functions effectively. Initiatives to strengthen systems Our Board of Directors strives proactively to resolve various issues related to sustainability with the aim of enhancing corporate value.

At the same time, promoting environmental initiatives leads to more opportunities to provide As a result of these initiatives, in fiscal year 2018, we reduced energy consumption per unit sales at our electricity consumption was substituted by estimated factors outstanding environmentally friendly products, reductions in operating costs, and further improvements in factories and offices by 21% year-over-year. However, an increase in our volume of production and an calculated by the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan corporate reputation. Based on the requirements of ISO 14001, Tokyo Electron (TEL) identified and analyzed increase in energy consumption associated with product development and evaluation resulted in power based on values published by the internal and external issues in relation to the environment, namely, its relationship with the climate, air quality consumption of 282 GWh in fiscal year 2018, up 11% year-over-year; and energy-derived CO2 emissions* International Energy Agency (IEA). and water quality. We also identified the environmental needs and expectations of customers, suppliers, of 152 kilotons, up 8% year-over-year. Based on the correlation between business operations and energy governments and employees, as well as the company’s compliance obligations. From this information, we use, we changed to an appropriate metric at factories and offices in Japan, and standardized it across the have set the following as our risks and opportunities to address: (1) environmental management by reducing company. Specifically, we adopted a metric calculated using a complex weighting of data from each area the environmental impact of our business activities, (2) compliance with applicable laws, and (3) enhancing on the number of evaluation units used in development, the number of units produced, total floor area and product competitiveness with the environmental contribution of products. man-hours. Of all 11 of our factories and offices, both those overseas plus those in Japan that had set goals based on this method, goals were achieved at 6 of them. Environmental management system Energy consumption reduced at business sites To continuously improve its environmental activities, TEL has operated an environmental management system based on ISO 14001 since 1997, primarily at its manufacturing subsidiaries. In March 2017, we acquired multi-site ISO 14001 certification for our factories and offices in Japan that had previously 21% reduction (compared to FY2017, per unit sales) acquired certification separately. Coinciding with the multi-site certification, we have developed a standardized company format for environmental impact assessments, the identification of useful environmental aspects, environmental management programs and internal audit checklists. During fiscal Example initiative year 2018, we established approximately 100 environmental goals for different levels across the entire As a way of conserving energy and combatting global warming, we are proceeding to switch to LED company and carried out these improvement activities. We also set up a system at our Head Office for lighting.
