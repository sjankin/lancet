This means we support the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are part of the initiative, which aim to mobilise efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change while ensuring that no one is left behind. The SDGs are a common set of goals that put the world on a sustainable path. The vital role of water and related resources in creating and delivering sustainable communities puts Melbourne Water in a key position to contribute to this global effort. We look to the SDGs to help us assess our contribution to sustainability and guide where we can focus our efforts to support a more sustainable Melbourne region. We enhance our contribution across all goals while demonstrating leadership for: • SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation • SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities • SDG 15 – Life on Land. Maintaining the world’s most liveable city is a collaborative effort. The goals provide us, our customers, the community and stakeholders with a common framework to work together to deliver ongoing community wellbeing and a sustainable, wellmanaged environment for future generations. The Melbourne Water Annual Report 2017-18 provides information on how Melbourne Water is contributing across all the SDGs. How to navigate this report from a sustainable reporting context The interdependent nature of the 17 UN SDGs means that by delivering our strategic direction, Melbourne Water contributes to all 17 goals.

This program uses prioritisation tools to help decide where to focus future effort and effective investment to maintain the quality of our world-class drinking water. The program builds on the learnings from the sanitary surveys completed for Melbourne Water’s drinking water catchments in 2018. It will lead to clear strategic objectives and associated joint management plans to optimise the quality and quantity of water that can be harvested from these catchments and maximise the value of these protected, forested catchments for Melbourne’s community.

Table 2: Environmental water delivered for 2017-18 River Volume Outcomes Yarra 24,079 ML Four releases of environmental water were made into the Yarra system to allow the migration of Australian Grayling (Prototroctes maraena), improve water quality and improve access to breeding and feeding habitat by macroinvertebrates, platypus and fish (in particular Macquarie Perch). Movement opportunities for small native fish were also provided in the upper reaches or the river, and small rapids and pool habitats were refreshed in the middle reaches for improved macroinvertebrate, platypus and fish habitats. Environmental water was also released into two billabongs in the Yarra floodplain – Yering Backswamp and Bolin Bolin Billabong (see Watering Bolin Bolin Billabong case study on page 50) – primarily to improve wetland vegetation and provide habitat for frogs and birds. Tarago 1764 ML Three releases were made into the Tarago system to maintain water quality, provide habitat for River Blackfish, platypus and macroinvertebrates and support spawning of Australian Grayling. Werribee 2666 ML Two releases were made in the upper Werribee system (Pyrites Creek) to improve habitat for frogs and macroinvertebrates by flushing organic matter from benches and cleaning riffle habitats. An additional objective relating to recruitment and growth of riparian vegetation was also obtained. Two releases were made in the lower Werribee system to promote fish movement and improve water quality. Maribyrnong 290 ML Three environmental flow releases improved water quality and improved small rapids habitats in the upper reaches. Additional improvements included providing movement opportunities for small native fish in the upper reaches, while also refreshing small rapids and pool habitats in the middle reaches for macroinvertebrates, platypus and fish. 28 | 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report Enhancing Biodiversity Melbourne Water manages the Ramsar-listed EdithvaleSeaford Wetlands.

As waterways manager and a significant landowner, we have a critical role in protecting the waterways, estuaries and wetlands which are essential to the survival of much of our region’s biodiversity. Threatened species such as Growling Grass Frog, Dwarf Galaxias, Latham’s Snipe and Swamp Skink all depend on a thriving environment. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. Melbourne Water manages both the Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands Ramsar site and the WTP, which is a major portion of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar site. Melbourne Water invests in biodiversity conservation at both of these sites. We also play an important role in managing nutrient and sediment input into the Westernport Ramsar site. Our WTP site is one of the most important refuges for waterfowl in Victoria. It also supports migratory shorebird populations and a significant population of the endangered Growling Grass Frog. It is home to the critically endangered Spiny Rice-flower and Orange-bellied Parrots. Our significant investment of $1.1 million to support biodiversity conservation at the WTP in 2017-18 has included pest animal and plant control, environmental watering, species monitoring, research and meeting legislative requirements across the 10,500 hectare site. The site is managed in consultation with our key advisory committee, which is composed of community group representatives, experts, agencies and adjacent land managers. 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report | 29 Healthy Places – Healthy Environment Managing our Catchments Taking a whole-of-catchment approach is a vital part of managing the health of our waterways.

In recent years we have invested in technology to capture greenhouse gas emissions generated during sewage treatment as biogas to generate electricity. Scope 1 emissions have been reduced by covering anaerobic lagoons at the WTP. The methane-rich biogas captured is used to generate electricity on site and, on average, has the potential to meet 77 per cent of the site’s electricity use. Design of an additional biogas power plant commenced in 201718, with construction due to begin in early 2019. This 6 megawatt biogas-fueled power plant will increase the WTP’s renewable energy production to almost 120 per cent of its annual electricity use, making Melbourne Water a net energy exporter overall. Electricity exported off site will offset power costs at other Melbourne Water sites. Site emissions will be reduced with less electricity required on occasion from the grid to meet supply and demand for the WTP treatment process. We are also conducting feasibility studies for solar power generation at some of our largest electricity-consuming sites, to significantly reduce the energy taken from the State’s electricity grid. This expansion will complement our existing hydropower plants in our water transfer system, which already produce nearly 70,000 megawatt hours (MWh) per year, enough to power more than 14,000 homes. 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report | 39 Energy Melbourne Water generates and uses significant amounts Because Melbourne Water generates its own electricity of energy to deliver water and sewerage services to its we also create renewable energy certificates (RECs).

Melbourne Water’s growing team of female firefighters was bolstered with New Mexico water bombing pilot, Jennifer Bartley, joining the team in 2018. An experienced pilot who has fought many major wildfires, Jennifer is based at our Healesville depot with the Forest Air helicopter which provides vital emergency fire management protection for our world-class catchments. Jennifer joined the growing team of seven full-time female firefighting employees and eight casual female project firefighters for the summer’s operations. Executive General Manager, Service Delivery at Melbourne Water, Charmaine Quick, said the addition of the outstanding American pilot was providing benefits for the rest of the team. “Having Jennifer working with our team is a wonderful demonstration of the diverse roles available for women at Melbourne Water. But we have some way to go. Our female firefighters currently make up around 30 per cent of our total firefighting team and it would be great to see this closer to parity.” The visibility of female role models in typically male-dominated areas at Melbourne Water has contributed to an increase in applications from women for firefighting positions. We are committed to a diverse and representative workforce where there are no barriers for women in any areas, including firefighting. 56 | 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report SMARTER DATA DELIVERING A MORE MOBILE WORKFORCE new tools, resources and management to improve capital investment planning OUR </> FIRST Continuous HACKATHON Improvement SHOWCASING AGILE DELIVERY 8 12 We embrace an agile and innovative approach HOURS TEAMS to new ideas, and we encourage business 12 SOLUTIONS improvements so that we always exceed customer and community expectations. eDNA RESEARCH SAMPLING TRANSFORMING OUR WATERWAY MANAGEMENT $5.78M FOR AWARD WINNING RESEARCH PROGRAM 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report | 57 Improving the way we do business Improving value through digital technologies By streamlining our processes, we will have greater freedom to innovate and work with the community to solve problems In 2017-18 we implemented a number of new digital of climate change, increased urbanisation and liveability. technologies, tools and processes to enhance asset management, make operations safer and more efficient, In 2017-18 we continued to drive discipline in the execution and improve the service provided to our customers.

However, it will not completely replace the need for traditional surveys that may be required to provide information such as the health, sex and age of animals. In 2017-18 we increased our remotely-operated technology program to optimise the maintenance and management of land and assets. This included investment in a new terrestrial remotely-operated vehicle capable of supporting gas sensing, visual inspection and physical manipulation work at reduced risk, as well as new mini submersibles to complete underwater inspections. We also acquired and built internal capacity to deploy a fleet of eight multi-rotor drones, with seven Melbourne Water staff completing aviation Remote Pilot Licence accreditation.

To the extent that nonspecialised land and buildings do not contain significant, unobservable adjustments, the assets are classified as Level 2 under the market approach. The market approach is used for specialised land adjusted for the Community Service Obligation (CSO) to reflect the specialised nature of the land being valued. A CSO adjustment is a reflection of the valuer’s assessment of the impact of restrictions associated with an asset to the extent that is also equally applicable to market participants. This approach is in light of the highest and best use consideration required for fair value measurement, and takes into account the use of the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible, and financially feasible.

Non-infrastructure assets and liabilities are deducted • The 5 year average of long-term capex forecasts, less from the enterprise value range to obtain the infrastructure the 5 year average of normalised long-term growth value. In order to assess reasonableness of the enterprise related capex, used as a proxy for capex in the steady valuation, cross checks are performed by comparing the state (2016/17: 5 years). earnings before interest, tax and depreciation/amortisation (EBITDA) and regulated asset value multiples implied by the value determined under the income approach against multiples implied by share prices at which comparable organisations are trading and recent transactions in comparable assets which have occurred. Such approaches are often referred to as market approaches or relative value approaches. Melbourne Water’s policy is to use a midpoint valuation in assessing the fair value. 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report | 101 Assets Available to Support Output Delivery (continued) 4.1.2.1

The Corporation has not adopted these standards early in accordance with DTF guidance. The Corporation’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below: AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The core principle of the Standard requires an entity to recognise revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer and is effective from 1 January 2018. The new Standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer with the notion of control replacing the existing notion of risks and rewards. The Corporation has completed an impact assessment of this new Standard in the 2018 financial year and has concluded that there are no material changes to revenue recognition, other than for developer charges and contributions. Currently developer charges and contributions are recognised on receipt. Under AASB 15 we expect that developer charges and contributions will instead be recognised at the point in time the Statement of Compliance (SOC) is issued to the developer, which is later than receipt. This will require recognition of receipts as income in advance to the Statement of Financial Position to be released to revenue as the SOC is issued. The financial impact of the change is still being quantified. The above assessment also included the following amendments to AASB 15: • AASB 2014-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 15 • AASB 2015-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Effective date of AASB 15 • AASB 2016-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Clarifications to AASB 15 AASB 16 Leases This Standard will primarily affect accounting by lessees and will result in the recognition of almost all leases on the Statement of Financial Position and is effective 1 January 2019. The Standard removes the current distinction between operating and financing leases and requires recognition of an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals for almost all lease contracts. Accounting by lessors will not significantly change. Management has conducted an assessment over current operating leases and has made an assessment of the impact in regards to the new Standard. In line with recommendations from DTF, Melbourne Water is planning to apply a retrospective modified approach and will recognise an asset and liability predominantly for two office buildings and a parking area. The financial impact of the change is still being quantified AASB 9 Financial Instruments The key changes to this Standard include the simplified requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets, a new hedging accounting model and a revised impairment loss model to recognise impairment losses earlier, as opposed to the current approach that recognises impairment only when incurred. An assessment undertaken by management has identified that historical writeoffs have been not material, with future expected losses to also be immaterial. As such, it is expected that there will be no need to raise future provisions for doubtful debts. Whilst there may be no significant impact to the Corporation arising from AASB 9, there will be a change to the way financial instruments are disclosed. This is effective 1 January 2018. 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report | 133 Independent Auditor’s Report To the Board of the Melbourne Water Corporation Opinion I have audited the financial report of the Melbourne Water Corporation (the corporation) which comprises the: • statement of financial position as at 30 June 2018 • statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year then ended • statement of changes in equity for the year then ended • statement of cash flows for the year then ended • notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies • statement by directors and chief financial officer. In my opinion, the financial report presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the corporation as at 30 June 2018 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of Part 7 of the Financial Management Act 1994 and applicable Australian Accounting Standards. Basis for I have conducted my audit in accordance with the Audit Act 1994 which incorporates the Opinion Australian Auditing Standards. I further describe my responsibilities under that Act and those standards in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of my report. My independence is established by the Constitution Act 1975. My staff and I are independent of the Corporation in accordance with the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the Code) that are relevant to my audit of the financial report in Victoria. My staff and I have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. Key Audit Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgement, were of most Matters significance in my audit of the financial report of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 134 | 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report Key audit matter How I addressed the matter Long term procurement of the Victorian Desalination Plant (VDP) using a private public partnership (PPP) agreement and Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) contracts Refer to Note 5.1 Interest bearing liabilities and Note 5.3 Commitments VDP finance lease liability: total $4.069 billion, My key procedures included: current $70.339 million, and non-current • gaining an understanding of the key contractual $3.999 billion. changes for the current year VDP commitment disclosures: minimum future • engaging a subject matter expert to assist in lease repayments $10.291 billion and other obtaining sufficient, appropriate audit evidence for expense commitments $4.329 billion. the finance lease liability and commitment disclosures, including of the: I considered this to be a key audit matter because: • appropriateness of re-financing adjustments • the finance lease liability and future VDP • reasonableness and consistency of all the commitments are financially significant finance lease model assumptions • the VDP's contractual rights and obligations • identification of any model or assumptions with DELWP are complex changes • the corporation places significant reliance • reasonableness of all model inputs, with on DELWP for the underlying data for the specific reference to underlying data and accounting and disclosures supporting documentation (i.e. contracts, • the finance lease model is highly complex, water orders) involves significant management • model’s computational accuracy judgement and is underpinned by various • appropriateness of all VDP related financial subjective assumptions report disclosures as required by AASB 117 • the accounting for, and disclosures related Leases to, the VDP are inherently complex with limited authoritative accounting guidance • evaluating the subject matter expert's report, available including assessing it for consistency with other • small changes to the contractual terms and audit evidence obtained, and the relevance and conditions (for example—refinancing reasonableness of their findings and assumptions requirements) significantly impact the • obtaining the corporation's representation from liability carrying value DELWP relating to the underlying data for the • the VDP's commitment disclosures involve accounting and disclosures. significant management judgements and estimates, and amendments were required in prior years. 2 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report | 135 Key audit matter How I addressed the matter The estimate of the fair value of infrastructure assets is derived from an income-based valuation approach that uses a complex discounted cashflow model ('DCF model').

Board’s The Board of the corporation is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the responsibilities financial report in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Financial for the Management Act 1994, and for such internal control as the Board determines is necessary to financial report enable the preparation and fair presentation of a financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial report, the Board is responsible for assessing the corporation's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is inappropriate to do so. 136 | 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report 3 Auditor’s As required by the Audit Act 1994, my responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial responsibilities report based on the audit. My objectives for the audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about for the audit of whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to the financial fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is report a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report. As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also: • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the corporation's internal control • evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board • conclude on the appropriateness of the Board’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the corporation's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the corporation to cease to continue as a going concern. • evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. I communicate with the Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit. From the matters communicated with the Board, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in the auditor’s report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

[2] The variance to prior year is as a result of higher cash payments to suppliers and employees $53.9 million. The 2017-18 result is above the target range and in line with business expectations. [3] The variance to prior year is as a result of higher cash payments for capital expenditure of $32.4 million and higher dividend payments of $48.8 million compared to prior year. The 2017-18 result is above the target range and in line with business expectations. It is anticipated that future year on year variances will fluctuate in line with expected revenue as per the 2016 pricing determination and capital expenditure profile. [4] The favourable variance to target is due to an increase in operating cash flows due to stronger trading results and lower cash payments for capital expenditure compared to plan. [5] The variance to prior year is favourable due to an increase in current assets being higher trade and other receivables of $9.4 million and assets held for sale $10.2 million at the end of June 2018. [6] The favourable variance to target is due to higher current assets being trade and other receivables $37.7 million and assets held for sale $16.6 million. [7] The favourable variance to target is due to higher Earnings Before Net Interest and Tax during the year of $160.8 million due to higher revenue and lower expenditure. [8] The variance to prior year is favourable due to higher Net Profit After tax of $58.4 million due to higher revenue and lower expenditure. [9] The favourable variance to target is due to higher Net Profit After Tax during the year compared to plan of $123.8 million. Improved performance is mainly due to higher than anticipated revenue predominantly from developer contributions and lower operating and finance expenses. 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report | 139 Performance Report Water, sewerage and other service performance indicators KPI Number 2016-17 2017-18 2017-18 Variance to Variance to [1] Key Performance Indicator Result Result Target prior year Notes target Notes WQ1 Water Quality Compliance with Bulk Water Service Agreement (BWSA): Microbiological Standards ­­— E. coli 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 0.0% 0.0% WQ2 Water Quality Compliance with BWSA: Aesthetics — Turbidity 97.8% 98.9% 91.5% 1.1% 8.1% [10] CRM1 Customer Responsiveness Complaints referred to Energy and Water Ombudsman Victoria (EWOV) responded to within EWOV established time 98.0% 100.0% 100.0% 2.0% 0.0% EM1 Non-Compliance with other EPA Victoria License and SEPP parameters — Sewerage system failure Zero spills due to sewerage system failure 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0% 0.0% EM2 Compliance with EPA Victoria discharge licence requirements EM2.1 Western Treatment Plant 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 0.0% 0.0% EM2.2 Eastern Treatment Plant 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 0.0% 0.0% E2 Total net CO2 emissions Net tonnes CO2 equivalent N/A 453,477 N/A [11] [11] WW1 Waterways — Drainage and Flood protection % reduction in flood effects achieved by projects in delivery by Melbourne Water by 2021 N/A 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% N/A WW2 Waterways condition Active management of waterways will contribute to maintaining or improving waterway health 94.0% 90.0% 80.0% N/A [12] 12.5% [12] Notes — to Performance Report: [1] Performance indicators as mandated in Ministerial Reporting Direction 01 Performance Reporting (MRD 01) have been marked with their MRD 01 reference numbers. [10] The positive result is due to major storage reservoirs being well managed and there were no significant events impacting water turbidity. [11] This is a new performance indicator this year and was not included in the Corporate Plan. Therefore there is no comparable target. [12] The KPI for waterways condition is now an outcome based target measured as part of the new Waterways Drainage Investment Plan and replaces the 2016-17 KPI measured as part of the Healthy Waterways Strategy. Therefore the variance to prior year assessment is not applicable.

In my opinion, the performance report of the Melbourne Water Corporation for the year ended 30 June 2018 presents fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the performance reporting requirements of Part 7 of the Financial Management Act 1994.

Details of individual consultancies are outlined on Melbourne Water’s website at www.melbournewater.com.au Consultancies valued at $10,000 or greater In 2017-18, there were twenty three consultancies engaged during the year where the total fees payable to the consultants were $10,000 or greater. The total expenditure incurred during 2017-18 in relation to these consultancies was $1,090,992 (excl. GST). Consultancies valued at less than $10,000 In 2017-18, there were three consultancies engaged during the year where the total fees payable to the consultants were less than $10,000. The total expenditure incurred during 2017-18 in relation to these consultancies was $12,100 (excl. GST). Advertising Campaigns Melbourne Water had no advertising campaigns with a value greater than $100,000. ICT Expenditure For the 2017-18 reporting period, Melbourne Water had a total ICT expenditure of $57,284,417 (2016-17: $55,526,957) with the details shown below. Non-business as usual (non-BAU) ICT expenditure Business as usual (BAU) ICT (operational and capital Non-BAU ICT expenditure Non-BAU ICT expenditure expenditure ($000) expenditure) ($000) (operational expenditure) ($000) (capital expenditure) ($000) $31,804 $25,481 $25,481 Disclosure of Major Contracts Melbourne Water has disclosed, in accordance with the requirements of government policy and accompanying guidelines, all contracts greater than $10 million in value entered into during the year ended 30 June 2018. Details of contracts can be viewed on Melbourne Water’s website at www.melbournewater.com.au Competitive Neutrality Policy Melbourne Water is corporatised and therefore has an independent Board, with independent and objective performance monitoring. We face equivalent tax treatment, borrowing requirements and regulations as a private business. As outlined above, we also operate in an environment where the Essential Services Commission determines cost-based pricing. In this regard our processes are consistent with the requirements of the Victorian Competitive Neutrality Policy. Melbourne Water has had no actions for anti-competitive behaviour. Pricing Following an 11 per cent decrease (plus inflation) in 2016-17, Melbourne Water’s wholesale water and sewerage prices will increase approximately in line with inflation for the remaining four years of the Essential Service Commission Price Determination (until 2020-21), which increases an average household water bill by approximately $25 per annum (depending on inflation). The annual waterways and drainage charge of $98.88 for 2017-18 will also increase by inflation. Freedom of Information Melbourne Water is subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) and is committed to releasing documents in our possession unless exempt. We also welcome enquiries about the broad range of documents we provide outside the FOI Act. The designated persons for the purpose of the FOI Act are: Principal Officer Authorised Officer Acting Authorised Officer Mr J Thwaites Mr M Keough Ms J Cowley Chair, Melbourne Water Board FOI and Privacy Advisor and Government Liaison Records Coordinator 148 | 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report Requests for information We received 24 requests.

As a State Government-owned entity, Melbourne Water does not make any political donations or contributions 2017-18 Melbourne Water Annual Report | 151 Appendix C – Bulk Entitlements The Victorian Government introduced bulk water reforms on 1 July 2014. These reforms introduced a ‘source’ and ‘delivery’ bulk entitlements model for Melbourne with a seasonal determination process and rights to carry over unused water allocations from year to year. The four systems currently supplying Melbourne (Thomson River, Yarra River, Silver and Wallaby creeks and Tarago and Bunyip rivers) are collectively known as the Greater Yarra System – Thomson River Pool. Melbourne Water was assigned the source bulk entitlements to the Greater Yarra System – Thomson River Pool. The delivery bulk entitlements to the Greater Yarra System – Thomson River Pool were assigned to Barwon Water, City West Water, South East Water, South Gippsland Water, Western Water, Westernport Water and Yarra Valley Water (the ‘primary entitlement holders’). As the Resource Manager for the Melbourne headworks system, Melbourne Water allocates water to the primary entitlement holders by making seasonal determinations to them. Melbourne Water is also the Storage Manager (under section 171B of the Water Act 1989) for water sources in the Melbourne headworks system. The following table fulfils the reporting requirements in Melbourne Water’s bulk entitlements.

We provide our Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact through our Annual Report. Melbourne Water’s approach to reporting against the SGDs is through our Strategic KPIs in our Corporate Plan and through a formal sustainability reporting mechanism, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). GRI and the UN Global Compact have established an initiative ‘Business Reporting on the SDGs’ which will produce a handbook in December 2017 for SDG business reporting in the meantime. This report adopts the GRI Sustainability Standards (conforming to Core level of reporting)3 as they are the current global standard for sustainability reporting and represent best practice. They are designed to be used by organisations to report about their impacts on the economy, the environment and/or society. Sustainable development and materiality Sustainability reporting requires an organisation to report on their significant economic, environmental and social impacts or that substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders. In order to determine the issues that are material to Melbourne Water, engagement was undertaken to establish the relative significance of the SDGs to Melbourne Water’s strategic activities and to understand our impact or influence on the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Melbourne Water stakeholders, customers, and staff contributed to an understanding of what SDGs are material to us and where opportunities for leadership lie. The following activities were undertaken to support this materiality assessment: • external stakeholder interviews • interviews with Melbourne Water Leadership Team and managers • all staff survey • mapping of Melbourne water strategies and activities against the SDGs and targets • review of industry priorities • review of peer reporting. The results showed that Melbourne Water impacts across all 17 goals, albeit to differing degrees. The goals that are most material to us, SDGs 6, 11 and 15, align with the three pillars of our strategic direction. SDGs 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 17 also featured as material with Melbourne Water having less direct impact on SDGs 1, 2, 4, 10 and 16. Melbourne Water’s approach to sustainable development and to supporting the SDGs is to enhance our contribution across all UN SDGs, while demonstrating leadership for SDGs 6, 11 and 15. Given this, our GRI reporting (Core) covers most topics. In the few cases where specific disclosures are not relevant to our organisation they have been noted in the table. We have also reported on issues as they relate to the UN Global Compact Communication on Progress (see Appendix I, The UN Global Compact). Reporting The Melbourne Water Annual Report 2017-18 content was defined through a combination of extensive, business-wide consultation, including with senior management and executives. Melbourne Water is also required to report under a range of regulatory instruments and our content also reflects these requirements. Unless otherwise specified, topics are relevant across the entire Melbourne Water organisation and only inside the organisation. Refer to Tables H1 to H7 for Melbourne Water’s GRI Standards disclosures. Melbourne Water has not sought to have this report externally assured this year. Our last Annual Report was published in 2016-17. No restatements of information have been made. 3 Melbourne Water’s 2015-16 Annual Report used G4 Guidelines.
