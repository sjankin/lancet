The connection began with the construction of the Dai-Ichi National Who Built the Foundation of Shimizu Corporation Bank in 1872.

We are also taking on the challenge of creating new value and finding sense of values and lifestyles change with the rapid advancement of technology. Japan is also facing a solutions to global social problems, and are working to achieve sustainable growth and declining population and an aging society with fewer children being born, aging infrastructure, and the frequent occurrence of natural disasters. The many problems facing the construction industry globally, improve corporate value. such as global warming, abnormal weather events, and increased energy demand, are also growing more severe. Expectations of companies and the roles they are expected to play in achieving the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) set forth by the United Nations in 2015 are also increasing. The Shimizu Group aims to be a company that is valued by society and continues to be chosen by customers. We will achieve this through the dedicated pursuit of sustainability of communities and buildings and structures, continuing to provide value that exceeds the expectations of our customers, and by creating the communities described below and contributing to the achievement of SDGs as a “smart solutions company.” 1 Contributing to the Realization of Safe and Secure Communities We will continue to place importance on the philosophies of faithful craftsmanship and being marketoriented, which make up the DNA of the Shimizu Group. We will dedicate ourselves to safety and quality assurance, and will provide security to communities and customers. Natural disasters have been more frequent and more intense in recent years. The social roles that the construction industry plays in maintenance, management, and extending the life of infrastructure, and in rapid recovery and restoration, have grown increasingly larger amid concerns over the possibility of a major earthquake, either directly beneath the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area, or in the Nankai Trough or other critical locations. The Shimizu Group assists companies with the formulation of BCP (business continuity plans) to prepare for major disasters, works to develop disaster prevention and mitigation technologies, and provides safe and secure buildings and services to communities. 2 Contributing to the Realization of Comfortable, Smart Communities We strive to create communities where people can live and work with passion by creating spaces that are highly comfortable and convenient for the people who use them, and that take their well-being into consideration. We also contribute to the creation of communities that are convenient for all types of people by providing universal designs and renovation and services to create barrier-free environments as we work to enhance sustainable value over a building’s life cycle. Shimizu is actively pursuing the optimal use of ICT (Information Communication Technology), and automation and industrialization of group production processes. We are also taking on the challenge of Kazuyuki Inoue developing a vision for the future of the construction industry and are creating smart production systems President and Representative Director that utilize AI, robots, and other advanced technologies to improve the comfort and productivity of construction sites and achieve innovation in the business as a whole. 3 Contributing to the Realization of Environmentally Friendly, Sustainable Communities We recognize the long-range impact that the construction industry has on the surrounding environment, from construction to operation and demolition. The Shimizu Group puts the environment at the center of all of its business activities. We work to reduce CO2 emissions, achieve energy savings, and conserve resources over the entire lifecycle of buildings, and take other steps in business activities to reduce the Restoring Trust burden on the environment. We also promote initiatives in ecosystem preservation and biodiversity. We are also taking on the challenge of building and encouraging the spread of ZEB (Zero Energy On March 23, 2018, Shimizu Corporation was indicted for alleged violations of the Antimonopoly Act Buildings) to make a society with low or no carbon emissions a reality. We are focusing on the renewable relating to a bid on a Chuo Shinkansen construction project ordered by the Central Japan Railway Comenergy management business, projects that achieve harmonious existence with nature, and other busipany.

We will continue to promote compliance management and high ethical values among all officers and employees in the future. In July 2014, Shimizu formulated Midterm Management Plan 2014 (2014–2018), a five-year plan based on the long-term vision. The three basic policies of this plan are to advance the construction business; “Midterm Management Plan 2014” Performance Goals steadily develop the three key businesses of the global business, building stock management business, and sustainability business; and further strengthen the management foundations, while maintaining a Performance Indicators FY 2017 (Results) FY 2018 (Targets) FY 2018 (Forecasts) steady response to the current robust demand for construction and also keeping an eye on long-term Net Sales (Consolidated) ¥1,519.4 billion ¥1,630.0 billion ¥1,790.0 billion trends in the construction market.

We will also invest in the real estate development business, the power generation and electricity retail business, the infrastructure management business, and others, whereby will build a diverse revenue bases in these new areas. We will also continue to increase equity capital to prepare for the risks in new areas of business, and will maintain an appropriate level of interest-bearing debt to secure and maintain stable means of financing. In terms of shareholder return, we consider that strengthening the company’s financial bases to provide the foundation for long-term growth and paying stable dividends are important management issues. Our basic policy on the allocation of profits is to pay out dividends that are supported by stable business performance. We plan to pay annual dividends of 26 yen per share (a dividend payout ratio of 22.4%) in fiscal 2018. ESG Initiatives The business environment has recently been changing at a dizzying pace, and this has also provided various risks and opportunities. I believe that we need to manage in a way that takes the environment (E), social (S), and governance (G) elements into consideration for Shimizu to achieve sustainable growth amid such conditions. We are working on ESG initiatives and on enhancing corporate value from the following four perspectives in the rolling three-year management plan (FY 2018–FY 2020), which is based Of the 17 SDGs, Goal 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), and Goal 11 (Sustainable cities and on Midterm Management Plan 2014. communities), include actions that should be actively pursued by the construction industry. Shimizu is 1. Pursue both offensive and defensive environmental management through more initiatives aimed at working on Goal 7 (Affordable and clean energy), and other goals as part of our business.

We are currently in the process of formulating the The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Developnext long-term vision and revising the Midterm Management Plan.

All U.N. members are called upon to achieve the goals under the principle of “no one left behind” stated in the SDG action plans for People, the Planet, and Prosperity. Since Shimizu was founded in 1804, we have placed importance on the high aspirations and attitude towards business of the founder, Kisuke Shimizu I, and his successor, Kisuke Shimizu II, of performing faithful craftsmanship, being market-oriented, and maintaining a spirit of innovation. In developing the company’s business, we have also focused on the basic principles of management in The Analects and the Abacus, which contains the teachings of the venerable businessman, Eiichi Shibusawa, who represented Japan in the Meiji and Taisho eras (1868–1926). I believe that we have been successful precisely because we have met the expectations and earned the trust of all stakeholders in each era. I will personally stand at the helm and enlist the coordinated efforts of all employees in making sure that Shimizu will also be able to continue providing value that exceeds the expectations of our customers in the future.

Construction Industry The recent frequency of earthquakes, typhoons, volcanic eruptions, and other natural disasters is placing increasing importance on the social role of the construction industry. This role includes building and maintaining infrastructure, rapid response on recovery, and restoration projects. Through these, Shimizu provides the safety and security to protect the lives of our customers and their businesses. There are also concerns about the future potential for a major earthquake, either directly beneath the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area or in the Nankai and Sagami troughs. Moreover, the impact of global warming has exposed the potential risk for disasters other than earthquakes, such as massive typhoons or torrential rains. Shimizu is contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by developing technology to mitigate the damage from such disasters from many perspectives. Forecasting and diagnostic technologies, disaster prevention and mitigation technologies, and technologies that enable rapid recovery and restoration of normal daily life after a disaster are among the technologies we contribute. Shimizu will continue to contribute to the realization of safe and secure communities in the future as well.

When I Recently, the company has been particularly focused on workstyle reform and promoting the provide such advice, I think it is important to provide advice and supervision from three perspectives: By advancement of women as management strategies. To achieve that, it is important for Shimizu to keep looking at issues from a bird’s eye view of the macro perspective, by looking at them from the groundthe productivity per hour of each employee in mind in proceeding with workstyle reform, to continually level perspective of the frontlines and stakeholders, and by looking at them from a below-the-surface revise operations, including organization-wide processes, and to improve the quality of organizational perspective of trends in society and the market. management.

It is increasingly important to other means, from the perspective of preventing a loss of corporate value from unforeseen events. I rechave an unwavering North Pole for both management and employees in such an environment. This is ognize that the management of Shimizu are building a proper system of internal controls. As a full-time why they must always take the teachings of Eiichi Shibusawa in The Analects and the Abacus, which external audit and supervisory board member, I want to confirm that discrepancies do not arise between contains the basic principles by which Shimizu manages its business, to heart. That spirit exhorts us to the views of management and the understanding of the locations and frontlines spread throughout Japan walk with the weak, think about future generations, and put work in communities and the world that and overseas so that the internal controls function effectively. Shimizu has a good corporate culture in we can truly be proud of first, rather than focusing on immediate profit. Shimizu does this through the which all employees follow the teachings of Eiichi Shibusawa contained in The Analects and the Abacus, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were adopted by world leaders at a United Nations which talks about the compatibility of economic activity and ethics. I would like to see Shimizu take risks summit. To achieve that, it is important for everyone to be able to speak freely and in a friendly manner. that are appropriate in light of this culture and will lead to further enhancement of corporate value. That deeply impressed me as being something that I should take the lead on as an external audit & supervisory board member.

(current position) Jun. 2013: Outside Director, LAC Co., Ltd. (current position) Jun. 2014: Audit & Supervisory Board Member (part-time), Shimizu Corporation (current position) At Shimizu, management makes an effort to ensure that everyone in the company shares a common understanding. Information is also actively shared with external audit & supervisory board members by providing them with information on internal and external operations and answering questions. As an external audit & supervisory board member, I have the mandate of shareholders. I think that I was able to audit the performance of duties by directors and other officers to ensure that these duties were carried out appropriately, and that I was able to properly audit the performance of duties in regard to the material impact of events on the company for the various stakeholders. I also think that Shimizu’s standards for audits by auditors, rules on the audit & supervisory board, and record of prior audits show that audits have been appropriate for the company’s long tradition in light of the social demands of each age. Today, as major changes are occurring in society, I would like to contribute to ensuring strict compliance in the future and to even better management of the company based on flexible, sustainable governance. 76 Shimizu Corporate Report 2018 Shimizu Corporate Report 2018 77 About Shimizu Initiatives in Various Areas Business Base Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Data Collection Key

The scope of our assurance procedures was limited to the Indicators marked with the symbol “ ” in the Report. Yokohama (Yokohama city) 1. The Company’s Responsibilities The Company is responsible for preparing the Indicators in accordance with the Company’s own criteria, that it determined with consideration of Japanese environmental regulations as presented in 2018, 2.Ecological Missions 2030-2050, 2.1.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are estimated using emissions factors, which are subject to scientific and estimation uncertainties given different instruments for measuring GHG emissions Nagoya (Nagoya city) may vary in characteristics, in terms of functions and assumed parameters. 2. Our Independence and Quality Control Kansai (Osaka city) We have met the independence requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants in January 2017, which is based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectiveness, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behavior. Kobe (Kobe city) In addition, we maintain a comprehensive quality control system, including documented policies and procedures for compliance with ethical rules, professional standards, and applicable laws and regulations in accordance with the International Standard on Quality Control 1 Shikoku (Takamatsu city) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board in April 2009. 3. Our responsibilities Hiroshima (Hiroshima city) Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Indicators included in the Report based on the procedures we have Head Office: Tokyo performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements: Assurance Main Branches: 14 Kyushu (Fukuoka city) Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (“ISAE 3000”) (Revised), issued by the International Offices: 76 Auditing and Assurance Standards Board in December 2013, Practical Guidelines for the Assurance of Sustainability Information, revised Tokyo Civil Engineering in December 2014 by the Japanese Association of Assurance Organizations for Sustainability Information and, with respect of GHG emissions, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (“ISAE 3410”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Stan(Tokyo, Chuo-ku) dards Board in June 2012. The procedures, which we have performed according to our professional judgment, include inquiries, document inspection, analytical procedures, reconciliation between source documents and Indicators in the Report, as well as the following: • Making inquiries regarding the Company’s own criteria that it determined with consideration of Japanese environmental regulations, and evaluating the appropriateness thereof; • Inspecting relevant documents with regard to the design of the Company’s internal controls related to the Indicators, and inquiring of personnel responsible thereof at the Company and 1site visited ; • Performing analytical procedures concerning the Indicators at the Company and 1site visited; and • Testing, on a sample basis, underlying source information and conducting relevant re-calculations at the Company and 1site visited. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are more limited in nature, timing and extent than a reasonable assurance engagement. As a result, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is lower than would have been obtained if we Overseas had performed a reasonable assurance engagement. 4. Conclusion Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Indicators included in the Report have not been measured and reported in accordance with the Company’s own criteria that it determined with consideration of Japanese environmental regulations.

Shimizu Corporate Report 2018 93 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Shimizu Corporation and its subsidiaries 1. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on the accounts maintained by Shimizu Corporation (the “Corporation”) and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”) prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Corporation as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan. 2. U.S. Dollar Amounts The accounts of consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen by rounding down to the nearest million. The U.S. dollar amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been translated from the original Japanese yen into U.S. dollars on the basis of ¥106.31 to U.S.$1, the rate of exchange prevailing at March 31, 2018, and have been then rounded down to the nearest thousand. These U.S. dollar amounts are not intended to imply that the Japanese yen amounts have been or could be converted, realized or settled in U.S. dollars at this or any other rate. 3. Principles of Consolidation 1) Scope of Consolidation The Corporation had 65 subsidiaries as at March 31, 2018. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018 include the accounts of the Corporation and all subsidiaries. The Corporation had 14 affiliates as at March 31, 2018. As at March 31, 2018, the equity method was applied to all affiliates. 2) Financial Statements of Subsidiaries The financial year-end for 16 overseas subsidiaries and 2 domestic subsidiaries is December 31, and the financial year-end for one domestic subsidiary is March 26. Consolidation of these subsidiaries is therefore performed by using their financial statements as at December 31 and March 26, respectively, and certain adjustments are made to reflect any significant transactions during the period from year-end balance sheet dates for these subsidiaries to March 31. 3) Amortization of Goodwill Goodwill is principally amortized over a five-year period on a straight-line basis from the year of acquisition. 4) Elimination of Unrealized Intercompany Profits All significant unrealized intercompany profits included in assets such as “Costs on uncompleted construction contracts” among the Group has been eliminated on consolidation and the portion thereof attributable to non-controlling interests is reported as “Non-controlling Interests.” In connection with the elimination of unrealized intercompany profits, the depreciation expense is also adjusted to eliminate any profit from the cost of assets purchased through intercompany transactions. 4. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 1) Valuation of Securities The Group classifies securities into two different categories, held-to-maturity debt securities and other securities. The Group holds no trading securities. Held-to-maturity debt securities are valued at amortized cost. Other securities with market quotations are valued at the prevailing market price as at the balance sheet date. Other securities without market quotations are stated at cost, cost being determined by the moving average method. Net unrealized gains on other securities with market quotations are reported net of taxes as a separated component of “Net Assets” and the cost of sales is determined by the moving average method. 94 Shimizu Corporate Report 2018 Financial Section 2) Valuation of Inventories Real estate for sale: At cost on an individual basis (The carrying value of inventories on the balance sheet is presented at book value after write-down for decline in earnings.) Costs on uncompleted construction contracts: At cost on an individual basis Costs on uncompleted real estate development projects: At cost on an individual basis (The carrying value of inventories on the balance sheet is presented at book value after write-down for decline in earnings.) PFI projects and other inventories: At cost on an individual basis or at cost, cost being determined by the moving average method (The carrying value of inventories on the balance sheet is presented at book value after write-down for decline in earnings.) 3) Depreciation Method for Tangible Fixed Assets Depreciation for tangible fixed assets (excluding leased assets) is computed by the declining balance method, at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. Some subsidiaries use the straight-line method. 4) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts For receivables classified as “normal,” the allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on a historical default ratio. For receivables classified as “doubtful” or “bankrupt,” the allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on individual assessment on the probability of collection. 5) Warranty Reserve An allowance to cover the costs of repairs for damages related to completed construction work for which the Group is responsible is provided based on previous warranty experience. 6) Reserve for Expected Losses on Construction Contracts in Process An allowance is provided for estimated future losses related to the construction contracts in process. 7) Reserve for Expected Losses Related to the Anti-Monopoly Act An allowance is provided for an estimated amount of payment of penalties, etc., under the Antimonopoly Act. 8) Accounting Method for Retirement Benefits Net defined benefit liability has been recorded mainly at the amount calculated based on the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets as at the balance sheet date. Method of attributing the projected benefit obligations to periods of service: Benefit formula basis Method used for amortization of actuarial gain or loss: Straight-line method (10 years amortized from the following financial year) Method used for amortization of prior service cost: Straight-line method (10 years) Adoption of simplified methods in the Group: Some consolidated subsidiaries apply a simplified method to compute their net defined benefit liability and retirement benefit expenses. 9) Accounting for Hedging Hedging instruments are valued at fair value and accounted by using the deferral method of accounting. With regard to some interest rate swaps which meet certain requirements, the Group uses the special treatment, based on the short-cut method, assuming that there is no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship between hedged items and hedging instruments. Hedging instruments: Derivative transactions (interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts) Hedged items: Assets and liabilities which are exposed to interest and foreign exchange market fluctuation risks Hedging policy: Derivative transactions are used solely for hedging the risks associated with existing or future assets and liabilities. Derivative transactions are never entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation. 10) Recognizing Revenues and Costs of Construction Contracts Revenues and costs of construction contracts, of which the percentage of completion can be reliably estimated, are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage of completion is calculated based on the cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost. The completed-contract method is applied to all other construction contracts. Shimizu Corporate Report 2018 95 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 11) Consumption Taxes Consumption taxes payable or receivable are excluded from each account in the consolidated statements of income. 12) Foreign Currency Translation The balance sheet of overseas subsidiaries is translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date except for shareholders’ equity which is translated at historical rates. The revenues and expenses of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Differences arising from such translations are shown as “Foreign currency translation adjustments” and are included in “Net Assets.” 13) Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows consist of cash on hand, bank deposits payable on demand, and time deposits, which are readily convertible into cash and subject to minor risks of fluctuations in value. 14) Income Taxes Income taxes of the Corporation and its domestic subsidiaries consist of corporate income taxes, local inhabitants’ taxes and enterprise taxes. The Corporation and its domestic subsidiaries account for deferred taxes in accordance with the regulations for preparation of consolidated financial statements in Japan. Deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and those as reported in the financial statements. In addition, the consolidated overseas subsidiaries provide for deferred income taxes relating to temporary differences between reporting for tax and accounting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the relevant countries. 15) Accounting Standards issued but not yet effective (1) Summary On March 30, 2018, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ) issued “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No.29) and “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No.30). The accounting standard provides a comprehensive framework for recognising revenue from contracts with customers. (2) Scheduled effective date The Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries expect to apply the accounting standard from the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2021. (3) The effects of applying accounting standard At present, the Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries are in the process of measuring the effects of applying the accounting standard. 5. Notes to Consolidated Balance Sheet 1) Revaluation Reserve for Land According to the Land Revaluation Law enacted on March 31, 1998, land used for business and owned by the Corporation was revalued on March 31, 2002 and an unrealized gain from the revaluation of land was reported as “Revaluation reserve for land, net of taxes” as a separate component of “Net Assets” and the relevant deferred tax liabilities were reported as “Deferred tax liabilities for revaluation reserve for land” as a separate component of “Non-Current Liabilities.” Such revaluation was allowed only at one specific time under the Law and cannot be undertaken at each financial year-end. According to the enforcement ordinance of the Law, there are several methods allowed to determine the revalued amount of land. The Corporation adopted a method of using the assessed value for property taxes with appropriate adjustments. 96 Shimizu Corporate Report 2018 Financial Section 2) Assets Pledged as Collateral The following assets are pledged as collateral for borrowings at affiliated companies and others.

Financial Instruments 1) Overview (1) Policy for financial instruments The Group raises operating funds primarily through bank borrowings and bond issues. Temporary fund surpluses are managed principally through short-term deposits with little risk. Under the Group’s policy, the Group uses derivatives only for the purpose of reducing risks by hedge, and not for speculative purposes. (2) Types of financial instruments, risk and risk management Regarding credit risk associated with customer’s operating receivables such as notes receivable and accounts receivable from construction contracts, the Group appropriately reduces such risk in response to the payment conditions and customer’s credit situation. Regarding investment securities held primarily for the purpose of maintaining business relationships, the Group comprehensively takes into account the benefits to the Corporation, acquisition value and stock price fluctuation risk, etc., judges whether or not to acquire these, and reconsiders the purpose of holding acquisitions from the same viewpoint each year. Regarding volatility risk of foreign exchange rates and interest rates, the Group conducts market risk management in line with its risk management rules for volatility in financial markets. The Group manages liquidity risk associated with raising funds by appropriately planning fund raising based on a three-month cash flow projection prepared monthly and the fiscal year’s cash flow projection. (3) Supplementary explanation on fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on market value or reasonable estimate if there is no market value. Since certain assumptions are used for estimating values, values could be different if different assumptions are applied. In addition, the derivative contract amounts described in “Derivatives” (Note 12) are not indicative of the actual market risk involved in derivative transactions. Shimizu Corporate Report 2018 101 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 2) Estimated fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of the financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheet as at March 31, 2017 and 2018, and estimated fair value are shown below. The following table does not include financial instruments for which it is extremely difficult to determine the fair value.

When the total amount becomes a net liability, the amount is indicated in parenthesis. Notes: 1. Method to determine the estimated fair value of financial instruments (1) Cash, (3) Marketable securities, (5) Notes and accounts payable—trade, (6) Short-term borrowings The Corporation uses carrying value for these amounts because they will be settled in the short term, meaning that carrying value approximate fair value. (2) Notes and accounts receivable—trade By receivables with separate fixed terms, the fair value is calculated by applying a discount rate determined taking into account the term of collection and the credit risk. (4) Investment securities The fair value of stocks is determined based on the stock market price and the fair value of bonds is determined based on the stock market price or prices quoted by financial institutions. Among “Investment securities,” non-listed shares, etc. (¥46,602 million ($438,368 thousand) in the consolidated balance sheets as at March 31, 2018 (¥40,942 million as at March 31, 2017) ) are not included in the above because determining the fair value for them is extremely difficult. (7) Bonds payable and current portion of bonds payable, (8) Convertible bond-type bonds with subscription rights to shares The fair value of the bonds issued by the Corporation is based on the prevailing market price. (9) Non-recourse bonds payable and current portion of non-recourse bonds payable Carrying value is used as fair value as there is a variable interest rate and the value is reviewed on a short term basis to reflect the market interest rate, meaning that carrying value approximate fair value. (10) Long-term borrowings, (11) Non-recourse borrowings and current portion of non-recourse borrowings The fair value of long-term borrowings and non-recourse borrowings are estimated by applying a discount rate to be applied to the total of principal and interest if a similar new borrowings agreement would be entered into. Some long-term borrowings and non-recourse borrowings are subject to special treatment of interest rate swap, and these are calculated by applying a discount rate to be applied to the total principal and interest with the consideration of the underlying interest rate swap if a similar new borrowings agreement would be entered into. (12) Derivative transactions The fair value of derivative transactions is valued from prices quoted by financial institutions.

Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for designing and operating such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. The purpose of an audit of the consolidated financial statements is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control, but in making these risk assessments the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Shimizu Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries as at March 31, 2018, and their consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. Convenience Translation We have reviewed the translation of these consolidated financial statements into U.S. dollars, presented for the convenience of readers, and, in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been properly translated on the basis described in Note 2.
