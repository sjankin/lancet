Since its establishment in 1717, ONO has resolutely pushed forward in the pharmaceutical industry under the corporate philosophy “Dedicated to Man’s Fight against Disease and Pain.” We aim to contribute to society by developing pharmaceutical products that truly bene�its patients, and we will continue to tackle diseases that have not been overcome, as well as the disease areas where the satisfaction level with the treatment is still low among patients and medical needs are high. As a company that delivers pharmaceutical products affecting the lives and quality of life of patients, we always engage with the community with a sincere and faithful attitude and making efforts to further strengthen our compliance system on a company-wide scale, so as not only to comply with laws and regulations but also to act in accordance with high ethical standards. President, Representative Director, and CEO Gyo Sagara We set the ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Codes of Conduct as the basis of our CSR management and speci�ied six priority areas for our CSR activities in light of the seven core subjects de�ined in ISO 26000, an international standard providing guidelines for social responsibility, and we have promoted the activities with company-wide efforts. The �irst of these priority areas is Corporate Governance, which forms the foundation for the �ive remaining areas of Innovative Pharmaceutical Products, Human Resources and Human Rights, The Environment, Fair Operating Practices, and Society. We will promote activities related to these priority areas to ful�ill our social responsibility to all stakeholders and contribute to the sustainable development of society. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈2〉 CSR Management Identifying six priority areas based on our corporate philosophy and Codes of Conduct, and contributing to sustainable social development through business activities ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Codes of Conduct represent the ideal state of a company from a perspective of a high standard of ethics. They also guide us in acting with respect for human rights of all people, complying with laws and regulations, and striving to maintain fair relations with society in every aspect our business activities. Placing the ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Codes of Conduct at the foundation of our CSR management, we have cross-checked them against the Seven Core Subjects of ISO 26000, and identi�ied Six Priority Areas for the CSR activities. Based on our Corporate Governance, we have de�ined the other priority areas as Innovative Pharmaceutical Products, Human Resources and Human Rights, The Environment, Fair Operating Practices, and Society, and we are committed to demonstrating accountability to our stakeholders by disclosing information about our efforts in these areas.

We promote efforts to improve safety and health conditions, and to create a working environment where the company and its employees can live in harmony and individual abilities blossom to their full extent. We also value a society where human rights are fully respected and seek to establish a company with no discrimination. ● The Environment Keeping in mind our corporate social responsibilities for the environment, we promote environmental efforts to realize a global environment rich in natural beauty through environmentally sustainable activities in all areas of business operations. ● Fair Operating Practices We thoroughly implement employee education based on our Codes of Conduct and anti-bribery rules and strengthen compliance to establish and maintain sound, fair and transparent relations with medical professionals and trading partners as well as with government and administrative bodies. ● Society We raise our social value by creating and developing pharmaceuticals that truly bene�it patients. We always engage with the community with sincerity and act in harmony with the community as a local corporate citizen. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈4〉 How to Identify Priority Areas 1. ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Codes of Conduct represent the ideal state of a company from six perspectives based on high ethical standards. 2. We identify the social issues to be considered for CSR management and divide them into those which we are required to address, those for which we should give support, and those for which we can give indirect support. 3. We assess and review those issues in consideration of the progress in addressing them, as well as social demand, to identify any items which we should add or aspects on which we should enhance our efforts. CSR Promotion Structure To promote CSR activities, we have the CSR Committee in place, chaired by the Director, Senior Managing Executive Of�icer. The Committee, which mainly consists of managers from various divisions, deliberates and makes decisions on important issues and subjects in the six priority areas for CSR activities. The activities of the Committee are periodically reported to the management. Representative Director Management Strategy Meeting Divisions directly Corporate Management controlled by the Discovery and Research Corporate Development Division Sales and Marketing Clinical Development President Safety and Quality CMC – Production Corporate Planning Legal Department Human Resource Corporate Human Capital General Affairs Committee CSR Division Division & Strategy Division Division Assurance Division Compliance Members Committee Development Communications Department Department promotion Department Department Department Department Secretariat : CSR Promotion Section Corporate Social Responsibility 〈5〉 Participation in United Nations Global Compact In November 2017, we participated in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), which is composed of 10 principles advocated by the UN concerning human rights, labour, the environment, and anti-corruption. We will comply with relevant laws and disseminate the Ten Principles of the Global Compact through our daily activities to ensure that all employees follow them. The Ten Principles of the UNGC 〈Human Rights〉 Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 〈Labour〉 Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 〈Environment〉 Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 〈Anti-Corruption〉 Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈6〉 Efforts made for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were adopted at the United Nation Summit in 2015, are the common goals of the international community and consists of 17 goals. In the SDGs, good health and well-being for all is listed as Goal 3. Under our corporate philosophy “Dedicated to Man's Fight against Disease and Pain,” we, as a R&D-oriented company specialized in pharmaceuticals, take offering innovative drugs as an important CSR issue and are making efforts to realize it. Specifying cancer, immunologic diseases, and central nervous diseases as our priority research areas, we will develop original innovative drugs for diseases where medical needs still cannot be met, and contribute to achieving Goal 3: Good health and well-being for all through improving medical access. As Goal 9, build infrastructure for industrialization and technological innovation is listed. Building a foundation to offer innovative drugs is also important for us. We are proactively working on preparing the groundwork for innovation by promoting researches through research grants for domestic and overseas researchers funded by the Ono Medical Research Foundation and Ono Pharma Foundation. As Goal 17, leveraging partnerships to achieve the goals is listed. Offering innovative drugs can be achieved not only by ourselves, but also through various partnerships. We had promoted the development of our original drugs in various �ields by leveraging the world’s cutting-edge technologies, knowledge and �indings even before the term “open innovation” was popularized. At the same time, we also proactively work on the introduction and derivation of new drug candidate compounds. Furthermore, in addition to partnership activities with venture and other pharmaceutical companies, we form partnerships with various stakeholders, such as universities, research institutions, administrations, local communities, and NPOs, and make efforts to resolve issues through open innovation. You can �ind out more about our major business partners from here. We are now identifying materiality of our CSR activities, and by the end of FY 2018, we will determine which SDGs we should focus on besides the above three goals.

Corporate Governance Structure As part of our endeavors to bolster corporate governance, ONO has adopted an organizational framework with a Corporate Auditor (or Board of Corporate Auditors) whose task is to focus on enhancing the functions of the Board of Directors and the Board of Corporate Auditors. Corporate Governance Structure Annual General Meeting of Shareholders Appointment / Appointment /dismissal Appointment /dismissal dismissal Board of Board of Directors Corporate Auditors Directors Corporate Auditors Accounting Report Outside Corporate Auditors Auditing Outside Directors Report Appointment / Auditor dismissal Auditing Business Organization Cooperation Representative Director Cooperation Management Strategy Meeting Compliance Legal & Other Accounting & Other Meetings Committee Advice/ Audit Guidance Advisors Appointment /dismissal Internal Audit Corporate Officers Business Audit Department Divisions & Offices Employees & Others ●Board of Directors As for board members, we select the candidates taking into consideration the balance and diversity of their knowledge, experience, and pro�iciency, so that the Board of Directors as a whole can make technical and comprehensive management decisions. The term of of�ice for each director is limited to one year. This serves to clarify their responsibility, and it allows the board to respond �lexibly to changes in the management environment. The board system are determined in a way that is optimally suited to enforcing management transparency, enhancing corporate governance, and expediting the decision-making process. Presently, the board consists of eight members, including three outside directors. The board holds a meeting every month in principle to deliberate and make decisions on important management issues and to assess how each board member is conducting his or her duties. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈9〉 ●Board of Auditors To maintain a strong auditing function, the Board of Auditors comprises two independent outside auditors along with two full-time auditors who have expert knowledge on our business operations and who are highly skilled in collecting auditing information. These full-time and outside auditors work together to achieve high auditing ef�iciency. The Board of Auditors holds a meeting regularly. Working with the internal auditing department （Business Audit Department）to enforce auditing ef�iciency, the Board of Corporate Auditors endeavors to improve its functions of the management oversight by enhancing the effectiveness of audits in cooperation with the accounting auditor. ●Outside Directors / Outside Auditors The outside directors except a new director appointed in June 2018 attended all meetings of the Board of Directors held in FY 2017. From an independent and objective standpoint, they oversee our business operations and take part in our decision-making process. They are involved in the process of making important decisions such as nomination of of�ices and executive compensation, help to ensure the transparency and objectivity and enhance the functions of the board by serving as members of the Director Appointment Committee and the Executive Compensation Committee. The outside auditors attended all meetings of the Board of Directors and the Board of Auditors held during �iscal 2017. As experts in law and corporate accounting, the outside auditors carry out the audits from an independent and objective standpoint to ensure that our management remains sound and strong. Outside of�icers provide useful advice and suggestions for our business management based on their abundant experience and profound knowledge. There is no special interest relationship between these outside of�icers and ONO such as personal relationships, capital relationships, and business relationships, based on which we believe there is no risk of con�lict of interest with general shareholders. ●Operational Management Structure For the improved ef�iciency and accuracy of our decision making and business operations, we hold Management Strategy Meetings and other meetings attended by the president, board members, corporate of�icers in charge of each division, and managers of relevant departments. At these meetings, we take a multifaceted approach to addressing important management issues, including those that are to be deliberated on at board meetings. We also aim to improve management ef�iciency and make quicker decisions by introducing a corporate of�icer system and promoting transfer of authority. Auditors are obliged to attend Management Strategy Meetings and inspect their minutes, as these meetings are also subject to auditing. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 10 〉 Corporate Governance Code As for the Corporate Governance Code stipulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we follow all principles before revisions (general principles that respectively specify the �ive issues of securing the rights and equal treatment of shareholders, appropriate cooperation with stakeholders other than shareholders, ensuring appropriate information disclosure and transparency, responsibilities of the board, and dialogue with shareholders, as well as the principles that embody the general principles and supplementary principles). Through the assessment of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors and other measures, we will continuously develop and improve our system in a way to make it more suitable for our business operations from such perspectives as the management ef�iciency, soundness, and transparency. As for the Corporate Governance Code revised in June 2018, we will continue to respond to it appropriately. Internal Control System We have laid out our operational system in compliance with the corporate governance guidelines set out by the board of directors. Implementation of the system is inspected regularly by the Internal Auditing Department (Business Audit Department). Results are reported to the board of directors with the aim of constantly improving the system. Furthermore, we adopt a �irm stance of �ighting against any antisocial forces or organizations that may threaten social order or security. Risk Management We work to identify potential major risks to prevent them from occurring, and we have a structure in place to ensure that appropriate actions are taken in case of their occurrence. In addition, we are making efforts to effectively and ef�iciently solve risk management issues, including promotion of the establishment of company-wide risk management system with the senior executive of�icer / executive director in charge. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 11 〉 ●Rules on the management of the risk of loss and other systems 1. We manage risks related to compliance, product quality and safety, safety and health, the environment, disasters, information security, and other issues on the basis of internal rules and through the preparation and distribution of procedures in the relevant sections, as well as through training and other measures. 2. Cross-organizational risks and risks deemed to have a signi�icant impact on management are monitored and addressed at a meeting attended by the president and representative director, the directors and corporate of�icers in charge, and the managers of relevant divisions. In case of unexpected situations, the president calls a meeting with concerned parties to solve problems promptly. 3. Risks speci�ic to a division are addressed through the preparation of handling procedures, which are reviewed constantly in accordance with changes in the business environment. ●System to ensure proper business operations of the corporate group composed of ONO and its subsidiaries We provide consultation and guidelines for our group companies with regard to their legal compliance and risk management. While respecting their autonomy, we request that each company provides us with regular business reports and consults with us on important business issues in advance. Business Continuity Plan (BCP) According to the instructions of the Emergency Response Committee chaired by the president, we have organized the Crisis Management Headquarters and established a system designed to minimize the impact of an emergency on mission-critical operations even in the case where an emergency occurs such as a natural disaster or serious accident, so that we can continue business activities or recover promptly and resume them if they are suspended. The BCM Committee, which is chaired by the senior executive of�icer / executive director (executive director of Corporate Management Division) and in charge of business continuity management (BCM), and the Management Of�ice have been formed to maintain and strengthen our abilities to respond to crisis and continue our business operations, and promote relevant management activities during normal times. We have installed systems prepared for disasters such as emergency generators and duplicate power service in our head of�ice building, the Tokyo Building, and all of our plants and research institutions, and we also have introduced seismic isolation systems to prepare for earthquakes in our head of�ice building, the Tokyo Building, and the Minase Research Institute. As we have transferred some of the Osaka Head Of�ice’s functions to the Tokyo Building, we can use resources such as internal systems and inventories at either base in the event of natural disasters in one area. The development of our two-base system prevents us from having to stop our business activities and improves our ability to continue our business operations.

We actively conduct investor relations (IR) activities based on a policy of pursuing accuracy, promptness, fairness, and impartiality. We disclose �inancial results and other timely disclosure information on our website and at the same time through TDnet, the timely disclosure network of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Information that is not subject to the timely disclosure rules is also disclosed swiftly through our website and by other means. For securities analysts and institutional investors, we actively hold individual meetings and phone conferences in addition to a �inancial results brie�ing or a conference call at the time of each quarterly statement, having held 250 meetings in total in FY 2017. We also participate diligently in investor conferences sponsored by securities �irms and the like in order to facilitate individual investors’ understanding of our business activities and management strategy. Our website contains an IR library that provides useful current and past data, including development progress updates, as well as �inancial highlights for the last �ive years. Also, we endeavor to convey our corporate information to a wider range of people in an easy-to-understand manner by issuing business reports (shareholder newsletters) and corporate reports. We will disclose the information more accurately and promptly. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 13 〉 Innovative Pharmaceutical Products Dedicated to Man’s Fight against Disease and Pain is our corporate philosophy as a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of new drugs. In line with this philosophy, we work to bring world-class innovative drugs as soon as possible to patients across the globe through collaboration between all our divisions including research, development, business strategy, manufacturing, safety/quality assurance, and marketing, as well as through the dedication of all employees to the efforts with passion and conviction.

Also, in lowand lower middle-income countries, there are many people who have dif�iculty receiving necessary medical care due to various reasons such as inadequate medical infrastructure and poverty. Under the corporate philosophy “Dedicated to Man’s Fight against Disease and Pain,” we aim to improve the degree of medical access with the following goals: development of innovative pharmaceutical products, improvement of medical infrastructure and the establishment of partnerships with outside parties. The Direction of our efforts ・Promotion of research and development for measures against diseases for which patients’ medical needs are not yet met, rare diseases, and intractable diseases ・Local medical education, training of medical personnel, improvement of medical supplies in countries and regions where medical infrastructure is not fully developed ・Establishment of partnerships with outside parties as necessary to deal with issues Promotion Management System The management team oversees the directions for the improvement of medical access and the details of the efforts. New efforts associated with medical access will be deliberated on and approved by the CSR Committee, chaired by the Senior Executive Of�icer. Its activities are periodically reported to the Management Strategy Meeting which is chaired by the CEO. Examples of Efforts Working on the treatment of rare diseases is important so as to improve medical access. We make the following efforts to develop and provide pharmaceuticals for rare diseases. Date designated Product name Therapeutic indication Status as an orphan drug Malignant melanoma that has no possibility 2013.06.17 Approved of radical resection Recurrent or intractable classical OPDIVO 2016.03.16 Approved Hodgkin lymphoma intravenous infusion Progressing or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma that has no possibility of 2017.12.01 Approved radical resection Improvement of pheochromocytoma symptoms in a Metyrosine Under state of excess catecholamine release and associated 2015.05.25 (generic name) developmen improvement of other symptoms Kyprolis for Recurrent or intractable multiple myeloma 2015.08.20 Approved intravenous infusion The kinds of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia in Onoact for Under intractable and urgent cases: ventricular fibrillation and 2016.08.24 intravenous infusion developmen hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia Binimetinib Malignant melanoma due to BRAF mutations that has Under 2018.03.30 (generic name) no possibility of radical resection developmen Encorafenib Malignant melanoma due to BRAF mutations that has Under 2018.03.30 developmen (generic name) no possibility of radical resection In addition, Opdivo is designated as a target item under the Priority Assessment Designation System, speci�ied by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, that targets bile duct cancer. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 16 〉 Efforts Made for Flexible Approval for Children Medication evaluated appropriately for children should be used for pediatric patients. Aiming to improve pediatric patients’ access to pharmaceuticals, we are working on the �lexible approval for children as follows. Product name Pharmaceutical indication Status Patency of ductus arteriosus in ductus Prostandin for injection Approved arteriosus-dependent congenital heart disease Onon® Dry Syrup Bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis Approved Digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting) resulting from the EMEND® Capsules administration of antineoplastic agents (cisplatin, etc.) Approved (including the delayed phase) Digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting) resulting from the PROEMEND® for administration of antineoplastic agents (cisplatin, etc.) Approved intravenous injection.

It is expected that the achievements of this consortium will lead to the creation of next-generation pharmaceuticals with high utility against intractable immunoin�lammatory diseases and also enable the provision of new treatment options for patients and healthcare professionals. Project ONO SWITCH As an effort made to promote both Work Style Reform and activities to contribute to society, we started Project ONO SWITCH in August 2018. This effort is an effort to make donations to NPOs/NGOs related to medical care using the money saved through the reduction of overtime work through the promotion of Work Style Reform, aiming to further promote the embodiment of the corporate philosophy “Dedicated to Man’s Fight against Disease and Pain by contributing to the promotion of working style reform and healthcare and people’s health around the world. The project was named by abbreviating Save the World by our work style ImprovemenT and CHange (meaning saving the world through improvement and reform of our ways of working). The project name also expresses switching work methods to new ones, switching the funds obtained through working style reform to donation, and switching on the process of reexamining how to work. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 17 〉 Recipients: We donated to the following NPOs based on responses to questionnaires targeting all our employees.

In this project, we will work on improving access to pharmaceutical products and improving medical infrastructure through partnerships with outside parties. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 18 〉 Human Resources and Human Rights ONO PHARMACEUTICAL believes that “People make the company,” and actively supports the development of individual abilities and positive action taken without fear of failure. We promote efforts to improve safety and health conditions, and to create a working environment where the company and its employees can live in harmony and individual abilities blossom to their full extent. We also respect everyone’s human rights in all business activities and aim to establish a company with no discrimination either inside or outside the company due to race, nationality, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, belief or philosophy, academic background, disability or illness. Development of Human Resources ●Concept of Human Resource Development We aim to develop human resources who become source for us to grow to be a global R&D oriented pharmaceutical enterprise as well as act in an ethical manner with a strong sense of responsibility as a member of a pharmaceutical enterprise involved in pharmaceutical products, which are closely related to the lives of people. Desired characteristics for our human resources Those who make bold efforts and independently act based on their self-discipline ・are innovation-minded and never give up trying until the end; ・can demonstrate their abilities in a team environment and can work collaboratively; ・have a strong sense of responsibility for, and are proud of, their own jobs; ・always take a positive approach and can learn and grow independently; and ・act in an ethical manner with common sense. Having over 300 years of history since our foundation, we desire human resources who will be the fountainhead for us to continue to make bold efforts for the future. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 19 〉 ●Provision of Growth Opportunities We organize a wide range of training programs to provide employees with growth opportunities. Besides collective training given in each phase of their career growth, we have introduced company-wide joint training for new employees from all divisions, departmental introductory training, and annual training for young employees. We also organize training programs to cultivate global human resources who can work actively under any circumstances, and send employees to overseas af�iliates. For management staff, we provide training focusing on management skills required for their respective roles and managerial positions and for the growth of the organization, and we continuously enhance the training programs. As for the efforts made mainly by MRs, training is also conducted at medical institutions so that our employees have opportunities to listen to the opinions of patients and medical staff directly and know in depth the needs in the medical �ield. In addition, we have a system to assist employees in self-learning with an aim to encourage employees to engage in personal development and grow independently.

After that, they undergo education specialized for the divisions they’re assigned to. In addition, after 10 months of being employees, follow-up training for newly hired employees is provided for them to take time to review events in the �irst year as members of society, to refresh their minds for the second year. The goal of the third-year employee training is for employees to learn that it is necessary to radically change their minds―moving one step ahead from independence to self-discipline―and to make efforts for voluntary proposals, proactive actions, and the promotion of the development of younger employees. The training includes learning communication skills required for achieving goals, and contents that lead to good on-site practices. The goal of the �ive-year employee training is to further raise motivation for work by having employees view their work in a multifaceted manner and review it from creative perspectives. The training includes experiential learning cycles for them to grow themselves while achieving outcomes, and contents that help the participants digest tacit knowledge to establish their cherished opinions, leading to effective practices and outward development. Training for promoted employees The highest level individual contributors training makes participants understand the roles required for a manager, and develop awareness and attitudes concerning proactive team management. In addition, the training helps participants acquire the skills to identify problems and understand what is necessary to become an in�luencer. The training for new management staff is provided to understand the personnel evaluation system, and to acquire the management skills required for being the next candidates for managers, which improves their abilities to build relationships of trust with others and to get things done. At the training for employees who are appointed as managers from among the core employees, participants learn about reaf�irming the personnel evaluation system, understanding labor management, the roles expected for managers, team building, and team management. Manager training The manager training provides a program that incorporates understanding and practicing the mission statement and human resource development. Various kinds of training are held every year. For example, management skill training at which managers from all departments get together for the purpose of intensifying interactions between departments, training for evaluators aiming to effectively use a goal-setting interview system and evaluate employees in a fair and accurate manner, and training regarding compliance and efforts for mental health care conducted by managers for employees, aiming to establish a working environment where it is easier to work. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 21 〉 Coaching training In coaching training, trainees take training through online classes once a week with other trainees from different industries, in addition to receiving directions every two to three weeks from a professional coach for managers to learn about coaching. In parallel, coaching for the subordinates and employees is carried out over the course of about a year. Training for selected employees The executive candidate development training targets senior managers nominated by of�icers, and it takes two to four years to develop the next generation of executives. Trainees re-acquire the theory and principles of management and develop self-awareness and self-discipline as managers by having deep discussions on future visions and changes in organizations/businesses with other trainees. The next-generation leader development training targets employees who are nominated as future global leaders by department managers. The purpose of the training is to develop human resources that will in�luence the entire company while demonstrating leadership within the team at all sites, whether in Japan or overseas, in cooperation with others in an appropriate manner. Trainees spend about a year acquiring environmental adaptability, leadership, logical thinking, and global business skills. English training This is training to acquire English skills essential for global business. In addition, in order to strengthen the capability of performing English-related work, we have three programs: a one-week camp-style English conversation training program in Japan, a three-month study abroad language training program, and weekly lectures by dispatched English instructors (two-year course). Diversity management training We are always pursuing innovation to continuously create the world's �irst pharmaceuticals. As a source of ideas leading to creation of innovation, broad diversity regardless of specialized �ields, gender, and nationality is increasingly required in the future. In this seminar, we not only understand the signi�icance of diversity, but also improve the skills of interviewing to make better use of it, and acquire management capabilities. Voluntary training We provide voluntary training for young employees who desire to proactively learn. This includes training to develop managers’ perspectives in the early stages of their careers such as management simulation games that allow participants to learn accounting and �inance, which are not familiar to those who work at some departments, and training to help participants raise awareness on cooperation between departments. Career planning training We provide opportunities for employees to review their individual careers and think positively about career afterwards as a form of training. They learn various career theories and participate in a group work format for them to develop their future career plans, leading to better results by discovering their unnoticed qualities and strengths, along with what personally feels rewarding to them. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 22 〉 Self-development learning We provide employees who desire to proactively learn with opportunities for self-development learning. Through correspondence education, we have over 140 courses such as leadership and management, accounting, �inance, and English conversation, and we arrange an environment on a steady basis for those proactive learners with wide range of �ields. In addition, we promote self-development learning by aiding online English conversation classes and quali�ication tests.

E-learning is used for basic training such as phytotoxicity education, which is essential for employees of pharmaceutical companies, collecting safety information, handling personal information, and the prevention of bribery. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 23 〉 Respect for Human Rights ONO will respect everyone’s human rights in all business activities. Based on this principle, we promote establishment and operation of the personnel system in line with the policy that “no discrimination should be allowed either inside or outside the Company due to race, nationality, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, belief/philosophy, academic background, disability or illness.” We also prohibit any forms of harassment and provide compliance training. Furthermore, ONO supports international norms and codes regarding human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the core labor standards of the ILO (International Labor Organization), and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Diversity Promotion Initiatives ONO considers that it is important to diversify the characteristics, values, and behavioral features of the members of the organization and accept their individuality for prompt and �lexible responses to environmental changes and improvement of the corporate value. In line with this idea, we promote various initiatives. ●Efforts made for promoting women’s participation and advancement A priority in this area is a commitment to the development of a system under which women can realize their full potential. As a result of our efforts to aggressively hire women and discourage female workers from quitting after major life events, the number of female employees has been steadily increasing, and the employment rate of female employees as of March 2018 rose by 3.5% compared that as of March 2013. Other initiatives to create an environment in which women can play more active roles include the introduction of programs aimed at improving diversity and inclusion into management staff training and seniority-/hierarchybased training. We have participated in the Diversity Western Japan Study Group, which is operated voluntarily by about 60 companies from western Japan and other parts of the country since 2015 to share information on know-how and initiatives for the improvement of diversity through participation in seminars held beyond the boundaries of companies and other activities. We continuously work to increase the number of female employees and build a system that helps them develop their career in line with our �ive-year action plan (from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2021) formulated in response to the Japanese government’s enactment in FY2015 of a law to promote women’s roles in the workplace (Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace).

This exceeds the legally stipulated rate (2.2%) amended in 2018. Approximately 50 employees with disabilities are currently playing an active role in their respective divisions. We have also been expanding mid-career employment to quickly obtain human resources with the skills, knowledge, and experiences that are needed immediately. Especially since FY2014, when we started to actively promote such employment in consideration of the business environment, the number of mid-career employees has been increasing substantially in broad range of jobs such as MRs, development personnel, staff in the safety information management department, and administration staff. A total of about 70 new employees joined ONO in FY2017. Many mid-career employees are working to play their respective parts using their experience and expertise.

We are continuously committed to the development of support systems and working conditions that help employees work in various styles, as well as the improvement of their work-life balance, so that each and every person in our diverse workforce can bring energy to their work and demonstrate their full potential. ●Promotion of the Review of Working Styles We consider that the shortening of work hours is an essential and fundamental challenge to be addressed for the development of a pleasant work environment. To this end, we focus on the review of working styles. We appoint a promotion committee member in each department to involve the whole company in the activities, and the members work to raise awareness and encourage employees to improve operational ef�iciency and take paid holidays. We have also improved the system by making use of IT and introduced a �lexible time system and telecommuting system. Through these initiatives, we achieved positive results such as a year-on-year decrease in work hours by 0.5% and a year-on-year increase in the rate of taking paid holidays by 6.4% during the period from April 2017 to March 2018. ●Employee satisfaction survey We regularly conduct employee satisfaction surveys to highlight the organizational issues and improve employee satisfaction. The satisfaction survey results lead to planning of measures to create a workplace where all employees can �ind what personally feels rewarding to them and they can enjoy their jobs. ●Childcare Support Activities Based on an idea that support of families raising children as part of the efforts of the whole society and creation of a better environment for having and raising children is one of the issues to which companies should be committed, we set up an action plan in accordance with the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children established by the Japanese government, and have proceeded with the plan since 2005. ONO was certi�ied as a general business operator meeting the criteria in 2008, 2012, and 2014, obtaining “Kurumin,” the mark accredited to such business operators. Our past efforts were rewarded as ONO received two Osaka Labor Bureau Director’s Prizes in the 2015 Equal Employment/Work-Life Balance Corporation Awards, sponsored by Japan’s Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare. One was in the category of companies promoting gender equality, and the other was in the category of family-friendly companies. In the 5th phase of the action plan, which started in April 2017, we promote initiatives to build an environment in which men can actively take part in child-raising, such as the introduction of new child-raising support systems including holidays to encourage employees to take part in child-raising, as well as strengthening of the delivery of a message that child-raising is a life event to be shared by men and women in order to ensure that the male employees who wish to participate in child-raising by taking childcare leave can obtain consent from people around them. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 26 〉 Period ・Introduction of shortened work hour programs for 1st phase of employees raising preschool children April 1, 2005 to March 31, 2008 action plan ・Introduction of a leave program for nursing care of children ・Encouragement of employees to take annual paid holidays ・Expansion of the shortened work hour programs for 2nd phase of employees raising children April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012 action plan ・Implementation of measures to reduce overtime work ・Provision of information to encourage male employees 3rd phase of to take childcare leave April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2014 action plan ・Introduction of a re-employment scheme for employees who have left their jobs due to childcare and other reasons ・Examination of a new program to support female employees to continue their careers, and introduction and dissemination of the program 4th phase of April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2017 ・Implementation of measures to reduce overtime work action plan ・Survey of the current situation on annual paid holidays taken by employees and implementation of measures to encourage employees to take the holidays ・Introduction of support systems that encourage men to take childcare leave and participate in child-raising and 5th phase of dissemination of them April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2019 action plan ・Encouragement of employees to take annual paid holidays to achieve their work-life balance ●Support for Employees with Cancer Employees diagnosed with cancer face various problems during work such as regular hospital visits, side effects of various treatment, and economic issues. To assist employees with cancer who wish to continue working while being treated, ONO provides a system to prolong the period of absence from work, an income security program to help them avoid a period with no income, a system to allow the use of accumulated holidays on a half-day basis, and a system to offer shortened working hours for the treatment of cancer. We also provide support from other perspectives such as the promotion of understanding among other people in the workplace by establishing a system to encourage such people to support employees with cancer and enhancing the dissemination of it, as well as efforts to review their working styles. ●Other Support Systems ONO has in place various systems aimed at creating a pleasant working environment in addition to the programs required by law. We have listened to the voices of employees and developed systems that meet their actual needs. When introducing a program for which legal standards are speci�ied, we set up the program in a way to exceed the standards. Thus, we continuously work to develop support systems so that employees have many options for working styles. We also prepare and post a booklet on our intranet that summarizes the systems to inform employees about the contents and how to use them. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 27 〉 【Systems that exceed the standards specified by labor related laws】 ・Childcare leave Japanese law stipulates that childcare leave can be taken until the time the child turns one year old. However, employees at ONO can take childcare leave until the end of the month when the child turns three years old. ・Shortened work hours for childcare Japanese law stipulates that shortened work hours for childcare leave can be utilized until the child turns three years old. But employees at ONO can shorten their working hours by up to two hours per day until March 31 of the year that their child is in third grade of elementary school. ・Nursing care leave While companies are legally required to provide nursing care leave for up to 93 days in total per family member in need of care, ONO provides the leave for up to a year in total. 【Legally required systems】 ・Shortened work hours for nursing care When an employee works while providing care to family members in need of care, the working time can be shortened by up to two hours per day for up to three years aside from the period of nursing care leave. ・Family care leave Employees who have to provide care to preschool children and other family members in need of care can take family care leave without pay. The prescribed number of days is five per year for employees with one person in need of care, and 10 days for those with two or more such persons. 【Systems that promote flexible working styles】 ・Flexible working hours As an initiative that provides employees with more options for working styles to thereby help them improve their work efficiency and achieve a work-life balance in which they give equal priority to their jobs, family, childcare, and nursing care, the entire company has a flexible working hours system with some exceptions. ・Telecommuting system All employees are eligible to use the telecommuting system aiming to support employees who are working while taking childcare and nursing care in balancing work and such care. The system was designed so that employees can establish their individual working styles and work in a flexible and efficient manner. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 28 〉 【Various leave and subsidy systems】(extract) While employees may take leave when they cannot come to work due to attendance to weddings, funerals, and other ceremonies of their own or their family members, moving for job transfer, and accidents, disasters, and other events of force majeure, we also have systems in which special paid holidays can be taken under other circumstances. ・Accumulated holidays Expired annual paid holidays can be accumulated under certain conditions and used for the treatment of the disease or injury of the employee, nursing care of family members, fertility treatment, and other purposes. For example, an employee can take a paid holiday using this system in case of sudden illness of their children. ・Holidays to encourage employees to take part in child-raising Employees at ONO can take up to two days off for child-raising until the child reaches the age of 1. This system can be used in a wide range of situations such as regular health checkups and immunization. ・Maternity protection leave A pregnant employee or an employee within one year from delivery can take leave up to the days specified according to the time of pregnancy to receive a health instruction or health checkup. Other than leave for checkups, up to five days off in total can be taken for the duration of each pregnancy when the employee cannot come to work due to morning sickness or suspicion of threatened premature labor. ・Support of employee volunteer activities ONO has introduced a volunteer vacation program, which provides a five-day special paid vacation to support employees involved in volunteer activities. We also have a bone-marrow donor leave scheme to give special paid vacation during the period when employees need to take days off for bone-marrow donation. ・Subsidies for day-care centers and baby-sitting For employees raising preschool children and whose spouses are also working, ONO provides subsidies to help pay for day-care centers or baby sitters when they need such services and make an application for the subsidies. These subsidies are also available if an ONO employee’s spouse (working or not working) is ill or cannot care for the child for some other reason. ・Subsidies for sick child care A subsidy will be paid by the company upon application when it is necessary for a double-income family with a child under two years old to use sick child care facilities / services. Also, subsidies will be also paid to non double-income family if a spouse uses such facilities/services because of his/her sickness, etc. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 29 〉 【Other systems】 ・Use of company cars to pick up and drop off children MRs are allowed to use company cars for the purpose of picking up or dropping off their children before or after work. ・Day-care Center Concierge (day-care center enrollment support system) In order to support smooth returning of employees who took a childcare leave, we have a third party provide information for such employees to have their children enroll a day-care center. ・Accompanying spouses transferred overseas For an ONO employee who wishes to accompany his/her spouse transferred by the company of the spouse to another country, ONO allows the employee to take up to three years off work. ・Re-employment for employees who have quit ONO The employees who have retired due to problems balancing work and family duties after major life events such as marriage, childbirth, and child-raising, or nursing care of family members can be re-employed when certain conditions are met. ・Non-regular re-employment The employees who have reached the mandatory retirement age and retired can be re-employed as part-time employees when certain conditions are met until they reach the age of 65. ●Efforts made regarding wages We strictly comply with the Minimum Wage Act, safeguard the daily lives of our employees, and work hard to create a workplace environment that is easy to work in. ●Safety and Health For safety and health, ONO holds the regular meetings of the safety and health committee to continuously improve the work environment. Our production sites and research institutes conduct safety and health inspections, report the problems identi�ied during the inspections to the committee, and make proposals for improvement to disseminate information and take proper actions. The inspections are carried out in all ONO workplaces every year to check the items including measures and equipment for the prevention of �ires and other disasters, safe handling of machinery, the level of safety in daily work, transport work, and the level of neatness, tidiness, and cleanliness in workplaces. At the ONO Head Of�ice and other company sites where a Health Committee is stablished, the Committee discusses health issues based on results of workplace environmental measurements. In addition, the Central Safety and Health Committee is held to provide opportunities for sharing information and exchanging opinions between all Safety and Health Committees and Health Committees and considering policies and measures that contribute to sanitation as a whole company.

In addition, we systematically promote educational activities such as creating and posting original posters using illustrations drawn by employees. ・In order to support the employees who try to quit smoking, we implement an in-house smoking cessation contest, whose goal is to quit smoking in six weeks in a wise and enjoyable manner.” We support employees' health promotion activities through supports such as subsidies for seeing a doctor at smoking cessation clinic and provision of online programs for smoking cessation. ・We conduct a walking campaign every year in the company. The event targets temporary staff and outsources in addition to all the employees. The event is designed to encourage voluntary participation by allowing not only individual employees but also their families to participate as a team. The participants who reach a certain criterion receive specialties in the areas stricken by the earthquake as a prize of achievement. The number of participants has increased year by year, and it is expected to encourage employees to walk regularly and frequently.

Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 34 〉 The Environment Recent years have witnessed the increasing impact of global warming, and battling this threat has become one of our most important collective challenges in the international society. The Paris Agreement from COP 21 sets out a global action plan to limit global warming to less than 2°C compared to temperatures before the Industrial Revolution, with the target, for all intents and purposes, of completely halting the increase in human-generated greenhouse gases. Based on our ONO Pharmaceutical Environmental Guidelines, we have formulated a voluntary action plan under which we will strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from business activities on a company-wide basis. In this and other ways, we will ful�ill our corporate social responsibility by prioritizing the environment in all business areas and by contributing to the realization of a sustainable global environment. ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Environmental Guidelines ● Aware of corporate social responsibility for the environment, we will work to protect and preserve the global environment in all of our business operations. ● In addition to fully complying with all environment-related laws and regulations, we will establish targets and action plans in a continuous effort to protect and preserve the environment, including natural resources and biodiversity. ● In all of our business operations we will implement environment focused measures such as saving resources and energy, conservation of water resources, recycling, reducing waste, and preventing pollution. ● We will endeavor to do “Monozukuri” to produce eco-friendly products, and will cooperate with society. ● With the participation of every employee, we will strive to further understand environmental issues and to promote environment-related activities. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 35 〉 Environmental Management In recent years, commitment to the prevention of global warming has become one of our most important collective challenges. We endeavor to ful�ill our corporate social responsibility for the environment by prioritizing the environment in all business areas and by contributing to the realization of a sustainable global environment. We have formulated a voluntary environmental action plan in accordance with our Environmental Guidelines and speci�ied the activities and numerical targets to be achieved under the plan as mentioned below.

Meanwhile, we are promoting efforts in both tangible and intangible ways, such as reviewing / adjusting the operating hours of facilities and implementing Cool Biz and Warm Biz. We will continue our efforts for energy conservation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through measures such as adopting Top Runner Equipment and considering the introduction of renewable energy when updating old equipment. ＊CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency) is a method for evaluating and rating the environmental performance of buildings. It is a system that comprehensively evaluates the quality of buildings including not only environmental consciousness, such as energy conservation and the use of environmentally friendly materials, but also the consideration of indoor comfort and the building’s influence on the landscape. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 40 〉 ・Incorporating Renewable Energy Solar power, a form of renewable energy, is an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, since it does not need to release any when generating electricity. We introduced solar power generation facilities in our headquarters building in FY2003, the Minase Research Institute in FY2015, and the New Tokyo Building in FY2017. Solar panels at the Minase Research Institute Solar power monitoring system at the Minase Research Institute • Fuel-Related Initiatives By switching from fuels such as heavy oil and kerosene to utility gas and natural gas (LNG), the same amount of energy can be obtained but with fewer CO2 emissions. Therefore, switching to these cleaner fuels results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions. In our plants and research institutes, we are trying to reduce CO2 emissions by replacing heavy oil / kerosene with city gas and LNG. All fuels were converted to city gas or LNG at other bases that used to use heavy oil and kerosene by the end of FY2013. • Power Load Leveling In Japan, due to stoppages of nuclear power plants, the revised Energy Saving Act, which went into effect in FY2014, included provisions for cutting peak electricity usage in the summer and winter―a process known as power load leveling. We have been promoting electricity demand leveling by implementing a peak shift from daytime electricity use with a nighttime heat storage system at major bases and modifying the method of heating water for air conditioning (switching from air-cooled chillers to steam boilers), in addition to implementing seasonal energy-saving measures (suspension of use of hot-water toilet seats, water heaters, and some lighting) across the company. The Fujiyama Plant uses a cogeneration system (CGS) to generate power for its daily needs, thus easing the amount it needs to obtain from the electric power utility. • Energy Management In order to successfully carry out measures to achieve energy ef�iciency and power load leveling and to reduce CO2 emissions, it is helpful to gather data on energy usage from various facilities, analyze them, and use them to reduce and adjust the load. Through a monitoring system, graphs and �low charts are used to put data into an easy-to-grasp form so that the data can be used in the most effective way. While the production sites and the research institutes have conventionally measured energy use, we are gradually moving ahead with upgrading our energy management systems, which includes the possible adoption of a comprehensive FEMS (factory energy management system) and a BEMS (building energy management system). Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 41 〉 2) CO2 Emissions in the Value Chain (Scope 3) ONO divides CO2 emissions in the value chain (Scope 3) into 15 categories under the Ministry of the Environment’s guidelines, and since FY2014 it has been calculating them for sites in Japan. Based on the identi�ication of Scope 3 emissions, we will consider concrete measures to realize a low-carbon society.

Water Resources Availability of high-quality fresh water is one of the important factors for us in conducting business activities. The Environmental Management Committee leads and conducts surveys on risks, and identi�ies/analyzes/evaluates the business risks. Although our plants and research institutes in Japan have never experienced restrictions on using good-quality fresh water so far and the risk of trouble related to using such water is considered low under the current circumstances, we identify and evaluate potential impacts and consider countermeasures, in case water quality deterioration or a water shortage occurs due to global environmental changes caused by climate change in the future or the regulations on drainage are reinforced. Major water risk factors Potential impacts of the risks Restrictions on use of good-quality Making us unable to use good-quality fresh water, leading to restrictions fresh water / water shortage on activities for production and research Increasing costs for installing purification equipment to improve Water quality deterioration water quality Flooding / disasters such as Flooding the facilities due to the overflow of rivers near business heavy rainfall sites and torrential rains Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 43 〉 ●Efforts Made for Reducing Water Use In newly constructed facilities at of�ice buildings, research sites, plants, and other sites, we use water-saving sanitary equipment. For existing buildings, we are also making efforts for reducing water use, such as installing water-saving washers in faucets. In addition, a recycled water system has been installed at the Fukui Research Institute, and the annual water use there is 18,167 m3, which is 5.9% of our total water use.

We respond to the CDP water survey on the details of water risks, impact, usage, wastewater volume, etc. Waste ●Waste Management We promote company-wide initiatives to reduce the amount of industrial waste land�illed. The �inal land�ill disposal amount for industrial waste in FY2017 was 7.4 tons, 1,055.7% of that in the previous �iscal year. This was a temporary increase due to renovation work on the investigational drug-related facilities carried out at the Joto Plant. We will promote the reduction of land�ill waste. ・ Efforts made for reducing waste We are endeavoring to reduce the amount of waste generated by separating and recycling waste based on our waste management regulations and waste separation rules. Observation at the intermediate waste treatment facilities and land�ill sites run by waste treatment subcontractors are also conducted periodically to ensure our company’s waste is being disposed of appropriately. To meet the target of recycling all industrial waste, we also conduct thermal recycling with certi�ied heat recovery operators and use land�ill sites where material recycling is performed. We achieved zero emissions* again in FY2017 and will make efforts to continue to achieve zero emissions.

Note that we have not achieved zero emissions for certain materials, such as some hazardous substances and reagent waste, because their safe disposal is a higher priority. ●Recycling containers and product packaging Pursuant to the Containers and Packaging Recycling Law, some of the containers and packaging materials for the products we sell are recycled. In addition, we are working to reduce our environmental impact by changing the materials in our containers and changing the designs of our packaging.

They periodically measure the concentration of exhaust gas and noise from boilers and CGSs as well as wastewater from the plants, in accordance with related laws and other regulations, in order to ensure that levels are within regulatory limits. They also strive to reduce environmental risk. The PDCA cycle is followed in the plants, and employees are provided with the necessary environmental management training in operations in which there is a risk of environmental impact. Emergency drills are also conducted regularly. These drills use scenarios such as high concentrations of soot due to faulty equipment and leakages of oil into the ground, giving employees Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 45 〉 practice in the necessary preventative and responsive measures for such situations. In recent years, extreme weather events are occurring as a result of global warming. We have formulated manuals to prepare for accidents and emergency situations caused by such weather, and we organize training sessions to minimize environmental impacts. In particular, to address any accidents and emergency situations that may cause water or soil pollution, we systematically review and implement the backup and reinforcement of relevant equipment. ●Management of Chemicals ONO is committed to reducing chemical emissions to the lowest possible level not only in compliance with laws and regulations but also in recognition that these emissions may impact human health and the ecosystem. ・ Compliance with the PRTR Law In FY2017, the Minase Research Institute and the Joto Plant made reports on Class I designated chemical substances. These chemicals are managed in appropriate amounts and in compliance with the PRTR Law. Due to the suspension of the use of the incinerator at the Fukui Research Institute, dioxin emissions and transfers in FY2017 were zero.

Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 46 〉 ・Fluorocarbon Management In April 2015, amendments to the Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbons came into force, and the reporting of leakage from and inspection of air conditioning equipment and refrigerators/freezers for business use became obligatory. Therefore, we conduct activities such as the identi�ication of such equipment, simple inspections / periodic inspections, generation of records, and calculations of leakage. In FY2017, the calculated leakage of �luorocarbons was 197.9 tons-CO2. We will continue to prevent leakage and promote the introduction of non-CFC (chloro�luorocarbon) and low-GWP (global-warming potential) equipment when updating equipment. Green Purchasing In December 2004, we started purchasing on a company wide basis-from @of�ice, an online of�ice supply purchasing service provided by Kokuyo Co., Ltd. This service offers a wide range of environmentally friendly of�ice supplies, including Green Mark and Eco Mark certi�ied products, and we use this service to promote green procurement. In FY2017, 80% of the of�ice supplies purchased by ONO were environmentally friendly products. Independent Practitioner's Assurance As for the categories of environmental information listed below, indicated with for the year ended March 31, 2018 included in our CSR Report 2018, we have received independent assurance so as to bolster the reliability of the information.

In addition, we have disclosed environmental accounting data in reference to the Environmental Accounting Guidelines (2005 edition) issued by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan. ●Assessment of Environmental Efficiency We disclose an indicator that shows the ef�iciency of our environmental conservation activities in reducing environmental impact. To calculate this indicator, we classify the company’s environmental impacts into �ive categories: chemical substances, global warming, waste, water quality, and air quality. We then select a typical environmental factor for each of the categories and divide their amount of environmental impact by the net sales in the relevant �iscal year. The resulting �igure is then used to assess the level of reduction in environmental impact achieved through environmental conservation activities. Although our waste temporarily increased from the previous year due to renovation work on the investigational drug-related facilities carried out at the Joto Plant, the environmental ef�iciency indicator improved by 45.0 points due to the increase in sales in FY2017. We will remain committed to reducing our environmental impact and improving the environmental ef�iciency indicator.

Basic principles ONO PHARMACEUTICAL for corporate Codes of Conduct activities Standards of conduct for Compliance Program corporate activities Codes of Practice Fair Competition Rules Promotion Codes Standards of conduct that govern the actions of all executives and employees on medical workers/ institutions, researchers, patient groups and wholesalers Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 50 〉 Compliance Promotion Initiatives ●Compliance Promotion System To promote compliance, we have appointed a Corporate Compliance Of�icer and set up a Corporate Committee. The Corporate Committee examines and deliberates on compliance-related issues, plans and promotes relevant training programs, and checks to what extent such compliant related matters are shared and understood within the company in cooperation with the internal auditing department. We have internal and external contacts (refer to the chart below) including a 24-hour external contact service named the ONO Hot Line, which was set up in 2015 for compliance issues as well as a system to ensure that informants can directly report to or consult with top management-that is, the Representative Director, the Corporate Compliance Of�icer, and the Corporate Auditors. Under this system, compliance violations including harassment can be prevented, appropriate work environment can be ensured, and necessary measures can be taken to minimize any loss of credibility in the event of a compliance violation. We ensure that the matters including reporting person’s name, reported content, and his/her privacy are strictly kept con�idential to other than those involved in the survey, and support anonymous reporting. In addition, we will never bring detriment to such a reporting person solely because of use of the system. We provide guidance to associated group companies in creating systems and rules to prevent the occurrence of noncompliance, and we strongly urge our af�iliates and suppliers to do the same. We also continue enhancing the system to make the contacts available in the entire group so that employees can report or consult without hesitation. Violation of compliance/ Issue to be consulted on Contacts for violation of compliance reporting / work-related consultation Internal contacts Union External contacts External contacts Representative Director, Law firm ONO Hot Line Corporate (Outsourcing) Compliance Officer, Corporate Auditor, Manager of Human Resource Department, Manage of Legal Department, Manager of Business Audit Department, Chairman of Compliance Committee Chairperson Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 51 〉 ●Ethical Considerations ONO always gives consideration to ethical treatment in various stages of research and development. We conduct research using human specimens (blood, tissue, cells, genes, etc.) after strict deliberations on ethical and scienti�ic acceptability. To this end, we have established internal ethical codes based on the basic guidelines speci�ied by the Japanese government and set up the Research Using Human Specimens Ethics Committee composed of internal and external members as an advisory board. To ensure that the lives of the animals are respected and proper consideration is made to animal welfare in research using laboratory animals, we have established the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee that reviews whether all animal experimental protocols are prepared based on the principles of the 3Rs―Replacement (active use of alternative methods of experiment), Reduction (reducing the number of test animals), and Re�inement (alleviation of pain)―in advance. The committee also implements self-inspections and assessments of the animal experiment processes. In recognition of these initiatives, Ono has earned the Center for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and Use (CALAC) in the Japan Health Sciences Foundation (JHSF) accreditation as an animal testing facility. Clinical trials, which are essential for verifying the safety and ef�icacy of investigational compounds, must be performed with respect for the rights of trial subjects. Clinical trials are closely monitored for patients’ safety and are stringently conducted under high ethical standards. We are committed to evaluating the real merit of investigational compounds by steadily applying essential and complete testing procedures that comply with the Act on Securing Quality, Ef�icacy and Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices of Japan (Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act) and other related legislation, as well as the global standards based on the spirit of the Declaration of Helsinki. For more information, see the web pages below: Considerations to ensure human rights during research http://www.ono.co.jp/eng/rd/human_rights.html Ethical considerations in animal experiments http://www.ono.co.jp/eng/rd/animal_ethics.html Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 52 〉 ●Fair and Transparent Business Activities We conduct fair and transparent business activities, and provide training programs to repeatedly familiarize employees with their duties to prevent fraud and corruption. We aim to contribute to healthcare all around the world and people’s health through continuous R&D activities and the stable supply of new drugs. To this end, we need to engage in collaborative activities-for example, providing support for patient organizations-and cooperate with research and medical institutions to help patients overcome disease and pain. To enhance the fairness and transparency of such collaborations and cooperation, it is important to ensure transparent relationships with our partners. We therefore disclose information on the costs of our assistance to medical institutions and patient organizations in accordance with our transparency guidelines, which are formulated in line with the relevant guidelines of the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA). While compliance with laws related to fraud and corruption is attracting increasing attention on a global scale, we always act in consideration of the social situation in Japan and overseas. To this end, we established ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Bribery Prevention Global Policy and the Regulations on Bribery Prevention in 2017 to clarify our bribery prevention system in a written form, and work to operate them in a strict manner. To ensure that publicly funded research is conducted in compliance with the relevant guidelines established by the Japanese government, we have formulated the Action Guidelines for Publicly Funded Research and the Regulations on Publicly Funded Research, and apply them for even more appropriate use and management of public research funds. For the details of our system for preventing bribery and corruption, refer to the Ono Pharmaceutical Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy (hereinafter the Global Policy ) below. Ono Pharmaceutical Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy (147 KB) http://ono.m2-lab.com/eng/csr/pdf/anti-bribery-global-policy201704.pdf No facilitation payment de�ined the Global Policy was exercised in FY 2017. For more information, see the web pages below: Operation and management system of public research funds, and procurement policy http://www.ono.co.jp/eng/rd/management.html Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 53 〉 Responsible Promotion Activities ●Basic approach We have formulated the Pharmaceutical Promotion Code in the ONO Codes of Practice (hereinafter referred to as the “Code”) compliant with the JPMA Code of Practice as our action guidelines and are conducting responsible promotion activities through collaboration between the Sales and Marketing Division, the Compliance Promotion Department, and the Safety and Quality Assurance Division, in order to realize optimal and patient-centered healthcare. ●Engagement in fair promotion activities ONO PHARMACEUTICAL de�ines “promotion” as “providing and conveying pharmaceutical information to medical workers so as to disseminate the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals based on such information.” Employees involved promotions proactively carry out promotion activities, while always examining whether they are acting in accordance with the spirit of the Code regardless of whether there are speci�ic provisions or descriptions in the Code. Also, we comply with the Code and adhere to the Promotion Code for Prescription Drugs de�ined by JPMA (Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association), as well as respecting the IFPMA (International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations) Code of Practice, which is a code established by an association in which the JPMA participates. ●Training to thoroughly inform fair promotion activities We provide the following training courses for employees to enhance their awareness of compliance. Every year we schedule a three-month period of intensive training during which we organize lectures given by the leaders of various departments, as well as training courses using an e-learning system, to improve employees’ familiarity with and understanding of compliance in general. In the event of a certain type of noncompliance, we also provide ad hoc training sessions to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of such noncompliance on a company-wide scale. In particular, with regard to harassment, not only do we provide training courses for management staff, but we also include harassment and other issues in the sessions conducted by external lecturers, thereby enhancing awareness of compliance. As for fair promotion activities, compliance promotion staff members visit sales branches in various places twice a year to provide MRs with compliance training sessions, aiming to disseminate and teach the Code. Also, in the Compliance Promotion Department and the Sales and Marketing Division, joint meetings at the section chief level are held through collaboration with trade practice committees established under the Fair Trade Council of the Ethical Pharmaceutical Drugs Marketing Industry to share information and provide training. Furthermore, at meetings attended by leaders in the Sales and Marketing Division, systems to improve familiarity with the aforementioned standards within the Division are developed. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 54 〉 Proper Procurement Activities We have established a basic policy for procurement activities in terms of fairness, economic rationality, and environmental protection, and our procurement personnel are required to act in accordance with the policy. In addition, ONO clearly separates its purchase organization from other parts of the company and carries out regular internal audits of the purchase organization to con�irm its transparency. ●Basic policy for procurement activities ONO has established its policy for procurement activities based on the six CSR priority areas* according to the three basic ideas. ＊Corporate governance, innovative pharmaceutical products, human resources and human rights, the environment, fair operating practices, and society Basic Ideas on Purchase Transactions 1. Purchase transactions involve selecting and purchasing favorable goods and services on the basis of economic rationality. 2. Purchase transactions are open to suppliers both at home and abroad and are conducted in a fair and transparent manner through a simple and easy-to-understand procedure. 3. Purchase transactions play a key role in the activities of companies as part of their contribution to society as good citizens. Companies also give consideration to resource savings and environmental conservation in purchase transactions. Basic Policy for Procurement Activities (1) Compliance with relevant laws and regulations We will comply with relevant laws and regulations in Japan and other countries, and we will conduct fair transactions based on high ethical standards. (2) Respect for human rights We will respect fundamental human rights and perform our duties without unjust discrimination. (3) Economic rationality We will perform suf�icient evaluations of the quality of goods and services and the management stability of suppliers, and we will select suppliers based on proper standards. (4) Fair distribution of opportunities We will provide opportunities for all suppliers to compete in a fair and transparent manner. (5) Consideration of the environment We will be conscious of the protection of resources and the conservation of the environment in our procurement activities. (6) CSR procurement We will promote CSR activities in all of our procurement activities as part of our efforts to promote CSR activities throughout the ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Group. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 55 〉 Society We strive to support patients and their families by sending information on diseases, treatment, and other issues. Also, we are actively committed to various activities that contribute to local communities at our business bases around the world. Various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Activities ●Web-Based Information Dissemination Our corporate website contains a section for patients and their families that provides information for the proper use of our key products. This section also explains common diseases including diabetes, allergic rhinitis, and Alzheimer's dementia as well as symptoms of osteoporosis and overactive bladder, the patients of which are increasing as the population ages, and therapeutic methods and things that the patients and their families should do in their daily lives in an easy-to-understand manner with diagrams and illustrations, all of which are easy for patients and their families to use. We also have other web sources to disseminate useful information widely. We run a website specializing in dementia titled “Treating Dementia with Positivity which provides comments and messages from a wide range of healthcare professionals involved in the treatment and care of people with dementia. We operate ONO Oncology (information for public and patients),” a website we created with the cooperation of supervising doctors so that people can learn dif�icult cancer immunity concept in an easy-to-understand matter and offer a free smartphone application that provides support to patients suffering from diabetes and other lifestyle diseases. As for the operation of the website Treating Dementia with Positivity in FY2017, we newly interviewed the representatives at 37 medical institutions and published an article that introduced their initiatives on the website. We have posted contents concerning such as rare cancer with high unmet medical needs (malignant melanoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma) as well as lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, and stomach cancer. ●Initiatives for Medical Advancement We are making efforts to meet unmet medical needs and contribute to medical advancement. In 1988, the ONO Medical Research Foundation was established with donations from ONO. The Foundation provides grants for research activities in the �ield of lipid metabolism disorders and also aims to promote research and treatment in that �ield through various projects and thereby contribute to the health and welfare of the public. The Foundation has provided research grants and scholarships every year since its establishment and gave an Osamu Hayaishi Memorial Award to one researcher, research grants to 12 researchers, and scholarships (for researches under 40 years old) to 16 researchers respectively in FY2017. In FY2017, we newly funded or continued to fund approximately 40 courses across Japan mainly on cancer, diabetes, neurological diseases, bone and motor organ diseases and other disease areas the patients of which are likely to increase rapidly as the population ages. In addition, we have supported the Japanese Biochemical Society's Osamu Hayaishi Memorial Scholarship for Study Abroad, which assists researchers who are willing to research biochemistry-related life sciences in general in studying abroad, for 10 years from FY2017, and we made a decision to support eight researchers in March 2017 and another decision to support other eight researchers in March 2018. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 56 〉 ●Activities to Support the Health of People We conduct various health-related activities to provide a wide range of support for people such as patients and the families of patients. We also cooperate in holding seminars for citizens to raise awareness and provide correct information about diseases. In addition, we have been participated in Relay for Life as a part of CSR activities since FY2014. Relay for Life is a charity activity project conducted by the Japan Cancer Society and the National Action Council of Relay of Life aiming to deal with and overcome cancer. We have been actively participating in the Relay of Life events mainly at the locations where our research institutes, plants, and sales of�ices reside. In the �ield of dementia, all our MRs who have completed the Dementia Supporters Training Program learn and put into action what they can do on a daily basis to help people with dementia and their families live with a sense of security. We produce and release on our corporate website a series of short movies titled Grandma’s World which are aimed at raising dementia awareness. In addition, we continue the Communicate & Link exhibition on the website which shows images of paintings calligraphy and other art works created by people with dementia at medical institutions. This exhibition is aimed at spreading joy to people with dementia and their families and helping medical providers gain professional ful�illment. We received 411 works from various parts of Japan for the ninth exhibition held in FY2017 and sent comments handwritten by the selection committee members as well as a certi�icate of commendation to each applicant. In March 2018, we held the Operation Slimmer and Healthier program in Soma City, Fukushima Prefecture, as held previously in Aizu Misato Town, Fukushima Prefecture in March 2015, in Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture in March 2016, and in Ofunato City, Iwate Prefecture in April 2017 as a Great East Japan Earthquake reconstruction assistance activity. With the cooperation of top athletes and specialists in lifestyle disease, the program addressed childhood obesity, a social issue in the earthquake-affected areas. This project provides an opportunity for children and their parents to consider diet and lifestyle habit through sports. We will continue being involved in activities that help people keep healthy. ●Efforts made for children’s education We are proactively engaged in activities to support the development of children, who will be responsible for the future. The classes we have continued to provide at schools (targeting junior high school students and high school students) focusing on dementia are the effort we make to have children consider dementia as common matter and acquire correct knowledge through viewing of the dementia awareness short movie titled Grandma’s World we created and lectures by specialists. We started the event in May 2014, and more than 1,400 junior high school students and high school students have participated by the end of March 2018. In FY2017, we continued the activities we had done in FY2016, aiming to raise the children’s interest in learning science with the theme of medicine, our researchers visited Shimamoto Municipal No. 3 Elementary School (in the town where the Minase Research Institute resides) to give the sixth graders a lecture and co-sponsored an experiential learning event called Water Wonder Expedition Part 4 (sponsored by the municipalities in the vicinity of Fujiyama Plant and targeting elementary school students) aiming to have children think about the global environments, particularly the water environment. In FY2018, we started sponsoring the performance Kokoro no Gekijo (Theater of the Heart), which was performed in Kansai and sponsored by Shiki Theater Company / Butai Geijyutu (Performing Arts) Center as a new activity. Theater of Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 57 〉 the Heart is a project to invite children (mainly elementary sixth grade students) from various regions in Japan to theaters for free and demonstrate the excitement of theater aiming to bring the most important thingｓ for people to live, such as the importance of life, the heart to consider a person, the joy to believe each other to children's heart through the performance. We understand such philosophy and support activities. We also donated to the project Kodomo Hon no Mori Nakanoshima (Woods of Children’s Book in Nakanoshima) (tentative name) that aimed to stop children being away from reading. Kodomo Hon no Mori Nakanoshima (tentative name) is a project to build a library designed by an architect Tadao Ando in the Nakanoshima Park to encourage children to develop rich creativity through books and arts/culture. Maho wo Suteta Majorion (Majorion who Quite from Water Wonder Expedition Part 4 Being a Witch), a family musical performed by Shiki Theater Company Photo by Ken Arai Relationships with communities In our role as a corporate citizen, we have each of our business sites take part in various activities to contribute to local communities such as cleanups, disaster prevention activities, and conservation of the natural environment. ●Initiatives in the Production Division The Fujiyama Plant’s recent activities for improving the environment involved planting trees in a nature park near the base of Mt. Fuji in May 2017 and cleaning up the areas surrounding the plant in March 2018. These events aim to boost children’s awareness of water and the natural environment around Mt. Fuji and to get children thinking about how they can contribute to preserving the environment. Growing trees at the foot of Mt. Fuji The Osaka Marathon Cleanup campaign Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 58 〉 At the Joto Plant in November 2017, staff took part in the cleanup of the periphery of the plant site and the area around a neighboring elementary school as well as parks and other places as part of the Osaka Marathon Cleanup campaign organized by the Osaka Municipal Government. In January 2018, the private �ire brigade of the plant joined the New Year’s parade of private �ire brigades in Higashinari Ward Osaka. It took on the role of rescuing people from collapsed houses and delivering them to the emergency team. A fair to sell bread and cookies made at work centers that support the independence of persons with disabilities is held on the second Wednesday of every month. Staff in the production division will continue to actively participate in such useful community-based social contribution activities. ●Initiatives in the Discovery and Research Division The Minase Research Institute joined the Rikyu no Mizu Conservation Society to protect the famous water source found on the premises of Minase Jingu Shrine which has been selected as one of the 100 best springs in Japan. Staff members took part in the joint cleanup activities which are organized twice a year. In addition, the private �ire brigade members at the institute participated in �ire�ighting training in a �ire-prevention festival in Shimamoto-cho which is held to raise awareness of �ire prevention among local residents every November as well as in the New Year parade of the �ire�ighting brigade of Shimamoto-cho, which is organized on the second Sunday of January every year. At the Fukui Research Institute staff took part in cleanup activities including picking up of litter around the boundary of the site on a regular basis. The private �ire brigade members at the institute joined a volunteer �ire brigade competition which is held every year to raise awareness of �ire prevention and improve �ire�ighting skills and conducted �ire�ighting training. And, the gymnasium and tennis courts on the premises are opened to the public as places for communication. At the Tsukuba Research Institute employees regularly pick up litter in its neighborhood in an effort to maintain the beauty of the area. ●Initiatives in Other Divisions On the fourth Wednesday of every month, the Head Of�ice holds events at which bread and cookies made by the disabled members of a social welfare organization are sold. ●Eco-Cap Activities The Minase Research Institute (from June 2014) and the Head Of�ice (from July 2014) have been taking part in an “Eco-cap” campaign. The caps of plastic bottles are disposed of in special garbage containers near vending machines and are recycled. The proceeds from this recycling are used, for example, to buy vaccines for children in developing countries and help communities recover from earthquakes. Corporate Social Responsibility 〈 59 〉 ●Blood Donation Employees at the Head Of�ice, plants, and research institutes actively donate their blood to the Japanese Red Cross Society. ●Contribution to the Local Community in Shimamoto-cho In an effort to promote sustainable development in harmony with local communities ONO donated dental goods to children in Shimamoto-cho Mishima-gun June 4 to 10 <Osaka Prefecture—the home of the Minase Research Institute. During Dental Health Week> 2,800 tooth-brushing kits and 400 toothbrushes produced by Bee Brand Medico Dental Co. Ltd. which is one of our af�iliates were provided for four elementary schools and �ive kindergartens/nursery schools in the town with the hope to help realize a world without dental cavities. This initiative is implemented as an annual program with an aim to realize coexistence of the local community with the company and achieve sustainable development.
