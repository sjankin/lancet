Since then, we have identified 12 Goals, 42 Targets and 47 indicators to achieve in our business. FY 2016/17 Sustainability Report reports on 9 Goals, 24 targets and 24 indicators. This is just the beginning. As the years pass by, the reporting will become more comprehensive and holistic. In FY 2016/17, Biji-biji Initiative became the first Malaysian organisation to receive a Provisional Membership from the World Fair Trade Organisation (WFTO). Biji-biji Initiative also became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact in 2017. As a social enterprise, Biji-biji Initiative is committed to running an ethical business while upholding its social, environmental and economic commitments. This includes upholding the UN Sustainable Development Goals, UN Global Compact Principles and WFTO Principles. When we established Biji-biji Initiative in 2013, we aimed to be amongst the most forward thinking and innovative organisations, pushing boundaries and setting new standards of operations for 21st Century businesses. We never allowed the age-old excuses of ‘small size’ or ‘limited budget’ to hamper our dreams. We implemented our Governance Framework in our 1st year of operation. Since then, it has evolved into one of our most comprehensive impact measurement documents (set against the SDG goals, targets and indicators). The Annual Sustainability Report you read today is the result of many hours of work by our Sustainability team, and all team members who contributed their time and efforts to make this happen. We recognise the road ahead is long and challenging; there is much we need to improve to be a truly sustainable and ethical company. We will continue to report our findings transparently, whether good or bad, and take serious efforts to improve them.
