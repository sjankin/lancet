A supply chain new gas or liquid fuel burned 19.8 MW boiler, which will allow a flexible response to sudden changes in consumer heat demand, possible disturbances of other production sources, and which will increase the mandatory power reserve available in the company, was launched in Petrašiūnai Power Plant. In addition, AB Kauno Energija installed in 2017 another gas burned boiler in the Company’s Pergalė boiler-house. A 14.9 MW gas or diesel burned boiler with a 1.5 MW condensing economiser is built here, instead of worn and already demolished DKVR-type boilers. These new facilities are in line with the new, more stringent requirements of the European Parliament and Council Directive (EU) 2015/2193 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants from medium-sized combustion plants that will come into force from 2020. Using these boilers, nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) will not exceed 80 mg / m3.

We have already disclosed information on significant changes that have had an impact on both the environment and the social and economic environment of the Company in the earlier chapters of this report, but it is also important to mention that we have achieved one of our strategic goals – we have further reduced the average price of heat to consumers. The average price of heat for consumers decreased by 3.78 % from 5,02 to 4.83 ct/kWh without VAT during the year. We constantly seek to improve our range of environmental management initiatives in all our day-to-day activities, from the attention paid to strict control of emissions from our heat sources, to the emission data collected from our use of fluorescent lamps, tyres, wastewater and other waste amounts. The Company commitment to social responsible reporting has stepped up a gear to now include the GRI Standards methodology, further strengthening our commitment to be a socially and environmentally supportive company. Our company strategy remains one that is fully focused on strengthening our role as a leader in transparent and inclusive social, economic and environmental reporting. 102-15 Key impacts, risks, and The information is disclosed in section 6.2 of the consolidated annual opportunities report of the Company.

CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GRI STANDARDS 2017 GRI CONTENT INDEX / 015 GRI 103 MANAGEMENT APPROACH GRI 204 – PROCUREMENT PRACTICES 103-1 Explanation of the The company main procurement of services comes through the GRI material topic and its monthly procurement of provision of heating services from inde204 Boundary pendent heat producers. These services represent 61% of consumers heat demand. This is a substantial amount of procurement, making this topic an obvious choice. The boundary is with all the business and residential customers who receive heating using these sources, and it is here where any potential impacts will be felt. The company seeks to minimise these and any other boundary impacts through close management and quality control of these relationships on a regular basis. If serious impacts are likely to occur, we can correct through improved procurement procedure month by month 103-2 The management Company’s Procurement policy is determined in the Rules of ProcureGRI approach and its ment, which is announced publicly on Company’s website: 204 components http://www.kaunoenergija.lt/bendroves-veikla/viesieji-pirkimai/ viesuju-pirkimu-taisykles/ Company goals and targets for procurement practices are defined in law as we are obliged to provide the lowest price. All heat providers have technical measurements made of their service delivery to make sure it satisfies the conditions of the procurement contract. The Company’s procurement procedures are organized by the Procurement Commission constituted by the order of General Manager or Procurement Organizer, subject to procurement amount. All procurement announcements and winning contracts are published on the Central Procurement Portal: https://cvpp.eviesiejipirkimai.lt/. As much of our procurements consist of purchase of heat from independent heat producers, Heat Procurement Commission operates in Company. It consists from company’s employees from various departments. Much of procurement procedures are governed by national regulations based on legislation. This governs all heat providers in Lithuania. https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.A37C2263838C/qCQgCxIhFq CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GRI STANDARDS 2017 016 / GRI CONTENT INDEX Responsibilities are within the company’s Heat Procurement Commission and associated company departments.

GRI management approach However, the management approach is systematically linked to the 204 procurement process and although evaluation is not carried out, adjustments can be made to the management approach through employee or client feedback. GRI 205 – ANTICORRUPTION 103-1 Explanation of the AB Kauno Energija and its subsidiaries are guided by the anticorrupGRI material topic and its tion policy aimed at identifying the main principles and requirements 205 Boundary for the prevention of corruption in AB Kauno Energija and its subsidiaries, and the guidelines for ensuring compliance with them, implementation of which creates preconditions and conditions for implementing the Company’s scale the highest standards of transparent business conduct. The Company’s anticorruption policy is not in conflict with the laws of the Republic of Lithuania. The company constantly strives to minimize the risk of corruption through a range of management and quality control measures related to managing this relationship. Upon revealing of the case of corruption, all internal documents of the Company and measures provided by the legal acts of the Republic of Lithuania are taken. 103-2 The management To prevent corruption, a system has been created in which anonyGRI approach and its mous or personally possible cases of abusive or corrupt practices can 205 components be reported to the Company. The Company invites to use it if Company’s employees are observed in improper performance of their duties or abusing them, reaching personal gain in working relationships, exceeding powers granted, assimilating or disposing Company’s assets, disclosing official or commercial secrets, carrying out acts of bribery or bribe-taking. The information can be submitted by e-mail: pasitikejimo.linija@kaunoenergija.lt or by filling out the notification form, which is published on the website of the Company here: http://www.kaunoenergija.lt/ korupcijos-prevencijos-kontaktu-forma/ CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GRI STANDARDS 2017 GRI CONTENT INDEX / 017 AB Kauno energija guarantees complete confidentiality and assures the anonymity of the data. When reporting on a possible violation or act, the notifiers are asked to indicate as precisely as possible their location, time, information on the offender (name, surname) and a brief description of the nature of the violation.

Compliance with Corruption Prevention Requirements and Standards is an integral part of the Company’s business ethics, and AB Kauno Energija and its subsidiaries’ corruption prevention policy is applicable to representatives of AB Kauno Energija, and its contractors, subcontractors, suppliers and intermediaries. 103-3 Evaluation of the GRI Evaluation of the management approach is not formally carried out. 205 management approach With reference to clause 1.1 of GRI 103 Management Approach, the disclosures are combined for GRI 300 ‘Environmental’ material topics. GRI 302 – ENERGY GRI 303 – WATER GRI 305 – EMISSIONS GRI 306 – EFFLUENTS AND WASTE GRI 307 – ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE GRI 308 – SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 103-1 Explanation of the Six material topics have been chosen here as the most relevant for reGRI material topic and its porting purposes: Energy, Water, Emissions, Effluents and waste, En300 Boundary vironmental Compliance and Supplier Environmental Assessment. Due to the particularity of activities the Company uses a lot of electricity and water, has high emissions into the air; also generates a specific amount of effluents and waste. The saving of energy and its resources is very important for Company’s economic performance. Environmental compliance is crucial if the company wants to maintain its commitment to the environment, to stay compliant, and to continue its high level of transparency in reporting such actions. Supplier environmental assessment needs to improve, which is why it is included here. The company wants to break with old practices and establish itself as positively encouraging suppliers to adopt a more environmental approach to business. Emissions and environmental compliance have an impact wider than local sites. Therefore, the boundary for impacts for these material topics are within all company sites as well as throughout the whole country. 103-2 The management The company does a good job of managing the topic within the comGRI approach and its pany but could improve its management approach outside the com300 components pany in relationships with clients / service providers. Internally the management systems in place to record and report on environmental impact are very strong.
