have created a distribution map of amphibians and Kinran through yearly censuses. The results from these surveys have proven favorable, with an increase in population statistics across the board. With this success in mind, we will continue to maintain and improve on our conservation efforts to ensure that the whole test site is managed appropriately. Komatsu engages external lecturers on a regular basis to train our employees in order to create a culture of environmental conservation amongst our workforce. These training efforts afford personnel at all levels with an understanding and awareness of the importance of biodiversity conservation activities, which has thus far led to excellent results in the maintenance of the environment in our test site. In FY2017, employees will learn the tree cutting method known as Yamazakura , which will prove extremely beneficial to woodland conservatory efforts. Following this trend of woodland conservation, we also hope to have our employees engage in tree-planting activities for the local community in the future. Our conservation activities are not limited to within the test site, but encompass much of the surrounding areas as well. We clean the neighboring Onogawa river four times a year, and have established a dedicated corner at a business establishment fair that teaches local residents about the importance of biodiversity. In order to create a sustainable environment for the future, it is imperative that we not only engage in internal initiatives, but in external ones as well. Through the continued enactment of these co-operative measures, we believe that we can create a system of advancement that protects the natural environment while disseminating important environmentally friendly values throughout society.

Komatsu is thus acutely aware of the importance for Social Contribution Activities that help nurture and develop the local communities in our areas of operation. We emphasize themes in our social contributions which utilize the business acumen and know-how that we have cultivated in our business operations. This in turn allows us to make use of our existing expertise to greatly increase the beneficial impact and reach of our contributory activities. Basic Approaches to Social Contribution (from Komatsu's Worldwide Code of Business Conduct ) CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) is a multi-faceted topic, of which specific elements pertaining to the different aspects of its implementation are subject to change according to country, region, or business practices. However, regardless of these variations, the underlying axioms that drive these initiatives remain the same: companies must co-exist in harmony with society, responding to expectations and building a relationship of mutual trust. As mentioned in other sections of this report, one of the principles that guides the Komatsu Group on a global scale is the understanding that Komatsu should fulfill its corporate social responsibilities through integration of CSR into our business operations. We further build on that belief by defining clear requirements for good corporate citizenship: a company should live up to societal expectations by promoting harmony and making real contributions for the benefit of the community in which it operates. Komatsu is proud to report that we live up to these high standards, and are proactively engaged in social contributory activities across multiple regions. 5 Basic Principles for Social Contribution (from Komatsu's Worldwide Code of Business Conduct ) Aims: To clarify the responsibilities of Komatsu Group and its employees as members of the local community and guide their activities for social contribution accordingly. Principles: Activities for social contribution should: ■ have continuity; ・ contribute to the advancement of ・ be voluntary (not forced); public welfare; ・ be reasonable to employees; and ・ not be designed to advertise our products or services. 154 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Accomplishments and Approaches for Social Contribution Activities Social Contribution Expenditures of the Komatsu Group We have divided and summarized the results of our social contributions into 6 general categories.

As Komatsu develops business on a global scale, we listen to the opinions of the people who live in each area and conduct support activities to improve the living standards of the people in the local community. We believe that conducting such social contribution activities is the responsibility of those doing business in that area. USA Support for housing improvement (Komatsu Mining Corp.) Employees of Komatsu Mining Corp. (KMC) participated in volunteering activities for the Non-Profit Organization(NPO), Habitat for Humanity. Habitat for Humanity is an NPO that aims to support a range of home building and community projects, focusing on practical support that makes a real, tangible difference to the lives of of those most in need. We support Habitat for Humanity's efforts in improving and securing housing by setting up sanitation facilities, spreading construction technology, building a community that is strong against disasters, supporting the development of the entire community, and Support for Habitat for Humanity activities providing building support for houses. A total of 110 KMC employees have participated in tangible activities thus far. In September 2017, 11 employees of Komatsu America Corp. (KAC) came together to jointly support housing improvement near Milwaukee, where KMC headquarters are located. South Africa Human Resources Development Program (Komatsu South Africa) In July 2014, Komatsu established the Komatsu Development Trust (KDT), which provides human resource development programs that aim to improve the status of black and 四 colored people who have historically been disadvantaged in the Republic of South Africa. KDT currently offers scholarships to college students majoring in mining technology, provides support for educational improvement in mining areas, and collaborates with Cummins to provide community human resources development programs (* see Collaboration with Cummins Inc. for more details). We have also established the Komatsu/ Denron Community Center Komatsu Transformation Trust (KT T), that carries out cooperative programs with Graduation Ceremony customers. It is part of the program that worked together with Denron (quarry business) to establish the Komatsu/ Denron Community Center. This center combats the talent shortage of skilled workers and operators by providing basic education opportunities. In an effort to improve the status of people who have been placed at a disadvantageous position by unfair discrimination, Komatsu will continue to support activities focusing on human resource development. 156 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Komatsu's Initiatives for the Social Issues 157 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Developing People Needed by the Community Developing People Needed by the Community When we asked ourselves: What sort of social contribution activities would meet the needs of regional communities and make the best use of Komatsu's strengths? We arrived at the answer: developing people. We are working in cooperation with several entities (such as national and local governments as well as schools), to carry out human resource development programs that are tailored to each region's needs and enable participants to acquire skills that will open up various employment opportunities. Various Areas and Forms of Support Developing Human Resources Tailored to Regional Needs Worldwide Using the know-how cultivated through our core business, Komatsu supports the development of skills in people that are needed not only internally by our company, but by local communities as well. Expectations for human resources can vary greatly from community to community. At Komatsu, as we do business on a global scale, we try to understand what each community needs and work on providing that support accordingly in various areas and in different forms. The pyramid graph below shows the different areas in which Komatsu is supporting human resource development. It also shows that the closer you get to the top of the pyramid, the more closely linked the program is with Komatsu businesses. The base of the pyramid shows our active support of activities such as science classes in elementary schools, mainly in different parts of Japan, USA and Europe. The next level up is to provide basic education, which is support given to people who cannot or were not able to receive the level of education necessary to find employment, due to circumstances specific to their country or region. We currently run such programs in Chile and South Africa. At the next level, we support universities and vocational training schools in many regions by providing Komatsu's curriculum and equipment, as well as instructors. At the top of the pyramid, we are working with national and local governments and with our customers to develop human resources, particularly in regions where human resource development is a social challenge. The actual content of the support given includes Komatsu providing instructors and trainers; providing teaching materials, equipment and facilities; accepting apprentices; and various other means through which our daily cultivated know-how can be best put to use. Support for Developing Human Resources We provide needed support for regions where human resource development is a social challenge, in cooperation with customers and national and local governments We support industrial vitalization and employment promotion by providing instructors, programs and equipment to vocational training schools.

We believe that collaborative CSR activities are more effective than activities conducted alone, due to the sharing of valuable requisite resources and know-how. In promoting social contribution activities in the past, Komatsu has collaborated with entities like NPO organizations that have their own unique know-how of CSR. And in 2016, we have entered into a contract with our business partner, Cummins Inc. of U.S., to collaborate on the development of local human resources. Komatsu and Cummins'Common Objective Komatsu and Cummins Inc., a major engine manufacturer in USA, have built a strong relationship of trust over the years as partners in the engine business. Our two companies have already expended much energy into supporting human resources development in local communities as part of our social contribution activities, and have already collaborated in several areas. Based on this contract, we will globally expand our development of human resources through the comprehensive utilization of each other's resources and best practices.

Vocational training school supported by Cummins and Komatsu Students attending the school The shortage of skilled technicians has become a serious problem all over the world, especially in the manufacturing industry. Due to the massive lack of both hands-on and soft skills, we are currently experiencing a severe labor shortage. TEC provides various tools to vocational training schools for young aspirants to fully acquire the skills necessary for employment and to participate actively in society, building a better country for the future. Collaboration program of both companies {2) Case of Peru Komatsu has also developed a TEC program in Peru, South America in collaboration with Cummins. We started a program to support the SENATI (Servicio Nacional de Adiestramiento en Trabajo Industrial) Arequipa (a local vocational training school) from FY 2016, and are working to provide the training of mining and construction machine skills in the 3 year course. While Peru has social issues such as economic disparity and inequality in education, we believe that investments in the mining industry are expected to cause it to expand further. As a result of this, the training of mining and construction machine skills is an urgent issue. ui 界 SENATI Arequipa Students talking about future resolutions More than half of the mine sites in Peru are located in the southern region, of which Arequipa city is the center. Since many mining companies are developing businesses in the suburbs, graduates who have studied at the school will not need to leave their local communities, even if they are employed in neighboring mining companies in the future. We will continue to make use of our business acumen and equipment to develop support activities that create a good number of job opportunities in the area. Through these programs, Komatsu will continue to promote TEC as much as possible, thus enabling young aspirants who have acquired the sufficient knowledge and skills to select their own career paths in the future. 160 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Disaster Relief 161 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Special Story: Fostering Community Growth in Cambodia Special Story: Part of our impact In western Cambodia, a land peppered with as many gleaming temples as tin roofs, there's a destructive threat buried just beneath the surface of everyday life: active landmines left from the Cambodian Civil War. In certain areas generally known to locals but not securedone wrong step can mean devastation. The anti­ personnel mines still lurking in Cambodia's rural countryside were designed to maim or kill a person. Less common but more powerful are the anti-tank mines, strong enough to destroy heavy machinery. These areas of danger are overgrown with bushes and trees, as residents have learned where they cannot farm or live safely. But in a country where 90 percent of impoverished residents live in the countryside, most have no choice but to continue to farm the land in and around these areas of threat. 162 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Special Story: Fostering Community Growth in Cambodia Since 2008, we have been supporting a unique community development project undertaken by the Japan Mine Action Service (JMAS) in cooperation with the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC), to remove these landmines and redevelop villages where families can live, work and play without fear. By donating special equipment designed by Komatsu engineers to safely remove anti-personnel landmines, we have supported the clearing of about 1,400 mines spread across more than 1,700 hectares of land. Female mango farmer and her husband Before the landmines were cleared, said one female resident in Battambang Province, it was like a forest. All the people were scared to come into the forest. Now the land is safe for people to live, she said. The woman lives with her husband on a plot of land in one of the redeveloped areas. They farm the land where they built their own home, growing mangos and other food. As a valued community partner, we work with CMAC and JMAS to respond to local governments'requests to clear areas of known landmine activity. Using a Komatsu bulldozer to cut brush and a specially designed demining machine, these teams clear areas for residents to live and work. We developed these machines special for this [purpose], said Atsushi Nagira, General Manager, Demining and Reconstruction Project, Construction Equipment Marketing Div. , Komatsu Ltd. Not for sale, but for society. We first started designing the demining machine in 2002 when redevelopment initiatives gained momentum in Afghanistan and Cambodia. Eager to help unite as global citizens and provide a service to areas in need, we tested the first machine in Afghanistan with support from the Japanese government and later handed it over to a local NGO (non-governmental organization) for use there utilizing Japan's ODA (Official Development Assistance) funds. The machines are modified versions of Komatsu bulldozers, featuring specially designed roller pulverizers in front of the equipment and bulletproof, soundproof operator cabins that keep safe those working to clear the fields. The deminers are painted white, one of the official colors of the United Nations. In 2008, we joined JMAS in their efforts to build upon CMAC's ongoing manual efforts to remove landmines in Cambodia. The Project for Developing a Safe Village in Battambang District includes landmine removal and community reconstruction in areas suffering from the impacts of anti-personnel landmines. Komatsu provided free of charge a demining machinefor removing landmines, and related equipment including a hydraulic excavator and bulldozerfor earth excavation and ground leveling work. Today, there arefour Komatsu demining machines in Cambodia. Residents who are part of CMAC operate the equipment. When asked what it's like to drive the deminer and detonate deadly landmines, one operator said this is heavy duty equipment, so it's no problem. We feel very safe. According to Nagira, Not only the people, but also our equipment is very tough. Road construction using Komatsu equipment Since 2006, the area has seen an 82 percent decrease in landmine accidents. During a March visit to the Battambang Province villages where we are providing aid and partnering with local communities, peace and happiness radiated on residents' faces in areas where the land has been cleared. We are so happy and so grateful that the mines are cleared, said the female farmer. 163 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Special Story: Fostering Community Growth in Cambodia Komatsu has also done much more to empower the villagers than just remove active landmines. Together with these government organizations, community partners and local residents, we are building communities: clearing the land of overgrowth, building or rebuilding roads, and constructing primary schools. There is a great need here, Nagira Many schools are needed and the work must continue after the schools, too. Employing people and giving them places to live. We have now helped redevelop 10 villages in areas Students at Chror Narb Phes Komatsu Primary School previously riddled with active landmines. Komatsu equipment was used to build local roads for more than 60 kilometers, connecting villages that previously were difficult if not impossible to access during monsoon season. We provided a bridge for one village particularly cut off during monsoon season, and helped build 46 ponds for the villages, which previously had no water supply. And eight new primary schools now serve nearly 600 local students. Most students want to go to school and now they can, said a teacher at Chror Narb Phes Komatsu Primary School, built in 2011. Komatsu's vision and leadership have helped make this project a reality. Young children in these villages now aspire to become doctors, nurses and teachers because they have a place to learn and thrive. Older local schools have dirt floors and tin roofs that make the monsoon rains incredibly loud. Some of these schools have to close during the rainiest days as students and teachers cannot hear one another and the ground floods. At Chror Narb Phes Komatsu Primary School, happy schoolchildren now sit at desks under a sturdy roof with solid floors beneath their feet. Reciting their lessons in unison, they learn math and writing, dreaming of growing up to be like the teachers they so admire. Many children's parents are farmers, which is hard Classroom under sturdy roof with solid floors work, said one of the school's teachers. The students come to school and learn about other jobs. It opens the world to them. Asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, the children added policemen and carpenters to the list. Through a cultural exchange with Japanese schoolchildren, the students also experience the kindness of peers thousands of miles away. Classrooms are decorated with Japanese pieces of art such as calligraphy and origami {paper folding), and a library bearing the Komatsu name is comprised of items donated from Japan for the school. Growing up in areas now free of the threat of landmines, these children will help shape Cambodia's future. Living with their families on redeveloped land distributed to residents free of charge through an application process, this new generation doesn't have to know the fear of trying to make a living on land that is unsafe. When we provide aid, we have to enable those we are aiding to be self-sustainable, said Nagira. The project is to foster people. We must do more than clear the land. We must work with the government…to make life sustainable. For the female mango farmer and her husband, the plot of land they received 10 years ago through the Battambang Province Demining and Reconstruction Project is truly special, because it's theirs. I'm so happy, she said. It's a small land but I have my own. I am happy to live here. 164 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Special Story: Fostering Community Growth in Cambodia Cambodia Demining Project Schedule We currently support three ongoing redevelopment projects in Cambodia: ・ Battambang Province Demining and Reconstruction Project: started in 2008 • Banteay Meanchey Providence Demining and Reconstruction Project: started in 2017 • Kampong Tom Providence Comprehensive Demining(Landmines & UXOs) Project: started in March 2018 165 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Clearing Anti-Personnel Landmines and Reconstruction Support Clearing Anti-Personnel Land mines and Reconstruction Support As of2008, Komatsu has engaged in collaborative efforts with the Japan Mine Action Service (JMAS) to support the demining ofanti­ personnel landmines.

As of today, we have carried out lessons for about 4,500 people over a total of 50 classes. We had the pleasure to attend a Visiting Lecture at a primary school for 6th graders. One of the students had this to say: I heard KOMATSU's Story today. I realized that there were many landmines yet to be left and Komatsu helped remove landmines to move them somewhere safe. I was surprised to see that the machines Komatsu provided did not break, even after rolling over landmines. Please keep up the good work until all landmines have been removed in the world. Through this initiatives, Komatsu will continue to nurture children, giving them opportunities to consider their future and ways of living. ゜ 私は地営除去つ 口沼クトの翌遵呈翌-� ごくよ凡たなと思l I ました．最初に．しばくだんのあ . こ工＿ � L ー・ �' , ・' I� んだら手足 かふ.. ffitぷヒ聞 いたから． -るヒころをふ .―― 「 -• ----一 ～ 一 映画の この世界の片隅1こき±.(J)中のば< r::::・ん ← 、 をふむ渇面かあ., t迅£ ヒ思いました．木訂厄てあった n)i ----い ぱくたんを持べみたら．ちょっと痘くて思，て た形ヒ ＇ f .... ヽ� /さ..._� 一 \― は全然ちがべいたからばくた んはこうゆう形な lb ’ ,,..' �, ぞ｀ ヽ 't::.·· と分かりました。外国でまだ．工にば<kんが ．� ー ヽ ー ク ・ 涯，ている国があべそれを日本の技術てばくだ 雫y -=:'....:· ·� \,; ” 囀� んを無くならせようヒがん[;t'. ているかうすこ いな .. 、 . ―と思いましt::., 2時朋以J:..歩いて召く学校を1)7,i­ ..,._ 9 ムし1::: リ．追距トを作つい）してえらいなと思い立した。 • 、さ ・・ A scene of a visiting lecture at an elementary school ョ本のヤモリは小さし＼けビ外国のヤて）は30cm< . ·--------―----····---ー •“ らいだし．外国1まわにをからあげに つ狡 したり．お瘍でゅ1:'たハナヤを食ペ たりするから．くらし方は OO それを,.し1-:: ヒ思いました． Letter from elementary school fifth grader after school delivery 168 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Clearing Anti-Personnel Landmines and Reconstruction Support Efforts to remove anti-personnel landmines (past activities) First model of the D85MS-15 demining machine being tested in Afghanistan Anti-personnel Land mines: A Semi-permanent Source of Terror With the advent of numerous conflicts in various areas around the world, an enormous quantity of anti-personnel landmines came to be laid. Despite the restoration of peace in these conflict zones, the still-armed mines continue to be a massive threat. Un-deactivated mines claim over 20,000 victims annually, many of whom are ordinary people going about their daily lives or children playing in fields. The Ottawa Treaty was forged in 1999 in order to resolve this ongoing issue, which provides comprehensive prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. With this treaty being signed by over 150 nations (including Japan), we can see validated proof that momentum for the abolition of anti-personnel landmines has spread throughout Japan and the world. It takes an inordinate amount of time and meticulous attention to detect and remove anti-personnel landmines manually. Cambodia is an excellent example of this fact; of the 6 million landmines laid during the civil war, only about 350,000 have been destroyed in the 15 years after the end of the war (1992 to 2006, according to the Cambodia Mine Action Centre). Going by this rate of progress, the complete removal of landmines would require more than 240 years, which would continue to put both citizens and manual removal workers at great risk. With this considered, Komatsu believes that using a machine for this manner of work would minimize the danger of potentially fatal accidents while dramatically increasing the speed and efficiency of mine removal. This would involve a demining machine that can crush or explode landmines buried near the surface by scratching at or pounding on the ground. Such a machine would often utilize a structure or functions that are similar to the chasses and attachments used by construction equipment. We are thus confident that the specialize technology and experience in manufacturing we have acquired through our business operations in manufacturing construction equipment will prove invaluable in the development of a demining machine for anti-personnel landmines that is both efficient and safe. (left) An anti-personnel landmine has been discovered. Although it was laid almost 20 years ago, many of them are still explosive (Cambodia). (right) Workers from local NGOs continue to be engaged in extremely dangerous clearance operations (Afghanistan). 169 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Clearing Anti-Personnel Landmines and Reconstruction Support Starting along the Path to Development Back in 1998, Komatsu began development of machines to perform requisite pre-demining tasks, such as the removal of shrubbery. In 2002, the Japanese government approved exports of demining machines for anti-personnel landmines, and in 2003 Komatsu applied for the public offering of subsidies of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), embarking on the full-scale development of demining machines. In December 2003, we completed the production of our prototype. The base of the machine is a bulldozer with a chassis weight of about 27 tons. In addition to excellent reliability and durability, such a machine has the ability to cover rocky terrain, damp ground, and sloping land quickly and thereby clear even large areas effectively. Replacement parts are easy to obtain, and by changing the vehicle's front attachment, the machine can also be used as a bulldozer for ground leveling operations. It can be used in road construction work and other operations in the future. Moreover, this machine features remote control technology for construction equipment that has been already proven to have practical applications in disaster recovery areas. Through remote operation, the operator's safety can be further enhanced. Since many countries have now completely abolished the use of anti-personnel landmines, demonstration testing of demining machines' capabilities must take place in actual minefields. Komatsu has engaged in thorough testing of the capabilities of our developed machines in Afghanistan since 2004. About 80% of Afghanistan's land is arid and mountainous, and during the long period of conflict approximately ten million anti­ personnel landmines are estimated to have been laid around the country. Furthermore, antitank landmines can be found in minefields in addition to anti-personnel landmines. Demining machines must be able to withstand these even larger explosions while protecting their occupants, and must be able to extricate themselves from minefields safely. Tests to confirm the functionality and reliability of the vehicle were conducted repeatedly with great caution, also making use of remote operation technologies. Field tests began in Cambodia in 2006. The objective was to verify the machine's capability to clear terrain, which, unlike Afghanistan, features mud flats and areas covered with bushes. The results of the testing showed great promise, with the Komatsu anti-personnel landmine demining machine succeeding in demonstrating clearance capabilities of 500 square meters per hour on average. This is from 25 to over 50 times the speed of manual clearance (although this varies according to conditions during the clearance operations). Operation of our demining machine for two or three days can produce one hectare of safe land. In Cambodia, converting that land into fields will enable two or three families to support themselves. (left) Komatsu's demining machine for anti-personnel landmines rotates rollers with spikes attached (rotary cutters) to crush and explode anti-personnel landmines in the ground. It operates over a large area of land, tearing up bushes and weeds and transforming the land to look as if it were a field (Cambodia, 2006). (right) Practicing wireless operations (Cambodia). The worker operates the machine from behind a protective shield. The First Machine in Service What is essential for safe and efficient antipersonnel landmine removal operations is not only the development of vehicles but also technical training of local operators of the equipment. In the spring of 2004, Komatsu invited people from landmine removal NGOs operating in Afghanistan to Japan for the first time and conducted technical training. Through a single one of our demining machines, we have enhanced interaction among people centered on demining operations. In addition, through getting to know the countries now working towards reconstruction and interacting with the local communities, a new commitment has been born within Komatsu that drives us to redouble our already significant efforts. The demining machine for anti-personnel landmines has had its capabilities and reliability thoroughly verified and has been deployed by a local NGO in Afghanistan through ODA funding from the」apanese government since September 2007. 170 KOMATSU CSR & Environmental Report 2018 Message from Concept of Theme 1 : Theme 2 : Theme 3 : Social GRI Contents Top CSR Enhancing Developing Growing Contribution Data STANDARDS Management activities Quality of Life People with Society Activities INDEX Clearing Anti-Personnel Landmines and Reconstruction Support (left) In May 2007, people involved in the clearing of landmines in Afghanistan were once again invited to Japan to participate in training. In Afghanistan, there are many people from NGOs who participate in the landmine removal program under the United Nations umbrella. (right) The first machine has been deployed by a local NGO in Afghanistan and it has been in use since September 2007. Further Efforts by Collaboration with JMAS January 2008, Komatsu and the Japan Mine Action Service (JMAS), a nonprofit organization of Japan, signed an agreement to jointly demine anti-personnel landmines in the contaminated regions and reconstruct local communities after demining. JMAS is a nonprofit organization staffed mainly by the retired individuals of Japan's Defense Agency. Owing to their previous vocation, these retirees are possessed of a wealth of technical expertise and experiences. Since 2002, JMAS has engaged in clearing landmines and unexploded ordnances {UXOs), as well as digging wells and providing educational programs. Its zealous efforts also include the provision of technical personnel in cooperation with the governments of Cambodia, Laos and Afghanistan. Komatsu believes Kunio Noji (left}, President and CEO of Komatsu, that the combination of our demining machine technologies and JMAS' experiences and and Mr. Mitsuo Nonaka, President of JMAS, at know-how should enable faster reconstruction of devasted local communities and thus the signing ceremony make very effective social contributions. Based on this agreement, the first reconstruction project for local communities was launched in Battambang, Cambodia in May 2008. Specific plans for this project call for our demining equipment to be rented at no cost to JMAS for speedy demining, and then, the safe development of agricultural land, digging of wells, building of schools, and repair and building of roadways and bridges. In addition to lending the demining machine and construction equipment required for use in building such infrastructure, at no cost, Komatsu has agreed to pay the operating expenses of¥50 million and transportation cost to Cambodia. Komatsu will also supply replacement parts at no cost. For our next project, Komatsu is considering a reconstruction project in Africa. Komatsu positions community reconstruction (which begins with demining) as one of its core activities in social contribution. In addition to continuing this activity, Komatsu hopes to expand its efforts to other areas by collaborating with other companies, NGOs, governments, international organizations and local people.
