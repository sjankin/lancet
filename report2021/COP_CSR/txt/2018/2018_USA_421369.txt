For this reason, making more things with less negative I invite you to read our annual Sustainability impact is imperative for us, our customers, Report and join us on this journey. and society to prosper into the future. Sincerely, This is the opportunity for business to lead. Harnessing the power of automation technologies increases our collective ability and capacity to make things better—better for our customers, and better for the planet and society. We are inspired by the boldness and breadth of the UN Sustainable Development Andrew Anagnost Goals and how the private sector is using them President and Chief Executive Officer It is a great honor to lead Autodesk at this as a blueprint for a better world. While our Autodesk pivotal moment in history. Every industry we work supports all 17 goals, we are especially serve from manufacturing to construction is committed to delivering technology to help being disrupted and transformed.

Although our biggest opportunity to improve our shared future is through the designers who use our software, we also work hard to improve the direct impact of our operations. This report provides a high-level view of our progress in sustainability over the past several years.

The Autodesk 2018 fiscal year ran from February 1, 2017, through January 31, 2018. Performance data covers the company’s global operations, unless otherwise stated. In some cases, segments in tables do not add up to the total due to rounding. Dashes indicate where data was unavailable. 3 Customers Our customers have a broad and global reach. They include a wide range of companies, design firms, academic institutions, nonprofits, and entrepreneurs in the architecture, United Nations Sustainable engineering, construction, product design, and manufacturing fields. We deliver solutions that Development Goals our customers use to make more and better things, with less negative impact on the world. The United Nations Sustainable Development Architecture, engineering, and construction: Operational energy use in buildings is responsible Goals provide an important framework to drive for 32 percent of energy consumption globally and 19 percent of energy-related greenhouse social, environmental, and economic progress gas (GHG) emissions.1 While it is not uncommon for operational energy use to account for as globally. Although Autodesk addresses all 17 much as 90 percent of a building’s environmental impacts,2 the construction process also offers goals to varying degrees, we focus particularly significant potential for improvement. Research indicates that more than 30 percent of on the following to maximize our positive construction activity is related to rework,3 and as much as 30 percent of construction impact through our products, operations, and material is wasted on-site,4 costing time, money, and natural resources. The urgency of philanthropic activities. reducing these impacts is compounded by global demographic trends. As the global population shifts and urbanizes over the next 30 years, the construction industry will need to build an average of 13,000 buildings every day in urban areas.5 Indeed, 60 percent of urban areas anticipated to exist in 2030 have yet to be built.6 As a result, industry demand will continue to rise for solutions that enable architects, engineers, and contractors to support this rapid growth more sustainably by improving energy and materials productivity. Our customers are increasingly working to make net-zero energy buildings, implement low waste and industrialized construction, and develop smart and sustainable cities. Providing automation tools to support these objectives affordably and at scale is central to our sustainability efforts. The Autodesk® Architecture, Engineering & Construction Collection and our cloud platform help enable customers to achieve these outcomes.

In early 2018, we also launched a new impact area on positive human machine collaboration and made our first investments. Complementing our focus on climate change, we are working to ensure that human beings not only survive but thrive through the disruptions and dislocations brought on by a warming planet and transformations in the way we work. We match charitable donations and provide paid volunteer time so that our employees can support the causes and organizations they care about most. In response to the many hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, and other natural disasters that occurred in 2017, our employees joined forces to raise tens of thousands of dollars for disaster relief and resilience-building efforts. Many also volunteered their time to provide direct aid in the days, weeks, and months following these destructive events.
