We work closely with clients to address the issues that jeopardise sustainable Being a economic growth, such as the infrastructure deﬁcit, climate change and ﬁnancial exclusion. responsible Investing in company communities Our relationships with governments and other development institutions help them access ﬁnancial markets, and we draw on our relationships with all stakeholders, including our colleagues, to create prosperous communities through our community engagement programmes around health and education. This is only possible if we remain committed to operating responsibly, encouraging good conduct and ethical behaviour across our organisation. This is why our approach to sustainability focuses on three pillars – contributing to sustainable economic growth, being a responsible company, and investing in communities. Within each pillar, we have identiﬁed a number of Sustainability Aspirations, which set out measurable actions to achieve sustainable business outcomes. Our Aspirations form part of our response to the issues that matter to us and our stakeholders. Understanding our sustainability themes We regularly engage with a range of stakeholders to understand the sustainability themes that matter to them, and that affect our business. During 2017, we undertook a desk-based materiality review, supported by external specialists, which identiﬁed topics of importance to both our business and our stakeholders. We share how we manage and measure progress against these through policies and statements on sc.com, the Group’s 2017 Annual Report and Accounts and this publication. The table below sets out where stakeholders can ﬁnd responses to the top ﬁve topics identiﬁed: SUSTAINABILITY THEMES RESPONSES Climate change ¼ Climate Change Position Statement (sc.com/positionstatements) ¼ Climate Change Aspiration (p7) ¼ Principal Uncertainty in Risk & Capital Review (p181 of the 2017 Annual Report & Accounts) Conduct, values ¼ Group Code of Conduct (sc.com/codeofconduct) and ethics ¼ Conduct Aspiration (p9) ¼ Stakeholders and responsibilities (p36-41 of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts) Environmental and ¼ Environmental & Social Risk Assessment (sc.com/esrisk) social risk management ¼ Standards and policies (sc.com/positionstatements) Human rights ¼ 2017 Modern Slavery Statement (sc.com/modernslavery) ¼ Human Rights Position Statement (sc.com/positionstatements) ¼ Stakeholders and responsibilities (p36-41 of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts) Talent attraction and ¼ People Aspiration (p9) engagement ¼ Stakeholders and responsibilities (p36-41 of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts) Standard Chartered 05 Sustainability Summary 2017 Contributing to sustainable OVERVIEW economic growth Being a responsible company Investing in communities Sustainability data OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILIT Y We created our Sustainability Aspirations in 2016 after engaging with stakeholders and colleagues to understand the main sustainability issues and opportunities we face as a business. Launching our The Aspirations set out measurable activities, and annual and multi-year targets, in the areas where we believe we can have the greatest impact. Aspirations We have taken steps to embed the Aspirations within Standard Chartered through a series of workshops with colleagues in Singapore, New York and Hong Kong, These were aimed at illustrating the connection between participants’ daily work for the Bank and our sustainability approach. Senior business leaders recognise the potential of the Aspirations to connect our core business with positive social and economic outcomes in our markets and guide our contribution to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. In 2017, we achieved the targets for annual Aspirations in conduct, people and ﬁnancial crime compliance, and achieved our multi-year Aspiration for microﬁnance three years ahead of schedule. Our aim for 2018 is to maintain this momentum and continue to help colleagues understand how they contribute to our ability to have a positive impact as an organisation. Standard Chartered 06 Sustainability Summary 2017 CONTRIBUTING TO SUSTAINABLE Overview ECONOMIC GROWTH Being a responsible company Investing in communities Sustainability data Contributing to sustainable economic growth Objective Contributing to sustainable We use our core business of banking to promote sustainable economic growth development in our markets. Here Overview for good We ﬁnance individuals, businesses and projects that contribute to sustainable economic growth in some of the world’s most dynamic and diverse markets. In 2017, we provided loans and advances of $262,859 million to customers across Corporate & Institutional, Commercial and Retail Banking. We work with clients to generate positive environmental and social impacts from our lending activities in sectors as varied as infrastructure and microﬁnance. This includes identifying and developing opportunities for blended ﬁnance solutions. In 2017, we funded and facilitated $1.2 billion towards clean technology and made $1 billion available to microﬁnance institutions for onward lending to entrepreneurs in 2016 and 2017, achieving our Aspiration three years early. Managing our impact includes minimising environmental and social risks, and in 2017, our Environmental and Social Risk Management team reviewed 487 transactions against our 20 Position Statements, which set out best-practice environmental and social management standards. We updated our Position Statement on Palm Oil and started a similar review of all Position Statements, with updates due to be published in 2018. Our performance against the six Aspirations under this pillar is set out on the opposite page. IMPACT AND SUSTAINABLE FINANCE Working together with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), we help drive prosperity for people traditionally excluded Developing from the ﬁnancial system. We have extended a unique Risk Participation deal – partnerships to deliver the ﬁrst of its type for the microﬁnance sector in Asia when it launched in 2013 – with the ADB to increase the ﬂow ﬁnancial inclusion of credit to microﬁnance institutions (MFIs) across Asia. By increasing the capital available, partner MFIs are able Value of loans to MFIs in to reach more unbanked individuals and ﬁnance additional Bangladesh, Indonesia and India micro enterprises. Originally, we aimed to originate and service a $150 million $325m portfolio of MFI loans across Asia by the end of 2018, with the ADB sharing 50 per cent of the risk on the portfolio. Due to the programme’s success, the ADB increased their risk participation ceiling from $75 million to $120 million, allowing us to increase the total programme size to $240 million outstanding at any given time. The programme has now been recognised as part of the ADB’s mainstream operations with no speciﬁed end date. Together with the ADB, we have provided approximately 125 loans totalling $325 million to 13 MFIs in Bangladesh, Indonesia and India, with the potential to expand to additional markets in Asia.

Here for good Overview Being a We recognise that sound governance practices are a central element of responsible banking. responsible We continued to encourage good conduct as a priority with 99.4 per cent of employees company recommitting to the Group Code of Conduct in September 2017. We further enhanced our approach to ﬁnancial crime prevention by strengthening our policies and extending training for employees on the front line of ﬁghting ﬁnancial crime. Our diversity is a unique strength that helps us to deliver a positive impact on society. We work hard to create a culture of inclusion where talent and individuality are valued and respected. In 2017, we introduced a standard ﬂexible working practice to ensure all colleagues can choose how they work and increased the beneﬁts we offer parents globally. Our new Fair Pay Charter, agreed in 2017, sets out the principles which guide all of our reward and performance decision-making. This includes continuing to reward colleagues in a way that is free from discrimination on the basis of diversity, including gender. We supported more than 50 country-based employee networks and three global networks (Women, Disability and LGBT & Allies), offering professional development, mentoring, networking and connections to employees. We have set new targets under the People Aspiration to improve employee wellness and implement a new diversity and inclusion strategy in 2018. We aim to minimise the environmental impact of our operations, and between 2008 and 2017, we reduced energy use by 34 per cent. In the same period, we reduced absolute water consumption by 36 per cent and water use by property area by 45 per cent. Our performance against the four Aspirations under this pillar is set out on the opposite page. FINANCIAL CRIME COMPLIANCE Working with NGOs to de-risk through education Our efforts to ﬁght ﬁnancial crime can have unintended consequences for clients that deliver critical humanitarian services to people in need. Financial crime controls can prevent payments to and from development and non-proﬁt organisations, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) providing humanitarian programmes in countries where bribery, corruption and moneylaundering are prevalent. We are helping these clients to mitigate ﬁnancial crime risk through education. In October, we hosted our ﬁrst Financial Crime Risk Management workshop in Washington for US-headquartered clients. The workshop builds on our successful Correspondent Banking Academies, and was delivered in partnership with the World Bank Group, World Vision and the US NGO membership group InterAction. The event shared international best practices in ﬁnancial crime compliance and showed organisations how they could strengthen their fraud, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist ﬁnancing controls. From 2018, we will also offer free ﬁnancial crime compliance e-learning modules to our NGO clients.

Building partnerships Despite going to school, she lacked the knowledge, skills and positive role models to create a more positive future for herself to empower girls and and her family. young women After shyly watching from the sidelines, Potlokwa joined our Goal girls’ empowerment programme, gaining valuable life skills that have enabled her to blossom into a conﬁdent young woman. She shared her experiences, and her dreams of becoming a doctor in her local community, at our ﬁrst Beyond Girls’ Education Summit in South Africa in 2017. The summit looked at ways to help girls and young women move from education to employment. More than 130 experts from the public, private and not-for-proﬁt sectors joined Goal girls like Potlokwa from Asia, Africa and the Middle East to create new partnerships to increase the employability of girls and young women. Delegates also experienced ﬁrst-hand how play-based activities can enable dialogue about rights, ﬁnancial education and conﬂict resolution by taking part in a Goal session. More than 45 new commitments came out of the event. One example is a partnership with global charity Lensational, which is training Goal girls and young women in Kenya, Uganda and the UK in professional photography to increase their employability and income generation opportunities.

During 2017, we introduced new methodology to measure paper consumption. This resulted in both an increase in reporting and overall paper consumption. Data from 2015 and 2016 is no longer considered representative and is, therefore, not shown 9. During 2017, more branches measured their waste generation and those reporting were found to have generated more waste per branch than our previous sample population. As a result, total waste generated across the portfolio increased. We are reviewing our scaling-up approach; scaled-up data from 2015 and 2016 is no longer representative, and is, therefore, not shown Further information Our online resources provide further information to support this document: Annual Report For a full review of our performance during 2017 visit sc.com/annualreport Approach to sustainability You can learn more about our approach to sustainability at sc.com/en/sustainability Position Statements You can ﬁnd out more about our environmental and social standards and how we apply these in our work with clients at sc.com/positionstatements Code of Conduct You can download our Code of Conduct at sc.com/codeofconduct Tax reporting You can ﬁnd complete country by country tax reporting at sc.com/cbcr Included in DJSI, FTSE4Good Contact us If you have any comments or questions about the information in this report, contact us at sustainability.feedback@sc.com Sustainability Aspirations 2018 Our Aspirations build on our three sustainability pillars with measurable targets to demonstrate how we are achieving sustainable outcomes across our business.
