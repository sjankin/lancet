The great interest of forest owners and their joining the group managed by Darnūs miškai, VšĮ showed that such an initiative was a long-standing ENVIneed. The implementation of the strict requirements of the FSC standards is often too complex or economically not feasible task for small forest owners. Apart from that, the RONMENTAL situation becomes even more complicated in view of the fact that some of them do not even have a basic knowledge about forestry, making the certification burden hardly bearable for them. In such cases, a group certification, PROTECTION where the certification processes are coordinated by a single administrator, is perhaps the only practicable option. The need for such a pilot certification project and its benRATIONAL USE OF WOOD efits could be felt already during the first half-year of our existence. Thanks to the joint efforts of VAKARŲ MEDIENOS PROCESSING WASTE GRUPĖ, UAB and other wood processing companies, we brought together the largest group of private forest owners in the history of Lithuania, which successfully passed The waste, i.e. tree bark, wood dust and sawdust, generated when manufacturing wood products in the production plants of the the audit in autumn of 2017 and received the FSC Forest VMG group companies is returned to production and / or other production-related processes, i.e., the production waste resulting Management Certificate.
