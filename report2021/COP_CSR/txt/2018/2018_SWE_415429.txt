This approach creates circular flows and minimizes society’s resource usage. There is considerable public support for mines and smelters and we work hard to act as role models in the field of sustainability. We welcome the stringent demands made on our operations, and see our impact on air, soil and water as an ongoing challenge. This is why we set our own priorities that define how we achieve the maximum environmental effect from investments. Official requirements sometimes yield only minor environmental improvement relative to the investment, resulting in a waste of resources that is contrary to our sustainability ethos. Boliden will, therefore, continue to As part of our efforts to develop this culture, we fowork to influence society to create predictable regucus on participation and involvement by all employees lations and efficient licensing processes that ensure a – an approach that is yielding results in the majority of sustainable and competitive industry in the countries in units.

SOURCE: WOOD MACKENZIE, DEC. 2016 14 | Boliden Annual Report 2016 Introduction Market Operations Corporate Governance Financial reports MARKET POSITION Competitiveness Metals are traded and priced on global exchanges. Competitive costs and sustainable processes are critical to long-term success in that the metals are largely produced and traded in their pure forms without distinguishing properties. Unlike pure metals, mined concentrates are not traded mines often have high grades, substantial revenues from on exchanges, but are priced by leading operators who by-product metals, advantageous infrastructure, and announce their terms in the form of annual contracts low costs. Smelters’ competitiveness is usually compared known as benchmark contracts. The competitiveness using the cash margin metric, which is a more comparaof mines – the cost per tonne of metal – is well-known ble metric, in that smelters extract multiple metals and to the market’s operators due to the information on by-products. Smelters’ competitiveness depends on cost cost levels, known as cash cost, regularly compiled by levels, stable processes, and the extraction of metals and independent analysis companies.

Boliden’s smelters have the capacity to handle considerably larger volumes than those produced by Boliden’s mines and substantial volumes of concentrate are bought in from external mines. Boliden’s integrated business model generates synergies in raw materials planning and the ability to evaluate external raw materials suppliers. The model also ensures more stable revenues for the Group as the income cycles of mines and smelters often differ. Mines An individual mine has natural variations in grades, Boliden’s Business Area Mines produces metal conwaste rock dilution, energy requirements at different centrate. Revenues are affected by ore tonnage, metal depths, equipment maintenance and other factors grades, recovery during the concentration process, that result in the profit varying over time. These the price of concentrates in USD, and exchange rate variations are often known well in advance and are fluctuations. clearly defined in so-called life of mine plans.

The metal premium is determined by regional supply and demand and constitutes a local adjustment of the LME price, including such factors as transportation, customised alloys, and payment terms. Free metals arise when the quantity of the metal extracted during concentration exceeds the payable metal content of the concentrates purchased by the smelter. By-products extracted during the processing, such as sulphuric acid, also generate important revenues. The operating profit comprises the gross profit less operating costs for personnel, consumables, external services, energy, and depreciation. The operating profit is reported excluding revaluation of the smelters’ process inventory (PIR) in order to provide a better picture of the underlying trend. Unlike mines, smelters have a similar production situation over time with the exception of maintenance shutdowns of varying lengths. An individual smelter has minor shutdowns every year and conducts major maintenance work at 3-10 year intervals. Boliden provides guidance on maintenance shutdowns for the year ahead. 20 | Boliden Annual Report 2016 Introduction Market Operations Corporate Governance Financial reports INCOME MODEL MINES The metal market’s income components The mines’ gross profit = • Global market price in USD set on the The value of metal concentrate (Price x Payable) LME and LMBA (Price) – Deductions for treatment and refining charges and penalties (TC + RC + Penalties) • Metal premium, which constitutes a local adjustment to the LME price (Premium) • The concentrates’ payable metal conTC+RC tent, negotiated individually in line with + PENALImportant costs established standards (Payable) TIES • Personnel • Treatment charges published by the • Consumables major operators (TC) • Spare parts • Refining charges (RC) • External services • Discount for impurities in the metal • Energy (Penalties) • Depreciation • Metal extracted as a percentage of the metal content, which depends on the ALL SALES OF METAL quality of the process and the material CONCENTRATES BETWEEN (Recovery) BOLIDEN’S MINES AND • Income from by-products (By-products) SMELTERS ARE MADE ON MARKET TERMS THE BARS IN THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE NOT ACCORDING Revenues and Operating Operating TO SCALE gross profit costs profit S M E LT E R S The smelters’ gross profit = Treatment and refining charges and penalties (TC + RC + Penalties) + Metal premiums (Recovery x Premium) + Free metals ((Recovery – Payable) × Price) + By-products Important costs TC+RC • Personnel +PENAL• Consumables TIES Metal • External services concentrate • Energy PREMIUMS • Depreciation FREE METALS BY-PRODUCTS Revenues Raw materials Gross profit Operating Operating excl.

Streamlining Odda’s zinc operations Boliden reached an agreement to sell the independent Noralf operations at Odda to Fluorsid − an Italian company that is the market leader in aluminium fluoride − last autumn. The operations sold comprise the manufacture and sale of aluminium fluoride, which is used in the production of aluminium. The manufacturing process requires large amounts of sulphuric acid, which is a by-product of the smelter’s zinc process. A long-term agreement was signed at the same time for the sale of sulphuric acid. The sale supports Boliden’s strategy of streamlining the zinc operations at Odda and expanding production to 200 ktonnes per year by the second quarter of 2017. 34 | Boliden Annual Report 2016 Introduction Market Operations Corporate Governance Financial reports BUSINESS AREA SMELTERS Boliden’s acquisition of the Kevitsa mine in northern Finland means that Harjavalta now has a stable base supply of nickel concentrate.

The Access to land is fundamental in terms of Boliden’s effects of mines and smelters are most pronounced in ability to carry out exploration and conduct mining operations. In order to promote environmentally responsible and economically sustainable use of its 20,000 hectares of forest, Boliden’s forestry is FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified which ensures that economic, environmental and social responsibility is applied to all aspects of the forestry operations. Boliden aims in conjunction with all forestry-related activities, transportation and other activities in conjunction with it, to use input goods and consumables that are environmentally friendly and recyclable. Boliden has, on its own initiative, designated about 10% of its productive forested land as nature conservation areas, which is more than required for certification. 44 | Boliden Annual Report 2016 Introduction Market Operations Corporate Governance Financial reports ENVIRONMENT Description of the Events during environmental impact the year Waste Boliden processes numerous waste products • Construction of a deep storage facility for hazardous waste in order to create saleable products and to under Rönnskär continued in 2016.

Reclamation: Waste from mining operations comprises waste rock and tailings sand, which contain elevated levels of sulphides. The challenge, during reclamation, is to prevent oxygen from the air from reaching the waste rock and the tailings sand and thereby prevent weathering and the formation of acidic water.

Boliden’s reporting to the LBMA is verified by KPMG. 2016 In 2016, Boliden’s purchasing and sales staff have completed training courses in business ethics, social justice, and environmental issues that affect our supply chain. An improved methodology and system support mechanism have been introduced in order to further enhance the efficiency of the supplier evaluation process. Just over 100 business partners completed a self-evaluation process, which is a tool used to evaluate the work in areas that Boliden has identified as being of particular importance. The aim is to develop and improve the sustainability work of all parties. On-site visits and audits are carried out in special cases and any deviations and measures implemented are followed up. A total of 11 (19) such visits were carried out during the year, 5 (3) of which were audits. Business partners that fail to live up to our requirements are expected to draw up an action plan showing how these requirements will be met in future. 50 | Boliden Annual Report 2016 Introduction Market Operations Corporate Governance Financial reports BUSINESS PARTNERS AND PURCHASING PURCHASING CATEGORIES Boliden has, after the integration of the Finnish mines, a total of 7,300 suppliers, 200 of which account for 80% of the purchasing volume.

Middle management programmes are conducted annually, as are employer branding activities. Boliden has made an unchanged number of visits to universities and trade fairs in Sweden during the year, while the number of activities in Finland has increased. The results of external surveys show that the “young professionals” group (professionally active people 1−8 years after graduation) view working at Boliden in an increasingly positive light. Boliden’s equal opportunities work has been noticed. One example of this is Women at Work – a network for women who are interested in career development. 54 | Boliden Annual Report 2016 Introduction Market Operations Corporate Governance Financial reports RISK MANAGEMENT Market and commercial risks Boliden’s market and commercial risks are primarily managed within the individual Business Areas and at Group level.

There are some exceptions to this, e.g. when mining ore bodies with short residual lifespans or in conjunction with major investment projects. See also under the “Financial risks” section. Boliden also continuously hedges Smelters’ metal price and currency exposure during the period between the purchase of materials and the sale of corresponding metals (with the exception of process inventory) in what is known as transaction exposure.

Norway and Sweden have longer pricing agreements than Finland profitability. and Ireland. At the same time, Boliden monitors the potential for entering into longer term pricing agreements if favourable terms are offered. The EU’s climate vision is giving rise to substantial investments in renewable and subsidised power generation, which can be expected to result in increased pricing volatility. Financial risks Boliden has a centralised treasury function that is responsible for managing financial risks with the exception of credit risks in accounts receivable. The treasury function is tasked with supporting the management and operating units at Parent Company and Group level. This structure ensures good internal risk monitoring and offers both financial and administrative economies of scale. The treasury function is responsible for identifying and limiting the Group’s financial risks in line with the financial policy adopted by the Board of Directors.

The refinancing requirement is reviewed regularly by Boliden’s treasury function. The liquidity. refinancing requirement is dependent, first and foremost, on market trends and investment plans. The loan agreements carry loan covenants which oblige Boliden to comply with certain defined key ratio conditions in order to avoid early repayment. A deterioration in the global economic climate may entail increased risks in respect of profit performance and financial position, and the risk of Boliden coming into conflict with loan terms and conditions. Boliden has complied with all loan covenants in 2016. The average term of total loan facilities was 3.3 years (2.4) at the end of the year, which is in accordance with established Group policy. On 31 December 2016, Boliden’s payment capacity totalled SEK 6,968 m (6,514) in liquid assets and unutilised binding credit facilities with a term in excess of one year. Boliden has a cash pool structure that enables it to maintain a central overview of liquidity flows and ensures efficient management of the Group’s liquidity.

The reserves are reduced each year through mining activities, and it is, therefore, vital that Mineral Reserves and Resources are increased by means of successful exploration or acquisitions. In 2016, Boliden made one acquisition – Kevitsa in Finland – and was also able to announce a new, inferred Mineral Resource at Tara in Ireland. Large parts of Garpenberg’s Mineral Resources were, furthermore, upgraded to Mineral Reserves. Boliden shall work to ensure optimal resource and the nearby Nautanen deposit with the aim of submitmaterials handling at every stage of the value chain and ting an application for a mining concession in 2017. the responsible conversion of assets in the form of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves is an important The Boliden Area component of this work.

The formulas have been verified using density measurements. In other cases, measurements are carried out for the different ores or rock types that affect the density. Waste rock dilution Mining usually incurs some waste rock dilution that varies, depending on the mining method used, the ore’s geometry, and other geological factors. Boliden systematically monitors the waste rock dilution of the ore extracted and the experience gained thereby enables waste rock dilution to be included in all Mineral Reserve estimations. Ore losses Proven Mineral Reserve Some ore may have to be left unextracted (e.g. in 380 A proven Mineral Reserve meets the requirements for the form of pillar offset), depending on the mining a measured Mineral Resource where mining-engineermethod used, the ore’s geometry and other technical ing and profitability studies show that it is technifactors.
