These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. Revenue and margin recognition on long-term contracts (Note 2.3.6 Sales and costs generated by operating activities and Notes 3, 18 and 32) Identified risks As at 31 March 2018, the Group’s revenue and earnings before interests and taxes (EBIT) amounting to respectively 7,951 M€ and 381 M€ mainly derive from construction contracts and long-term service agreements (“the long-term contracts”). As described in Note 2.3.6 to the financial statements, revenue on long-term contracts is recognised according to IAS 11 based on the stage of completion assessed by milestones which ascertain the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work or the performance of services provided for in the contract. At each closing date, estimates and assumptions involving a high degree of judgement by management are required in order to assess: yy the revenue at completion, including contract variations (variation orders, claims and contract amendments); yy the revenue recognised in accordance with milestones achieved; REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2017/18 — ALSTOM 105 3 Financial statements Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements yy the margin at completion on each contract, incorporating appropriate contingencies to cover identified risks (technical, commercial, etc.) related to the project execution. We consider the revenue and margin recognition on long-term contracts to be a key audit matter, because quality and proper implementation of processes, management assessments and judgements significantly impact the revenue and the margin recognised on projects. Our response As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the Group’s internal processes and controls for project management of long-term contracts. We also performed a critical review of the systems and controls implemented by the Group relating to the measurement of the revenue and costs at completion and of the stage at completion. For a sample of contracts, selected based on their risk profile including the technical or commercial complexity and/or the financial impact, we also: yy examined the terms and conditions of the contracts, including contract amendments and variations yy obtained an understanding of the performance and stage of completion of the contract through discussion with the project and Group management; yy examined externally available evidence, such as customer correspondence, approval of external milestones, for the most significant turnkey contracts, physical inspection of construction site; yy used our experience gained in previous years on these contracts or on similar contracts; and yy assessed the consistency of the accounting information reflected in the financial statements with the project information obtained. We verified that Notes 3, 18 and 32 to the consolidated financial statements contain the appropriate information. Disputes and Investigations (Note 22 Provisions and Note 33 Disputes) Identified risks As described in Note 22 and Note 33 to the financial statements, Alstom’s operations lead to the risk of litigation and contractual claims from third parties, and the Group faces on-going investigations and procedures by judicial authorities with respect to alleged illegal payments in certain countries. Alstom assesses the corresponding risk based on assumptions and estimates, to determine whether a provision is recorded or a risk disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. This assessment involves a high level of judgment. Due to the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements, the degree of management’s judgment and the uncertainty around the resolution of those procedures, we consider the disputes and investigations to be a key audit matter. Our response We performed a critical review of the provisions recorded and disclosures provided by in particular: yy examining the procedures implemented by management to identify, assess and account for disputes and investigations; yy inquiring with the in-house legal counsels and analysing underlying documentation of procedures ongoing; yy obtaining external legal positions if considered as relevant; yy examining legal expenses accounts for any indication of legal matters not yet considered; yy reading minutes of the meetings of the Boards of Directors and of the shareholders’ meetings of Alstom’s key entities; yy assessing management’s judgment through understanding of precedent outcomes in similar cases and external legal positions; yy verifying that Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements contains the appropriate disclosures on the status of disputes and related uncertainties Adoption of IFRS 15 (Note 2.1.1 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers) Identified risks IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” will be applied by Alstom starting 1 April 2018. As described in note 2.1.1 “IFRS15 Revenue from contracts with customers” to the financial statements, Alstom has elected to apply the full retrospective method. Accordingly, based on analysis performed by the management, opening equity at 1 April 2017 is expected to be restated of approximately (0.5) B€ after tax. The Group has studied the differences implied by IFRS 15 with its current accounting methods. Alstom has identified and measured the accounting impacts of IFRS 15 by relying on analyses of the contractual and general conditions applicable to its construction contracts as well as long term service agreements. The differences and the estimated impacts of the restatement on the equity and the balance sheet at 1 April 2017 are presented in the Note 2.1.1 “IFRS15 Revenue from contracts with customers”. We consider the adoption of IFRS 15 to be a key audit matter, in view of the differences with the existing accounting principles and methods, notably including the transition from the milestones percentage of completion method to the cost to cost percentage of completion method in order to recognise the revenue from contracts qualified as overtime contracts. 106 ALSTOM — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2017/18 Financial statements Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements 3 Our response We performed a critical review of the IFRS 15 impacts and disclosures by in particular: yy assessing the compliance of the new revenue recognition accounting principles and methods described in Note 2.1.1 with IFRS 15; yy examining the quantified impacts as at April 1, 2017 in Note 2.1.1 concerning the adoption of IFRS 15 on equity, balance-sheet and order backlog. For this purpose, we: yy selected contracts and entities on the basis of their financial impact and risk profile; yy considered the Group’s analyses of the selected contracts and entities, notably the transfer of control over time or point in time and, where applicable, the identification of the various performance obligations, the contract modifications and variable considerations; yy examined the parameters of the simulation tool developed by Alstom and reconciled the data used in the tool and in the analyses done by the main subsidiaries with the accounting data. Lastly, we assessed the appropriateness of the qualitative and quantitative information given in Note 2.1.1 to the financial statements. Verification of the Information Pertaining to the Group Presented in the Management Report As required by law we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars, were appointed as statutory auditors of Alstom SA by the annual general meeting held on 23 June 2009. As at 31 March 2018, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars were in the 9th year of total uninterrupted engagement. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2017/18 — ALSTOM 107 3 Financial statements Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: yy identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. yy obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. yy evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements. yy assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. yy evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. yy obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements. Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

This statutory auditors’ report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the shareholders, Opinion In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your general meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Alstom SA (“the Company”) for the year ended 31 March 2018. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2018 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee. Basis for Opinion Audit Framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 April 2017 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Justification of Assessments Key Audit Matters In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements. Valuation of the investment in Alstom Holdings (Note 2.1 Investments) Identified risks As at 31 March 2018, the net value of the investment in Alstom Holdings amounts to 8 016 m€ and represents 99% of Alstom’s total assets. Alstom Holdings owns directly or indirectly all the entities of the Alstom group. As described in Note 2.1 to the financial statements, investments are recorded at their acquisition cost. The recoverable value of the investments is assessed based on a multi-criteria approach. Alstom records an impairment if the recoverable value of the investments is lower than their carrying value. Determining the recoverable value is based on (i) Discounted Cash Flows, and (ii) values in relation with current or considered transactions or any other fair market values, if available. This impairment test relies on significant management estimates, such as the group’s business plans and terminal growth rate. Accordingly, we consider the measurement of the recoverable value of the investment in Alstom Holdings to be a key audit matter, due to the amount of the investment recorded in the balance-sheet and the inherent uncertainty of certain inputs, in particular the likelihood of achieving forecast results included in such measurement. REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2017/18 — ALSTOM 125 3 Financial statements Statutory auditors’ report on the financial statements Our response We performed a critical review of the methodology applied by management to perform the impairment test by: yy understanding process and controls implemented by Alstom; yy assessing the consistency of the assumptions used for the impairment test (projected future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates) with the historical and current performance, the existing backlog of contracts and the economic environment in which Alstom operates; yy assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions used to determine values in relation with current or considered transactions or any other fair market values, if any; yy reviewing sensitivity analyses to key assumptions; yy verifying that Note 8 to the statutory financial statements contains the appropriate disclosures. Verification of the management report and of the other documents provided to Shareholders We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars, were appointed as statutory auditors of Alstom SA by the annual general meeting held on 23 June 2009. As at 31 March 2018, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars were in the 9th year of total uninterrupted engagement. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. 126 ALSTOM — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2017/18 Financial statements Statutory auditors’ report on the financial statements 3 Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: yy identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; yy obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; yy evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements; yy assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; yy evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

Long Term Incentive (performance shares) The main characteristics of the performance shares allocation policy applied to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which contributes to align his interests with those of the shareholders, are compliant with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and are the following: Performance All of the performance shares are subject to the achievement of performance conditions which are relative and/or conditions internal. The Board of Directors commits, in the event of a major change in the Group’s strategy or structure, to adapt the performance conditions to future new challenges, in their nature as well as in the level of results to be achieved, while maintaining stringent requirements and comprehensive disclosure. Acquisition and Satisfaction of these performance conditions is henceforth assessed at the end of the third fiscal year following the performance period grant date. The Board shall not assess the achievement of performance conditions or deliver the shares of a given plan prior to the definitive acquisition date initially forecasted. Limits applicable The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on 13 March 2018, reiterated the following principles regarding grants to to the grant officers: yy the IFRS 2 value (which is used in the establishment of the Group’s consolidated financial statements) of any annual grant shall not exceed one year of fixed plus target variable compensation, which corresponds to the compensation obtained when achievements are strictly aligned with the set objectives. Thus, performance share compensation is capped at 100% of target short-term compensation (fixed and target variable), i.e. 200% of fixed short-term compensation; yy the aggregate amount of annual grants to corporate officers cannot exceed 2.5% of the overall amount authorised by the General shareholders’ meeting for grants of free shares within the Group or 5% of the total grants under the relevant plan. Holding requirement Since 2007, the Board of Directors has also set, for each grant, the number of shares that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer must hold until he no longer exercises his duties. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is thus required to hold, in registered form, 50% of the performance shares definitively delivered to him during the entire term of his mandate (as renewed, if applicable). This holding requirement no longer applies when the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer reaches a retention target of shares held in registered form corresponding to the value of three years of his last gross annual fixed compensation. For the assessment of the holding requirement cap, the following is taken into account: yy the gross annual fixed remuneration applicable as at the date of the last final share performance acquisition; and yy the respective market prices of the shares held in registered form by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as at the time of each final acquisition of performance shares. Prohibition of The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commits not to use hedging instruments on the performance shares granted hedging instruments by the Company during the full length of his term of office. To the Company’s knowledge, no hedging instrument has been set up.

During periods where trading is not prohibited, the Group’s internal rules of good conduct create an obligation to consult the Compliance Officer, in the event of any doubt prior to conducting a transaction. Periodicity The grants are completed annually (when completed), around the fiscal year closing date.

Retention conditions of performance shares under vesting period 41% In the event of a departure, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 70% shall not retain rights to acquire performance shares granted under his mandate during the last two plans and which are still subject to Fixed annual compensation performance conditions. Thus, no early acquisition would be possible Compensation subject to performance conditions during the vesting period and the performance shares resulting from the Variable annual compensation last two plans would be entirely lost. As a reminder, the Board refrains from observing the achievement of performance conditions or from Long-term incentives (ref.: IFRS2 value of March 2018 grant) delivering the shares of a plan prior to the end of the vesting period. Supplemental pension plans MAXIMUM COMPENSATION The Company’s policy is no longer to provide the executive corporate officer with defined benefit pension plans (article 39). Thus, the plan that was in progress was closed on 31 December 2016 and the related 42% rights frozen. 24% The Company’s policy is to provide the executive corporate officer with a system that is equivalent, but significantly less expensive, to a definedbenefit pension plan, i.e. an annual contribution dedicated to retirement to a third-party organisation under an “article 82” scheme. 34% 76% Fixed annual compensation Compensation subject to performance conditions Variable annual compensation Long-term incentives (ref.: IFRS2 value of March 2018 grant) 182 ALSTOM — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2017/18 corporate governance Board of Directors’ report on corporate governance 5 The Company’s policy is also to provide the executive corporate officer The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer undertook, once the tax and with a defined contribution pension plan (article 83). social obligations relating to these contributions are satisfied, to keep the amounts paid on the dedicated retirement savings vehicle, at least As an illustration, upon decision of the Board of Directors held on for the duration of his mandate; 8 November 2016, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer receives additional retirement benefits: yy a defined benefit pension plan (article 39), of which closure and freezing of cumulated rights was decided from 31 December 2016. yy a defined contribution supplementary retirement scheme (article 83) No new rights can be acquired under this plan since this date. as follows: The three schemes listed above are collective plans available (for the contributions are paid annually and correspond to 1% of the “article 82” and “article 83”) or formerly available (for “article 39”) to annual remuneration up to four annual Social Security ceilings, 4% other senior managers in the Group. of the annual remuneration between four and eight times annual ceilings of the Social Security and 11% of the annual remuneration between eight and twelve times the Social Security ceiling, Compensation due or granted to Mr Henri since 1 July 2014, contributions are 95% borne by the Company; Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief yy an annual contribution dedicated to retirement paid to a third-party Executive Officer, for fiscal year 2017/18 organisation under a “article 82” scheme.

At its meeting held on 15 May 2018 and acting upon the recommendation of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors found that: yy with respect to Company global performance objectives, all quantifiable and based on the following four performance criteria all measured over a full year: free cash flow, adjusted EBIT, gross margin on orders received, injury frequency rate, the level of achievement should be evaluated at 102.8% of set objectives for a target at 60% and a ceiling at 120%: ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL OF GLOBAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES Performance level Target Ceiling for the fiscal year Criteria evaluation GLOBAL OBJECTIVES 60% 120% Free Cash Flow 20% 40% €128 M 27.8% Adjusted EBIT 25% 50% €514 M 50% Gross margin on orders received 10% 20% Confidential (1) 20% Lost time injury frequency rate 5% 10% 1.0 lost time injury by millions 5% of worked hours (2) 2017/18 OVERALL ANNUAL PERFORMANCE 102.8% (1) The Board of Directors considers that margin on orders received is a key performance indicator for the business of the Company as it reflects the strategic orientation to focus on most profitable projects. However, Alstom being the only “pure player” of the rail industry (i.e. whose business relies solely on the rail industry), the Board considers it would be against the interests of the Group to publicly state the objectives and performance of the Company as to the gross margin on orders received, as this would give competitors strategic information. (2) With regard to the safety-related indicator, the evolution of the rate of accidents at work has largely exceeded the targets set by the Board but the Board, on the proposal of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee and the Executive Committee, considered that the fatal accident that occurred in India in 2017 does not allow the Company’s objective regarding safety at work to be exceeded. As a result, the rate of achievement of this variable compensation target is capped at 100%. REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2017/18 — ALSTOM 183 5 corporate governance Board of Directors’ report on corporate governance yy with respect to individual objectives related to specific action plans, based on 5 criteria, measurable whenever possible, the level of achievement should be evaluated at 40.2% for a target set at 40% and a ceiling at 50%, as detailed hereafter: ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL OBJECTIVES Comments Target Criteria evaluation INDIVIDUAL OBJECTIVES 40% Management of the In terms of organisation and governance, the Board of Directors noted 5% 90% organisation and governance that Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge continued to implement the necessary of Alstom evolutions of the Board itself with regard to its composition and ways of working. Indeed, new Directors were proposed to the vote of the General Shareholders’ Meeting on 4 July 2017, namely Yann Delabrière, Sylvie Kandé de Beaupuy and Françoise Colpron, bringing new skills and better diversity to the Board. A detailed evaluation of the operations of the Board of Directors was launched in Spring 2017 with the support of an external specialised consultant. A list of recommendations was made and an action plan set up within the Board and each of its Committees. The Board also noted the quality of management by Mr Henri PoupartLafarge of the changes within the Executive Committee. It noted the slow but steady improvement in gender diversity within the management teams (from 18% to 20% over three years) and the geographical diversity with a preponderance of local employees in the management teams of different regional entities outside Europe (more than 75% in Asia-Pacific, Latin America or North America, more than 55% in Africa-Middle East). Success in the Regarding strategic evolution, precise orientations have been set up as 12% 125% implementation part of the “Alstom 2020” strategic plan and a crucial step has been taken of Alstom strategy with the combination project between Alstom and the mobility business of Siemens announced on 26 September 2017. The Board considered that the proposed project would allow market consolidation in the context of the emergence of new competitors and the first steps of this combination have been successfully implemented, especially the opinion given by the employee representative bodies and the signing of the Business Combination Agreement. At the same time, Alstom’s geographical expansion continued during the year, notably with the progress made in the installation works in India (Madhepura) and South Africa (Gibela), and the launch of activities in sub-Saharan Africa. From an Innovation point of view, the Board noted the launch of new solution platforms such as Mastria™ (multi-modal digital mobility platform) and Aptis™ (electric bus). Sales Performance The fiscal year 2017/18 was another exceptional year for Alstom, with 9% 90% more than €7.2 billion of order intake. The order intake volume, spread over many contracts, demonstrates the Group’s ability to operate in multiple geographies and markets, notably with a rebound in order intake in the Signaling business (+30% compared to the prior-year period). The Board noted, however, that significant orders, although announced, were not yet all formalised at the end of the year. 184 ALSTOM — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2017/18 corporate governance Board of Directors’ report on corporate governance 5 Comments Target Criteria evaluation Operational and financial The evaluation of the Board on operational and financial performance is 9% 90% performance based on various Key Performance Indicators such as On Time Delivery, Inventories, Working Capital… The Board considered that the operational and financial performance improved during the fiscal year 2017/18 through the proven progress in terms of operational excellence on the one hand (On Time Delivery including the delivery of the first trains of the Gibela mega-project in South Africa or the first locomotives in India, Cost of non-quality...) and financial results (margins) on the other hand. The Board noted that some difficult projects were now under control or on an improvement track and that the management teams had taken and implemented the difficult adaptation decisions to the economic context in the United Kingdom and Brazil. Alstom image The Board considered that Alstom had regained the trust of the financial 5% 90% markets, resulting in a significant increase of the share price between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. It thus considers that the repositioning of the Company as a worldwide Railway Transportation specialist is now a proven fact. In addition, the Company has been involved for many years in corporate social responsibility surveys conducted under the Dow Jones Sustainability Index method with the objective of being above the eighty-fifth percentile of companies in the same sector. This has been reached continuously for 7 years. In 2017, Alstom’s teams helped the Company beat its own record by reaching the ninety-fifth percentile of companies in the industry. The efforts of the Company in terms of Ethics & Compliance have been recognised and allowed the ISO 37001 certification as well as the successful end of the American Department of Justice self-reporting obligations. 2017/18 OVERALL ANNUAL 40.2% PERFORMANCE Therefore the Board decided that Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge’s variable limit his variable compensation to 120% of his annual fixed compensation, compensation for fiscal year 2017/18 would be set at €1,072,500, as he announced at the General Shareholders’ Meeting held on 5 July corresponding to an achievement of 143% of his objectives. Considering 2016 for the fiscal year 2016/17, his wish having been reiterated for the very significant change of context with respect to governance and the fiscal year 2017/18. Accordingly, the Board recommends the 2018 strategy, the steady level achieved in terms of commercial and financial Annual Shareholder Meeting to approve a variable compensation exactly performance and Mr Poupart-Lafarge’s contribution to these results, the matching the actual achievement at 143% of targets, in consistency with Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominations and the Company’s remuneration policy in place since 2016.

AGREEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS SUBMITTED FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING Agreements and commitments authorised during the year In accordance with article L. 225-40 of the French Commercial Code, we were informed of the following agreements and commitments concluded during the year authorised by the Board of Directors. Letter of support from Bouygues SA to the contribution in kind of the Mobility activity of Siemens to Alstom remunerated in newly issued shares Directors concerned: Mr Olivier Bouygues, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Bouygues SA, Bouygues SA, represented by Mr Philippe Marien. Nature and purpose: At its meeting of 26 September 2017, your Board of Directors authorised the signature of a support agreement between Bouygues SA and Alstom, and countersigned by Siemens, on the same day as the signature of the Memorandum of Understanding between Siemens and Alstom to combine Siemens’ mobility activities with Alstom (the “Transaction”). The purpose of this agreement, which includes obligations for Alstom, is to set the conditions to which Bouygues SA provides support and the terms and conditions thereof. By this agreement, Bouygues undertakes in particular to (i) vote in favor of the Transaction at the meeting of the Board of Directors, (ii) not to transfer, directly or indirectly, the Alstom shares it holds before the general meeting called to decide on the Transaction and (iii) vote in favor of any resolution submitted to the vote of the shareholders as part of the approval of the Transaction, with all of its voting rights up to a maximum of 29.99% of the Company’s capital. Alstom undertakes, after the lock-up, to cooperate with Bouygues SA, upon it so requests, in the efforts it may engage to sell its stake in the Company. Motivations justifying the interest of such commitments for the Group that led to the authorisation given on 26 September 2017: The Board of Directors underlined the importance of the support of Bouygues SA, as a significant shareholder of Alstom, in the planned merger between Alstom and the mobility activities of Siemens. REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2017/18 — ALSTOM 203 5 corporate governance Statutory Auditors’ special report on related‑party agreements and commitments Agreements and commitments not subject to prior authorisation In accordance with articles L. 225-42 and L. 823-12 of the French Commercial Code. In accordance with article L. 225-90 of the French Commercial Code, we have been informed that the following agreements and commitments have not been subject to prior authorisation by your Board of Directors Supervisory Board. It is our responsibility to inform shareholders of the circumstances by virtue of which the procedure for prior authorisation was not followed. Exclusive financial advisory mandate entrusted to Rothschild & Cie Bank Director concerned: Mr Klaus Mangold, Vice President Europe of Rothschild, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Rothschild GmbH and Member of Rothschild Global Advisory Group. Nature and purpose: On 26 September 2017, Alstom concluded with Rothschild & Cie a mandate agreement as Alstom’s exclusive financial advisor, and as part of this mandate, assist Alstom in the study, preparation and implementation in connection with the planned merger between Alstom and Siemens’ mobility activities. This agreement was authorised by your Board of Directors on 26 September 2017 and was signed following this authorisation. Although this agreement had a retroactive effect, its final terms have only been finalised the day of the Board of Directors authorisation. As such, this agreement could not be submitted to the authorisation of your Board of Directors nor formally concluded before this date. Motivations justifying the interest of such commitments for the Group that led to the authorisation given on 26 September 2017: The Board of Directors has considered that it was in Alstom’s interest to retain Rothschild & Cie as financial adviser given its extensive experience in many cross-border transactions, his knowledge of your Company’s activities, and the sector in which your Company operates. AGREEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS ALREADY APPROVED BY THE ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING Agreements and commitments approved in previous years which the execution continued during the year Commitments falling within the scope of article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code with Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom starting 1 January 2017 Director concerned: Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom. Nature and purpose: At its meeting of 8 November 2016, the Board of Directors authorised starting 1 January 2017 the new terms and commitments made to Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom and motivated the interest of such commitments for the Company, in accordance with Articles L. 225-38 and L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code. Your Board of Directors meeting of 15 May 2018 has confirmed, for the purpose of the Statutory Auditors’ special report, the motivations that led to the authorisation given on 8 November 2016. These commitments are as follows: Supplemental retirement schemes: At its meeting of 8 November 2016, the Board of Directors authorised, upon the recommendation of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee, the closure starting 31 December 2016 and the freeze of cumulative rights of the defined benefit plan in force (“article 39”) together with the implementation of a new supplemental retirement scheme in accordance with the articles L. 225-38 and L. 225-42-1 of the Commercial law. The Board of Directors then decided to replace the defined benefit plan with a new defined contribution supplemental pension scheme, with the objective of reducing the annual expenses held by the Company under these schemes. The other beneficiaries eligible to the “article 39”, being the members of the Executive Committee under French employment contract, with an annual remuneration that exceeds eight times the Social Security ceiling, benefit from an equivalent system. The implementation of the new terms and conditions aims at creating a retirement saving of which the amount, at the time of the retirement of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, should allow him to receive an annual pension equivalent to the one he would have acquired under the “article 39” defined benefit plan, reduced by a discount related to the suppression of the presence condition and depending on his age and seniority in the scheme. 204 ALSTOM — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2017/18 corporate governance Statutory Auditors’ special report on related‑party agreements and commitments 5 As a consequence, the Board of Directors decided to: yy close, starting 31 December 2016 of the defined benefit pension plan (article 39) attributable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the freeze of the cumulative rights, as of 31 March 2018, representing an annual pension of €176,000 (constant euros) subject to the presence condition at the time the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer asserts his pension rights. No new rights shall be acquired in relation to this plan; yy implement, starting 1 January 2017, an annual contribution dedicated to retirement paid to a third-party organisation (article 82). The calculation of this gross annual contribution is based on Mr Poupart-Lafarge’s total annual remuneration (fixed and variable remuneration) according to the following terms and conditions: 10% of his gross fixed remuneration between eight and twelve times the Social Security Annual Ceilings and 20% of his fixed remuneration greater than twelve times the Social Security Annual Ceilings, 20% of his annual variable remuneration as determined by the Board of Directors, the reference remuneration (fixed and variable) for the calculation of the contribution will not, in any case, exceed €2 million, no contribution will be paid if its variable remuneration is equal to zero. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is committed, once the tax and social obligations relating to these contributions have been satisfied, to keep the amount paid on the dedicated retirement savings vehicle at least for the duration of his mandate. This system reduces the Company’s annual expense by approximately 25% in the full-year accounts on the basis of a remuneration corresponding to the annual objectives. The amount of the pension to which the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer would be entitled on the basis of this remuneration would be less than the amount currently considered under the terms of the previous “article 39” scheme (amount itself limited to eight times the Social Security ceilings), in application of a discount accompanying the transition from a non-acquired rights plan to an acquired-rights plan. Agreements and commitments approved in previous years but not implemented during the year Commitments falling within the scope of article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code with Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom, from 1 February 2016 to 31 December 2016 Director concerned: Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom Nature and purpose: At its meetings of 28 January 2016 and 10 May 2016, the Board of Directors authorised the related-party commitments made to Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom starting 1 February 2016 and motivated the interest of such commitments for the Company, in accordance with Articles L. 225-38 and L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code. At its meeting of 8 November 2016, the Board of Directors authorised the closure and the freeze of the cumulative rights under this plane, starting 31 December 2016. These commitments are as follows: Supplemental retirement schemes: The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has benefited from a defined benefit plan (article 39) for the benefit of senior executives of Alstom SA and Alstom Executive Management SAS whose basic remuneration exceeds eight times the Social Security Ceilings. At its meeting of 8 November 2016, the Board of Directors authorised, upon the recommendation of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee, the closure starting 31 December 2016 and the freeze of cumulative rights of the defined benefit plan in force. Under this scheme, the vesting of rights for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was subject to performance conditions. In its deliberation of 28 January 2016, the Board of Directors decided that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer would acquire his annual rights only if his variable remuneration for the corresponding financial year reached at least 50% of his target value. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2016/17, the Board of Directors noted that this performance condition had been achieved. The pension that would be paid to Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge through this plan, unless he claims his rights to retirement while leaving the Group, has been frozen to €176,000 (constant euros) subject to the presence condition when the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer claims his pension rights. With regard to the defined contribution pension scheme (article 83), the Chairman continues to benefit from the supplementary collective retirement arrangement which the directors of Alstom SA and Alstom Executive Management SAS are benefiting from. The contributions used to finance the defined pension contract amount to 1% of Tranche A, 1% of Tranche B, 4% of Tranche C and 11% of Tranche D of Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge reference salary and are 95% supported by the Company. For fiscal year 2017/18, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer benefitted from contributions of €25,187 per year, supported at 95% by the Company, €23,927.

These commitments are as follows: Severance payment: As regards the length of Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge’s career as employee before being appointed as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (18 years), the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee, authorised the suspension (instead of cancellation) of his contract of employment during his Corporate Office. The Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee, decided that in the event of revocation of his Corporate Office his contract of employment with Alstom Executive Management SAS would be reactivated. In the event it would not be possible to propose to Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge a position corresponding to his level of responsibility, he would benefit from a severance payment which cannot exceed two years of his target remuneration as Corporate Officer and is subject to the following performance condition: application of a coefficient corresponding to the average level of attainment of targets applicable to his variable remuneration for the three years preceding his departure to two years of his target remuneration, fixed and variable. It would include and could not be lower than the severance payment to which Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge is eligible in the frame of his suspended employment contract with the Company Alstom Executive Management SAS as at 31 January 2016, that would amount to €1,856,000.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France. For the year ended 31 March 2018 To the Shareholders, In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Alstom S.A. (the “Company”), appointed as independent third party and certified by COFRAC under number 3-1060 (1), we hereby report to you our report on the consolidated human resources, environmental and social information for the year ended 31 March 2018, included in the management report (hereinafter named “CSR Information”), pursuant to article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Company’s responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing a company’s management report including the CSR Information required by article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code in accordance with the Company’s internal reporting guidelines consisting of “Census Rules” and “Social Survey indicator protocol” for the human resources information and of “Environment, Health & Safety Reporting Manual” for the environmental information (hereinafter the “Guidelines”) and available on request from the Company’s head office. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory texts, the French Code of ethics (Code de déontologie) of our profession and the requirements of article L. 822-11-3 of the French Commercial Code. In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with the ethical requirements and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Statutory Auditors’ responsibility On the basis of our work, our responsibility is to: yy attest that the required CSR Information is included in the management report or, in the event of non-disclosure of a part or all of the CSR Information, that an explanation is provided in accordance with the third paragraph of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information); yy express a limited assurance conclusion that the CSR Information taken as a whole is, in all material respects, fairly presented in accordance with the Guidelines (Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information). However, it is not for us to express an opinion on the compliance with the other legal provisions applicable, in particular those set out by the article L. 225-102-4 of the Commercial Code (plan of vigilance) and by the law n° 2016-1691 of 9 December 2016 known as Sapin II (fight against corruption). Our work involved seven persons and was conducted between September 2017 and April 2018 during an eight week period. We were assisted in our work by our CSR experts. We performed our work in accordance with the order dated 13 May 2013 defining the conditions under which the independent third party performs its engagement and with the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie nationale des Commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement and with ISAE 3000 (2) concerning our conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information. 1. Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information Nature and scope of our work On the basis of interviews with the individuals in charge of the relevant Departments, we obtained an understanding of the Company’s sustainability strategy regarding human resources and environmental impacts of its activities and its social commitments and, where applicable, any actions or programmes arising from them. We compared the CSR Information presented in the management report with the list provided in article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code. (1) Scope is available at www.cofrac.fr. (2) ISAE 300 Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information. REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2017/18 — ALSTOM 273 6 Sustainable development: Alstom’s social responsibility Report by one of the Statutory Auditors, appointed as an independent third party For any consolidated information that is not disclosed, we verified that explanations were provided in accordance with article R. 225-105, paragraph 3 of the French Commercial Code. We verified that the CSR Information covers the scope of consolidation, i.e., the Company, its subsidiaries as defined by article L. 233-1 and the controlled entities as defined by article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the methodological note, presented in chapter 6 of the management report. Conclusion Based on the work performed and given the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information has been disclosed in the management report. 2. Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information Nature and scope of our work We conducted more than one hundred interviews with around one hundred persons responsible for preparing the CSR Information in the Departments in charge of collecting the information and, where appropriate, responsible for internal control and risk management procedures, in order to: yy assess the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, and taking into account industry best practices where appropriate; yy verify the implementation of data-collection, compilation, processing and control process to reach completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and obtain an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures used to prepare the CSR Information. We determined the nature and scope of our tests and procedures based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information with respect to the characteristics of the Company, the human resources and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainability strategy and industry best practices. Regarding the CSR Information that we considered to be the most important and whose list is given in annex: yy at parent entity level, we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organisation, policies, actions), performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations of the data. We also verified that the information was consistent and in agreement with the other information in the management report; yy at the level of a representative sample of entities, Sorel-Tracy in Canada, La Rochelle, Valenciennes and Saint-Ouen in France, Salzgitter and Stendal in Germany, Hong-Kong, Mexico City in Mexico, Cabliance in Morocco, Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, Gibela in South Africa and Manchester and Radlett in the United Kingdom, selected by us on the basis of their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify that procedures are properly applied, and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work represents 25% of headcount considered as typical size of the social component, and between 21% and 37% of environmental data considered as characteristic variables of the environmental component. For the remaining consolidated CSR Information, we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the Company. We also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in part. We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used, based on our professional judgement, are sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR information cannot be totally eliminated. Conclusion Based on the work performed, no material misstatement has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines.
