We do this, for example, by continuing our In our constant effort to maintain premium quality standards, long history of engagement and leadership in organisations we know that consumer feedback is essential in helping us that develop the toy safety standards used around the globe, define our quality levels.

We had 781 calls per million LEGO® products sold, reaching our below 900 target. Read more about consumer experiences on page 60. Global quality insights from the consumer call centre By working intensively with consumer feedback, we have learned that quality perception is not uniform across the globe. LEGO sets produced in the same factory using the same high quality standards will have different levels of 38 The LEGO Group Responsibility Report 2013 Children deserve only our best 39 consumer feedback, depending on the country, as consumer behaviour differs between countries and cultures. We know that if the consumer call rate for Europe is at an index of 100, the call rate for the United States will be index 140 and index 280 for South Korea. As we expand to new regions, we adjust and scale our consumer feedback options to the market so we can service our consumers in the best possible manner. The target for 2014 is 950 calls per million products sold, slightly higher than 2013, as we continue to expand into new markets and add more bricks to our novelty boxes. Learning from the consumer call rate Consumer call rate is monitored in the LEGO Group to give a temperature check on how our quality is perceived by consumers. It’s an effective tool used to maintain and improve our premium product experience. Rigorous quality and consumer tests are carried out in the development of all LEGO sets to ensure only premium play and building experiences reach consumers. As an example, in 2013, a LEGO Fire Helicopter, product number 60010, received consumer feedback regarding play functionality. Feedback told us that playing with a LEGO Minifigure in the doorway of the helicopter while operating the fire hose could cause the model to become unstable. A team of designers therefore quickly developed an alternative construction where this particular play feature was possible while keeping the model stable. The product was then reintroduced to the market with a new building instruction. LEGO® Fire Helicopter, 40 The LEGO Group Responsibility Report 2013 product number 60010 Playing with safe and high quality toys The LEGO Group believes it is vital that children always have safe and high quality play experiences. The LEGO Group operates in the EU toy category market that saw a total of 366 safety notifications in 2013. We are proud to announce that we had no safety notifications globally for the third year in a row, thereby adhering to our zero product recall expectation.

For the LEGO play experience it is vital that (Scope 3) the consumer can combine bricks in all thinkable ways, be they new or old. This has been a LEGO trademark throughout generations. The raw material for LEGO bricks starts out as a fragment currently distilled from crude oil. Through a number of ­processes, the large molecules from crude oil are processed via small molecules into long chains of ­molecules to make, in the case of the LEGO brick, the material Polyethylene. All plastic materials for our bricks are made in this way.

The choice of materials for our bricks is important, as it has a large effect on the environmental impact of our value chain. Different materials create different impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, land, water and resource use. These impacts depend on a range of factors, such as how the material is found, whether it comes from plant material or oil-based resources, and how easily it can be processed. As we want to be able to make informed decisions when looking for new materials, we are developing systems that allow us to better assess the impacts of the raw materials that go into our products. 120 The LEGO Group Responsibility Report 2013 Building a responsible business 121 Understanding our Limiting the impact of design choices our packaging The search for sustainable materials is a As 10% of the LEGO Group’s CO2 emissions major part of the story, but not the whole are linked to the packaging material we use, picture.

Doing this has several advantages: In our WWF Climate Savers partnership, we have committed • less environmental impact through reduction in materials to further look into how we can best innovate our products and transport i.e. saves 4,000 tonnes cardboard annually to be more sustainable and how to best embed eco-design. and reduces the CO2 from packaging by 10%. • consumers can handle products more easily. 122 The LEGO Group Responsibility Report 2013 Building a responsible business 123 • retailers have room for more items on their shelves. In 2013, we implemented the reduced size packaging for 100% of our new products. Implementation of responsible sourced paper materials continues We are committed to responsible forest management, and through our support to the Forrest Stewardship Council we have developed and implemented Chain of Custody management systems. In 2013, the LEGO Group was certified according to the FSC Chain of Custody standard. We also worked to align our suppliers to both our product line and marketing materials. We are pleased to have passed our audits, made corrective actions and received the final approval for six of our work sites. We are now looking to increase our sourcing of FSC in the Asian region. Today, more than 90% of the material we source for our core line products is FSC-certified. Our ambition is that by 2015, all paper used by the LEGO Group for printed materials, packaging, building instructions, brochures and in-store material will be FSC-certified. Innovation of product packaging In 2013, we took stock of how well we integrate environmental impact into our development process. We will build on this knowledge in 2014. Through the Climate Savers partnership with WWF (more information on page 115), the LEGO Group will look into how best to innovate products to become more sustainable.

In 2013, we investigated in even greater detail how, and where, we generate waste. Working with external experts we have decided to concentrate our focus in 2014 on reducing waste generation as our first priority, whilst at the same time maintaining the high levels of recycling we achieved in 2013. We prioritise our waste management to: 1. reduce waste 2. reuse waste 3. recycle waste Water consumption In 2013, the LEGO Group used 339,000m³ water in total. This is a minor increase in water consumption per tonne of products produced. The Group recognises water scarcity as a key concern in the world and therefore wants to manage our resource ­consumption responsibly. In 2014, we will work to better understand our water consumption and accessibility. 130 The LEGO Group Responsibility Report 2013 Building a responsible business 131 Strengthening in three main areas: Operations, Marketing and Business Enabling. corporate governance • All employees can contact daily management directly and all employees are encouraged to contact the CEO directly with ideas and thoughts.
