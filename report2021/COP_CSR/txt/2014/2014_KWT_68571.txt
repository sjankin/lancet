Achievements during the past year include: • ISO 9001:2008 certification for Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Uganda • ISO 14001:2004 certification for Dubai • ISO 18001:2007 certification for Dubai • ISO 22000:2005 certification for Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Libya • HACCP CODEX Alimentarius Annex 2 CAC/RCP 11969 (2009) certification for Saadiyat Accommodation Village in Abu Dhabi • Establishment of a Food Safety Management System and initiation of ISO 22000 certification of our food warehouses in Sudan and Cyprus • Certification of 2 HACCP trainers through Highfield in the UK • Qualification as an HABC center for HACCP training and examinations • HACCP certification by Highfield, UK of 60 Sudanese staff members in Sudan/Darfur – with 240 more to be completed this year • “Go Green” Recycling and Tree Planting Program • Goumbook Green Connection: Give a Ghaf tree planting program • Gazprom NEFT Iraq recognition for 500 days of work without an HSE incident • Award of the American Society for Safety Engineers HSE Excellence Award 2013 – GOLD Award • Emirates Environmental Group – CSR Arabia Network continued membership.

Human Rights is one of the six key modules. Participation is conducted through e-learning on an individual basis – and employees must pass an on-line examination to achieve certification. Gulf Catering Company has worked in challenging and remote locations throughout the Middle East, Africa, Australia and Asia since 2003. We have employed upwards of 8,000 employees representing over 30 nationalities. Many of our employees are from developing countries: representing a challenge in ensuring proper recruitment, hiring, work conditions and accommodation of staff members. In our Iraq operations we have transitioned to 75 percent local hire operations, with a goal of steadily increasing this number as we promote junior staff and create new openings. In 2013, we were awarded a UN Food Rations contract in Darfur, Sudan. Our staffing consisted of 85 percent local national employees: all of whom were employed according to local and international labor law: at fair salaries and benefits. We implemented a training program that has resulted in 60 local employees undergoing HACCP Food Safety training in Arabic that will result in official certification through Highfield Awarding Body for Compliance in the United Kingdom. The training, testing and certification for the remaining 240 employees is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2014. Local employees in Sudan are provided with transport to and from their workplace, mid-day meals, water, uniforms, job-related protective equipment and safety shoes. Our corporate position is not simply to adhere to minimum requirements – but to provide the communities in which we are working with employment opportunities, training, certification and skills that ensure their future. 33rd floor, Mazaya Business Avenue, Plot No. AA1, Jumeirah Lakes Towers, P.O.

Gulf Catering Company became certified by Highfield Awarding body for Compliance of the UK to conduct, test and certify HACCP training. In the past year, 8 QHSE Managers became certified as Tutors through Highfield Awarding Body for Compliance. This allows a greater reach in training employees in Iraq and Africa – areas where training personnel are scarce. By adding Food Safety HACCP training and certification, we provide important job skills and opportunities to employees in remote areas. This was evidenced as we trained, examined and submitted 60 Sudanese staff members in our Darfur operations for certification. By the end of 2014 an additional 240 Sudanese staff members will be trained, tested and certified. Gulf Catering Company’s focus is on a safe and productive working environment for our employees.

It is a drought-tolerant evergreen tree that has often been called the ‘tree of life’ due to its root system’s ability to find water in the dessert – even up to 30 meters. The early inhabitants of the region relied on sighting a ghaf UAE-indigenous Ghaf Trees tree to locate water. The ghaf tree withstands drought and can survive off of very little water. Its flowers, fruit, leaves, branches, bark and roots provide a natural habitat to many dessert birds. The ghaf is endangered by camels and goats who feed off of its bark and leaves and by man, who cuts it down. Its existence is further threatened by planting initiatives that focus on water-thirsty imported varieties of plants and floral trees that require extensive amounts of water. We joined the “Give a Ghaf” program by organizing our first special tree planting. The Removing the seeds from the event began with an introduction lecture on pods the tree, and the opening of pods that hold precious seeds. Preparing and Labeling the Pots The seeds were then planted in special pots labeled with our company name. The seeds are expected to germinate at the nursery greenhouse in 3-6 months, and 33rd floor, Mazaya Business Avenue, Plot No. AA1, Jumeirah Lakes Towers, P.O. Box 634367 Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

We will follow the progress of our trees throughout the coming months until actual trees are planted. Our Construction and Life Support contracts involve both preventative actions and the incorporation of environmentally friendly / recycling initiatives. Examples include the safe processing of waste, fuel overspill basins, recycling of aluminum cans, metals and plastic water bottles, and the use of biodegradable catering materials. Our future Ghaf trees In many projects, a percentage of the proceeds of recycling initiatives are contributed to local educational initiatives. Gulf Catering Company gives priority to ISO14001 qualified suppliers. When sourcing materials and supplies we require a Material Data Safety Sheet (MSDS) that we provide to our clients.
