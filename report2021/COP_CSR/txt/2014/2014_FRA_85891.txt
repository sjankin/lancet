This new technology enables Lyreco to load more boxes on one pallet and then to fill more boxes in one full delivery vehicle. Consequently, it also saves space in the Distribution Centres and requires less handling when refilling the box making machines. Based on current analysis, the new boxes will save 4,500 km per year driven by 15 trucks, meaning 900 diesel litres and 1.1 tonne of CO2 reductions. 24 Sustainable Development Report 2013/2014 Environmental Actions PACKAgINg RE-USE OF BOXES New countries adopt a second life for supplier cardboard boxes Reusing the cardboard boxes in which suppliers n When a customer order is prepared, the deliver goods to Lyreco, is a very simple, operative estimates the volume of the order Initiated in Additional countries Number of boxes / year Sustainable Development Report 2013/2014 --Our OurEnvironmental EnvironmentalActions Actions emissions saved but effective resource reuse initiative.
