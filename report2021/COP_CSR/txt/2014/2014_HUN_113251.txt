AHOY! – GREETINGS FROM THE CAPTAIN Foreword by the CEO The CIB Group treats and applies sustainability as an attitude that permeates the entire corporate culture and constitutes an integral part of operation. In concordance with the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, we believe that the best practice is for the whole of the organisation to reflect the fundamental principles of sustainability through its basic operation. The year 2013 represented a positive turning point for the CIB Group in many respects. During the year countless rumours were aired regarding our future, to which our owner responded in the last quarter of the year by approving the bank’s new, five-year strategy, the clear purpose of which is – with the solid support of our parent bank – for us to once again become a financial institution that is profitable in every respect by the end of the period. To this end, the decision was made to implement numerous changes, all of which clearly move the financial institution towards a strengthening of sustainable banking operations in the long term. Our mission is, through the provision of an outstanding quality of service, to become the bank of choice for a base of highly discerning retail and corporate customers, and to make concerted efforts to retain our excellent staff and further develop their abilities and skills, while focusing more sharply on protecting the added value that we create. In this spirit we have forged ahead with the transformation of our corporate culture and business processes, and have successfully maintained the already high level and diversity of our social investments: through our various direct and indirect initiatives we have assisted 65 000 people in need. We could never have achieved this figure without the active participation of our many civil-sector partners and, of course, our committed employees. Please take the time to read through this year’s report which, for the sixth year running, shows the degree of our compliance with the principles set out in the UN Global Compact. A new feature this year is that when preparing the report we departed from the usual methodology, as we are the first of the Sanpaolo Group’s subsidiaries to base our report on the latest GR14 methodology of the Global Reporting Initiative. The differences lie in the method of defining material issues, and the way that they are reported. Naturally, we give a detailed account of this in the report itself. Finally, I would like to ask you to share with us any thoughts and comments that you might have, so that by taking them into consideration we can perform even better in the year ahead, to the satisfaction and benefit of all our stakeholders. Best regards, Dr. Pál Simák CEO, Chairman of the Board of Directors 7 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 1. AHOY! – GREETINGS FROM THE CAPTAIN 1.1.

Captain’s entry in the Ship’s Log, 2013, off the “CSR Isthmus” 1.1.1. Changes in the banking environment the government measures affecting the banking sector, which significantly reduced the profitability of Hungarian banks and altered the domestic operating environment; the high ratio of non-performing loans that resulted from the deterioration in the quality of the corporate and retail credit portfolio as a consequence of the changed environment; the continuing outflow of external funds from the banking sector; however, the banking sector’s liquidity improved concurrently with that of the financial markets. In the first half of 2013 the decline in the corporate loan portfolio of financial intermediaries continued. On the supply side the lending terms remained strict, which the banks mainly attributed to the prevailing macro-economic uncertainty. On the demand side, however, signs of an upturn could be observed, even with regard to long-term loans, something that has not been seen since 2010. Owing to the Funding For Growth (FFG) scheme, which was expanded in September, the pace of the decline in corporate lending slowed, while 2014 saw a reversal of the trend in lending in the SME segment; although in order to sustain this a further loosening of lending terms by the large banks is needed. The portfolio of household loans continued to decrease in the first half of 2013, but a strengthening of demand was observed, with the result that new placements grew for the first time in years. Although the slump in lending can primarily be attributed to the weak macroeconomic environment and profitability outlook, as well as to the worsening situation with regard to the predictability of the regulatory environment, the proportion of non-performing loans is also a major factor. The most important challenge for the domestic financial intermediation system is the management of the deteriorating loan portfolio. The growth in new non-performing loans damages profitability by making it necessary to recognise new impairment. The high non-performing portfolio can reduce the willingness to lend; it weakens liquidity, compromises maturity matching and draws away funds that could be used to provide new loans. 8 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 1. AHOY! – GREETINGS FROM THE CAPTAIN 1.1.2. Government measures affecting the banking sector The Hungarian banking sector was affected by numerous government measures in previous years. Measure Impact Extraordinary bank tax This tax burden is considerably higher than similar taxes levied in other countries of the European Union, and damages not only the growth prospects but also the profitability of the stakeholders in the banking sector, as well as the banking system’s return on equity and its ability to support the real economy through its lending activity. Transaction duty The Act on the Financial Transaction Duty entered into force on 1 January 2013. The introduction of the duty further increases the financial burdens on the banking sector. “One-off supplementary In addition to the increase in the financial transaction duty, a statutory amendment passed transaction duty payment” by Parliament also obliges banks to make a one-off supplementary payment, due to the fact that the financial transaction duty revenue fell short of the budgetary target. The supplementary payment amounts to 208% of the transaction duty paid for the January-April period. National Asset The most socially disadvantaged debtors who are unable to service their mortgage loans Management Agency can apply to have the National Asset Management Agency (NE Zrt.) purchase the property serving as collateral for their loan. The Asset Management Agency buys the property at a heavily discounted price, and the debtor can rent the property back at a discounted fee. The original strict requirements have been relaxed, but it remains unclear whether the Asset Management Agency will be capable of purchasing the 25 000 properties prescribed under law by 2014. The number of residential properties earmarked for forced sale between the fourth quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2013 came to a total of 28 816 (15 216 properties in 2013), of which 3 228 properties were successfully sold in the first three quarters of 2013. Of the properties sold, 5% were sold by financial institutions and 25% by the debtors themselves, while 70% of them were bought up by the National Asset Management Agency (Source: MNB). Exchange rate cap scheme When a fixed exchange rate is set the payment obligations of foreign currency borrowers are reduced for a temporary period of up to 60 months. During this period they repay the foreign currency-based mortgage loan at a fixed exchange rate (HUF/CHF 180 for Swiss franc loans, HUF/EUR 250 for euro loans and HUF/JPY 2.5 for Japanese yen loans), while the difference between the fixed exchange rate and the actual exchange rate is only paid after the grace period has expired. The principal part of the exchange rate difference is borne by the customer, while the burden of the exchange rate difference on the interest payments is shared at a ratio of 50-50% by the lending financial institution and the state. The number of exchange rate cap agreements concluded between 1 April 2012 and 30 November 2013 exceeded 166 000 overall, which together with the 5 712 contracts concluded under the earlier, Phase 1 of the Exchange Rate Cap Scheme, makes a total of 171 801 contracts. The volume of foreign currency loans with a fixed repayment exchange rate came to more than HUF 1 329 billion at the end of the period. So far, people with holding account loans participating in the exchange rate cap scheme have been relieved of HUF 24.2 billion in interest payments, half of which was borne by the banking sector, and half by the state. (Source: PSZÁF) Funding For Growth The Funding For Growth Scheme considerably improved the terms of borrowing. Under Scheme the FFG scheme a total of HUF 701 billion in loans have been placed, which represents the utilisation of more than 93 percent of the available funds, so the scheme has had a significant effect on the activity of participants on both the demand and supply side. In the first pillar of the scheme, new loans amounted to 63 percent of total placements, and it is particularly favourable that 60 percent of these placements were investment loans. Owing to the capping of the interest margin at 2.5 percent, the burden of interest payments for businesses was significantly reduced both in the case of new loans and of loans used to refinance existing credit facilities. (Source: MNB) Free cash withdrawals In February 2014 the government introduced the opportunity for retail customers to make free cash withdrawals, twice a month, up to a maximum amount of HUF 150 thousand. This new obligation will have a negative impact on the sector’s profitability, representing a burden of approximately HUF 40 billion. (Source: HVG) 9 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 1.

Our owner Intesa Sanpaolo The CIB Group’s owner is Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A, one of Europe’s largest banking groups. ISP is committed to the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region, and to the Hungarian market, which is of strategic importance to the group. ISP has not only provided CIB with considerable capital and funding support in recent years, but has also shared with it the best group-level operating practices. In 2013 our owner resolved to pursue a new strategy that focuses on growth. Intesa Sanpaolo’s new business plan is aimed at achieving solid and sustainable value creation and distribution by the year 2017. This is envisioned as taking place along the lines of a clear and comprehensible action plan that requires a joint effort to put into effect, with people and investments representing the key factor in its implementation. The four main pillars of the business plan: New Bank of Growth Bank of Internal Growth Low Capitalisation Bank People and investments as key factors The main focus is on a substantial improvement in profitability, underpinned by a pronounced increase in revenues, continuous costs management, and dynamic loan and risk management. Its objective is to become the „Bank of new growth”, i.e. the engine of new growth, by fully leveraging the value inherent in its existing activities, that is, to be a „Bank of internal growth”. At group level, as well, the plan focuses on the establishment of multi-channel sales, private banking, asset management and insurance centres, and the provision of 360° banking services to corporate customers, all of which also feature in our Bank Group’s strategy. Our parent company is strengthening its presence in the markets deemed to be the most important and/or which offer exceptional opportunities, and is also maintaining a presence, while giving consideration to opportunities for expansion, in regions that are undergoing a transformation, such as Hungary. 2.1.2.

Accordingly, the work got under way in 2013, and in what follows we will describe the most important results of these efforts. The most significant change affecting the organisation was the creation of the Focused Customer Management Division (FCMD). The new division, together with Workout and Real Estate Portfolio Management, is comprised of the FCMD Corporate Relations and FCMD Retail Leasing and Operation units, headed up by the Chief Workout Officer Michael Clark. The purpose of establishing the division is for customers with credit products that would not suit our business objectives to maintain in the portfolio to be managed by FCMD from the beginning to the end of the process, from the front office activities to the operational processes, so as to free up the business divisions to focus on their task of implementing the new strategy. In the interest of appropriately separating the areas of responsibility, the FCMD Credit Underwriting unit, established at the same time as FCMD, is under the direct supervision of the Chief Finance and Risk Officer. The Realty Services department has been transferred from Asset Management, and is now under the direct supervision of the Chief Financial Officer. Another important organisational change in the reporting period was the continued restructuring of the retail and SME network. In response to the stricter regulations and the protracted financial crisis, in 2013 we had to further streamline our branch network. Following the closure of 13 branches – while continuing to provide nationwide coverage – as of the end of the year we served our customers in a total of 95 branches. The number of SME departments fell from 20 to 12, and thus, in terms of their size, the portfolios managed by the departments have become more evenly distributed. Concurrently, the boundaries of the SME departments and regions have also changed, helping to also reduce the number of departments in geographical terms. The SME Sales and Network Management unit has ceased to exist, so that the regions now report directly to the division head. The changes are made necessary by the fact that, on the one hand, the lower segmentation threshold for the SME division has risen (from a HUF 100 million annual net revenue to HUF 250 million), and consequently the SME division manages considerably fewer customers; and on the other hand, in line with the Bank Group’s strategy, our aim is to build an efficiently operating, sustainable division that works to achieve profitable growth and fully leverage cross-selling opportunities. In line with the principle of organisational efficiency, the post of Chief Administrative Officer has been abolished. As a consequence, Bank Security has been moved to the Efficiency and Change Management Division. The remaining organisational units (Group Legal Services, Compliance and Prevention of Money Laundering), now report directly to the CEO. In the interests of simplification and boosting efficiency, organisational changes were made at all the divisions following a review of the relevant processes; the most important changes – besides those already mentioned – took place in the HR, Risk Management, IT, Treasury, and Corporate Banking & Structured Finance divisions. A change affecting the CIB Group’s structure was that on 14 January 2013 CIB Fund Management – as a result of the Regional Asset Management Project – became a member of Intesa Sanpaolo Group’s Luxembourg-based EURIZON Capital SGR group. 16 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 THE SHIP 2.1.3.

Stand by our values! 2.3.1. The Ship’s Code – Ethically-sound and responsible operation Running a ship is only possible if it cuts through the we should do in the event of a pirate attack. The question arises waves by adhering to a set of ethically-sound rules of how far I can go, and how I can act in defense of my people of conduct. Our system of rules had already been without compromising my integrity.

We haven’t even set sail yet, but many have already asked what Captain’s Log entry in the dock of the port of Rhetoric... Our Code of Ethics reflects our broader vision of our social and environmental responsibilities. It explains those values in which we believe, and which we have made a commitment to uphold. As a company that operates in compliance with strict ethical norms, we have put in place a number of mechanisms that reveal risks that have previously, due to their nature, remained hidden; these include ethical risks. The purpose of the procedural rules is for victims in ethics cases, who until now have been unable to ask for help, to be able to consult and request advice, before taking action, if needs be, and to do so in an anonymous manner. The Intesa Sanpaolo Group has set up a system of local ethics ombudsmen, which with a few exceptions investigate ethics-related reports in the given member country, with the decision also made at local level. To enable us to take local conventions into account, in addition to the ethics ombudsman the CIB Group is also establishing an Ethics Committee, the chairperson of which – as the ethics ombudsman – is the Bank’s head of CSR.

The solar panels resulted in a saving of 8 444 m3 of natural gas in 2013, which is equivalent to the annual gas consumption of 3 average detached houses. Greenhouse gas emissions avoided through the use of solar collectors (tonnes, as carbon dioxide equivalent ) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 24 17,94 16,33 14,3 10,75 In 2013 some 50% of the office paper we used was already recycled. In the case of statements sent to our customers, the leaflets used for marketing purposes (newsletters enclosed with statements) are made from recycled paper; the number of these in 2013 was close to 2 265 million. Cycling to work grew in popularity, with the number of people using this mode of transport increasing from 142 to 176 in 2013. In our Petrezselyem utca head office the men’s and women’s changing rooms were expanded, providing capacity for an extra 30 persons. The replacement of traditional light bulbs with LED units is ongoing; in 2013 we replaced the lighting in the whole of the Petrezselyem utca head office, as well as in the 24-hour zones of the branches in Budapest. When preparing and implementing the training programs we take special care to respect the values of our natural, economic and social environment, and make an effort to manage our resources responsibly and without waste. To this end we give preference to electronic communication (e.g. in the process of sending out invitations, information or training materials), and where paper-based documentation is absolutely necessary we produce this economically, with double-sided printing. In 44 branches and in the Medve head office, we replaced the old, obsolete uninterrupted power supply (UPS) units. The installation of smaller, modern, energy efficient UPS units led to an approximately 10% reduction in UPS energy use, with a corresponding decrease in CO2 emissions, while due to the increased battery life a significant drop in the quantity of hazardous waste is also expected over the next 5-6 years. As part of the spring and autumn “Bike to Work!” campaigns, 40-55 of our employees pedalled a total of 6 314 kilometres, thus saving their environment from a total of 1 243 kg in carbon dioxide emissions. As the first of the financial institutions in Hungary to apply, we also took part in WWF Earth Hour, as a part of which – for the purpose of raising awareness – the CIB Group also switched off the exterior illuminations of its central office buildings for two hours. 1 Defining the concept of office square meter also took place based on the definition approved by Intesa Sanpaolo; net office area in 2010 102 461.85 m2; in 2011 84 664 m2; in 2012 82 662 m2; in 2013 66 312 m2 4 In respect of the 2009 CO2emissions have been calculated based on the conversion rates set by the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, which are, in the case of electricity, 401 kg/kWh, in the case of natural gas 1.9739 kg/m3, and in the case of vehicle fuel (diesel, petrol), 2.46 kg/l. With effect from 2010, the conversion rates recommended by our parent company Intesa Sanpaolo are as follows: in 2010, in the case of electricity 0.368 kg/kWh, in the case of natural gas 1.934 kg/m3, in the case of vehicle fuel diesel 2.672 kg/l and petrol 2.444 kg/l; in 2011, in the case of electricity 0.335 kg/kWh, in the case of natural gas 1.934 kg/m3, in the case of vehicle fuel diesel 2.352 kg/l and petrol 2.622 kg/l. In 2012, in the case of electricity 0,319 kg/kWh, in the case of natural gas 1.918 kg/m3, in 2011, in the case of vehicle fuel diesel 2.672 kg/l and petrol 2.444 kg/l; in 2013, in the case of electricity 0,335 kg/kWh, in the case of natural gas 1.934 kg/m3, in the case of vehicle fuel diesel 2.024 kg/l and petrol 2.099 kg/l.

Captain’s Log entry, passing through the Gulf of Know-how Our bank group provides commercial banking, leasing and factoring services to private and business customers in Hungary. Similarly to the other players in the sector, in recent years we have placed an emphasis on ensuring continuous growth in its customer base; however, this trend was interrupted by the financial crisis, which shifted the focus to customer retention and gaining the best possible understanding of client needs. The loan portfolio reflects an even higher degree of risk-awareness than before, with efforts being made to improve loan quality, while in respect of deposits the aim is to further accelerate the rate of growth. Naturally, profitable operation remains an important objective, in the interests of which we are constantly improving our cost effectiveness. These objectives fundamentally serve the long-term stability of our Bank Group. We provide comprehensive information about our services on our internet site, and in our Annual Financial Statements, which can also be downloaded from our website. Strategy The strategy rests on three main pillars: repositioning/balancing through development of the consumer and small business segments, as well as retention of the current market share in the corporate division, and the proactive management of the riskiest parts of the portfolio, the clear internal organisational separation of the inherited portfolio that is not a strategic priority a portfólió legkockázatosabb részének proaktív kezelése. The objectives are clear: for the Bank to become the primary bank for its customers; the gradual creation of stable profitability; a strong, sustainably profitable bank with a smaller organisation. 26 ross the ocean CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR VOYAGE ACROSS THE OCEAN 3.1. Distribution of income, from a stakeholder’s perspective The data pertaining to the generation and distribution of economic value reveal how the organisation contributes to the prosperity of its stakeholders. The total gross value generated is the difference between the total value generated (revenues) and the cost of goods purchased and services used (consumption). We performed the calculation of this data using the methodology applied by Intesa Sanpaolo. More information on the Bank’s business results can be found in the 2013 Business Report and the Annual Financial Statements that include it. The 2013 data continue to reflect the protracted difficulties faced by the Hungarian economy, and the impact of the much changed tax regime, as the economic value generated fell due to the special tax on banks, the drop in interest revenues, impairment and other losses; but at the same time we reduced our loss somewhat in comparison to the previous year.

We conduct segment-specific customer satisfaction surveys among our retail and SME customers. With the help of a system based on a short questionnaire accessible via the queue ticket dispensing machines in the branches, last year we elicited 375 000 responses from our customers. The questionnaires, which are updated quarterly and are tailored specifically to the individual branches, have made it possible to initiate targeted improvements in the branches with adequate speed. With respect to complaints management – where there was a 7% rise in the number of complaints relative to the previous year – we faced considerable challenges. Most of the complaints were received in respect of bank cards and current accounts, and leasing and credit products. Last year we found some kind of equitable solution for our customers in the case of every fourth complaint. Some 51% of the complaints were related to terms and conditions, and only 3% concerned customer communication. With respect to abuses of personal data, a total of 78 complaints were received (in 2011: 83, in 2012: 82), a significant proportion of which were related to external bank card fraud. • The CIB Group regularly cooperates in the hearings and consultations held by the Financial Arbitration Board in the interest of arriving at settlements that are based on customer-oriented solutions. 28 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR VOYAGE ACROSS THE OCEAN Number of complaints investigated by Voice of Customer (the complaints management department) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 18 148 17 697 17 237 16 880 18 025 Adjudication of complaints in 2013 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 36% 42% 40% 32% 32% 21% 24% 27% 31% 24% 43% 34% 33% 37% 44% Substantiated Acknowledged in Unsubstantiated a goodwill gesture Breakdown of complaints by type of service in 2013 Investment products Other 415 Transfers 1517 836 Credit and shopping cards 1849 Leasing 3222 Debit cards 1852 Credit products 411 Electronic channels 1649 Insurance products 651 Current accounts and deposits 3966 Mortgage loans 1657 29 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR VOYAGE ACROSS THE OCEAN We consider it important that everybody, including those of our customers who have disabilities affecting their movement, sight and hearing, or who are living with any other handicap, should have equal access to our services. A part of this stems from fulfilment of our statutory obligations, while other initiatives are undertaken voluntarily. On 31 December 2013 all of our 95 branches were barrier-free in compliance with the statutory requirements. (In 2012, some 75 of 108 branches were barrier-free, representing 69% of the network.) The main entrances to our central office buildings, and the bank branches housed within them, have also been made barrier-free. By the end of 2013 the bank’s branch network consisted of 95 units, and 171 CIB-operated ATMs were available to our customers. As in 2012, the CIB Group did not have any representative offices in 2013. At the end of 2013, a total of 40 of our branches had children’s areas, making it easier for customers with small children to do their banking. Indebted customers The government introduced numerous new regulations with the aim of improving the situation of borrowers with foreign currency-based mortgage loans. Although the majority of the programmes were concluded in 2012 (full early repayment at a discounted exchange rate and the write-off of 25% of non-performing mortgage loans), the exchange rate cap scheme (opportunity to make repayments at a fixed exchange rate) was extended. The CIB Group takes part in all cooperative initiatives that might deliver a solution for those of our customers whose situation has become untenable as a result of the economic crisis, with the aim of preventing or reducing the number of future complaints. Our customers have several options for the bridging of their repayment difficulties, depending on what type of loan product they have. In the case of unsecured credit there is an opportunity to request a temporary reduction in the repayments (50% for 6 months), but we charge the unpaid principal and interest in the following period. There is also the possibility of lengthening the repayment term, in which case the monthly payment decreases – although not proportionately, due to the increase in the overall loan fees – while various loan debts existing simultaneously can be replaced with a debt consolidation loan. Where property-backed loans are concerned, we offer numerous other solutions. With the CIB Solution Loan we provide what is known as a period of forbearance, during which only a part of the monthly payment needs to be paid, but we charge the unpaid principal and interest over the remainder of the term. There is the option to convert a Swiss franc-based loan into a euro or forint-based one. Based on the statutory provisions our CIB Exchange Rate Fixing Loan II product, which also ensures a temporary period of easing at the fixed exchange rates specified in the relevant statutory provision. The CIB Replanning Loan could be of assistance to those of our customers with Swiss franc-based mortgage loans who, due to changes in the exchange rate and/or their life circumstances, are unlikely to be able to continue meeting their current contractual payment obligations over the longer term. Furthermore, the monthly payment can be reduced by lengthening the term of the loan. For the amendment, it is also necessary to reissue the notarized deed and amend the contract. 30 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR VOYAGE ACROSS THE OCEAN 3.2.2.

Our operation is based on responsible procurement. The same terms apply to all our suppliers, and in the course of their selection our procurement principles and rules are enforced consistently. Our procurement principles: a supplier selection system that ensures transparency and a level playing field; consistent and favourable payment terms; insisting on legal, above-board employment at subcontractors too; the use of environmentally friendly technologies, environmentally friendly products and materials, and the recycling of waste is encouraged and in certain cases compulsory. Our regulations are harmonised with the standards of our parent company ISP. This general set of rules is periodically reviewed in the interest of ensuring that the principles of transparency and equal opportunities are continuously met. (The last review was held in 2012, and concluded that our procurement processes taking place along these lines ensure transparency and equal opportunities.) In keeping with the ISP principles, ethically-sound conduct is also reflect in our processes as an obligation associated with the contracts that we conclude, according to which our suppliers have to warrant that before signing the contract they have read our Code of Ethics, understood the parts of it that relate to them (“Guiding Principles for our Stakeholder Relationships” and “Guiding Principles for our Supplier Relationships”), that they agree with its content and will fully comply with its provisions in the course of their own operation. In addition to the above we have set ourselves the objective of incorporating, as an addendum to the CIB Group’s guidelines on its procurement processes, Intesa Sanpaolo’s sustainability rules relating to the procurement and use of paper and other materials. We plan the introduction of this to take place in 2014. 31 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR VOYAGE ACROSS THE OCEAN Number of suppliers by geographical location 2010 2011 2012 2013 Hungary 3 526 3 683 3 940 4 022 Europe 71 108 97 92 North America 8 12 12 10 Asia* 2 5 2 0 Total 3 607 3808 4051 4 124 Spending on services by geographical location of suppliers (HUF million) 2010 2011 2012 2013 Hungary 19 412 22 250 25 617 23 798 Europe 1 612 1 580 2 000 2 212 North America 170 134 223 211 Asia* 17 17 46 0 Total 21 211 23 980 27 887 26 221 *Israel is included in Asia. 32 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR VOYAGE ACROSS THE OCEAN 3.2.3. Authorities Number of proceedings launched by the various authorities, concluded in 2013 with the issuance of a resolution: 86 (in 2012: 94, in 2011: 85, in 2010: 20, in 2009: 16) Of these, the number of proceedings in which a breach of law was found to have been committed, and a fine imposed: 51 (in 2012: 64, in 2011: 46, in 2010: 13, in 2009: 8) Amount of fines paid in 2013: HUF 868.3 million (in 2012: HUF 33.9 million, in 2011: HUF 31.1 million, in 2010: HUF 15.9 million, in 2009: HUF 206.5 million) The large visible difference in the statistics relative to previous years’ data is attributed to the fact that in 2013 the Hungarian Competition Authority ruled that the banks committed a breach of the law between 15 September 2011 and 30 January 2012, by harmonising their strategies when restricting the availability of redemption loans. In connection with this case, a fine of HUF 835.4 million was imposed on CIB Bank. Number of consumer protection proceedings conducted by PSZÁF/MNB, concluded in 2013: 85, of which the total number of resolutions imposing a fine was 50. Consumer protection fines imposed on the Bank, in total: HUF 10 million 350 thousand. The Hungarian Competition Authority (GVH) and the Equal Treatment Authority. The fines imposed on members of the CIB Group by the Hungarian Competition Authority in 2013 totalled HUF 835.4 million. In 2013, as in previous years, the Equal Treatment Authority did not impose any fines on members of the CIB Group. 3.2.4. Pricing When determining our pricing we comply with the prevailing statutory provisions and fully observe the rules of fair competition, while giving priority to both maintaining the Bank’s solvency and ensuring the safety of customer deposits. Our prices are determined by fair market competition, the business strategy and the aspects of the regulatory environment that affect pricing. An example of the latter is the legislation that places exceptional restrictions on unilateral contract amendments, and the tightening of credit coverage rules applicable in the course of lending. 3.3. Products CIB Bank is one of the most capital-strong financial institutions in the domestic market, with firm support from the parent bank and more than 30 years of experience, providing the full range of services to more than 500 thousand customers in the domestic money market, while constantly seeking innovative solutions tailored to suit the needs of its customers. The services of CIB Bank Zrt. are available to businesses, institutions, municipalities and sole traders, as well as to retail customers. Besides the bank’s branches, customers also have an exceptionally wide variety of electronic channels to choose from, through which to manage their finances quickly and conveniently, such as CIB Internet Bank, mobilCIB, or eBroker, the Bank’s information and securities trading system. Keeping pace with the changing market environment, our Bank revamped its services in 2013 in order to offer a new and more transparent product range from which customers can choose the financial service that is the best suited to their requirements. The CIB Group also offers services to individuals and legal entities with special requirements. 33 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR VOYAGE ACROSS THE OCEAN Products/services that the Bank Group offers to its customers: Investment products Transfers Credit and shopping cards Debit cards Credit products Current accounts and deposits Mortgage loans Insurance products Electronic channels Leasing Other Secure banking In order to make using CIB Internet Bank and mobilCIB more secure, from 8 August 2013 onwards CIB Bank began incrementally introducing the obligatory use of a password generating device for identification purposes, in line with the security requirements specified by the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority in respect of two-factor authentication. To achieve a high level of security, taking into consideration the varying needs of customers, we offer two different types of identification device for our customers who use the CIB InternetBank. Our MobilToken application makes it possible to access our electronic services from anywhere using a mobile handset, while for those of our customers who prefer to use more conventional equipment, a physical token device is available for the electronic administration of their banking affairs. With regard to its services CIB Bank devotes particular attention to providing its customers with as much information as possible to help them make informed financial decisions. For this reason it participates in programmes that have as their primary goal the promotion of a culture of financial awareness. The “Financial Compass” Programme CIB has for many years sponsored the “Financial Compass” Programme (in which it participated in both 2012 and 2013), which is coordinated by the National Bank of Hungary. For more details about this, see the section entitled “Financial Literacy”. “Piggy Bank” Savings Account promotion In 2009 CIB launched a personal savings account intended to encourage regular saving. The account pays higher interest for every month in which the customer deposits HUF 10 000 or more in the savings account. Since the product’s launch, more than 110 000 such accounts have been opened at CIB, although since then a number of the accounts have become inactive. In the interest of encouraging saving among our customers, CIB launched a promotion in October of 2012. Owing to the success of the campaign, it continued the initiative right up to the end of 2013, providing an extra “bonus” to customers who set aside money in 12 consecutive months. 34 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR VOYAGE ACROSS THE OCEAN Retail product usage (including micro-enterprise customers) 2010* 2011* 2012 2013 Retail loans (HUF billion) 767,2 671,3 521,2 432,1 Retail deposits (HUF billion) 724,2 819,8 804,7 629,8 Number of active bank cards 460 098 419 787 425 369 371 178 Number of customers with an active CIB Internet 308 555 324 392 325 910 302 896 Bank subscription Consolidated, IFRS data as at 31 December *: Updated in 2012. Our corporate customers have a key role in stimulating the economy. Therefore we provide them with supplementary services that assist them in the further development of their business. Support for raising the financial awareness of micro customers with the Start Up Guide and Revol Software – in a continuation of the practice from previous years To advance the financial education of micro-enterprise customers, we provide a 240-page Start Up Guide to all customers who open an account, containing lots of up-to-date financial advice (for example: business plan, what does financing mean, state subsidies, running a business – tax and accounting questions, insurance, legal questions, day-to-day business issues – how to negotiate, what to sell and for how much, basic communication skills, internet use). Another useful tool that we offer free of charge is the Revol Software program, which is an invoice planning program that considerably simplifies the process of billing for customers. SME segment: The various customer segments all expect financial service providers to satisfy different needs. For this reason CIB Bank does not bombard its customers with standard propositions, but offers them solutions which – in keeping with the life cycle of the business – represent a complex package of financial services. It is a fundamental principle for us that we should meet our customers as many times as possible, because it is this personal relationship that enables our advisers to provide the managers of the businesses with as much information as possible, in a knowledge of the company’s present financial situation and plans. It is essential for customers to feel secure, and to be confident that they can trust their financial relationship manager. We believe that a long-term relationship built on trust is what forms the basis for the upkeep of a business that is built and run on stable foundations. Today competition based purely on price has been pushed into the background, giving over to an effort to forge relationships of trust. It is also in this spirit that our SME Division provides its services. “Relay Baton” and Business Breakfasts: “Relay Baton” is an initiative under which the managers of CIB Bank’s SME customers are given the opportunity to present the secrets of their business success, for example: management structure, strategy building, or perhaps their planning and governance, in the pages of relevant business media organs. These articles are published in national and local newspapers, as well as in the online media. In every case the interviews are accompanied by educational articles relating to special financial products, such as leasing facilities or subsidised loans, for example. In the autumn and spring of 2013, CIB Bank’s SME Division held a series of business events focusing on special business topics with relevance to SMEs. The purpose of this initiative was to generate dialogue between the SMEs, and to help them take all the latest “best practices” on board. These events provide an excellent opportunity for networking across the regions, between SME managers and banking specialists, and they also function as a superb platform for the sharing of valuable experience and exchange of tips, and for working together to find solutions to business challenges. 35 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR VOYAGE ACROSS THE OCEAN Corporate product usage 2010* 2011* 2012 2013 Corporate loans (HUF billion) 1 376,2 1 230,2 996,7 820,4 Corporate deposits (HUF billion) 618,9 597,7 506,2 572,9 Number of active bank cards 9 880 8 437 8 445 7 889 Number of customers with an active CIB Internet 13 026 8 986 8 610 8 106 Bank subscription Consolidated, IFRS data as at 31 December *: Updated in 2012. Initiatives to support our retail customers People may find themselves in situations, or faced with unexpected events, that make it difficult to meet their contractual loan repayments temporarily or for a longer period. In such cases it is extremely important that our customers notify their bank of this as soon as possible, as we have elaborated numerous options in the interest of – working together – finding a solution that makes it possible to continue making the repayments. Particularly prominent among our proposals aimed at households and individuals are financial products, such as mortgages, loans, etc., that promote financial integration and provide support for the groups in society that are at the greatest disadvantage in the crisis, such as: People and families in need The elderly/pensioners Students/youth Workers subject to redundancy Immigrants For more details about the favourable opportunities available to retail customers, see the section entitled “Indebted Customers”. Participation in the Funding For Growth scheme of the National Bank of Hungary (MNB) The Micro-Enterprise Division joined Phase 1 of the MNB Funding For Growth scheme in 2013 (the 1st phase ended in August 2013), then in November 2013 it joined Phase 2 of the scheme (the scheme will finish at the end of 2014). The lending initiative is designed to strengthen the Hungarian economy through the provision of discounted loans to SMEs at an interest rate of only 2.5% (the refinancing cost for the banks is 0%; the funds are provided by the National Bank of Hungary). A total of HUF 2 000 billion was earmarked for the banking sector as a whole in Phase 2 (90% of these funds have to be placed as new loans), while in Phase 1 a total of HUF 700 billion was utilised (of which HUF 300 billion went on the granting of new loans, and the remainder on the refinancing of existing facilities). In Phase 2 we plan to disburse loans totalling HUF 1.5 billion within the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise segment. Excluding loans provided to members of the CIB Group. Excluding deposits collected from members of the CIB Group. 36 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR VOYAGE ACROSS THE OCEAN Distribution of the loan portfolio by sector (%): (millió Ft) 2011 (%) 2012 (%) 2013 (%) Trading 10.29 10.67 7.53 Private Banking customers 30.80 28.65 27.09 Real estate investments 25.17 25.10 24.82 Other service sector 15.62 18.00 17.08 Food manufacturing 1.75 1.87 2.26 Transport and communication 3.47 3.19 5.98 Light industry 2.96 2.94 2.96 Heavy industry 2.56 2.66 2.50 Financial activity 4.55 4.00 4.22 Agriculture 2.28 2.35 4.11 Chemical and pharmaceutical industry 0.55 0.57 1.45 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 All customers who enquire about our services receive equal treatment.

The Bank complies with the provisions of the Code of Conduct, through the application of the principles of compliance and symmetry, in all of its dealings with customers. 3.4. Responsible marketing Our existing and potential customers learn about or products and services as a result of our marketing activity. It is important for us that we provide comprehensible and proper information in a way that generates interest in our products and services. We finalise our marketing communication materials following consultation with the Legal and Compliance departments, in the interest of ensuring responsible operation and legal compliance. During our advertising campaigns we take both ethical and sustainability guidelines into account. The CIB Group does not advertise in any media organs that give space for the expression of any extreme views. In the course of producing our publications we place emphasis on the use of recycled paper wherever there is an opportunity for us to do so. We print our newsletters on recycled paper. Consistently with the rules of responsible communication, and in compliance with the statutory provisions, we do not offer our products to minors, and do not advertise in public institutions where the education or training of people under 18 years of age takes place. 37 Our ship’s crew – “Only become a sailor if you love the sea” ur ship’s crew CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR SHIP’S CREW 4. Our ship’s crew – “Only become a sailor if you love the sea” There are lots of good officers serving aboard this ship, prevent this, or I’ll run into problems... but this massive several-tonne vessel could not be sai...

Crew statistics At the end of 2013 our Bank Group employed 2 531 people, almost all of whom had indefinite-term employment contracts, which for us is also symbolic of a committed employment relationship that can be planned for in the long term. To meet our seasonal labour requirements, we also employed 32 persons under a contract staffing arrangement. Although the proportion of part-time employees decreased slightly, we use other means of helping our staff to achieve a healthy work/life balance.

Talented sailors deserve special attention One of the main successes of the career management system launched by the CIB Group in 2013 is that we have now identified those of our colleagues who could become the managers of the future. For them we have elaborated the Management Talent Programme, for which 155 employees have been selected. The first Management Talent Programme got under way in May 2013. Participants in the programme have access to almost 30 development courses in 3 categories. training (10%): e.g. management and company-specific talent training courses, skills development training courses, etc. In collaboration with the Central European University (CEU), in 2013 we launched the Mini MBA course, in which 17 management talents participated. demonstration (20%): e.g. mentoring programme, coaching, publications, etc. practical experience (70%): e.g. project management, project participation, rotation, on-the-job training, visits to other departments, etc. A compulsory element of the programme is the mentoring scheme, when certain managers from the Bank Group voluntarily use their experience to help with the development of the management talents. Some 34 of the participants in the Management Talent Programme launched in May 2013 have already received a management appointment, or have been promoted to a management position with greater responsibility. In view of the success of the programme, we plan to continue it in 2014. 4.6. Training – Developing new skills and competencies is necessary to meet the constant new challenges The average number of hours of training per employee was 36.5 hours, which means that each employee received an average of 1.52 days of training over the year. A total of 712 employees participated in our restructured orientation programs, launched at the beginning of 2013. In 2013 a total of 193 people attended the English and Italian language courses supported by the Bank Group, which were held in Budapest in small classes. In the provinces 36 persons took part in the language training, typically at a unit of the contracted service provider. Almost 26 of the senior managers took part in one-toone training. As a part of the Management Talent Programme, 37 people received language training, 32 in classes, and 5 in the form of one-on-one tutoring. In 2013 a total of 28 new training packages were uploaded to the Bank Group’s electronic training portal, and employees successfully passed a total of 34,417 exams. 46 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR SHIP’S CREW Annual average number of training hours per employee 2010 2011 2012 2013 57,01 42 37,6 36,5 Based on closing headcount as at 31 December Number of training hours broken down by professional status in 2013 Total number of training hours Executive (male) Executive (female) Specialist and subordinate (male) Specialist and subordinate (female) 92 286 4 861 4 367 21 471 61 587 In concert with the launch of the career management system, we developed 18 new types of training course relating to both management and general skills, and ran them for those of our colleagues who were found, in the course of the assessment, to show room for improvement of the skill in question (a total of 20 training courses). The training programme for Premium Bankers started in 2013 with a comprehensive assessment; we used seven competence centres to measure our colleagues’ skill and competence levels, then after drawing a development plan – as the first stage in the development process – we worked on assertive communication training with every Premium Banker. We also held sales training for corporate banking advisers, with the involvement of all the branch managers. We supported the successful implementation of the product portfolio with a series of training courses with the following main areas of focus: for the participating employees to understand precisely the reason for the changes; for them to prepare to bring out the best of the new situation, both for our customers and for the Bank. On the sales training courses – in addition to the programmes already mentioned – we also worked with the staff of CIB 24, the SME and Leasing and Corporate Banking divisions, holding a total of 23 training courses for them. In the year 2013 our retail orientation programme, in addition to the classroom sessions, was augmented with a mentoring programme, during which trained mentors help the new employees to gain in-branch experience. 47 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 OUR SHIP’S CREW 4.7. “A loveable ship, and one to be proud of” The year 2013, in the interest of strengthening employee order to assess the state of health of our employees commitment and loyalty, saw a continuation of the CIB in their workplace, while in November a total of 574 Spirit programmes, which were also assisted by the team people participated in the testing with the help of of Spirit Ambassadors, which is made up of enthusiastic the screening truck parked outside our head office. employees. “CIB Spirit Sport” – We supported our employees Our aim is to make CIB into an attractive workplace, and in their sporting activities and training, and provione that we can be proud of.

The interests of the various sectors of the economy, and society, are represented by the associations formed by stakeholders, each focusing on a clearly defined set of objectives. Our participation in these organisations is important for two fundamental reasons. Firstly, it creates an opportunity to engage in professional dialogue, and secondly, it provides Bank Group, and the bank sector as a whole, with a means of upholding and protecting its interests as part of a structured advocacy group. Last year we reviewed and rationalised our membership of organisations, and at the end of the year we participated in the professional work of a total of 16 organisations.

In all cases the data is group-level data, except where specifically stated otherwise. When determining the content of the report we drew heavily on the results of various consultations held with civil-society organisations during the year. This year’s report of the CIB Bank Group focuses on the material aspects specified in the GRI G4 guidelines. We defined these carefully, with the involvement of our most important stakeholders and with the support of specialist consultants. In what follows we summarise this process for our readers in five – somewhat simplified – steps: 1. Identification of the relevant environment, social and economic issues that impact our stakeholders Here, on the one hand, we used external and interest documents such as our strategy, stakeholder surveys, research, GRI and other financial-sector guidelines, and on the other hand we ourselves have consulted experts who represent the stakeholder groups, who also helped us to identify such issues. Finally a list of almost 70 topics was drawn up, including a great many general concepts. 2. Checking for sustainability aspects and completeness We looked at whether the identified issues cover all areas of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility, and whether we had examined our actual and potential impacts from the perspective of all our stakeholders. 3. Determining the aspect boundaries We had to examine whether the individual issues have an impact within the company or outside it; in other words, where the boundaries are – because we intend to present them to our readers accordingly. 4. Prioritising, ranking The most exciting, and also the most difficult stage was when we had to rank the issues featured in the long list of relevant topics, with the help of specialists who are suitable for representing our stakeholders, in order to determine which of them are classified as material aspects. The methodology was elaborated by specialists, observing the GRI guidelines. During the ranking process we endeavoured to comply with the principles of comprehensiveness, conciseness and balance. 5. Validation, approval Our work was validated by the opinions of the specialists who took part, and those participating in the special working group, to whom we sent, as feedback, a list of the topics drawn up as a result of the prioritisation. Finally the working group structured the topics so as to provide a suitable framework for presenting the Bank Group’s performance. For the ranking, we used the following criteria for selecting the specialists representing the stakeholder groups, who we believe to be capable of representing and intermediating with the individual stakeholder groups: Selection criteria Internal stakeholder External stakeholder • Primary and secondary target group of the report • Has an influence that is of key importance from the Employees (4 persons) Media (3 persons) perspective of completing Senior managers (8 persons) Customers (2 persons) the report Middle manager(s); employee(s) Partners (suppliers, 1 person) • Their involvement could of sustainability and communiThird-sector organisations (2 represent an important cation departments, and head(s) persons) advantage from the perof key specialist departments (7 CSR specialists (2 persons) spective of the report’s persons) completion or distribution • Could represent a risk if not involved 61 CIB BANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 ANNEXES In the course of the prioritisation, the specialists involved in the process used a multidimensional methodology with variable weighting. In this process they examined, for example, the extent to which the given relevant topic affects the Bank Group, the extent to which it affects the given stakeholder group, what significance it has in a Hungarian context, etc. The individual rankings were collated by external consultants using various methodologies, and on this basis we selected the final 32 material aspects.
