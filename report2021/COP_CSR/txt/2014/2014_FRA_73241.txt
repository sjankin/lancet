For its first store in France, the Italian specialist in low-priced urban fashion for young people that is already present in 3 of Klépierre’s centers in Italy, chose the Rives d’Arcins shopping center in Bordeaux. Ireland’s top clothing retailer with unbeatable prices is coming to 2 leading shopping centers in France: Créteil Soleil (in June 2014 in a 5 400 sq.m. store) and Val d’Europe (in 2016). These latest leases reinforce the partnership between Klépierre and Primark, which already has leases with Klépierre at Aqua Portimão and Parque Nascente in Portugal, and at La Gavia in Spain (Madrid).

Around the must haves that make up the backbone of the retail mix – leading, lasting performers like Zara, H&M, and Sephora – there are brands that create differentiation. Representing around 10-15% of the mix, these retailers go by names like Hollister, Desigual, Apple, Uniqlo and Primark. Rare in France, Primark has just decided to open stores in Créteil-Soleil and Val d’Europe after an extension. Lastly, unique brands (10-15% of the mix) enhance the mix with a touch of exclusivity, like Hamley’s at Emporia, Mauboussin and Lego® at Jaude (Clermont-Ferrand), etc. Attentive: supporting the declinations of major brands This work that goes into creating the retail mix is made possible by the pool of retailers that the Group has built up over the years.

Since 2010, Klépierre has been supporting the successful development of the Italian cosmetic group Kiko in France (41 stores operating in the Group shopping centers) and, more recently, the fashion retailer Terranova (which chose Rives d’Arcins for its first opening in France) and Calzedonia, a fast-growing Italian group that already has more than 83 stores operating out of Group assets (including 37 Calzedonia, 31 Intimissimi and 15 Tezenis). Visionary: identifying the driving forces of retail Thanks to the work done in each country by leasing teams, novel concepts are identified and long-term relationships forged, like the one with Primark in Spain and Portugal. Today, Klépierre is the only shopping center property company to have signed 2 leases in France (at Créteil Soleil and Val d’Europe) and 4 in Europe with Ireland’s retail clothing champion. This kind of cross-fertilization also extends to nationwide brands. In 2012, Sephora made its first appearance in a Scandinavian shopping center (at Emporia), while Celio (67 stores in Klépierre shopping centers, 14 of them in Europe) opened its first store in Poland in 2013.

Because the exemplarity of an organization also depends on the performance of the suppliers it does business with, Klépierre is committed to giving preference to service suppliers (in the areas of maintenance, cleaning, and security) that are ISO 14001 or 9001 certified. Its goal is to reach the level of 80% of its suppliers certified by 2017. At the end of 2013, the percentage was already 76%. Lastly, a condition sine qua non of a lasting future, the zero defect requirement is measured each year using satisfaction surveys completed by visitors (more than 40 000 were surveyed in 2013 across all Group countries of operation). In France, the customer satisfaction score went from 8.2 to 8.52 between 2010 and 2013. Eventually, Klépierre intends to further enrich its approach with criteria that are more detailed and harmonized across Europe, and to analyze the satisfaction of its retail tenants.

ANN UAL R E POR T 53 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 RE S PON SI B L E APPR OAC H 2013 EFFICIENT CENTERS T he issue of energy performance remains firmly planted at the heart of the Group’s sustainable development strategy. The energy bill totals 38.6 million euros, which is between 15 and 30% of the operating budget of a shopping center. This percentage is expected to rise automatically in the years to come, given the volatility of energy prices and the gradual depletion of natural resources. For this reason, Klépierre has set an ambitious objective for 2020, that of improving its energy efficiency by 25% (in kWh/visit). And the Group is already advanced in its pursuit of this objective. Since 2009, it has in fact achieved savings of 8.3 million euros on a constant portfolio basis, by taking a number of different measures: closer management of consumption levels; investment in less energy-consuming technical equipment; and work to improve building quality, in particular when refurbishments are carried out. The successful pilot at the Louvain-la-Neuve shopping center (Belgium) – which saw its energy bill decrease by 42% after an innovative energy accounting system was installed, coupled with investments – demonstrates the value of efficient remote measurement systems.

Developments and extensions are BREEAM rated (with Very Good being the minimum), like Le Millénaire (which opened in 2011), Emporia (2012), and the Claye-Souilly (2012) and Bègles Rives d’Arcins (2013) extension-refurbishment projects. So far, 37 shopping centers (38% of the holdings in value terms) have received environmental certification (BREEAM or ISO 14001). In 2013, 5 facilities in France that together represent more than a quarter of the French holdings received the BREEAM In-Use Very Good rating (Val d’Europe, Noisy Arcades, PontaultCombault, Saint-Orens and Blagnac). The Group targets that, by 2015, half of its shopping center portfolio will be environmentally certified.

This extension-refurbishment project, which was conducted with the help of an ecologist throughout the process and rated BREEAM Very Good, led to the creation of 11 500 sq.m. of green spaces on this facility, located on the banks of the Garonne and the installation of 5 beehives. In order to better understand the issues surrounding biodiversity and to finetune its actions in this area, Klépierre asked a specialized consulting firm, Gaiadomo, to carry out a study of the impact of 40 of its top shopping centers on their surrounding ecosystems.

After a slight contraction in 2013 (-0.4%), activity in the Eurozone should grow by 1.0% in 2014, supported by moderate fiscal consolidation, an investment recovery and a decline in precautionary household savings. The economic outlook is expected to improve in every country where Klépierre operates. In Scandinavia, growth should reach 2.8% in Norway, 2.3% in Sweden and 1.6% in Denmark.

GDP growth will remain more measured in France (+1.0%) and Belgium (+1.1%) and will be weaker but positive in Southern Europe (Italy: +0.6%, Spain: +0.5% and Portugal: +0.4%). Overall, household spending will continue to show resilience, with positive figures in most countries (except Spain: -0.4% and Portugal: -0.5%).

CHANGE IN RETAILER SALES In 2013, retailer sales(2) in Klépierre’s shopping malls were flat (-0.1%) compared to 2012. On a like-for-like basis (excluding the impact of asset sales and the opening of new spaces), retail sales were slightly due to the currently lackluster consumption environment across Europe (-0.7%).

France-Belgium In France, retailer sales in Klépierre shopping malls outperformed national indices in 2013. For the year through November, national sales (source: French National Council of Shopping Centers) were down 1.5%, compared with -1.0% for retailers located in Klépierre shopping centers. Like-for-like change In France, sales by Klépierre tenants remained driven by regional shopping centers where sales increased by 1.3% compared with 2012. Val d’Europe (Greater Paris Area: +9.4%), Le Millénaire (Aubervilliers: +7.9%), Blagnac (Toulouse: +4.3%) and Odysseum (Montpellier: +3.3%) posted especially strong numbers. For the portfolio as a whole, sales decreased slightly for the full year (-1.4%), reflecting disappointing results in December (with adverse calendar effects). (1) OECD (November 2013).

ANNUAL REPOR T 74 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 B USI N E SS F OR T H E YE AR C HA N G E I N RETA I L ER SA L ES 1 The Personal Products segment – the main segment as measured by sales – continued to show resilience and even improved slightly in the second half of 2013 (-0.9% on a like-for-like stores basis, versus -1.4% for the first half of the year). In Belgium, retail sales at L’esplanade (Louvain-la-Neuve) decreased by 0.8%, mostly impacted by the household equipment segment. Excluding this segment, sales were up slightly (+0.4%). Change in current portfolio Asset sales – completed for the most part in 2012 (Bourges, Flins-sur-Seine, Lormont, Nîmes Étoile, Dijon Quétigny, Mulhouse Illzach, Rambouillet, Aulnoy-lez-Valenciennes, Beaune, Moulins and Guingamp) and 2013 (Lomme) – impacted the overall sales figures. In France, retail tenants sales were down by 2.6% compared with last year. 1.2.2. Scandinavia Like-for-like change In Sweden, sales were up by 1.7%. Performances were driven by Sollentuna (Greater Stockholm Area), Marieberg (Örebro) and Mirum Galleria (Norrköping) which rank among the most dynamic centers. In Norway (-1.2% for the full year), sales were negatively impacted for most of 2013 by the strategy of the major food operator ICA, which closed the ICA MAXI concept, and by several competitors that reopened after major extensions. Nevertheless, sales exceeded last year’s figures in both November (+3.3%) and in December (+1.2%). In Denmark, retail sales were virtually unchanged in 2013 (-0.4%) with Field’s reporting growth (+0.6%). It is the largest shopping center in terms of sales. Change in current portfolio In Sweden, the +17.2% sales performance was boosted by the contribution of Emporia (which opened in October 2012), the largest center in terms of retail sales. The center welcomed 6 million visitors in 2013. In Norway, retail sales were impacted by the disposal of 4 shopping centers in December (Halden Storsenter, Markedet, Stovner Senter, and Torvbyen). Vinterbro (Greater Oslo Area), for which an extension-refurbishment was completed in June, posted a strong increase in sales in December (+15.5%), and was up by 5.5% for the full year. 1.2.3. Italy Aggregate sales for the full year remained resilient (-0.5%). Retailer sales in Klépierre shopping centers significantly outperformed the national sales index (for the first eleven months of the year, sales by Klépierre retailers were unchanged at 0.0%, versus national sales down -2.1%(3)). After good performances in November (+2.3%), December turned negative (-4.2% due to a calendar effect: one less Saturday than last year). There was also a base effect in December as tenants were allowed to offer promotions last year but were no longer allowed to do so in 2013. 1.2.4. Iberia In Spain, where the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, tenant sales declined by 5.7% in 2013. La Gavia (Madrid) continues to outperform, with sales for the period up by 3.5%. In Portugal, shopping center sales also showed improvement after the first half of the year. Tenant sales increased by 2.0% in 2013 (versus -2.2% through June). Aqua Portimão (Algarve) once again showed the strongest gain in retail sales (+4.1%). 1.2.5. Central Europe In Poland, retail tenant sales fell slightly in 2013 (-0.9%), but recovered gradually during the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter (the change was -2.6% for the 6 months ended June). Overall, results remained globally impacted by Ruda which is facing a new competitor. Conversely, Lublin posted strong growth (+8.1%). In Hungary, the proactive approach to leasing in 2012 and 2013 led to a 10.9% increase in retail tenant sales this year. Sales rose by 17.2% at Corvin in Budapest (which opened in 2010). In the Czech Republic, thanks to the re-tenanting program rolled out at Nový Smíchov (the main contributor in terms of retail sales), retail tenant sales continued to grow throughout the year (+3.4% for the full year versus +3.0% for the first half of the year). Sales were also up in the country’s 3 shopping centers. (3) Source: ISTAT. ANN UAL R E POR T 75 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 BUS I N E SS F OR T H E YE AR REN TA L BU SI N ESS 1 1.3.

France Gross rents increased by 4.7% on a like-for-like basis, outperforming index-linked rent adjustments (+3.4%) thanks to the positive impact of renewals and relets signed in Q4 2012 and in 2013. This year, 258 leases were signed with an average reversion rate of +17.9%. This strong performance, delivered by refreshed and reorganized leasing teams, shows that retailers are interested in investing in Klépierre’s high-quality portfolio. On a current portfolio basis, the increase in gross rents reached 3.6%, impacted by disposals completed in 2012 (Aulnoy-lez-Valenciennes, Beaune, Moulins, Guingamp, La Roche-sur-Yon, Nîmes Étoile, Dijon Quétigny, Mulhouse Illzach, Rambouillet, Flins-sur-Seine, Bourges, Lormont) and 2013 (Lomme). Successful new developments and acquisitions contributed positively, as indicated below: Rives d’Arcins (Bordeaux, France) extension-refurbishment opened in May 2013. Since its opening, footfall has increased by more than 12% compared to the corresponding prior period before works. With 150 shops and an updated retail mix featuring Adidas Originals, Intimissimi (Calzedonia Group), Mango Touch, Hema and Terranova (for the first time in France), Rives d’Arcins has indeed refreshed the retail offer in the Greater Bordeaux Area and has naturally become the leading shopping destination in this dynamic city; ANN UAL R E POR T 77 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 BUS I N E SS F OR T H E YE AR REN TA L BU SI N ESS 1 the new Jaude center (Clermont-Ferrand, France) opened in November 2013. It features 54 additional shops and has introduced new brands to the region (Hollister, Mauboussin, Kiko, Hema, American Vintage, etc.). Jaude, which was already attracting 9.5 million visitors a year before the makeover, has succeeded its transformation, becoming the dominant shopping facility in Auvergne; St.Lazare Paris, the retail space at the Saint-Lazare train station, opened on March 30, 2012. 2013 was another year of tremendous success for this unique shopping center located in the very heart of Paris. In 2013, St.Lazare Paris continued to outperform and built on efforts to appeal to the best retailers. In Q3 and Q4, leases were signed with Moleskine, the upscale Italian notebook manufacturer, and Burger King, one of the most eagerly anticipated food brands for French consumers; Les Sentiers de Claye-Souilly (Greater Paris Area) extension-refurbishment opened on November 21, 2012. One year after its inauguration, it has proven to be a genuine success. Its strengthened retail offering and the deployment of new concepts from international retailers (H&M, Zara, Mango) have given the shopping center a larger footprint in its catchment area. Since it opened last year, footfall has increased by more than 20% compared to the corresponding period prior to the extension-refurbishment; the acquisition in November 29, 2013 of the remaining 50% stake in Odysseum (Montpellier), the leading retail destination for Montpellier opened in 2009. Belgium Gross rents for L’esplanade (Louvain-la-Neuve) rose by 3.8%, including 1.4% index-linked growth. This outperformance, reflecting L’esplanade’s power of attraction for both retailers and customers, is mainly due to active management of the shopping center and a changing retail mix. On September 28, for instance, the center welcomed a Superdry store, which posted the highest revenues in the country for the brand during its first days of operation. Leases signed since the beginning of the year include M.A.C – the Estée Lauder group’s high-end make-up brand – and Undiz – the Etam Group’s trendy lingerie brand. 1.3.1.2.

Norway Gross rents increased by 3.3% on a like-for-like basis, outperforming index-linked rent adjustments (+1.1%). In 2013, 360 lease renewals/changes were concluded, with a reversion rate of 3.9%. Leasing and reletting at the Gulskogen shopping center continued to translate into sound performances. On a current portfolio basis, gross rents were impacted: downward by the sale of a 50% stake in Nordbyen (Larvik) completed on February 1, 2013, by the disposal of a portfolio of 4 shopping centers on November 29, 2013 (Halden Storsenter, in Halden; Torvbyen, in Fredrikstad; Stovner Senter, in Oslo; and Markedet, in Haugesund) and by a significant negative forex effect; upward by the 7 600 sq.m. extension and refurbishment of the Vinterbro shopping center (Greater Oslo Area). With the opening of this extension in June 2013, Vinterbro’s GLA now totals 54 000 sq.m. and features 25 brand new shops. In addition, the shopping center’s 35 existing shops have rolled out new concepts, including Benetton, Burger King, Carlings and H&M. Sweden Gross rents rose by 1.6% on a like-for-like basis (including a 0.4% indexation effect). A strong leasing activity – 195 leases were signed in 2013 – and healthy fundamentals account for this success. Its strategic positioning in the most dynamic and flourishing cities allow Klépierre to capture the solid increase in consumption in this market (consumer spending up 2%(4) for the past three years). The change on a current portfolio basis (+26.0%) is mainly attributable to the contribution of Emporia, which opened on October 25, 2012 in Malmö and welcomed 6.5 million visitors in its first year of operation. One year after its opening, Emporia has already established itself as one of the most profitable shopping centers for retailers in Sweden. Denmark Gross rents rose by 6.5% on a like-for-like basis, reflecting the impact of new leasing operations at Field’s and index-linked rent adjustments (+1.9%). Leases signed include Helly Hansen – the Norwegian brand specialized in manufacturing gear for extreme sports and sailing – and StyleBox by Matas – the Danish cosmetics chain that offers an outstanding personal shopping experience.

Discrepancies in rents growth between the well-performing centers in the North and the Southern malls intensified in 2013. The change in gross rents on a current portfolio basis is mainly attributable to strategic vacancies in the Romagna Center to accommodate the completion of redevelopment work and several positive one-off items posted in 2012. 1.3.1.4.

In Spain, gross rents decreased by 3.9% on a like-for-like basis, reflecting a decline in retail sales and the generally challenging macro-economic environment. The challenges are nevertheless concentrated in 5 shopping centers. Excluding these assets, the decrease in like-for-like gross rents is limited to 1.5% (-1.0 €M), mainly driven by the resilient performances of the 2 largest shopping centers (La Gavia in Madrid and Meridiano in Tenerife). In Portugal, gross rents fell by 6.0%. In those markets, which are expected to slowly recover from 2014 (the GDP(5) growth forecast for Spain and Portugal in 2014 is +0.5% and +0.4%, respectively, after two years of contraction), Klépierre’s strategy is to focus on the most awaited international brands and expand their presence in the portfolio. For instance, Primark will soon begin fit-in work at Meridiano, where it plans to open a 4 000 sq.m. store in early 2014. 1.3.1.5.

DEVELOPMENT – DISPOSALS 1.4.1. The retail real estate investment market in 2013(6) In 2013, transactions in the retail real estate market in Continental Europe totaled 18.1 billion euros, an increase of 34% compared to 2012 due to a lack of large high quality projects being transacted. Shopping centers represent 67% of retail investment in Continental Europe. The retail investment market was dominated in 2013 by Germany, the Nordics and France. Germany, the Nordics and France once again captured the bulk of the capital flows targeting the European market in 2013, with 27%, 19% and 12% of the market respectively. Several major portfolio sales and large size unit assets sales have boosted the performance. The supply/demand gap persists for prime products. Prime yields have been globally unchanged over the last 6 months except for French assets, for which the decrease was 15 bps and for Spanish assets, for which yields rose by 25 bps. Pending deals in France (the Beaugrenelle shopping center in Paris, the proposed disposal of 127 Carrefour-anchored retail malls by Klépierre, etc.) could give a significant boost to the market. 1.4.2. Investments in 2013 In 2013, a total of 408.3 million euros was invested in shopping centers for strategic acquisitions and selected developments. With regard to investments, Klépierre continues to favor regions that enjoy strong purchasing power and a favorable demographic outlook for the years ahead. Acquisitions totaled 201.6 million euros in 2013 with 2 major transactions: acquisition of the remaining 50% stake in the Odysseum shopping center (Montpellier, France) on November 29, 2013. Opened in 2009, located just 15 minutes from Montpellier town center, and served by the city’s light rail network, this open air shopping center houses more than 120 stores over more than 50 000 sq.m. and has become the top first shopping destination in the Montpellier region in the past few years; acquisition of an additional 16.7% stake in IGC in Italy on December 5, 2013, bringing Klépierre’s share in this vehicle, which owns 9 centers, to 88%. This transaction has enabled Klépierre to increase its exposure to Italy’s most dynamic regions (Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna), which outperform Italian national indices in terms of both GDP per capita and demographic growth.

ANN UAL R E POR T 81 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 BUS I N E SS F OR T H E YE AR DE VE LOP M EN T – D I SP OSA L S 1 130.2 million euros were invested in recently developed shopping malls as well as in shopping center extension-refurbishments that opened in 2013. These centers largely met the demand of retailers and were almost fully let on opening. Rives d’Arcins (Greater Bordeaux Area, France) inaugurated on May 16, 2013. The extension and restructuring brought the total size of this regional center to 87 000 sq. m. The new 150 store-complex, which includes a large number of entirely new retailers to the region, has posted strong performances since it opened. Jaude (Clermont-Ferrand, France), inaugurated on November 13, 2013. This totally refurbished and extended shopping center has created quite a revolution for shoppers in Clermont-Ferrand’s city center. With a brand new, state-of-the-art design, the new Jaude center has introduced exclusive retailers to Clermont-Ferrand, bringing 54 new names to the city center. Vinterbro (Greater Oslo Area, Norway), inaugurated on June 13, 2013, now features 85 stores spread over more than 40 000 sq.m. The extension-refurbishment provided an opportunity to strengthen the center’s retail offering: 25 new stores have opened and 35 existing retail names have rolled out new concepts. Salanca (Perpignan, France), inaugurated on April 2, 2013. The existing shopping center has been transformed into a 40 000 sq.m. regional retail hub that features 65 stores. A total of 76.5 million euros was allocated to the Group’s development pipeline, mainly in France and Sweden (see section 1.4.3, “2014-2018 Development pipeline”). In addition, a total of 32.2 million euros was outlaid to buy back Klémurs’ minority shares during the first half of the year. 1.4.3. 2014-2018 development pipeline With the delivery of 4 successful extension-refurbishments and the launch of four new projects in 2013, Klépierre demonstrated once again in 2013, its ability to develop high-quality leading shopping centers that offer superior growth prospects: Val d’Europe (Paris region, France): in the interest of continuing Val d’Europe’s extraordinary success story, Klépierre has decided to launch an extension of the shopping mall and has already signed leases for certain units to some of the best-performing international best performing global retailers, such as Primark; Romagna Center (Rimini, Italy): located in Emilia-Romagna, one of the most dynamic Italian regions in terms of demographic growth (population forecast to grow by 20%(7) by 2040 versus 5% nationwide average), the extension program consists of the redevelopment of the existing shopping center, transforming it into a regional hub adapted to this city’s growth and appeal as a touristic destination; Galleria Boulevard (Kristianstad, Sweden): located close to the Danish border, in one of Sweden’s most attractive region, the Galleria Boulevard shopping center is being refurbished by Klépierre in phases. The redevelopment, which will be opened at the end of 2014 will complete this program and offer a brand new scheme unique to the city; Field’s (Copenhagen, Denmark): to remain the leader in the Copenhagen’s competitive market, Klépierre has launched an ambitious project to create a unique super jumbo for the Danish market. Besides a revamped shopping mall, the new complex will host several cinemas, a renewed food area and a cinema school. 99% of all investments are concentrated in France, Belgium, Northern Italy and Scandinavia: 57.3% of the committed and controlled projects are extension-refurbishment projects that enable the Group to capitalize on retail facilities that have demonstrated leadership in their respective catchment areas; 42.7% are greenfield projects that are part of large urban redevelopment programs supported by powerful transportation network plans, housing and office building projects. The Group’s global development pipeline has a value of 3.0 billion euros, which includes 0.4 billion euros worth of committed projects(8), 1.1 billion euros worth of controlled projects(9), and 1.5 billion euros worth of identified(10) projects. Expressed in group share terms, the respective amounts are 2.5 billion euros, 0.2 billion euros, 0.9 billion euros and 1.4 billion euros. For the period 2014-2018, the Group plans to invest 2.3 billion euros (total share), which breaks down as follows: 0.2 billion euros for committed projects, 0.8 billion euros for controlled projects, and 1.3 billion euros for identified projects.

In the years to come, the Group will continue to deliver the development projects included in this pipeline. The launch of controlled projects is subject to profitability, timing and pre-letting criteria. Supported by a high level of liquidity (1.9 billion euros on December 31, 2013), the Group will be able to strengthen its presence in targeted areas in Continental Europe, either by launching projects included in the pipeline or by seizing accretive acquisition opportunities. 1.4.4. Disposals completed in 2013 1.4.4.1. Assets sold since January 1, 2013 Klépierre’s strategy – re-affirmed two years ago – is to become a leading pure player in the European shopping center segment. Ambitious when it was announced at the beginning of 2012, Klépierre’s 1 billion euros disposal program to refine its portfolio has turned out to be a great success. The 1 billion euros target was largely exceeded (1 236 million euros of assets disposed as of 12/31/2013) and the asset by asset approach strategy resulted in average disposal yields of 5.8% in 2012 and 5.2% in 2013. Klépierre completed 11 asset sales in 2013, totaling 538.4 million euros (excluding duties, total share).

Assets in the process to be sold as of January 2014 Klépierre signed a memorandum of understanding with Carrefour and a consortium of investors for the disposal of a 2 billion euros portfolio of retail galleries. This portfolio consists of 127 small to medium-sized retail galleries initially acquired from Carrefour in 2000-2001. Their disposal would significantly tilt the balance in Klépierre’s shopping center portfolio toward Klépierre’s key strategic regions and leading shopping centers. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2014. On January 20, 2014, Klépierre completed the sale of a 50% stake in Le Millénaire offices (17 063 sq.m.). In addition, a sale and purchase promissory agreement was signed for an office building located in Paris (Javel) in December 2013 and was sold on February 11, 2014. 1.5.

Net rents for the year came to 892.8 million euros, an increase of 1.0% compared with the year ended December 31, 2012. Management and administrative income (fees) from service businesses totaled 78.2 million euros, down by 12.1 million euros, mainly attributable to the delivery of large projects in the Group’s development pipeline. Other operating income primarily includes gains on work reinvoiced to tenants and various indemnities. Rntal and real eastate expenses for the year came to 116.4 million euros, an increase of 8.1 million euros (+7.5%) reflecting the impact of recent openings and an increase in doubtful debtors. Depreciation and impairment allowance on property was 392.8 million euros for the year, an increase of 18.2 million euros compared with 2012. This variation includes an 80.1 million euros asset impairment allowance, an increase of 7.1 million euros. The 3.7% rise in amortization allowance reflects the development of the property portfolio. Depreciation and impairment allowance on intangible assets and equipment came to 11.3 million euros, compared to 10.9 million euros for the previous year. Provisions for the year came to -1.1 million euros, versus 0.3 million euros for 2012. Net proceeds from the sale of assets reached 173.4 million euros for the year, compared with 204.8 million euros for the previous year. This item includes the capital gain on the disposals of offices in the Paris area, the Lomme shopping mall in France, 50% of Nordbyen and 4 other Norwegian shopping centers. Operating income, 587.2 million euros for the period, down by 8.4% compared with December 31, 2012. The net cost of debt amounted to 326.7 million euros (+2.8%). The increase in financial expenses is attributable in particular to the reduction in capitalized costs in connection with recent openings and changes in the status of development projects. The average cost of debt – the ratio of interest expense to average financing – decreased to below 3.5% at year-end 2013. The change in the fair value of financial instruments was -94.2 million euros for the year ended December 31, 2013, versus -41.6 million euros on December 31, 2012. This major difference comes from the reclassification from cash flow hedge to fair value of 1.3 billion euros worth of swaps in connection with the expected net proceeds of the contemplated transaction with Carrefour. Klépierre’s financial policy and structure are described in more detail in paragraph 1.9. Tax expense was 31.0 million euros, compared to 21.7 million euros for the year ended December 31, 2012: tax payable was 31.3 million euros, versus 26.8 million euros for the preceding period including the impact of the 3% dividend tax in France; deferred taxes amounted to a credit of 0.3 million euros, versus 5.1 million euros in 2012. Consolidated net income was 137.0 million euros, down by 47.7% compared with December 31, 2012. Minority share of net income (non-controlling interests) for the period was 83.5 million euros, mainly from the shopping center segment, bringing group share of net income to 53.6 million euros, a decrease of 67.8%.

This decrease is mainly attributable to the following items: the decrease in operating revenue in line with the decrease in rental income following the disposal of offices premises completed during the period (Collines de l’Arche, Séreinis and Equilis in 2012; 21 La Pérouse/21 Kléber Paris, 192 Charles-de-Gaulle Neuilly-sur-Seine and 7 Meyerbeer Paris in 2013). These disposals explain the increase in non-recurring income for the year ended December 31, 2013; the decrease in income from subsidiaries, mainly due to the effect of the non-recurring income from Klécar in 2012. As a reminder, last year Klécar income included capital gains on the disposal of several shopping centers; the decrease in net financial income due to the changes in dividends received from subsidiaries (mainly Klécar and Klémurs) and the impact of provision for swap unwinding. The mandatory distribution is 174.6 million euros after discharging the obligation relative to capital gain on assets sales. The Supervisory Board will recommend that the shareholders present or represented at the shareholders meeting on April 10, 2014 approve the payment of a cash dividend in respect of fiscal year 2013 of 1.55 euros per share, versus 1.50 euros per share in respect of fiscal year 2012 (+3.3%), reflecting a payout ratio of 77% of the group share of net current cash flow.

Total share, shopping centers accounted for 95.6% of the portfolio, retail properties for 3.6%, and office properties for 0.8%. On a group share basis, these percentages are respectively for 94.4%, 4.5%, and 1.0%. In accordance with IAS 40, the Group’s committed development projects are taken into account at fair value using appraisals established by in-house teams. In particular, the following projects have been assessed at fair value: Jaude in Clermont-Ferrand (France) and Besançon Pasteur (France). Projects that are not appraised are carried at their cost price. These are mainly Scandinavian projects, in particular Kristianstad (Sweden) and Viva in Odense (Denmark). Projects under development represent 3.7% of the Group’s property portfolio. For the year-end valuations, the agreed price was used for all Carrefour-anchored retail malls included in the Projected Transaction(11). On a constant portfolio and exchange rate basis, the change in the valuation of assets – excluding transfer duties – over 6 months is +0.4% (+54 million euros) for the shopping center segment and -0.6% for the retail segment. Over 12 months, the change is -0.1% (-19 million euros) for shopping centers and -0.5% for retail properties. (11) The proposed transaction refers to the proposed disposal of 127 Carrefour-anchored retail galleries to a consortium of investors announced in December 2013 (cf. Klépierre press release dated December 16, 2013).

Over 12 months, the portfolio total share decreased in value by 259 million euros (-1.7%). The change on a current portfolio basis includes the forex effect related to the depreciation of Scandinavian currencies since December 31, 2012 against the euro (for -257 million euros total share and -144 million euros group share). This forex impact translates into a decrease in the amount of debt contracted in Scandinavian currencies when converted in euros. External growth added 312 million euros to the increase in the value of this portfolio over 12 months on a current basis. Most of the increase is attributable to developments and openings in France (+214 €M) and in Scandinavia (+98 €M). Significant changes are listed below: in France, the acquisition of a 50% interest in Montpellier Odysseum in December 2013, the acquisition of Monoprix in Le Havre and the impact of the opening of Jaude (Clermont-Ferrand) in November 2013; in Sweden, the first external appraisal of Emporia (Malmö), which was completed by in-house teams in December 2012. This change was partly offset by the impact of the disposal program (-296 €M) in France with Lomme in March of 2013, and in Norway with 50% of Nordbyen in February 2013 and the disposal of 4 assets in December 2013 (Halden, Torvbyen, Stovner, Markedet). Group share, the average yield rate of the portfolio is at 6.2%, excluding duties, a decrease of 4 bps compared with June 30, 2013 and an increase of 3 bps compared with December 31, 2012.

On a constant portfolio basis, the change in the value of the retail assets is -0.6% over 6 months (-0.5% over 12 months). The change in group share on a current portfolio basis over 12 months (+14.5%) is due to the acquisition of the minority interests (15.9%) in March of 2013. The average yield rate of the retail assets is 6.9% excluding duties, a decrease of 10 bps compared with June 30, 2013 and down by 13 bps compared with December 31, 2012.

EPRA PERFORMANCE INDICATORS The following performance indicators have been prepared in accordance with best practices as defined by EPRA (European Public Real estate Association) in its Best Practices Recommendations guide, available on EPRA’s website (www.epra.com). 1.8.1.

EPRA NAV EPRA NAV is a measure of the fair value of net assets assuming a normal investment property company business model. Accordingly, there is an assumption of owning and operating investment property for the long term. For this reason, deferred taxes on property revaluations and the fair value of deferred tax liabilities are excluded as the investment property is not expected to be sold and the tax liability is not expected to materialize.

EPRA NNNAV EPRA NNNAV (Triple Net Asset Value) is similar to EPRA NAV except it includes the fair value of deferred tax liabilities, debt, and financial instruments.

EPRA Net Initial Yield and EPRA “Topped-up” Net Initial Yield EPRA NIY (Net Initial Yield) is calculated as the annualized rental income based on the cash rents passing at the balance sheet date (but adjusted as set out below), less non-recoverable property operating expenses, divided by the gross market value of the property. EPRA “Topped-up” NIY is calculated by making an adjustment to EPRA NIY in respect of the expiration of rent free periods (or other unexpired lease incentives such as discounted rent free periods and step rents). 2013 2012 Shopping centers Retail assets Shopping centers Retail assets Klépierre yields 6.2% 6.9% 6.2% 7.1% Effect of vacant units -0.4% 0.0% -0.3% 0.0% Effect of EPRA adjustments on rents 0.2% -0.3% 0.2% -0.1% Effect of estimated transfer taxes and transaction costs -0.2% 0.0% -0.2% -0.4% EPRA “TOPPED-UP” NET INITIAL YIELD 5.8% 6.6% 5.9% 6.6% Effect of lease incentives -0.2% 0.0% -0.1% 0.0% EPRA NET INITIAL YIELD 5.6% 6.6% 5.7% 6.6% 1.8.5. EPRA Vacancy Rate The EPRA Vacancy rate is calculated by dividing the market rents of vacant spaces by the market rents of the total space of the whole property portfolio (including vacant spaces). The vacancy rate is calculated for the shopping center portfolio as of December 31, 2013.

ANN UAL R E POR T 91 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 BUS I N E SS F OR T H E YE AR FI N A N C I A L P OL I C Y 1 Reconciliation with Klépierre “Financial occupancy rate” The financial occupancy rate published by Klépierre is the ratio of annual contractual rents occupied to total contractual rents occupied plus target rents for all vacant spaces (the latter are estimated on the basis of internal budget data). Klépierre measures these rates by using the notion of minimum guaranteed rent (MGR) for occupied properties and not the market rents used by the EPRA to calculate EPRA Vacancy rate. France-Belgium Scandinavia Italy Iberia Central Europe Total(1) Financial occupancy rate 97.8% 97.0% 98.3% 89.9% 95.3% 96.5% Implied vacancy rate 2.2% 3.0% 1.7% 10.1% 4.7% 3.5% The 2 approaches are resulting in vacancy rates that are in line for all regions and on a total portfolio basis. Klepierre approach is slightly more conservative than the EPRA approach. 1.8.6. EPRA Cost Ratio The purpose of the EPRA cost ratio is to reflect the relevant overhead and operating costs of the business. It is calculated by expressing the sum of property expenses (net of service charge recoveries and third-party asset management fees) and administration expenses (excluding exceptional items) as a percentage of gross rental income. 12/31/2013 12/31/2012 (i) Administrative/operating expense line per IFRS income statement -237 -223 (ii) Net service charge costs/fees -43 -44 (iii) Management fees less actual/estimated profit element 78 90 (iv) Other operating income/recharges intended to cover overhead expenses less any related profit 19 14 (v) Share of Joint Ventures Expenses 0 – Exclude (if part of the above): (vi) Invesment Property depreciation – – (vii) Ground rents costs – – (viiI) Service charge costs recovered through rents but not separately invoiced – – EPRA Costs (including vacancy costs) (A) -182 -163 (iX) Direct vacancy costs 18 21 EPRA Costs (excluding vacancy costs) (B) -165 -142 (x) Gross Rental Income less ground rents per IFRS 1 001 985 (xi) Less: service fee/cost component of Gross Rental Income – – (xii) Add: share of Joint ventures (Gross Rental Income less ground rents) 2 – Gross Rental Income (C) 1 003 985 EPRA Cost Ratio (including direct vacancy costs) (A/C) 18.2% 16.6% EPRA Cost Ratio (excluding direct vacancy costs) (B/C) 16.4% 14.5% The increase in the 2013 EPRA cost ratio vs. 2012 is partly attributable to non-recurring restructuring costs. Excluding these, the EPRA cost ratio would be 17.4% and 15.6% excluding vacancy costs. The additional negative impact mainly reflects the decrease in development fees, which were high in 2012 due to the delivery of significant projects. 1.9. FINANCIAL POLICY 1.9.1. Financial resources 1.9.1.1. Change in net debt Consolidated net debt stood at 7 191 million euros on December 31, 2013, compared to 7 353 million euros on December 31, 2012 (-162 million euros). The main financing needs during the year are related to: the 2012 dividend payment made in cash (293 million euros) in April and distributions to other minorities (110 million euros); 440 million euros worth of investments during 2013, including the buy-back of Klémurs’ minority shares (32.2 million euros), and the acquisition of the remaining 50% stake in Odysseum and of an additional 17% of IGC minority shares, for a total consideration of 180 million. ANNUAL REPOR T 92 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 B USI N E SS F OR T H E YE AR F I N A N C I A L P OL I C Y 1 These expenditures were more than offset by disposals (538.4 million euros) and free cash flow for the year. The forex effect on net debt was -159 million euros, due to the depreciation of Scandinavian currencies against the euro in 2013. 1.9.1.2. Available resources At year-end 2013, the Group’s level of liquidity remains high at 1.9 billion euros, a total that includes 1.6 billion euros in unused committed credit lines. The quality of liquidity improved in 2013, thanks to the replacement of former bilateral revolving credit facilities with 1 050 million euros in new lines granted by several banks for a longer duration. In Scandinavia, the Group confirmed its footprint in the Norwegian bond market by issuing 690 million NOK in new bonds (average maturity over 3.5 years) either on a secured or on an unsecured basis. As of December 31, 2013: the average remaining maturity of available credit lines is 3.5 years (versus 3 years at year-end 2012); the banking pool has been enlarged to 11 new banks and BNP Paribas now represents less than 22% of all authorized financing; the average duration on the Group’s debt remains high (4.9 years). In January 2014, Klépierre signed a term sheet for a 200 million euros revolving credit facility. Including this new financing the level of liquidity of the Group is over 2.0 billion euros. This strong liquidity position is expected to be reinforced by the proceeds from the Projected Transaction(14) (1.5 billion euros net proceeds). A significant portion of these funds is expected to be used to early repay most of the debt falling due in 2014 and 2015. Taking all these items into consideration, the Group more than covers all its financings needs over the next 2 fiscal years.

Proforma the Projected Transaction with Carrefour, the percentage of capital market resources will reach 66%, since most of the proceeds from the sale will be used to repay banking facilities. (14) The Projected Transaction refers to the proposed disposal of 127 Carrefour-anchored retail galleries to a consortium of investors announced in December 2013 (cf. Klépierre press release dated December 16, 2013). ANN UAL R E POR T 93 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 BUS I N E SS F OR T H E YE AR FI N A N C I A L P OL I C Y 1 1.9.2. Interest rate hedging The Group’s hedging position was adjusted during 2013 to take into account both the issuance of new fixed-rate notes in 2012 and the completion of the disposal program. Klépierre unwound 700 million euros of medium-term payer swaps, benefiting from occasional sharp spikes in euro swap rates since the beginning of the period. At year end, the hedging ratio reached 69% at the Group level and the average duration of the fixedrate position (3.8 years) remains compliant with the balance-sheet structure. Subsequently to the Projected Transaction with Carrefour, Klépierre intends to restructure its interest-rate hedging portfolio in euros by replacing part of its fixed payer swaps portfolio with caps while maintaining its target of 70% fixed at all times. The swaps related to the floating rate debt repaid (€1.3 Bn) due to the transaction will be terminated. Based on the financing and hedging structure at year-end 2013, the Group’s annual cash cost at risk is 9 million euros, i.e. the loss due to shortterm interest rates moves would be less than 9 million euros 99% of the time. 1.9.3. Cost of debt The average cost of debt over the period continued to fall, reaching 3.5%. This figure reflects the low level of short-term interest rates, the adjustment of the hedging ratio, and the impact of the most recent refinancing operations, which were carried out at a significantly lower cost. The low cost of debt in 2013 led to an improvement in the Interest Coverage Ratio to 3 x. Post the Projected Transaction with Carrefour, the cost of debt is expected to decrease by 30 bps thanks to the ongoing restructuring of the interest rate hedging portfolio. In the meantime, ICR is expected to improve to 3.5 times.

Financial ratios and rating As of December 31, 2013, the Group’s financing covenants remain in line with the commitments agreed to under its financing agreements.

RISKS RELATED TO KLEPIERRE STRATEGY AND ACTIVITIES 3.1.1. Risks related to the economic environment Since the majority of the Klépierre real estate asset portfolio comprises shopping centers, changes in the key macroeconomic indicators of the countries in which the Group operates are likely to impact its lease income and real estate portfolio value, as well as shape its investment and new asset development policy, and therefore its growth prospects. The key factors likely to affect Klépierre’s business are as follows: t he economic environment is likely to encourage or depress demand for new retail space and therefore affect the growth prospects of Klépierre’s shopping center portfolio (in terms of construction of new centers, extension of existing centers and acquisition or disposal transactions). It may also have a long-term impact on occupancy rates and the ability of tenants to pay their rent; a downward trend or slower growth in the indices against which most rents payable under Klépierre leases are indexed may also compromise Klépierre lease income, as could any change in the indices used for this purpose. The overall impact on all the leases in the Klépierre portfolio could be reduced by the fact that indexation is country specific (usually against national inflation indices or, in the case of France, indices specific to commercial leases); the ability of Klépierre to increase rents – or even to maintain them at current levels – depends, at the point of lease renewal, principally on its tenants’ current and forecast revenue levels, which in turn depend in part on the state of the economy. Tenants’ revenue trends also impact on the variable element of rents; any prolonged worsening of economic conditions could also result in an increase in unlet units in Klépierre centers, which would have a negative effect on Group lease income and operating income as a direct result of the loss of lease income and the increase in non-billable expenses where vacant premises require repairs and renewals before they can be re-let. These costs cannot be passed on to tenants; the profitability of Klépierre’s real estate letting activities depends on the solvency of its tenants. In particular, during periods of difficulty in the economy, tenants may delay payment of rent, fail to pay rent at all, or encounter financial problems that would cause Klépierre to review tenancy conditions downwards. 3.1.2. Risks related to the real estate market Klépierre may not always execute its investments and divestments at the most opportune time because of the cyclical nature of the real estate sector. In overall terms, a downturn in the commercial real estate market (particularly shopping centers, but also offices to a lesser degree) could have a negative effect on the Company’s investment policy and disposal policy, as well as on the development of new assets, the value of its asset portfolio, the conduct of its business, its financial position, its operating income and its future prospects. More specifically, a downturn in the real estate market could have a significant negative effect on the conditions applying to Klépierre funding, and therefore on the business itself. In particular: t he Company plans to cover part of its funding needs by selling existing real estate assets. In unfavorable market conditions, these assets could take longer to sell and achieve lower prices than would otherwise be the case, which could limit the flexibility of Klépierre in the way it implements its development strategy; the Company is bound by certain covenants related to asset values contained in the loan agreements signed by Klépierre and its subsidiary companies. Unfavorable market conditions could reduce the value of Group assets, making it more difficult for the Company to comply with the financial ratios fixed under loan agreements. If Klépierre were to find itself unable to maintain these ratios, it could be obliged to sell assets or raise funds by issuing equity securities in order to repay the debt or ask lenders to amend certain loan agreement provisions. At December 31, 2013, the loan-to-value ratio referred to in the loan agreements stood at 43.9%, giving the group substantial room for manoeuvre given the maximum limit of 60%. Assuming the level of debt remains the same, the value of the portfolio would have to decline by more than 27% to reach the limit set in the loan agreements. By way of illustration, note that in 2013 the independent experts who valued Klépierre’s real estate assets were of the opinion that the yields used for these appraisals should be increased slightly, given the downturn in certain markets in which the Group is present. Accordingly, the value of Klépierre’s holdings decreased by 0.4% over one year, with the positive impact of 0.6 points from income growth offset by a negative impact of 1 point from higher yields. At December 31, 2013, an increase of 1% in the value of its real estate assets would trigger an improvement of 0.4 points in this ratio, all other factors remaining unchanged. A sustained downturn in economic conditions and the effects of this in the rental market could have an adverse impact on Klépierre’s business activities, its earnings, the value of its assets, and its investment and development policy. 3.1.3. Risks related to the departure or closure of flagship chains The Group’s shopping centers are often supported by one or more flagship chains with high levels of customer appeal. A decline in the attractiveness of such chains, any slowdown or cessation in their businesses (particularly as a result of an unusually depressed economy), any failure to renew their leases, any termination of their leases and any delay in re-letting the vacated premises could result in a decline in attractiveness of the shopping centers concerned. The resulting decline in footfall could trigger lower sales volumes for other stores, which would thus have a significant negative effect on the total rental income from certain centers, and the financial position and growth prospects of the Group.

Risks related to the development of new real estate assets Klépierre is involved in real estate development on its own account. This business poses the following significant risks: the cost of construction may turn out to be higher than initially estimated: the construction phase may take longer than expected, technical difficulties or completion delays may be encountered due to the complexity of some projects and the price of construction materials may change adversely; Klépierre’s investments (in new projects, renovations and extensions) are subject to obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals, which may be granted to Klépierre and/or its partners later than anticipated or even refused; Klépierre may require the consent of third parties, such as flagship chains, lenders or the associates involved in partnership developments, and these consents may not be given; Klépierre may fail to obtain satisfactory funding for these projects; up-front costs (such as the costs of feasibility studies) cannot normally be deferred or canceled in the event of projects being delayed or abandoned; The real estate development and investment risks referred to may then result in investment projects being delayed, canceled or completed at a cost above that initially estimated in the budgets prepared by Klépierre, which could in turn affect the Group’s financial results. 3.1.5. Risks related to lease renewals and the letting of real estate assets When existing leases expire, Klépierre could find itself in the position of being unable to let or re-let vacant units within an acceptable period and/ or under conditions as favorable as those offered by its current leases. The Company may not be able to attract sufficient tenants or high-profile retail chains into its shopping centers, and may not be successful in maintaining occupancy rates and lease income at satisfactory levels, which could have an unfavorable effect on Klépierre revenue, operating income and profitability (see Business of the year, section 1.3 Rental business). 3.1.6. Risks related to the marketing of developments Klépierre meets the cost of marketing the shopping centers developed by the Company and other real estate assets it acquires, and therefore bears the risk of any marketing failures. Klépierre may encounter difficulties in securing retail chain tenants that are both attractive to consumers and prepared to accept the level and structure of rents that the Company offers. The retail real estate sector in which Klépierre operates is a rapidly-changing business environment in which change is driven by customer demand. The possibility cannot be ignored that at some future time Klépierre may not be able to let its centers with a portfolio of retailers sufficiently attractive to ensure high occupancy rates and the opportunity to achieve high rental yields. This could in turn affect Klépierre’s business volumes and operating income. 3.1.7. Risks related to the competitive environment The Company’s rental activities operate in a highly competitive market. Competition may arise as a result of current or future developments in the same market segment, other shopping centers, mail order, hard discount stores, e-commerce or the attraction exerted by certain retail chains located in competitor centers. More particularly, the development by competitors of new shopping centers located close to existing Klépierre centers and renovations or extensions to competitor shopping centers may impact unfavorably the Company’s ability to let its retail premises, and therefore on the rent levels it can charge and its forecast financial results. As part of its business, the Company competes with many other players, some of which may have greater financial resources and larger portfolios. Having the financial leverage and ability to undertake large-scale development projects from their own resources gives the larger market players the opportunity to bid for development projects or asset acquisitions offering high profitability potential at prices that do not necessarily meet the investment criteria and acquisition objectives set by Klépierre, which may raise uncertainty on the Company’s business forecasts. 3.1.8. Risks related to the estimation of asset values At December 31 and June 30 every year, Klépierre calculates its revalued net assets per share. The measurement method used is as follows: calculation of the unrealized capital gains (or losses) held in the Klépierre portfolio arising as a result of the difference between the independently-appraised market value and the net book value shown in the consolidated financial statements, and adding these to (or deducting them from) consolidated balance sheet equity. The independently-appraised market value depends on the relationship between supply and demand in the market, interest rates, the economic environment and many other factors likely to vary significantly in the event of poor shopping center performance and/or a downturn in the economy. The IFRS book value of the Company’s portfolio is based on the historical cost method. It is not immediately adjusted to reflect fluctuations in market value, and cannot therefore reflect the effective realizable value of the holdings. The appraised value of its assets may not therefore reflect their realizable value in the event of disposal, which could have a negative impact on the Group’s financial position and operating results. The form and frequency of the expert appraisals conducted are detailed in Business of the year (1.8 Net asset value); the valuation method is described in Note 11.1, (Disclosures about the fair value model) of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. The value of the Company’s real estate assets is sensitive to the main appraiser assumptions (detailed in Note 11.1 (Disclosures about the fair value model) of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Risks related to the international business profile of Klépierre Klépierre owns and operates shopping centers in 13 Continental European countries. Some of these countries may have risk profiles higher than those of the Company’s major markets (France, Scandinavia, Italy). The economic and political context of these countries may be less stable, their regulatory frameworks and entry barriers may be less favorable and business may be conducted in more volatile local currencies. The risks posed by individual countries, combined with a failure to manage those risks effectively, may have a negative impact on the operating income and financial position of Klépierre. The distribution of the Group’s business and performance by country are detailed in Business of the year (1.3 Rental business). 3.1.10. Risks related to partners’ agreements Klépierre owns a significant proportion of its shopping centers* in France, Spain and, to a lesser degree, Italy and Greece, under the terms of a series of partnership agreements signed with CNP Assurances and Écureuil Vie. These partnership agreements provide the usual protections for minority partners: pre-emption right, joint exit right and the decision-making process applying to investment or divestment. The principal clauses of the partnership agreement are shown in Note 9.3. of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. If the minority partners were to exercise their exit rights, and Klépierre was not willing to acquire their stake, with the result that those minority partners sell their investments to a third party at a price below that of the revalued net asset value of the underlying assets, Klépierre would then be obliged to compensate them for any shortfall (which could go up to 20% of the revalued net asset value of the underlying assets). In the event of a significant shortfall, the obligation to make the corresponding payments in compensation could have a negative impact on Klépierre liquidity, and could require the Company to defer or cancel other investments. 3.1.11. Acquisition risks The acquisition of real estate assets or companies owning such assets is part of the Klépierre growth strategy. This policy poses the following significant risks: Klépierre could overestimate the expected yield from these assets, and therefore acquire them at too high a price compared with the funding put in place to facilitate such acquisitions, or be unable to acquire them under satisfactory conditions, especially where the acquisitions are made via a tender offer or in a period of significant economic volatility or uncertainty. The comprehensive due diligence conducted with the assistance of specialist external consultants prior to any acquisition aims to minimize these risks; where an acquisition is financed by the disposal of other assets, market conditions or unfavorable deadlines, this could delay or compromise the ability of Klépierre to complete the acquisition; the assets acquired could contain hidden defects, such as subletting, violations by tenants of applicable regulations (and particularly environmental regulations) or a failure to comply with the construction plans which would not be covered by the guarantees contained in the sale and purchase agreement. The due diligence process referred to above is also beneficial in this respect; Klépierre could also encounter difficulties in incorporating a new acquisition as a result of its impact on the Company’s internal organizational structure (IT, human resources). However, the possible impacts of any acquisition on these aspects are systematically evaluated as part of the acquisition decision-making process whenever necessary. 3.2. RISKS RELATED TO KLEPIERRE’S FINANCING POLICY AND FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES The exposure of Klépierre to the range of financial risks and the policy it applies to manage and hedge against those risks are described in greater detail in Note 8 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, and in the report of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. 3.2.1. Liquidity risks Klépierre’s strategy depends on its ability to raise financial resources in the form of loans or equity for the purpose of funding its investments and acquisitions and refinancing maturing debts. Klépierre is committed to distributing a significant proportion of its profits to its shareholders in order to qualify for SIIC status. It therefore relies significantly on debt to fund its growth. This method of funding may not be available under advantageous conditions. This situation could arise in the event of a crisis in capital markets or debt markets, the occurrence of events impacting on the real estate sector, a reduction in the rating of Klépierre debt, restrictions imposed by covenants included as part of loan contracts, or any other change to the business, financial position or shareholding profile of Klépierre capable of influencing the perception that investors or lenders have of its creditworthiness or the attractiveness of investing in the Group. Klépierre is also exposed to the general risks associated with all types of borrowing, and particularly the risk of operating cash flows falling to a level at which the debt could not be serviced. If such a shortfall were to occur, the result could be an acceleration or early repayment and the calling in of any security given, with the possibility of the assets concerned being seized. The Group’s debt maturity schedule and the management of liquidity risk are treated in further detail in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Notes 5.15 and 8). ANNUAL REPOR T 112 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 R I SK FAC TOR S RIS K S RE L ATED TO KLE PI ERRE’ S F I N A N C I N G P OL I C Y A N D F I N A N C I A L AC T I VI T I ES 3 Risks related to the covenants and other commitments contained in certain loan agreements In addition to the usual covenants and commitments, the loan agreements entered into by Klépierre also contain covenants obliging the Company to comply with specific financial ratios, as detailed in Business over the year (section 1.10 Financial policy). If Klépierre were to default on one of its financial commitments and be unable to remedy that failure within the time allowed in the loan agreement, the lenders could demand early repayment of the loan or seize the assets concerned where the loan is secured. Some loan agreements also contain cross default clauses allowing lenders to demand early repayment of outstanding amounts in the event that Klépierre fails to meet the commitments contained in other loan agreements (unless any shortcoming is regularized within the period allowed). Consequently, any failure to meet its financial commitments could have a negative impact on the financial position of Klépierre, its earnings, its flexibility in conducting its business and pursuing growth (for example, by impeding or preventing certain acquisitions), its ability to meet its obligations, and its share price. Risks related to any downgrading of the Klépierre debt rating Klépierre’s existing debt rating is periodically reviewed by the rating agency Standard & Poor’s. At the time this report was prepared, its long-term debt was rated “BBB+, on credit watch with positive implications” and its short-term debt as “A-2, stable outlook”. These ratings reflect the ability of Klépierre to repay its debts, as well as its liquidity, key financial ratios, operational profile and general financial position, and other factors considered as being significant in respect of the Company’s business sector and the economic outlook. Any downgrading of the Klépierre debt rating could impact negatively the ability of the Group to fund its acquisitions or develop its projects under acceptable conditions and could also increase the cost of refinancing its existing loans. Any increase in interest charges would compromise Klépierre operating income and the yield of development projects. If funding were not to be available under satisfactory conditions, the ability of Klépierre to grow its business through acquisition and development would be reduced. 3.2.2. Rate risk Klépierre is exposed to the general risks associated with all types of borrowing, and particularly the risk of operating cash flows falling to a level at which the debt could not be serviced. If such a shortfall were to occur, the result could be a faster rate of repayment or early repayment and the calling in of any security, with the possibility of the assets concerned being seized. Klépierre’s significant debt also exposes it to risks due to interest rate variations: the interest charges paid by Klépierre on its variablerate borrowings could therefore rise significantly; a significant rise in interest rates would impact negatively on the value of the Company’s holdings inasmuch as the yield rates applied by real estate appraisers to the rentals of commercial buildings are determined partly on the basis of interest rates; Klépierre uses derivative instruments such as swaps to hedge against interest rate risks which enable it to pay a fixed or variable rate, respectively, on a variable or fixed rate debt. Developing an interest rate risk management strategy is a complex task, and no strategy can protect the Company fully against the risk posed by interest rate fluctuations. The valuation of derivatives also varies depending on interest rate levels, is reflected in the Klépierre balance sheet, and may also impact on its income statement if hedging relationships are not sufficiently justified by documentation or if the existing hedges are only partly efficient. The use made by Klépierre of interest rate hedge contracts could expose the Company to additional risks, and particularly the risk of failure of the counterparties to such contracts, which could in turn result in payment delays or defaults that would impact negatively on the results of Klépierre. Quantified illustrations of the effects of interest rate fluctuations before and after hedging are given in Note 8.1 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. 3.2.3. Currency risk Klépierre conducts business activities in certain countries that have not joined the Eurozone (currently Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Norway, Poland and Sweden). In these countries, Klépierre’s exposure to exchange rate risks derives from the following elements: local currencies could depreciate between the invoicing of rents in euros and the payment of the aforesaid rents by the tenants, which would create exchange rate losses for Klépierre. Moreover, some leases are not invoiced in euros, but in dollars (Central Europe) or in local currencies (particularly in Scandinavia), which creates an additional risk related to the rent amount effectively recovered in euros; fluctuations in local currencies also impact on the level at which local financial statements are translated into euros and integrated into Klépierre’s consolidated financial statements; since a proportion of subsidiary Company expenses are denominated in the local currency, although their income (fees) are denominated in euros, any appreciation in the local currency may reduce operating profit; since rent bills are usually denominated in euros (apart from Scandinavia) tenants may have difficulty in paying their rent if their local currency depreciates significantly. Any resulting deterioration in their solvency could have a negative impact on Klépierre lease income. For details of the measures taken by the Group to reduce currency risks, please refer to Note 8.3 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Counterparty risk When Klépierre uses derivatives, such as swaps, to hedge a financial risk, its counterparty may be liable to Klépierre for certain payments throughout the term of the instrument. Insolvency of said counterparty may lead to delay or default in such payments, which would have an adverse impact on Klépierre’s results. Klépierre has also received confirmed financing commitments from banks in the form of revolving credit facilities. Accordingly, the company is exposed to counterparty risk, since the inability of the relevant banks to honor their commitments may prevent the group from honoring its own financial commitments. Klépierre is also exposed to counterparty risks in respect of its short-term investments; since these investments are made for reduced amounts, in simple forms and for a short term, this risk is, however, barely significant on the Group scale. The risk monitoring policy and control system implemented by Klépierre are presented in Note 8.4 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. 3.3. LEGAL, TAX AND REGULATORY RISKS 3.3.1. Risks related to applicable regulations As an owner and manager of real estate assets, Klépierre must comply with the regulations in force in all of its operating countries. These rules apply to several fields, including corporate law, health and safety, environment, building construction, commercial licenses, leases and urban planning. Changes in the regulatory framework may require Klépierre to make changes to its business, assets or strategy. Klépierre may also suffer financially should one or more tenants in one of its shopping centers fail to comply with the applicable standards. This may take the form of a loss of rent following a store closure or a loss of marketability of the asset. The regulatory risks described in this paragraph could impose additional costs on Klépierre which could have a negative effect on its business, results and financial position, as well as the value of the Klépierre asset portfolio. The specific risk posed by legal or regulatory provisions applying to leases In certain of Klépierre’s operating countries, and especially France, the contractual conditions applying to lease periods, lease voidance, lease renewal and rent indexation may be a matter of public policy. More specifically, some legal provisions in France limit the conditions under which property owners may increase rents to align them with market levels or maximize lease income. In France, certain types of lease must be entered into for minimum periods, and the process of evicting tenants in the event of non-payment may be lengthy. Any change to the regulations applying to commercial leases, and particularly their maturity, the indexation and capping of rents or the way in which eviction penalties are calculated, could have a negative effect on the value of the Klépierre asset portfolio, as well as the Company’s operating income and financial position. Risks relating to the SIIC tax regime Since the Company has SIIC status, it is subject to a special tax regime, referred to as the “SIIC regime”. As such, and subject to certain conditions (see the Glossary in the section 11 of this registration document for further details), it is exempt from paying corporate income tax. Although there are significant benefits involved in adopting SIIC status, it is a complex regime that poses certain risks for the Company and its shareholders: t he requirement for the Company to distribute a significant proportion of the profits earned in each fiscal year, which could, for example, affect its financial position and liquidity; the Company is exposed to the risk of future changes to the SIIC scheme, and certain changes could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s business, financial position and results; the Company is also exposed to the risk posed by future interpretation of the SIIC scheme provisions by the French tax and accounting authorities. Legal intelligence The Klépierre Legal Department, supported by the relevant functions, works in partnership with outside counsels to ensure that information regarding new laws and regulations that could have a material impact on the Group’s financial position and growth is gathered, processed and disseminated throughout the Group. This intelligence-gathering process extends to legislation and regulations in every country in which the Group has equity interests. ANNUAL REPOR T 114 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 R I SK FAC TOR S RIS KS REL AT ED T O SU BSI D I A RY COMPA N I ES 3 3.4. RISKS RELATED TO SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 3.4.1. Risks related to the shareholding structure of Steen & Strøm Steen & Strøm is 43.9% owned by ABP Pension Fund and 56.1% by Klépierre. The equity percentage, together with certain provisions contained in the shareholder agreement between the two shareholders, gives ABP Pension Fund significant influence in certain areas of strategic decision-making, such as major investment and disinvestment transactions involving Steen & Strøm. Under the terms of the agreement, certain decisions may be made on the basis of an 85% qualified majority vote, the effect of which is to give ABP Pension Fund an effective right of veto over these decisions. For certain Steen & Strøm growth decisions, the interests of ABP Pension Fund may diverge from those of Klépierre. The successful growth of Steen & Strøm’s business therefore depends to a certain extent on good relations between its shareholders. The possibility of some divergence of approach occurring between the shareholders cannot be excluded, which could disrupt the operation of Steen & Strøm, with a negative impact on the results, financial position and prospects of Klépierre. 3.5. ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS In all its operating countries (i.e. within Europe), Klépierre must comply with environmental protection laws applying to the presence or use of hazardous or toxic substances, and the use of facilities capable of generating pollution and impacting public health, particularly in terms of epidemics (especially in the Shopping center segment). Regulations on the control and maintenance of wastewater networks, domestic supply water stations and distribution networks, and hydrocarbon evacuation and storage facilities exist in all countries. Internal measures have been implemented to cover certain risks that are not covered by regulatory obligations. These good practices include building structure audits, energy audits, analyses to control rates of legionnaire’s disease, and thermal checks on electrical installations. The families of risks identified could have a range of different consequences: t he health risks resulting, for example, from internal pollution would produce a hazard to users and neighbors. A failure of this kind would have immediate local consequences in terms of footfall, reduced revenues for retailers and the loss of rent for Klépierre on the site concerned, as well as a negative impact on the Group’s reputation; an environmental incident caused by human error could reflect badly on the image of the Group and its management. The damage caused to the image of the Company as a result of an environmental incident is a risk whose potential consequences are hard to quantify; under current environmental laws and regulations, Klépierre, as the current or previous owner and/or operator of an asset, may be liable for identifying hazardous or toxic substances affecting an asset or a neighboring asset, and removing and cleaning up any such contamination found. The existence of contamination or the failure to take measures to resolve it may also impact negatively Klépierre’s ability to sell, rent, or redevelop an asset, or to use it as a security for a loan. In addition to the civil liability cover contracted to cover the risk of accidental pollution, Klépierre also has special insurance policies to cover the assets that include classified facilities subject to authorization. These policies insure against the liability of Klépierre in respect of physical injury, damage to property, and consequential loss arising as a result of gradual pollution. In terms of personal safety, the Group’s civil liability policies cover third parties against any prejudice suffered. Depending on its intensity, extreme weather may also impact the business activity of one or more assets. Exceptional snowfall could, for example, result in buildings being evacuated or pose a structural risk resulting in cessation of trading on a given site. Property damage insurance addresses this type of risk by covering harm to assets. Any failure to comply with safety measures or control procedures could result in an official shutdown of the site, with local consequences for the future of the business and image of the site concerned. Property damage insurance addresses this type of accidental damage. Risks are managed by means of permanent and periodic compliance measures. The permanent compliance measures use a “risk matrix” to check the procedures implemented and the monitoring points fundamental to the full coverage of the assets and the claims history. The periodic compliance measures ensure compliance with the regulations and procedures implemented (drafting of reports, recommendations and implementation plans) (see report of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board on section 9 of this registration document). ANN UAL R E POR T 115 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 R I SK FAC TOR S IN SU RA N C E RI SK S 3 3.6. INSURANCE RISKS Klépierre and its subsidiaries are covered by Group-wide international insurance programs underwritten by prime insurers: providing identical protection for all assets, irrespective of their location. Insured values are determined based on replacement cost assessments by independent appraisers, which are carried out at five-year intervals; covering the consequences arising from Group companies’ civil liability in relation to their business activities or professional misconduct, including the mandatory cover for subsidiaries falling within the scope of the loi Hoguet on professional licensing requirements. The level of cover is determined with regard to the Group’s actual record of losses and any legal requirements. The Group’s construction activities are covered by specific construction policies (property and civil liability), in compliance with the legal requirements in force in each country and in particular in France as regards the obligation to arrange Dommages Ouvrage policies, which provide cover against non-payment by builders for major structural defects. No comprehensive insurance policies have been arranged, although the risks not covered are negligible or would be the result of a deliberate act by the policyholder for which it would be criminally liable. Depending on the type of risk, the Group is reliant on the financial strength of insurers and may have to contend with the limitations of the insurance market and thus may no longer be fully or even totally covered against certain risks. The occurrence of exceptional and/or a very high frequency of losses may have an impact on the amount of insurance cover available to the Group. The possibility of an increase in the cost of insurance arising from market conditions cannot be discounted. It is also possible that insurers may become insolvent, or insurers may experience financial difficulties impairing their insurance capabilities and thus no longer be able to settle the claims covered by the Group’s insurance policies. The expert appraisers conducting replacement cost assessments may have underestimated the value insured, causing claim settlements to fall short of the losses incurred or, conversely, may have overstated the value insured, causing the Group to pay unduly high insurance premiums. In connection with its investments, Klépierre may encounter situations in which third parties have arranged insurance that is insufficient to cover losses or even no insurance in certain cases.

It exercises these powers within the limits of the corporate purpose, subject however to those expressly attributed by law and the bylaws to the Supervisory Board or general meetings of shareholders. Under the control of the Supervisory Board, it must, in particular: present the Supervisory Board with a report on the Company’s business at least once every quarter; present the Supervisory Board with the corporate financial statements, and where applicable, the consolidated financial statements for audit and control, within three months of each reporting date.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS 4.2.1. Compensation of executive corporate officers, stock options and performance shares The purpose of Klépierre’s policy on compensation, stock options and performance shares is to attract, retain and motivate high-performing managers. In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF code, compensation is based on work done, results achieved and also on scope of responsibility. The market is not the sole benchmark for compensation but regular comparisons are made with leading French and European real estate companies among Klépierre’s competitors. The compensation and performance shares policy is reviewed each year by the Nomination and Compensation Committee, which then makes recommendations to the Supervisory Board. It should also be remembered that the employment contract of Laurent Morel, Chairman of the Executive Board, with Klépierre Management was suspended with effect from November 30, 2011. Since then, Laurent Morel has received compensation set by the Klépierre Supervisory Board and continues to exercise his functions as manager of Klépierre Management free of charge. Jean-Michel Gault (Deputy CEO) and Jean-Marc Jestin (COO) are compensated in line with their employment contracts with Klépierre Management. Fixed compensation Any increase in compensation to members of the Executive Board is linked to events affecting the company and also takes into account performance-related pay from other components of compensation. Variable compensation Variable compensation rewards the performance of each corporate officer and the Company’s progress over the period. The rules used to set this compensation are consistent with the annual performance assessment of each executive corporate officer and with the Company’s strategy. The payment of variable compensation depends on the achievement of precise preset objectives (see below). The amount is determined at the end of each year based on how successfully these objectives have been achieved and paid at the start of the following year. The methods used to determine variable compensation are reviewed annually for the coming year. Variable compensation is set at a comparable order of magnitude to fixed compensation. It consists of a percentage of fixed compensation, tailored to the Company’s business and set in advance by the Supervisory Board. Only in very particular circumstances can exceptional variable compensation be paid. Variable compensation is not paid only to the executive corporate officers. Thus, in 2013, on the whole Group, 978 employees received a variable compensation. Variable compensation comprises a quantitative component and a qualitative component. ANNUAL REPOR T 124 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 COR POR AT E G OV E R N AN C E COM P EN SAT I ON A N D BEN EF I T S 4 Quantitative component The quantitative component of variable compensation is calculated as a percentage of fixed annual compensation of up to between 50% and 80% of fixed annual compensation. This percentage is determined by a scale based on the achievement of a target for net current cash-flow per share. This scale is designed to smooth out threshold effects. Net current cash-flow per share is a simple, relevant, objective and measurable criterion appropriate to the Company’s strategy. Its relevance is reviewed regularly and care is taken to avoid any ad hoc revisions. The different bands for achieving the net current cash-flow per share target are precisely defined but not disclosed for reasons of confidentiality. Accordingly, as net current cash-flow per share for 2013 was 2.07 euros, the quantitative component of variable compensation for members of the Executive Board is 70% of annual fixed remuneration. Qualitative component In addition to the company performance criteria there are individual criteria tailored to the objectives and specific responsibilities of each Executive Board member’s role. These, if met, may trigger an additional variable compensation payment. As regards the qualitative part of variable compensation to be paid to members of the Executive Board in 2015 in respect of 2014 and future years, this additional variable compensation will be capped at 60% of fixed compensation. The relevance of the criteria applied is reviewed regularly and care is taken to avoid any ad hoc revisions. The qualitative component of variable compensation to be paid to members of the Executive Board in respect of 2013 was based, among other criteria, on the achievement of the following pre-set criteria for the managers: completion of the disposal program for the years 2012-2013 in accordance with the objectives; completion of a major disposal: the sale to Carrefour of assets in France, Spain and Italy; the roll-out of SAP in all countries where Klépierre operates. These objectives and the personal objectives that derive from them, which were pre-set but not disclosed for confidentiality reasons, were all met in 2013. Performance shares Since 2012, Klépierre has prioritized the award of free shares as a means to promote loyalty among its executive corporate officers and a limited number of employees and also to encourage them to act for the long term, so aligning their interests with those of the Company and its shareholders. The award of such shares has replaced the stock option programs in place until 2011. All awards of bonus shares are linked to both internal and external performance criteria. The award of performance shares forms part of a policy of tying managers into the Company’s capital and its associated risks. The performance criteria set by Klépierre are therefore evaluated over a three year period. In compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code (small share of capital and allowance for dilution effects), at Klépierre’s general meeting of April 12, 2012 shareholders capped the number of shares that can be awarded at 0.5% of the share capital for a period of 38 months. Within this limit, the Supervisory Board set a maximum percentage of performance shares that can be awarded to members of the Executive Board. Following the entry into force of the revised AFEP-MEDEF Code in June 2013, shareholders at the general meeting of April 10, 2014 and future years will be asked to vote on this maximum percentage. Accordingly, at the general meeting to be held on April 10, 2014 the proposal will be put to shareholders to limit to 0.2% of share capital the number of shares that can be awarded to members of the Executive Board, during a period of 38 months. Shares are awarded each year, at the same time of year, except for 2012 due to the change in share ownership (entry of Simon Property Group) and to associated modifications in the composition of the Supervisory Board. Performance shares are valued according to IFRS. The Supervisory Board ensures that they do not make up a disproportionate share of the overall compensation of members of the Executive Board. Employees who do not receive performance shares can benefit from other programs linked to the Company’s performance (including incentive and mandatory profit-sharing schemes). Klépierre’s Executive Board, acting on the authorization granted at the general meeting of April 12, 2012, put in place in 2013 a bonus share allotment plan with performance conditions that associates 51 employees with the Company’s performance. This led to the award in 2013 of 255 000 performance shares, equivalent to 0.13% of the share capital. The Supervisory Board reviewed the award of performance shares to executive corporate officers under all parts of their compensation and set a limit of 95 000 shares, equivalent to 0.05% of the share capital, as follows: Laurent Morel: 35 000 shares Jean-Michel Gault: 30 000 shares Jean-Marc Jestin: 30 000 shares As these were existing shares, the award had no dilutive effect. The features of the plan are modeled on current practice at French and foreign international groups (notably Simon Property Group) and guided by the legal and tax regimes governing these products. Two performance conditions, one internal (or absolute) and the other external (or relative), are measured at the end of a 3-year period. First, the absolute performance of the Klépierre share taking account of dividend yield (total shareholder return or TSR). Second, the relative performance of the Klépierre share against the FTSE EPRA EURO ZONE index. ANN UAL R E POR T 125 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 CO R POR AT E G OV E R N AN C E CO MPE N SAT I ON A N D BEN EF I T S 4 The methods used to calculate each of these performance conditions are set out in more detail on page 310. The performance conditions are weighted as follows: absolute performance 30%/relative performance 70%. In application of Article L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code as developed in the AFEP-MEDEF Code, members of the Executive Board must retain in registered form a number of shares equivalent to 50% of the gain on acquisition net of tax and expenses when the shares are delivered until their appointment ends. Members of the Executive Board are thus forced to retain a substantial and growing number of shares, which should represent at mid term at least two years of fixed compensation. In accordance with the revised AFEP-MEDEF Code of June 2013, this amount will be reviewed and fixed by the Supervisory Board in light of the situation of each executive corporate officer periodically and, as a minimum, every time they are reappointed. Because of these stringent retention requirements imposed on members of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board does not require them to buy shares from their own capital at the time the performance shares are delivered. The Regulations governing Klépierre performance shares do not allow beneficiaries to hedge their risk during the vesting period and, to the best of Klépierre’s knowledge, no hedging instruments have been arranged. In accordance with the revised AFEP-MEDEF Code of June 2013, executive corporate officers will formally commit under the next allotment plan not to engage in any transactions that would hedge the risk of their performance shares until the end of the retention period fixed by the Supervisory Board. Supplementary pension schemes Laurent Morel and Jean-Michel Gault benefit from the supplementary pension scheme for senior managers of the former Compagnie Bancaire which may entitle them to additional pension payments. The maximum amount of this retirement pension is 9 767 euros for Laurent Morel and 6 643 euros for Jean-Michel Gault. This plan is closed to new entrants and can no longer be altered. Jean-Marc Jestin has no supplementary pension scheme. Aside from the above-mentioned compagnie Bancaire scheme, the members of the Executive Board belong to the same retirement scheme as the Group’s senior executives. Other Benefits in kind consist solely of a Company car and associated expenses such as fuel and insurance. Each year, members of the Executive Board also receive directors’ fees for any seats they hold on the boards of various Group companies, which make up a minimal part of their compensation. They receive no other compensation from Group companies. ANNUAL REPOR T 126 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 COR POR AT E G OV E R N AN C E COM P EN SAT I ON A N D BEN EF I T S 4 4.2.2.

COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH 5.1.1. Strategy – deeply embedded in operations 5.1.1.1. Our vision We are convinced that the value of Klépierre as a company is partly dependent on its environmental, societal and social performance. A better environmental performance, particularly in terms of energy use, is our permanent ambition and testimony to our operational excellence. Shopping centers which are well-established in their territories, which are respectful to their stakeholders and which have a positive local impact are more attractive to our customers. Klépierre is a responsible company with a real prevention and risk management culture. And because our staff bears witness to these dynamics and ensures collective performance, Klépierre pays particular attention to developing the talents and skills of all. The information below gives a better idea of the Group’s commitments and responsibility towards its stakeholders across all areas where it is active. They are presented transparently and honestly. In this way, Klépierre reasserts its support for the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the ten universal principles it promotes on human rights, standards, work, the environment and the fight against corruption. 5.1.1.2. The value we create A major commercial real estate player in continental Europe, Klépierre operates in 40 cities and 13 countries, and has 1 346 employees. Its holdings amounted to 16 billion euros (excluding duties) at 12/31/2013.

Meet stakeholders’ expectations The strategic and economic success of the Group is inseparably linked to its duty to develop and manage commercial assets which meet the expectations of stakeholders. All 20 sustainability aspects have been examined with consideration of their impacts on the Group as well as its stakeholders. The key stakes for Klépierre have been defined according to the following questions: Do these issues lead to direct or indirect financial impacts? Do they present opportunities or risks for the business? Do they reinforce the values and the business model? What degree of influence does the company have on those issues? What is the present and future regulatory context? We have identified the key stakes for our stakeholders based on continuous relationships and exchanges. Over time, Klépierre has forged close relationships with its stakeholders. The Group involves the stakeholders at every step in the development of its centers – from the design phase through to day-to-day management. We interact with them and stay informed of their opinions through various methods: public consultations, surveys targeting retailers and customers, meetings, shopping center tours, etc. The following examples of this dialog show the longevity and effectiveness of our relationships with our 8 different stakeholders.

Organization To ensure that its environmental, social and societal concerns are shared by all functions and responsibilities across Europe, Klépierre has set up an organization that is supported by dedicated structures, including: t he Sustainable Development Committee, which operates under the auspices of the Supervisory Board, and is chaired by Steven Fivel, Assistant General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of Simon Property Group; the Executive-level Sustainable Development Committee that meets six times a year with the Executive Board members and selected employees directly involved in the topics under consideration; a network of 30 employees that covers all of the Group’s operations, tasked with spearheading the local action plan. Their scope spreads across all countries and across major support functions; the Sustainable Development Department, which is attached to the Chief Operating Officer, sets and develops the Group’s environmental policy. It also circulates it and ensures it is implemented successfully all over Europe.

Specific meetings and travel, involving the Sustainable Development (Department), Management and the Operations and Technical Departments of each country took place throughout the year. Specific training on energy accounting was also provided in 2013 as part of progressive deployment of the remote metering of energy consumption. Finally, several times during the year, management always strongly shared the Group’s policy and ambitions for Sustainable Development in communications to all of the Group’s employees. 5.1.3.2. Participation to various initiatives and charters The commitment to sustainable and responsible development is also expressed externally through the different associations and initiatives in which Klépierre takes part. Klépierre is an active member of the following national and international industry associations that it considers as strategic for its business. For each of them, it holds a position on the governance body and/or participates in projects or committees, including notably those that are sustainability-related: F  rench Council of Shopping Centers (CNCC): French trade organization federating all actors involved in the promotion and the development of shopping centers. In 2013, in the field of corporate responsibility, Klépierre took an active part in the preparation and publication of the first guide of reporting principles on sustainability issues for shopping center owners; French Property Real Estate Association (FSIF): Klépierre holds a position on the board of the FSIF, whose mission is to examine, promote and represent the combined business interests of French real estate investment companies; European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA): This trade association has more than 200 of Europe’s public real estate companies as members.

These endorsements reflect the priorities the Group wishes to address: Global Compact: This United Nations initiative to encourage businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies, stating ten principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption, and to report on their implementation. Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) User Group: GRESB is a non-profit organization whose primary purpose is to assess the environmental and social performance of companies specializing in the real estate sector. As an acknowledgement of its Green Star status, Klépierre is a member of the User Group. French Charter for energy efficiency of public and private tertiary buildings: This Charter, drawn up at the end of 2013, provides French actors in the building sectors a framework for implementing energy efficiency in their portfolios and for anticipating future regulatory obligations for improving tertiary buildings’ energy performance. French Charter for Diversity: An initiative undertaken in late 2004, this document expresses the will of signatories to ban discrimination in the workplace and to promote a better reflection of the diversity of the population in their workforce. The Group signed it on July 31, 2010. French Charter for Parenthood: Initiative of the French Monitoring Agency for Parenthood in the Workplace, this charter sets 3 main principles that signatories are committed with: contribute to the positive evolution of parenthood representations in the workplace, create a favorable environment for parents-employees, and respect the principle of non-discrimination in professional advancement for parents-employees. The Group signed it on April 29, 2009. The Palladio Foundation: The Palladio Foundation, under the aegis of the Fondation de France, is an original initiative by companies in the real estate industry which was created in 2008 around the urban construction of the future and its living areas. Its purpose is to gather together all current construction players (elected representatives, real estate professionals, professionals from other sectors involved in addressing urban problems, researchers, members of federations or associations and the media) and invite them to debate. It supports the builders of tomorrow, whether they be students, researchers or young professionals. Klépierre is a founding member of the Palladio Foundation and Laurent Morel, CEO of Klépierre is an active member of its its Board of Directors. For all of the associations, charters or initiatives it endorses, Klépierre does not provide any substantive funding beyond regular membership dues. 5.1.3.3. External ratings Klépierre fosters ongoing relationships with the extra-financial rating agencies, as well as with SRI (Socially Responsible Investment) analysts and investors, as part of its commitment to regular assessment of its sustainable development performance. The indexes in which Klépierre is included demonstrate both the extent of its efforts to achieve greater transparency and the relevance of the measures it has adopted. The increases in its leading ratings in 2013 in the field of corporate responsibility reflect its commitment to greater transparency.

STOMERS ETHICS LOCAL PHILANTHROPY SANITARY RISKS SAFETY TRANSPORTS The DEVELOPMENT role of the latter is to ensure that the principles of transparency and good governance set forth by Klépierre (mentioned earQUALITY lier) are fully respected. Comprehensive set of procedures A comprehensive set of internal rules and specifically devised procedures define the rules of conduct to ensure respect for the law and local customs and priority of customers’ interests. It also defines the framework to limit and prevent risk situation. It covers the following themes: VERSITY HUMAN conflict of interests; TALENTS RIGHTS confidentiality and observance of professional secrecy; financial communication and media; privileged information and insider trading; fight against money-laundering and the financing of terrorism; adherence to rules governing corruption; no political funding; delegations of authority and signatures; gifts and invitations, received by employees and offered to customers and third parties; protection and utilisation of Company assets; adherence to procedures applicable to invitations to tender and procurement; whistleblowing; health, hygiene and safety; prevention of acts of discrimination and harassment, respect for privacy; environmental responsibility. Code of Professional Conduct One of the major projects of the newly reorganized Internal Control Department was to review these procedures and gather them in a more user-friendly Code of Professional Conduct in order to gain better visibility across Europe. This document has been approved internally by all countries and staff representatives, and is now being submitted to the French Labor Inspection Authority before final disclosure. The launch of this code in early 2014 will be a perfect opportunity to once again raise awareness on all of these topics. Targeted functions and newcomers will have priority access to training sessions. Review of the whistleblowing procedure Simultaneously, the whistleblowing procedure is being reviewed for better adaptation across Europe, and to respect national regulatory particularities. Some countries for example offer total anonymity while, in others, addressing specific topics requires personal identification. This exhaustive review, which began in 2013 in the 13 countries where the Group does business, will offer better protection for all employees, thus guaranteeing a better implementation of all ethics-related issues.

Risks A real culture of risk prevention and management The Group is extremely attentive to the importance of implementing a consistent and global policy on risk management. Its policy Y RISKS is reviewed on an ongoing SAFETY basis in order to guarantee its efficiency at all levels throughout Europe. TRANSPORTS At the Group level, the efficiency of the entire risk management system has been reinforced via a strengthened organization. It combines the Risks and Internal Control Committee, the Internal Control Department and the identification of a network of around 50 coordinators across all functions and countries. The main issues addressed by this organization in 2013 are: u  pgraded risk management tool: The risk mapping system aims to identify all risk inherent to our activities, and to evaluate their likelihood and potential impacts. It is made up of 42 risks gathered into 10 families. In 2013, the Group has opted for an upgraded risk mapping management tool which aims to boost our ability to monitor those risks, deploy a reliable, relevant and permanent reporting system, centralize and structure all data concerning risks and incidents through information that is immediately accessible and homogenous, and optimize our permanent and periodic controls; 10 families of risks Risks concerning personal safety Risks related to financial activities Investment and disposal risks Legal, tax and regulatory risks Commercial risks Reputation risks Construction and asset management risk Corporate strategy and governance risks Risk of shortages of resources (technical, physical or logical) Social, societal and environmental risks updated Business Continuity Plan of the French headquarters: full-scale test of the new back-up site. Anticipation of the consequences of the future relocation of the headquarters; L ES assessment of professional risks in France: establishing the assessment system (procedure, professional risks committee) and launch of an outsourced audit process on shopping centers (50 reviewed in 2013). 5.2.1.4. Safety Ensuring a safe environment to our hundreds of millions of visitors At the building level, risks are also mapped, assessed and addressed with a clear emphasis on ensuring the safety of the millions of SAFETY visitors and several tens of thousands of employees that frequent the Group’s shopping centers every year. TRANSPORTS The tools and organization devoted to preventing and reducing risks have been reinforced in recent years. A review of all environmental risks and resources allocated to their prevention was carried out, and new resources and warning systems that were implemented supply the regular data needed to correct issues when identified, according to the following steps: identification of roles and responsibilities in each country; review of all procedures, documents and operational modes; identification of all possible emergency situations; test planning. Control procedures follow a 2-step process and give priority to integrating assets under operational management. Internal dashboards track these controls at all levels and an Annual Report is made to the Executive Board: permanent control: 1st level by shopping center management, 2nd level by operational departments; p  eriodic control: by internal audit functions and teams in charge of operational supervision at the Corporate level. Mappings at the building level include the following risks, among other types of risk: safety risks: buildings’ structure and safety risks threatening the customer experience; natural risks: extreme climate patterns (drought, snowfall, heat waves and cold spells, storms), earthquakes, sea flooding, river flooding, fire, etc.; technological risks: proximity to specific installations; materials and chemical products: asbestos, lead, paints, cleaning products, etc.; soil and water pollution: wastewater quality, drainage systems, oil separators, etc.; health risks: Legionella, bacterial and virus infections, etc.; noise and odor pollution.

All shopping center managers and teams at the national and regional operational levels have received it. A high level of safety is also provided everyday by having dedicated teams and security guards permanently on site. New parking facilities all incorporate better design in terms of traffic management and specific spaces for the disabled and for families. Toilets and rest areas are also arranged to meet the expectations of customers with specific needs. Centers and cooling equipment in particular are also continuously monitored for legionella contaminations and bacterial and/or viral propagation. In 2013, the main projects required deploying more efficient reporting systems, and testing the team’s responsiveness through a crisis simulation exercise: deployment of a new web-based version of an incident reporting system in all shopping centers in France. From 2014, it will be progressively deployed across Europe; implementation of a crisis management exercise in Scandinavian shopping centers. Different scenarios have been tested: fire incidents, terrorist attacks, building collapse with serious injuries and deaths. These exercises were also the opportunity to test employees’ behavior in crisis situations including their reactions towards media. Thanks to this thorough system of safeguards, the Group has neither been involved in nor responsible for any breaches of environmental regulations, nor has it made any provisions or guarantees for environmental risks in the last three years.

Convenience, accessibility, retail mix and conviviality are key concepts in meeting the expectations of an ever-changing public, and they are drivers for centers to become a destination of choice for customers. Customer satisfaction surveys are indispensable tools for ensuring that the right policies have been put in place.

DEVELOPMENT QUALITY A ratler limited amount of procurement The Group’s purchases amount globally to around 223 million euros(2) for the operational management of its shopping centers owned and managed around Europe. Moreover, these figures do not impact the Group’s turnover, as the vast majority of the procurement made at the shopping center level is reinvoiced to the lessees as part of the operational rental expenses. This responsibility makes it even more crucial for us to WORKING be transparent DIVERSITYand relevantHUMAN in managing our budgets. TALENTS CONDITIONS The risks posed, if any, are RIGHTS to be found in the atomization of procurement processes at the local level among the entire portfolio of shopping centers, and the identification of key suppliers that can have an effect on the continuity of activity of one building. These issues are addressed notably through a reinforced selection and listing of service providers at national levels, a promotion of responsible practices and a continuous monitoring on site. Local service providers rather than multi-tier supply chain 100% of our key suppliers are present in the countries where the Group operates, are members of the European Union (except Norway), and all are signatories of ILO conventions on fundamental labor rights. Around Europe, 95% of our operating budgets consist in utilities (water and energy), waste, cleaning, Facility management and security services. The 3 latter are services operated by teams present daily in our shopping centers. This characteristic is fundamental to understand the impacts and challenges of our procurement policy. Average breakdown of operating budgets and identification of main service provided 5% 23% Others Security 4% Waste management 22% 28% Facility management Energy and water 18% Cleaning Listing and selection of suppliers and service providers Economic partners are selected through a competitive bidding process for each shopping center with a minimum of three competitors. Contracts are signed for three-year duration only without automatic renewal. Accreditation of service providers has been gradually reinforced in the Group’s main countries of operation. The smaller the number of service providers, the better control we have. In France for example, 59 suppliers in the centers we own and manage make up for 80% of our operating budgets. A particular effort also was made in France and Italy to ensure a complete review of the service providers accredited to handle security for the shopping centers with respect to social criteria. The selection for each contract among the companies accredited now progressively incorporates more stringent sustainability criteria. These criteria have different weightings depending on the kind of service. For cleaning services in Scandinavia for example, close attention is paid for environmental criteria to the use of machines without chemicals (electrolysis) and eco-certified cleaning products, to noise pollution, the use of electric vehicles, waste sorting methods, etc. Promotion of responsible practices Sustainability clauses consistent with the Klépierre environmental and social commitments have been progressively incorporated into the contracts signed with our suppliers. These clauses include the following items: e  conomy: financial position, turnover contracted with Klépierre (< to 25%), business ethics, etc.; environment: use of environmentally-sound products and materials, energy efficiency, waste, establishment of innovative processes, etc.; (2) Excluding marketing budgets, property taxes and fees.

At the Group level, 76% of key service providers have at least one certification, mostly ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, and the Group targets 80% by 2017. % of key service providers certified by type of service Total Cleaning Security Facility management GROUP 76% 82% 68% 77% Monitoring of suppliers and service providers A majority of suppliers and service providers such as cleaning services, security guards and maintenance workers have their teams present daily in our shopping centers. These services represent more than 63% of our operating budgets in Europe (see graph above). This makes monitoring and control mechanisms easier. If we add in utilities, businesses that are strictly regulated in Europe, more than 91% of our operating budgets can be considered to be under a high level of control. Klépierre considers it a distinctive feature and an advantage of its business sector since its supply chain is mostly based on service providers present on its assets. Teams on site and national operating departments are first in line for controlling and auditing the quality of the service provided. Procedures at Group level frame these controls for economic, environmental and social issues. Internal audit departments also carry out controls on suppliers regarding respect of their contractual obligations and monitor as well the efficiency and quality of controls by teams on site. Payment mechanisms The internal functions that select and list the suppliers and the functions that proceed to payment are independent. This strict task allocation has been reinforced since the implementation of the SAP. Only the economic partners that were previously listed are to be paid. This business management software solution, deployed since 2008, is now operational in all territories since Jan. 1st 2014 following the integration of Scandinavia. . 5.2.2. Efficient – improving buildings’ performance 5.2.2.1.

There are 2 factors behind its improvement: environmental and economic. By optimizing consumption and making better energy NATURAL WATER ENERGY choices, Klépierre is able to limit the effects of energy price volatility and the increasing rarity of hydrocarbons. RESOURCES Our energy efficiency has increased 7.7% over five years on a like-for-like basis thanks to actions in 4 areas: energy saving: – constant attention to operating hours: night visits to shopping centers to check equipment programming; – adjustment of set point temperatures: better adjustment to outside temperatures; – rollout of a real-time counting system, use by use: on over 48% of centers at the end of 2013 and major rollout scheduled ANTHROPY SANITARY overRISKS the coming months; SAFETY TRANSPORTS QUALITY – increasing awareness of good practices, etc ; improvement of technical equipment: – replacement of equipment with the highest energy use: cooling towers, mechanical linkages, ventilation pumps etc. ; – relamping: LED wherever possible, lower-wattage bulbs, national directories of quality product suppliers ; construction investments: – as part of the development operations: attention to building insulation and its compactness to improve thermal inertia ; – during the operational phase renovation work: overhaul thermal exchanges and recoup calories or frigories, etc. ; environmental dialogue with lessees: – identify the overall consumption of the buildings, including lessees, at over 47 centers ; – implement awareness-raising and cooperation initiatives ; –w  ork around a usage benchmark for lessees in the center itself, and for the same retailer in several locations.

Beyond the green lease: the overall performance of our buildings, including lessees, known at 47 centers The green lease is now attached to the new leases all over Europe. It opens the way to further cooperation with retailers on environmental and energy matters in particular. However, it will take some time to obtain signatures from the entire lessee pool. Klépierre wants to anticipate this process. The Group already has access to all energy use data, including lessees, over 47 centers (around 1 000 leases and one third of the portfolio in value), in the majority of Central Europe and Scandinavia.

(cf. Energy and Transports chapters). Therefore, 97% of our shopping centers in Europe can be accessed by public transport. In 2013, 38% of visitors went to centers of the holdings by public transport or by “soft” modes of transport (on foot, by bicycle, etc.). The Group’s recent developments (Paris Saint-Lazare, Clermont-Ferrand Jaude) show the Group’s desire to position itself on highly integrated urban environments. In the four most recently opened centers, the proportion of visitors using public transport or “soft” modes of transport is 53%, illustrating the Group’s new strategy in terms of accessibility. With the inclusion of St.Lazare Paris, this figure rises to 87%.

Reducing our dependence on fossil fuels is the main one. The actions mentioned above will all limit the impacts. The physical impacts are more limited, as our assets are implanted in 40 major cities in continental Europe. Anticipating them involves dynamic risk management (cf. Risks chapter). Structural audits are performed to warn of the impacts of extreme climatic events (storms, heavy rainfall or snowfall, etc.) and our energy saving efforts will help the Group to protect itself against changes in average temperatures and higher heating or climate control requirements. Finally, the Group’s holdings are not affected by drought (cf. Water chapter). The main regulatory changes as regards the fight against climate change are mainly examined within the dedicated working groups within the professional organizations to which the Group belongs. (4) Journeys by buyers were estimated using an average distance of 10 km for a round trip journey applying an emission factor specific to each mode of transport according to the breakdown of visits for each asset. Emissions from buyer energy use were estimated by extrapolating the CO2 impacts of energy use in Central Europe and Scandinavia to all holdings.

Waste Sort waste to increase the amount of waste recycled and recovered Effective waste management in the Group’s assets involves offering relevant sorting solutions in advance to its tenants and visitors, and then ensuring with the service providers responsible NATURAL for removing and processing the waste that it reaches the correct destiWASTE WATER ENERGY nation. RESOURCES Around 45 000 tons of waste were generated in 2013. 99.8% of this waste was non-dangerous. Increase the number of sorting solutions The Group constantly strives to increase the amount of waste sorted. These actions, in collaboration with the retailers, highlight the environmental and economic benefits: sorted waste repurchased (up to nearly one hundred euros for a ton of cardboard) could offset the costs of removing or processing non-sorted waste. LOCAL 12 500 metric tons of OverPHILANTHROPY cardboard, 1 150 metric SANITARY RISKS tons of food waste, SAFETY and 670 metric tons of fat were salvaged in 2013. In total, TRANSPORTS DEVELOPMENT almost 19 000 metric tonsQUALITY have been sorted on site. In the highest-performing centers, over 30 different kinds of waste are sorted. This success is due to increased awareness among the personnel of the retailers, a clearer waste procedure, and precise information on the destination of each type of waste. Over 40% of waste recycled and 70% recovered – a remarkable performance In 2013, the proportion of waste recycled, reused or composted was 40.3%, up 6% compared to 2012. If all the other forms of recovery are included (incineration with energy recovery or burying with anaerobic digestion, this figure TALENTS climbs to 70.1%, up 5%.

However, the local authorities retain responsibility for waste collection at a significant number of sites, notably in France and Italy. These sites are not included in the reporting, as the Group has no control over the final destination of the waste, which explains the hedging rate of 83.5%. Finally, the Group also wants to raise awareness among visitors to the centers about sorting, and is rolling out bins with multiple compartments in the public areas.

On-site infiltration of rainwater may also be encouraged, in compliance with the authorized levels of pollution, in order to limit soil waterproofing. 5.2.2.5. Natural resources A strict and limited use The Group is taking specific measures to limit the use of natural resources, besides fossil fuels. The Group’s main impact in this NATURAL area concerns the building development phase. NERGY RESOURCES The Group works in close collaboration with real estate developers on a recognized environmental approach: paying special attention to “green building site” policies implemented by these developers; encouraging them to implement strict environmental impact monitoring in the construction phase; systematically consider the use of environmentally-friendly materials; examine the origin of the raw materials used. Companies must prove that the wood used is legally sourced and Klépierre favors certification under the PEFC or FSC schemes. On new projects, in line with the criteria set by BREEAM for the materials target, traceability NITARY RISKS according to one of its 2 programs SAFETY TRANSPORTS is assured for over 80% of the wood used.

But its shopping centers also generate around 90 000 jobs(7), mostly with the retailers which operate within its centers or the service providers selected by the Group. The development of our shopping centers thus provides major opportunities to create jobs that cannot be off-shored. The development teams are fostering close relations with recruitment agencies to promote local recruitment. These relationships keep on going once the center is opened and take various forms such as job forums; 223 million euros in operational budgets across Europe: funds mostly redistributed locally to service providers at our centers responsible for cleaning, safety, and maintenance; 49 million euros in local taxes in 2013. For example, our biggest asset in France, which celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2014, has contributed 2.6 million euros to local public finances this year. Valuing and accounting for these external elements Economic and local impacts can be directly felt and experienced every day at our centers. The Group also aims to assess them at the European level. The Group wants to develop a method of accounting for these external features. Via this project, which was initiated in 2013, the Group aims to better identify the economic flows in place locally at the centers, and include these external features in the perception of value creation within the Group. 5.2.3.2. Transports Improving the accessibility and connectivity of our shopping centers The proximity and accessibility of modes of transport to its shopping centers are essential parts of Klépierre’s strategy. Location, urban density, and transport offerings are main criteria in selecting an investment. The retail space at the Saint-Lazare railway staAFETY TRANSPORTS tion in Paris illustrates perhaps more than any other the Group’s determination in this regard, with almost 97% of the 450 000 daily visitors coming by public transport or on foot. Making it easier to access our centers using different modes of transport Klépierre wants to increase and diversify the transport solutions used to visit our centers. This can be seen in the initial design stages, and continues with the operation of the building. 97% of our centers in value are easily accessible by public transport, with a stop located less than 500 meters from an entrance, with services less than every 20 minutes. Likewise, 94% of our centers in value are adapted for cyclists. The Group wants to equip all of its remaining sites by 2017. Innovative modes of transport are also being examined. Electric cars are the main area of interest. 35% of our parking lots are already equipped to receive and charge electric vehicles, i.e. 153 terminals all over Europe. Norway, where the use of electric cars is undergoing exponential growth, provides an interesting case study. Several of our centers in the Greater Paris area can also be accessed via the Autolib’ electric car sharing scheme. Finally, to facilitate the arrival of visitors in vehicles and to enable traffic to move more freely in our centers, parking lots are increasingly being equipped with guiding systems. Over 20 000 spaces in Europe had these systems at the end of 2013. 38% of our visitors come to our shopping centers on foot or by public transport. This percentage is up to 53% for new centers open for five years (excluding Saint-Lazare, which stands at 87%). 5.2.3.3.

Sensitivity vis-à-vis biodiversity at shopping centers Low sensitivity Average sensitivity Low sensitivity or average High sensitivity 39.2% 45.4% 84.6% 15.4% Special attention is paid to centers highly sensitive to biodiversity. Bègles Rives d’Arcins, right along the Garonne banks in France, has the highest sensitivity of all our holdings. Specific steps were taken during the extension-refurbishment operation to include this ecological criterion (cf. page 157). Finally, as part of the BREEAM In-Use certification, these centers are subject to a specific biodiversity initiative. Specific initiatives focusing on the majority of centers On the Group scale, 98 centers undertook at least one biodiversity initiative. 94% of centers identified as being highly sensitive in this regard have developed different initiatives. These can take several forms: planting up the building: on the roof or via a green wall at over 20 centers; installation of shelters for local wildlife: at 7 shopping centers, i.e. several dozen beehives and nesting boxes; ENERGY NATURAL sensitive management of green spaces: 73 shopping centers have chosen to promote local plant species and use more enviRESOURCES ronmentally-friendly phytosanitary products. 5.2.3.4. Health quality Providing a healthy environment for all our stakeholders The Group’s shopping centers are visited every year by several hundred million of customers and several tens of thousands of people work there daily. Therefore, the health quality in these areas must be optimum. This is a major component of the healthy and OPY SANITARY RISKS SAFETY TRANSPORTS QUALITY safe environment we offer to our customers. We distinguish three main components of health quality: general hygiene: the specifications for each service, especially cleaning, include a list of products favored for their health quality. 82% of cleaning service providers are certified, most of them ISO 14001; the quality of the materials, surfaces, and facades of the furniture: the Group strives to use healthy materials with low emissions of volatile organic compounds, and with low content of harmful substances. Asbestos and technical facilities are also of course covered by our risk management policy; air and water health quality: by ensuring that air inlets are free of major sources of pollution, and that a suitable amount of new WATER ENERGY comes in.

The change in the structure of the shareholder base and the strategy to refocus on leading shopping centers in areas of Europe with strong growth potential led to a reorientation of social/HR policies. In response to changes in the structure of the holdings, to become more agile and to optimize the allocation of skills essential to our key activity, the operational and organizational diagrams were overhauled. This involved workforce management to streamline costs and partly anticipate the consequences of the agreement protocol signed at the end of 2013 on the sale of 127 shopping malls to a consortium led by Carrefour. Total workforce 2013 2012 Total 1 346 1 467 Open-ended contract 1 281 95.2% 1 382 94.2% Fixed-term contract 65 4.8% 85 5.8% Klépierre has paid special attention to its HR processes to prevent and limit the impacts of these organizational changes. Almost 60% of new recruits were hired on open-ended contracts in 2013, 26% of whom were transferred from short-term contracts (fixedterm, interim or external), reflecting the Group’s will to continue supporting permanent employment. To ensure the optimum allocation of key skills, internal mobility processes were favored. Thus, the mobility rate was 7% for the whole Group in 2013, and has reached 20% in some countries. This mobility is monitored via a specialized training session whenever necessary. Depending on local contexts, additional measures have also been rolled out to support these evolutions: working hours reduction (RTT), regular communication (with managers, personnel representatives, employees), specific training sessions, etc. Departures, when unavoidable, have been subject to compensatory measures adapted according to the situations, including financial compensation over and above the legal minimums and individual support initiatives (coaching, outplacement, training, etc.). A rich social dialog to bring new outlooks This dynamic to improve organizational efficiency has been rolled out with the involvement of managers and personnel representatives in the entities where they are present. The quality and frequency of these exchanges help make organizational transformation more fluid and maintain a favorable social climate. In Norway for example, elected health and safety personnel representatives were the favored contacts for Management during organizational transformation (4 formal meetings, regular exchanges). Social dialog has also been rich and constructive in France: the Works Council met 13 times in 2013, with organizational changes being discussed at 8 sessions. The Executive Committee and Top management take part regularly to present the company’s general strategies (10 times in 2013). In France, the year also saw the renewal of the mandates of the elected members of the Works Council and Personnel Delegates. Thanks to the candidates’ sustained communication in the presence of and under the leadership of the HR department during these elections, the participation rate was 67%.

These question-answer sessions in the form of 2-hour breakfasts brought together ten employees, a member of the Executive Board and a member of the Executive Committee. Special measures to support transformation and prevent stress at work Various initiatives were launched during 2013 to support change and prevent stress at work: time management training offered to staff, increasing manager awareness, etc. Klépierre University has also made a major contribution to this approach by rolling out a specific program: 40% of employees in France, i.e. 215 people, took part in these half-day sessions on preventing stress at work. Additional modules on change and stress management were also launched at the end of the year in response to the challenges identified. In total, over 1 000 hours of training on these issues were delivered at the Group level. Absenteeism limited and stable over time Although the year saw major organizational changes in most countries, absenteeism remained stable at the Group level, demonstrating no damage to the working climate. WASTE WATER ENERGY NATURAL RESOURCES 2013 2012 RATE OF ABSENTEEISM 2.11% 2.16% Klépierre strives to protect the safety of its employees at work, both at head office and in the shopping centers. 76% of employees are represented on mixed occupational health and safety committees. Training sessions on these matters are held regularly (first aid, fire, defibrillators, etc.) over 190 staff from central functions received training during the year, as did personnel from the cenLOCAL SANITARY RISKSstable at Group ters.PHILANTHROPY The number of workplace accidents remained level, and the TRANSPORTS SAFETY number of days of absence due to workplace DEVELOPMENT QUALITY accidents fell 38%. 5.2.4.2. Talents Redynamizing the workforce to drive collective performance Intellectual and human capital must be considered in its individual dimension as an asset in itself, which brings real added value and ensures collective performance. TALENTS Becoming a preferred employer on the market Although Klépierre is committed to carefully managing its employees, the life of the company involves regular recruitment drives, either to replace outgoing staff or to strengthen teams essential to its core business (asset management, marketing, shopping center managers, etc.). 2013 2012 NUMBER OF NEW STAFF 129 181 Klépierre’s attractiveness to profiles specializing in real estate was improved by the organizational transformation and reaffirmation of operational excellence requirements. Also, employment market conditions as well as the professional development measures Klépierre has rolled out have boosted its image as a favored employer among junior profiles. To ensure that applications (either spontaneous or in response to advertisements) are properly processed and to optimize the management of profile databanks, an online recruitment tool was implemented at the end of 2013. The agreement on the hiring of senior workers was monitored by employee representatives. During the year 2013, the Group began negotiations with employee representatives to maintain provisions for promoting senior workers as part of the generation agreement.

One of the key search criteria: location. It was deemed essential to remain in Paris, and in an attractive area in the heart of retail to continue attracting and winning the loyalty of the best talent. This plan also involves improving communication between teams for a better overall performance. The Executive Board thus opted for the Edouard VII business center, ideally located between l’Opéra and la Madeleine, which is BREEAM In-Use certified. This building has excellent public transport connections. A study of the impact of travel by staff using public transportation was also conducted. It concluded that the environmental impacts were stable and a slight drop in the average travel time. Employee involvement in the project preparation phase is essential to encourage full involvement. Some sixty employees were asked to take part in brainstorming sessions, and internal working groups were set up on different matters, to reflect on new working methods to be implemented. The team move is planned for September 2014. Acknowledging and optimizing individual performance as part of continuing professional development Professional evaluation is an essential part of Klépierre’s HR development policy. The annual meeting between employees and their managers is a time to look back on the Group’s achievements from the last year, identify priorities, professional development targets and training needs. The skills and performances evaluation system identifies key positions and situations which may require special monitoring. In response, training is an individual talent and skill development priority. It is even more important in company transformation phases which may require specific support to teams. 2013 saw a refocusing on short training sessions and a fall in training needs following the implementation of SAP on a Group scale. Access to training 2013 2012 Average hours of training per trained employee 24 25 Klépierre University, supporting Group strategy The Group school has played an essential role in delivering the training policy. 25 new modules were offered to 605 participants by Klépierre University in 2013 in response to new challenges and the Group’s strategy (sales negotiation, management training, energy accounting, stress prevention, etc.). The sales teams benefited from a completely overhauled training program. Over 5% of training initiatives in France were aimed specifically at them, including e-learning modules and role plays specifically designed to meet their needs. They also participated with asset management teams in 22 special meetings with our partner retailers to improve their knowledge of market segments represented in our centers (food outlets, sport, culture & leisure, telephones, etc.). Promoting the exchange of best practices and circulation of know-how To circulate best practices and know-how essential to the Group’s core business, training sessions led by expert employees is strongly encouraged. In 2013, 37% of total training offered by Klépierre University was delivered by employees (real estate, commercial, health and safety, management, etc.). Klépierre also has an active internal mobility policy to promote the development of its employees. Mobility allows beneficiaries to gain an overall understanding of our holdings and their priorities while promoting good practices among the Group’s functions and countries. It also optimizes and manages internal reorganization processes.

Diversity Providing a working environment which motivates everyone Because it integrates new talent and multiplies available skills, diversity is a source of innovation, performance and competitiveness. G This is crucial HUMANfor Klépierre: integrating diversity enables us to understand the diversity of the customers who visit our centers. DIVERSITY TALENTS NS RIGHTS Ensuring gender equality 65% of visitors to Klépierre shopping centers are women. To better meet their needs, it would seem essential to attempt to reflect this situation within the company itself, at all levels and in all segments. Klépierre has set itself the target of promoting gender equality both in its recruitment processes and in terms of career management. This involves consistent, objective decision-making procedures which allow everyone to be assessed using the same criteria. Proof of this commitment: the target of 40% women in management by the end of 2015. Proportion of women by management level 2013 2012 Executive management 20.0% 20.0% Top management 10.0% 19.1% Middle management 31.1% 19.7% First line management 34.9% 39.6% Non-management 67.5% 66.3% GROUP 56.4% 56.4% EIn line with the Men/Women ratio at Group level, Women accounted for 53% of recipients of variable compensation; 56% of beneficiaries of an individual increase; 56% of employees trained and 54% of internal mobility candidates Additional measures are planned to promote and support their access to positions of responsibility: implementation of a women’s leadership module, to ensure equal access to “high-value” training. Through its drive to respect and promote diversity, Klépierre is also committed to preventing any kind of discrimination, either by opening up to different social environments, age management or inclusion of people with disabilities. No discrimination incidents were recorded in 2013 in countries where the Group operates.

STRONG METHODOLOGY, EXHAUSTIVE COMMUNICATIONS 5.3.1. Methodology – methodological specifications The environmental, societal and social management system is used to quantify and identify the principal sustainable impacts imposed by the Klépierre Group and its activities. The fundamental guidelines which guide this reporting are: relevance: the biggest sources of impact for each theme are taken into account; representativeness: the selected indicators are representative of the Group’s sites and activities; consistency: guarantees that the data comparison by territory or year by year is pertinent; transparency: the selected hypotheses and the calculations are clearly defined; precision and reliability: records are kept on-site and at every level of responsibility to guarantee the traceability of the data. 5.3.1.1. Methodological specifications for environmental and societal indicators The environmental and societal management system takes into account the recommendations made by the 3 widely acknowledged reference documents for our sector at the international, European and national scale: Global Reporting Initiative Construction and Real Estate Sector Supplement (GRI 4, GRI CRESS); European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA), Best Practices Recommendations on Sustainability Reporting; Conseil National des Centres Commerciaux (CNCC) – Guide sectoriel de reporting RSE. Definition of the monitoring scopes 2 scopes have been defined. “Assets Portfolio” scope It covers the shopping centers owned by the Group at more than 25% on 12/31/13 (are therefore excluded the offices, retail premises and various retail facilities defined in the Group Annual Report). Shopping centers accounted for 92.8% of Group assets on 12/31/13. “Managed Portfolio” scope This scope is specific for the shopping center industry, for operational feasibility reasons. It is a part of the “Assets Portfolio” scope. It covers the centers which the Group owned and managed over the entire reporting period. When a shopping center is acquired and enters under the property management of the Group, it enters the “Managed Portfolio” scope immediately after one full year. Real estate development projects are not included in the reporting during development and/or construction, until they are completed and after one year of activity. The term “property management” can vary slightly from one asset to another depending on the technical details of each center. Depending on the situation, Klépierre may have full management of the electricity, but be charged by a third party (supermarket, etc.) for its heating oil consumption. Similarly, the collection of its waste can be taken care of by a third party on the basis of a subscription, etc. Situations can vary greatly, and may therefore prevent the collection of exhaustive data. Centers for which Klépierre does not possess exhaustive data are excluded from the reporting. This explains the difference in coverage rate between one indicator and the other. The “Managed portfolio” scope accounted for 87.3% of the “Assets portfolio” scope on 12/31/13.

We therefore distinguish “current” and “constant” scope, which each apply to the relevant indicators of the “Managed Portfolio” scope. Current scope The current scope enables the Group to evaluate the CSR impact of its assets over one year. It shows the result of its policies in matters of management, renovation and sales/acquisitions. It includes all shopping centers owned by the Group at a level of 25% or more on 12/31/N, including those which were subject to renovations or extensions during the reporting period, regardless of the GLA surface created. Constant scope The constant scope enables the Group to highlight an evolution in its performance over a constant and identical scope in time. It highlights the Group’s ability to manage and optimize the performance of its assets. It includes all owned and managed assets for a period of at least 24 months. It excludes assets acquired or completed during that period, as well as those for which property management was not under the Group’s responsibility for the entire period. Assets which are subject to an extension superior to 20% of the GLA are excluded from the scope. Reporting periods and estimates The major factor to be taken into account is that two different monitoring periods are used. This difference is caused by the Group’s desire to minimize the need for estimates, and to collect or consolidate real data. The technical operating data relating to energy consumption, water consumption and waste production is completed monthly on the basis of bills received by on-site teams and relating to previous periods. In order to reflect actual consumption as accurately as possible, the Group has decided to adopt a one-year rolling period. For all indicators related to Energy, Waste, Climate Change, Water and one indicator on Transport (share of visits by transportation method), the reporting period is from 10/01/N-1 to 09/30/N. The specific scope for these indicators is therefore corrected to exclude shopping centers which were not owned or managed between 10/01/N and 12/31/N.

The dates which are closest to the start and the end of the reporting period will be taken. If needed, the data will be adjusted to 365 days through extrapolation. Coverage rate The coverage rate gives an indication of the comprehensiveness of reported data. The coverage rate is expressed in % of the total assets value of the respective reporting scopes. 5.3.1.2. Methodological specifications for social indicators Period and reporting scope For all social indicators, the monitoring period used is the period from January 1 to December 31 in year N. The scope for collecting the data and reporting covers all Group subsidiaries as at 12/31/2013 in which employees have an employment contract with the Group. For 2013, the subsidiaries are owned as follows: France-Belgium, Iberia, Southern Europe and Central Europe: full integration; Scandinavia: partial integration (56.1%). Changes in scope are the result of acquiring new entities or disposing of existing entities. The employees of these entities are incorporated into or removed from the Klépierre reporting scope with effect from the month following the transaction date. Definitions and clarifications Total employees: refers to the total number of physical employees at December 31, regardless of the number of hours worked and period of employment during the year. This indicator is the sum total of open-ended and fixed-term contracts. Average workforce: refers to the sum total of employees at the end of each month (open-ended and fixed-term contracts), divided by 12. All calculations are based on one of these 2 indicators, depending on their nature. 5.3.2. Full data – extra-financial statements 5.3.2.1.

At the same time, other agreements remain in place: the 2009 company agreement setting the framework for work relations (contract, structure of work time, compensation, etc.); the agreement on the Individual Training Entitlement (DIF). Once per year, employees receive the count of their available Individual Training Entitlement (DIF) hours. The Works Council is also informed annually of the use of these hours by workers; the agreement on working hours reduction; the agreement on working at home and the implementation of special measures for disabled workers; the 2012 company agreement on professional equality between men and women, the tracking of which leads to a discussion with employee representatives; the collective bargaining agreement on the employee health cost plan that is monitored annually with employee representatives. All agreements in vigor are accessible to all employees working in France, via a dedicated web page, accessible from the HR intranet.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. For the attention of the Shareholders, In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Klépierre, and designated as independent third-party entity, whose certification request has been approved by the French National Accreditation Body (COFRAC), we hereby present you with our report on the social, environmental and societal information prepared for the year ended December 31, 2013 presented in the management report included in the annual report (hereinafter the “CSR Information”), pursuant to Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Responsibility of the Company The Executive Board of Klépierre is responsible for preparing a management report including the CSR Information provided by Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code, prepared in accordance with the reporting criteria used by Klépierre (the “Reporting Criteria”), some of which are presented throughout the management report and which are available on request from the Human Relations & Environmental executive management teams. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory texts, the profession’s Code of Ethics as well as by the provisions set forth in Article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code. Furthermore, we have set up a quality control system that includes the documented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with rules of ethics, professional standards and the applicable legal texts and regulations. Responsibility of the Statutory Auditors Based on our work, our responsibility is: to attest that the required CSR Information is presented in the management report or, in the event of omission, is explained pursuant to the third paragraph of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Attestation of completeness of the CSR information); to express limited assurance on the fact that, taken as a whole, the CSR Information is presented fairly, in all material aspects, in accordance with the adopted Reporting Criteria (Formed conclusion on the fair presentation of the CSR Information). Our work was carried out by a team of four people between January 22 and March 7th 2014, i.e. a period of around four weeks. To assist us in conducting our work, we referred to our corporate responsibility experts. We conducted the following procedures in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, with the order of May 13, 2013 determining the methodology according to which the independent third party entity conducts its assignment and, with regard to the formed conclusion on the fair presentation of the Information, with the ISAE (International Standard on Assurance Engagements) 3000(1). 1. Attestation of completeness of the CSR Information Based on interviews with management, we familiarized ourselves with the Group’s sustainable development strategy, with regard to the social and environmental impacts of the company’s business and its societal commitments and, where appropriate, any resulting actions or programs. We have compared the CSR Information presented in the management report with the list set forth in Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code. In the event of omission of certain consolidated information, we have verified that explanations were provided in accordance with the third paragraph of the Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code. We have verified that the CSR Information covered the consolidated scope, i.e., the company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of Article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code and the companies that it controls within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, subject to the limits set forth in the methodological memo paragraph 5.3.1 presented in the Annual Report. Based on our work and considering the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information is presented in the management report. 2. Limited assurance on the fair presentation of the CSR Information Nature and scope of procedures We conducted 16 interviews with 35 people responsible for preparing the CSR Information in the departments in charge of the CSR Information collection process and, when appropriate, those responsible for internal control and risk management procedures, in order to: assess the suitability of the Reporting Criteria with respect to its relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, taking into consideration, when relevant, the sector’s best practices; ANN UAL R E POR T 179 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 E NVIRO NME NTAL, S OC I E TAL AN D SOC I AL I N F OR MAT I ON S TRO NG ME THO DO LOGY, EXHAU ST I VE COMM U N I C AT I ON S 5 v erify the set-up of a process to collect, compile, process, and check the CSR Information with regard to its completeness and consistency. familiarize ourselves with the internal control and risk management procedures relating to the compilation of the CSR Information. We determined the nature and scope of the tests and controls according to the nature and significance of the CSR Information with regard to the company’s characteristics, the social and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainable development strategies and the sector’s best practices. Concerning the CSR information that we have considered to be most important(2): for the consolidating entity, we consulted the documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organization, policies, actions), we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the data consolidation, and we verified their consistency with the other information presented in the management report; for a representative sample of entities and sites that we have selected(3) according to their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we held interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and implemented substantive tests on a sampling basis, consisting in verifying the calculations performed and reconciling the data with supporting evidence. The selected sample represented 53.5% of the Group headcount and 17% of energy consumption (energy consumption of common spaces and common heating and/or cooling facilities). Regarding the other consolidated CSR Information, we have assessed its consistency in relation to our understanding of the Group. Finally, we have assessed the relevance of the explanations relating to, where necessary, the total or partial omission of certain information. We believe that the sampling methods and sizes of the samples we have used in exercising our professional judgment enable us to express limited assurance; a higher level of assurance would have required more in-depth verifications. Due to the use of sampling techniques and the other limits inherent to the operations of any information and internal control system, the risk that a material anomaly be identified in the CSR Information cannot be totally eliminated. Conclusion Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2013 1.1. Investments During the first semester the Group acquired 15.89% of the share capital of Klémurs and its subsidiaries for a total amount of 33.9 million euros, includind acquisition costs (see note 4). On November 29, 2013, the Group acquired the remaining 50% of the Odysseum shopping center in Montpellier (SCI Odysseum place de France) held by Icade and 100% of SCI Odysseum 2. Following this transaction, Klépierre owns 100% of this shopping center (see note 4). On December 5, 2013, the Group acquired 16.7% of the Italian company IGC from the company Finiper, increasing its share in the subsidiary to 88% (see note 4). The main investments of the period concern France (Clermont Jaude, Bègles – Rives d’Arcins and Claye-Souilly for respectively 52 million euros, 23.6 million euros and 11.6 million euros) and Sweden (Kristianstad and Emporia for respectively 48.4 million euros and 21.7 million euros). 1.2. Disposals Disposals for the year amount to 469.5 million euros and concern mainly: the investment property located at 21 avenue Kléber and the company’s business premises located at 21, rue La Pérouse; the investment property located at 7 rue Meyerbeer in Paris; the investment property located at 192 avenue Charles-de-Gaulle in Neuilly-sur-Seine; the Lomme shopping center; 50% of the Norwegian shopping center Nordbyen; 4 shopping centers located in Norway (Halden Storsenter, Torvbyen, Stovner Senter and Markedet). On December 16 2013, Klépierre announced it has signed a memorandum of understanding for the proposed disposal of a portfolio of 127 Carrefour-anchored retail galleries to a consortium led by Carrefour and capitalized by institutional investors for 2.01 billion euros. 1.3. Dividend On April 11, 2013, the shareholders meeting approved the payout of a 1.50 euro per share dividend in respect of 2012 fiscal year, and proposed a cash payment. Cash dividend payments totaled 292.9 million euros. 1.4. Debt Klépierre obtained a syndicated loan for 750 million euros with maturity in 2018 from a group of 16 leading banks. During the second semester, Klépierre also obtained 3 bilateral loans for an amount of 300 million euros. These lines are undrawn. These new loans allowed Klépierre to waive 2 bilateral credit lines granted by BNP Paribas that have not been drawn: one for 500 million euros with maturity in March 2016 and another for 500 million euros with maturity in March 2018. In Scandinavia, the Group refinanced a mortgage loan of 390 million Norwegian kroner (50 million euros) through a bond issue for the same amount. The disposal of a portfolio of 4 assets in Scandinavia enabled the repayment of several mortgage loans for the amount of 1.5 billion Norwegian kroner. The maturity of a 600 million Norwegian kroner bond was partially covered by a new unsecured issue of 300 million Norwegian kroner. Steen & Strøm also arranged a credit line of 300 million Norwegian kroner as base-up for commercial paper issuances. NOTE 2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND METHODS 2.1. Corporate reporting Klépierre is a French corporation (société anonyme or SA) subject to French company legislation, and more specifically the provisions of the French Commercial Code. The Company’s registered office is located at 21 avenue Kléber in Paris. On January 27, 2014, the Executive Board approved the Klépierre SA consolidated financial statements for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2013 and authorized their publication. Klépierre shares are traded on the Euronext Paris™ market (Compartment A). 2.2. Principles of financial statement preparation In accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1126/2008 of November 3, 2008 on the application of international accounting standards, the Klépierre group consolidated financial statements to December 31, 2013 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS published by the IASB, as adopted by the European Union and applicable on that date. The IFRS framework as adopted by the European Union includes the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), the IAS (International Accounting Standards) and their interpretations (SIC and IFRIC). This framework is available on the website: http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm ANN UAL R E POR T 189 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 CO NSO LIDAT E D FINANCI AL STAT E ME N T S AS OF DEC E MB E R 31 , 2 01 3 NO TE S TO THE CO N SOL I DAT ED F I N A N C I A L STAT EM EN T S 6 The consolidated financial statements to December 31, 2013 are presented in the form of complete accounts including all the information required by the IFRS framework. 2.2.1. Standards, amendments and applicable interpretations as of January 1st, 2013 The accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 are identical to those used in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2012, with the exception of the adoption of the following new standards and interpretations, for which application is mandatory for the Group: Amendment to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements – Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income; Amendment to IAS 12: Deferred Tax – Recovery of Underlying Assets; Amendment to IAS 19: Employee Benefits; Amendment to IFRS 7: Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities; Amendment to IFRS 1: Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters; IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement; Annual improvements (2009-2011 cycle): A  nnual improvements of IFRS (2009-2011 cycle) IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment” IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” These amendments had no significant impact on the Group’s financial statements at December 31, 2013 except for IAS 19 amendment and IFRS 13. The first time application of IAS 19 amendment resulted in the recognition in equity of actuarial gains and losses balance amounting to 904 thousand euros at December 31, 2012. According to IFRS 13, the fair values are classified by level in the fair value hierarchy: the instrument is quoted in an active market (Level 1); the valuation uses measurement techniques based on observable inputs, either directly (price) or indirectly (derived from price) (Level 2); at least one significant component of the fair value is based on unobservable inputs (Level 3). All derivatives held by the Group were classified as level 2 instruments. The valuation of the derivatives was done taking into account the “Credit Valuation Adjustment” and the “Debit Valuation Adjustment” accordingly to IFRS 13. The impact is a positive fair value adjustment of 1 483 thousand euros in the result of the period on the item “Change in the fair value of financial instruments”. CVA, calculated for a given counterparty, is the product of: the total market value the Group has with this counterparty, in case it is positive; the probability of default of this counterparty. This probability of default is taken from rating agencies for a maturity of five years; and the loss given default set at 60% following market standard. DVA, corresponds to the loss that the Group’s counterparties may face in case of the Group’s default. It is the product of: the total market value the Group has with a counterparty, in case it is negative, to which an add-on of 1% of the notional is applied; the probability of default of the Group. The Group’s probability of default is taken form rating agencies for a maturity of five years; and the loss given default set at 60% following market standard. Fair values of investment properties used for impairment tests realized on assets are classified in level 3 (see note 2.12.2). Further to the application of the standard IFRS 13, there was no change in the appraisers’ valuation method but additional information will be given in the notes. Consequently, quantitative information on the assumptions used for the determination of the fair values of the investment properties is presented note 5.4. 2.2.2. Standards, amendments and interpretations of not compulsory application as from January 1st, 2013 Klépierre has not applied early the new standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the European Union where application in 2013 was optional. This applies to the following standards: Amendment to IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements; Amendment to IAS 28: Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures; Amendment to IAS 32: Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities; IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements; IFRS 11: Joint Arrangements; IFRS 12: Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities; Amendment to IFRS 10, 11, 12: Transaction Guidance; Amendment to IAS 36: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets; Amendment to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 et IAS 27: Investment Entities; Amendment IAS 39 & IFRS 9: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting. The process of determination by Klépierre of the potential impacts on the consolidated financial statements of the Group is in progress. The impacts estimated for IFRS 10, 11 and 12 are presented in note 2.2.3. The following standards have been published by the IASB but not yet adopted by the European Union: ANNUAL REPOR T 190 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 CO NSO LIDAT E D FI N AN C I AL STAT E ME N T S AS OF DEC E MB E R 31 , 2 01 3 NO TES TO THE CON SOL I DAT ED F I N A N C I A L STAT EMEN T S 6 IFRS 9: Financial Instruments; IFRIC 21: Levies. 2.2.3. Assessment of the impact of the new standards 2.2.3.1. IFRS 10 & 11 standards As part of the mandatory adoption of IFRS 10 and 11 on January 1, 2014, the Group first conducted an analysis of all shareholders agreements in order to evaluate the level of the Group’s control over the assets concerned. Application of the new standards would lead to the consolidation of 29 companies by the equity method that were previously consolidated by proportional method, in particular the companies owning the shopping centers Le Millénaire in France, Portimão in Portugal, Lonato and Verona in Italy and Åsane and Økern in Norway (see note 4 for an exhaustive list of the concerned companies). The change in the method of consolidation of the companies concerned does not have any impact on the “Net income of consolidated entity – Group share”. Following this assessment, the impacts at December 31, 2013 on the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group are estimated as follows: Consolidated Restated consolidated Balance sheet accounts IFRS 10-11 accounts (in thousands of euros) 12/31/2013 Restatements 12/31/2013 ASSETS Investment properties 11 280 396 -692 466 10 587 930 Equity method securities 19 910 450 651 470 561 Loans granted to equity method investees – 193 695 193 695 Financial assets and other non-current assets 23 485 2 23 487 Deferred tax assets 57 709 -3 964 53 744 Cash and cash equivalents 142 368 -14 873 127 496 Other items 646 480 -31 433 615 047 TOTAL ASSETS 12 170 347 -98 387 12 071 960 LIABILITIES Shareholder's equity 3 397 455 – 3 397 455 Financial liabilities 7 471 798 -65 245 7 406 554 Deferred tax liabilities 365 968 -12 973 352 995 Other items 935 125 -20 169 914 956 TOTAL LIABILITIES 12 170 347 -98 387 12 071 960 At December 31, 2013, the impacts on the main entries in the Group’s income statement are the following: Consolidated Restated consolidated Income statement accounts IFRS 10-11 accounts (in thousands of euros) 12/31/2013 Restatements 12/31/2013 Net rents 892 762 -47 766 844 996 Deprectiation and impairment -392 791 23 497 -369 293 Net cost of debt -326 721 8 640 -318 081 Corporate income tax -30 998 1 068 -29 930 Share in earnings of equity method investees 1 705 11 107 12 812 Other items -6 938 3 454 -3 484 NET INCOME 137 020 0 137 020 2.2.3.2. IFRS 12 As part of the mandatory adoption of IFRS 12 on January 1, 2014, the Group performed an analysis to determine the nature of its interests held in other entities and the associated risks and to distinguish, among the newly equity-consolidated entities, the companies that are jointly controlled from those in which it has significant influence. The main partnerships of the Klépierre Group are described below. Åsane Storsenter DA and Økern Sentrum Ans The Group holds 56.10% of the equity shares and voting rights of the holding company holding respectively 49.9% of the company Åsane Storsenter DA and 50% of the company Økern Sentrum. The remaining percentages are held by the partner Nordea for Åsane and the partner Storebrand for Økern. In the 2 partnerships, each partner has the right to elect the same number of members of the Board of Directors. Decisions require the consent of the 2 parties. These companies are thus jointly controlled. As these are joint-ventures, these companies will be consolidated using the equity method starting January 1st 2014.

The co-managing directors compensation is approved by collective decision of the shareholders, and these latter can only withdraw themselves totally or partially when unanimously authorized by the other associates. Consequently, SCI du Bassin Nord is considered as being jointly controlled and will be consolidated using the equity method. Holding Klege and Klege Portugal The Group holds 50% of the equity shares and voting rights of the holding company owning 100% of the company Klege Portugal. Each partner has the right to appoint the same number of members to the Board of Directors. The Chairman is appointed for a period of twelve continuous months on an alternating basis with the partner. All decisions are adopted on simple majority. The sub-group is jointly controlled and will be consolidated using the equity method. Clivia 2000 & Galleria Comerciale Il Destriero The companies Clivia 2000 and Galleria Commerciale Il Destriero are 50% held by the Klépierre Group and its partner Finiper Group. Each shareholder has equal representation within the Board of Directors. The Chairman and the Vice Chairman are appointed for a period of three consecutive years, on an alternating basis with the partner. Consequently, these companies shall be consolidated using the equity method, being considered as a joint-venture. Nordica Hodlco SA (parent company of the Steen & Strøm Group) Nordica Holdco SA is a company jointly held at 56.10% by the Klépierre Group and 43.9% by the ABP partner. The Group has the right to appoint 3 members to the Board of Directors including the Chairman, whereas the partner can appoint 2 members. This latter has protective rights pursuant to the shareholders agreement and following the analysis of the decisions reserved for the partner. As the Group controls Nordica Holdco it is consolidated by full integration. 2.3. Consolidated financial statements – basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Klépierre SA and its subsidiaries for the period to December 31, 2013. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same accounting period as that of the parent company using consistent accounting methods. The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of the historical cost principle, with the exception of financial derivatives and available-for-sale financial assets, which are measured at fair value. The book value of assets and liabilities covered by fair-value hedges, which would otherwise be measured at cost, is adjusted to reflect changes in the fair value of the hedged risks. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, with all amounts rounded to the nearest thousand unless otherwise indicated. 2.4. Use of material judgments and estimates In preparing these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, the Group management was required to use estimates and make a number of realistic and reasonable assumptions. Some facts and circumstances may lead to changes in these estimates and assumptions, which would affect the value of the Group’s assets, liabilities, equity and earnings. The principal assumptions made in respect of future events and other sources of uncertainty relating to the use of year-end estimates for which there is a significant risk of material change to the net book values of assets and liabilities in subsequent years are presented below: Measurement of goodwill The Group tests goodwill for impairment at least once a year. This involves estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. In order to determine their value in use, Klépierre prepares estimates based on expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit, and applies a pre-tax discount rate to calculate the current value of these cash flows. Investment property The Group appoints independent appraisers to perform half-yearly appraisals of its real estate assets in accordance with the methods described in Note 2.12.2. The appraisers make assumptions concerning future flows and rates that have a direct impact on the value of the buildings. Financial instruments The Group assesses the fair value of the financial instruments it uses in accordance with the standard models practiced on the market and IFRS 13 and described in Note 2.21.4 2.5. Options used under IFRS 1 As part of the first application of the IFRS framework, IFRS 1 provides exemptions from some provisions of other IFRS standards. The application of these exemptions is optional. For the Group, they relate mainly to: business combinations: non-restatements of business combinations occurring before the date of transition to IFRS; fair value or revaluation as deemed cost: use as deemed cost for property, plant and equipment and investment properties of the fair value applied in the consolidated financial statements in the revaluation carried out on January 1, 2003 following the adoption of SIIC (listed real estate company) status; share-based payment transactions: only plans granted after November 7, 2002 whose rights were not yet vested at January 1, 2005 were recognized as an expense on the income statement.

Scope and method of consolidation 2.6.1. Scope of consolidation The Klépierre consolidated financial statements cover all those companies over which Klépierre has control, joint control or significant influence. The percentage level of control takes account of the potential voting rights that entitle their holders to additional votes whenever these rights are immediately exercisable or convertible. Subsidiaries are consolidated starting the date on which the Group gains effective control. 2.6.2. Consolidation method The consolidation method is based on the degree of control exercised by the company. control: full consolidation. Control is presumed to exist where Klépierre directly or indirectly holds more than half of the company’s voting rights. Control is also presumed to exist where the parent company has the power to direct the financial and operational policies of the company and appoint, dismiss or convene the majority of the members of the Board of Directors or equivalent management body; joint control: proportional consolidation. Joint control exists where operational, strategic and financial decisions require unanimous agreement between the associates. The agreement is contractual, subject to bylaws and shareholder agreements; significant influence: consolidation using the equity method. Significant influence is defined as the power to contribute to a company’s financial and operating policy decisions, rather than to exercise sole or joint control over those policies. Significant influence is presumed where the Group directly or indirectly holds 20% or more of an entity’s voting rights. Investments in associates are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost, plus or minus the share of the net cash position generated after the acquisition, minus impairment; no influence: the company is not consolidated. Changes in equity of companies consolidated using the equity method are reported on the assets side of the balance sheet under “equity method securities” and under the corresponding equity item on the liabilities and equity side. Goodwill on companies consolidated using the equity method is also reported under “equity method securities”. 2.6.3. Intercompany transactions Intercompany balances and profits resulting from transactions between Group companies are eliminated. The internal profits eliminated relate in particular to the internal margin made on development fees incorporated into the cost price of capitalized assets or inventories by purchasing companies. 2.7. Accounting for business combinations The accounting rules for business combinations comply with IFRS 3 (revised). To decide whether a transaction is a business combination the Group notably considers whether an integrated set of activities is acquired besides the investment property. The criteria applied may include the number of property assets held by the target company, the extent of the acquired processes and, particularly, the auxiliary services provided by the acquired entity. If the acquired assets are not a business, the transaction is recorded as an asset acquisition. All business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred (acquisition cost) is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity issued and liabilities incurred at the transfer date. Identifiable assets and liabilities of the business acquired are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. Any liabilities are only recognized if they represent a real obligation at the date of the business combination and if their fair value can be reliably measured. For each business combination, the acquirer must measure all non-controlling interests held in the acquired company, either at their fair value at the acquisition date or at the corresponding share in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company. Any surplus of the consideration transferred and the value of non-controlling interests over the net fair value of the business’ identifiable assets and liabilities is recognized as goodwill. Costs directly linked to the acquisition are recognized as expenses. IFRS 3 (revised) stipulates a maximum period of twelve months from the acquisition date for the accounting of the acquisition to be finalized: adjustments to values applied must be related to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Therefore, beyond this 12-month period, any earn-out adjustment must be recognized in income for the fiscal year unless the additional consideration is an equity instrument. As regards the treatment of deferred tax assets, a gain in income for deferred tax assets unrecognized at the acquisition date or during the measurement period must be recognized. Where a business is acquired in stages, the previous investment is remeasured at fair value at the date control is transferred. Any difference between fair value and net book value of this investment is recognized in income for the fiscal year. The prospective accounting method of changes in the scope of consolidation was modified by the adoption of IAS 27 (revised), which specifies that: “Any change in the Group’s interest in an entity that results in a loss of control is recognized as a gain/loss on disposal and the remaining interest is remeasured at fair value with the change being recognized in income. Transactions that do not affect control (additional acquisition or disposal) shall lead to a further distribution of shareholders’ equity between the group share and the non-group share without an impact on profit or loss and/or a goodwill adjustment.” Goodwill is regularly reviewed by the Group and undergoes impairment testing at least once a year or if there is any indication of impairment. The method used by the Group to perform these impairment tests is explained in Note 2.12 Impairment of assets.

Translation of foreign currencies The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the operating and reporting currency used by Klépierre. Each Group entity nominates its own operating currency, and all items in its financial statements are measured in this operating currency. The Group’s foreign subsidiaries conduct some transactions in currencies other than their operating currency. These transactions are initially recorded in the operating currency at the exchange rate applying on the transaction date. On the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities stated in foreign currencies are translated into the operating currency at the exchange rate for that day. Non-monetary items stated in foreign currencies and measured at their historical cost are translated using the exchange rates applying on the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items stated in foreign currencies and measured at their fair value are translated using the exchange rates applicable on the dates when the fair values were calculated. On the balance sheet date, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into the Klépierre SA reporting currency – the euro – at the exchange rate applying on that date. Their income statements are translated at the average weighted exchange rate for the year. Any resulting translation differences are allocated directly to shareholder equity under a separate item. In the event of disposal of a foreign operation, the total accrued deferred exchange gain/loss recognized as a distinct component of equity for that foreign operation is recognized in the income statement. 2.9. Intangible assets An intangible asset is a non-monetary asset without physical substance. It must be simultaneously identifiable (and therefore separable from the acquired entity or arising from legal or contractual rights), controlled by the company as a result of past events and provide an expectation of future financial benefits. IAS 38 states that an intangible asset should be amortized only where it has a known useful life. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life should not be amortized, but should be tested annually for impairment (IAS 36) or whenever there is evidence of a loss of value. Assets recognized as intangible assets with finite useful lives should be amortized on a straight-line basis over periods that equate to their expected useful life. 2.10. Investment property According to IAS 40 almost all of Klépierre real estate meets the definition of “Investment property”. Buildings occupied by the Group are recognized as tangible assets. Klépierre opted to adopt IAS 40 using the cost accounting model on May 26, 2004 to maintain consistency between the accounting methods used by Klépierre and its then majority shareholder. Note 11.1 sets out pro forma financial data for investment properties on a fair value basis. 2.10.1. Cost model Fixed assets are recognized at cost, inclusive of duties and fees, and are depreciated using the component method. The distribution between non-depreciable values (land) and depreciable values (buildings) is established according to the methods set by the appraisers, i.e.: based on the land/building ratio for office buildings; by comparison with the reconstruction cost for shopping centers. Depreciation of these assets must reflect consumption of the related economic benefits. It should be: calculated on the basis of the depreciable amount, which is equivalent to the acquisition cost less the residual value of the assets; spread over the useful life of the fixed assets components. Where individual components have different useful lives, each component whose cost is significant relative to the total cost of the asset must be depreciated separately over its own useful life. After initial recognition, fixed assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. These assets are straightline depreciated over their useful life. The depreciation period, depreciation method and residual asset values should be reviewed at each balance sheet date. In addition, fixed assets are tested for impairment whenever there is evidence of a loss of value at June 30 or December 31. Where such evidence exists, the new recoverable asset value is compared against its net book value, and any impairment is recognized. Capital gains or losses realized on investment property disposals are recognized under “Income from disposal of investment property” in the income statement. 2.10.2. The component method The component method is applied based on the recommendations of the Fédération des Sociétés Immobilières et Foncières (French Federation of Property Companies) for components and useful life: for properties developed by the companies themselves, assets are classified by component type and recognized at cost; for other properties, components are broken down into 4 categories: business premises, shopping centers, offices and residential properties. 4 components have been identified for each of these asset types (in addition to land): structures; facades, cladding and roofing; general and technical installations (GTI); fittings. ANNUAL REPOR T 194 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 CO NSO LIDAT E D FI N AN C I AL STAT E ME N T S AS OF DEC E MB E R 31 , 2 01 3 NO TES TO THE CON SOL I DAT ED F I N A N C I A L STAT EMEN T S 6 Components are broken down based on the history and technical characteristics of each building. Klépierre uses the following matrix to determine components: Offices Shopping centers Retail stores Period QP Period QP Period QP Structures 60 years 60% 35 to 50 years 50% 30 to 40 years 50% Facades 30 years 15% 25 years 15% 15 to 25 years 15% GTI 20 years 15% 20 years 25% 10 to 20 years 25% Fittings 12 years 10% 10 to 15 years 10% 5 to 15 years 10% A wear and tear ratio is applied when the acquired property is not new. Purchase costs are split between land and buildings. The proportion allocated to buildings is amortized over the useful life of the structures. The residual value is equivalent to the current estimate of the amount the Company would achieve if the asset concerned were already of an age and condition commensurate with the end of its useful life, less disposal expenses. Given the useful life periods applied, the residual value of components is zero. 2.11. Investment property held for sale Investment properties under promise or mandate of sale are presented according to IFRS 5. The accounting impacts are as follows: reclassification as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell; investment properties concerned are presented separately in current assets; depreciation ceases. 2.12. Impairment of assets IAS 36 applies to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill. This standard requires assessing whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Such indications may include: a major decline in market value; significant changes in the technological, economic or legal environment. For the purposes of this test, assets are grouped into Cash Generating Units (CGUs). CGUs are standardized groups of assets whose continued use generates cash inflows that are largely separate from those generated by other asset groups. In most cases the Klépierre group treats each property and shopping center as a CGU. An impairment loss must be recognized wherever the recoverable value of an asset is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the fair value minus selling expenses or its value use, whichever is the higher. The method used to calculate the fair value of investment properties and investment properties under construction is described in Note 2.12.2. Value in use is calculated on the basis of discounted future cash flows expected to arise from the planned use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Under certain circumstances, the entity may later recognize all or part of such impairment losses in its income statement, with the exception of unallocated goodwill. 2.12.1. Measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets Group goodwill relates chiefly to Klépierre Management and management companies. Appraisal tests are conducted at least annually by an independent appraiser. Appraisals are updated to take into account any significant event occurring during the year. The appraisals conducted for Klépierre by Aon Accuracy are based chiefly on the range of estimated values generated by applying the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method over a period of five years. The first stage of this method involves estimating the future cash flows that could be generated by the business portfolio of each company, excluding any direct or indirect finance costs. In the second stage, cash flows and the probable value of the portfolio at the end of the forecast period (terminal value) are discounted at an appropriate rate. This discount rate is arrived at on the basis of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and is the sum of the following three components: the risk-free interest rate, a general market risk premium (forecast average market risk premium multiplied by the beta coefficient for the business portfolio) and a specific market risk premium (which takes account of the proportion of specific risk not already included in flows). In a third and final phase the value is obtained for each company’s equity by deducting its net debt and any non-controlling interests on the valuation date from the value of its business portfolio. Goodwill of Klépierre management and management companies The impairment test consists of comparing the net book asset value of the entities with the net asset value measured by the independent appraiser. The main assumptions used to calculate the enterprise value are the following: ANN UAL R E POR T 195 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 CO NSO LIDAT E D FINANCI AL STAT E ME N T S AS OF DEC E MB E R 31 , 2 01 3 NO TE S TO THE CO N SOL I DAT ED F I N A N C I A L STAT EM EN T S 6 the discount rate applied is 7.6% (7.6% at December 31, 2012) (except for Klépierre Management Magyarország and Klépierre Management Polska where the rate is 8.6% due to an additional specific risk premium, compared to 7.6% at December 31, 2012); the free cash flows over the duration of the business plan are based on business volume and operating margin assumptions that take into account economic and market assumptions on the date on which the plan was established; a growth rate for the 2014-2019 period based on the assumptions of the internal business plan approved by the management; Klépierre Management’s end value was determined with a growth rate applied from 2019 of 1%. At December 31, 2013, based on the assumptions described, the fair value of the net assets of Klépierre Management and management companies is greater than its book value at the same date. Goodwill of IGC The goodwill of IGC results from the recognition of deferred taxes at first consolidation. As a consequence, impairment tests performed on this goodwill at each closing consist on comparing its net book value with the amounts of expected tax optimization. Finally, after initial recognition, other intangible assets are recognized at cost, less any related depreciation and impairment losses. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are straight-line depreciated over their useful life. Useful lives are examined annually and an impairment test is conducted if there is any indication of impairment. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized. The indefinite nature of the useful life is reviewed annually. These assets are tested for impairment annually, or if there is any indication of impairment, by comparing the book value against the recoverable value. In the event of impairment, an impairment loss is recognized in income. The Klépierre Group’s intangible assets are not subject to an external appraisal. 2.12.2. Fair value of investment property The fair value of Klépierre’s investment properties is appraised by the independent appraisers responsible for valuing the Group’s assets on June 30 and December 31 of each year, but excludes transfer duties and fees (fees are measured on the basis of a direct sale of the asset, even though these costs can, in some cases, be reduced by selling the company that owns the asset). The fair values are determined in compliance with evaluation rules described in IFRS 13. In addition, given the complexity of real estate asset valuations and the nature of certain non-public data (such as the growth of lease rate, capitalization rates), the fair values of the investment properties have been classified as level 3 according to IFRS 13 criteria. Given the fact that these appraisals are, by their nature, estimates, it is possible that the amount realized on the disposal of some real estate assets will differ from the appraised value of those assets, even where such disposal occurs within a few months of the balance sheet date. Klépierre entrusts the task of appraising its real estate assets to various appraisers. Shopping centers are appraised by: Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) appraises French assets (except for Klécar France), all Polish, Greek and Belgian assets and 50% of Hungarian and Norwegian assets and a part of the Italian portfolio (shopping centers not fully owned by the Group); Auguste-Thouard appraises the Klécar France, the Roques-sur-Garonne shopping center, approximately 50% of Spanish assets and all of the Portuguese assets; DTZ appraises 8 French assets (Maisonément, Boulogne, Créteil, Drancy, Pontault-Combault, Val d’Europe, Claye-Souilly and St.Lazare Paris), Danish, Swedish, Czech and Slovakian assets, 50% of Norwegian, Spanish and Hungarian assets and a part of the Italian portfolio (shopping centers 100% owned by the Group). Retail stores are appraised by: Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) appraises Feu-Vert assets and Buffalo Grill restaurants; BNP Paribas Real Estate appraises the Défi Mode, Sephora, King Jouet, Cap Nord, Akene, Da Costa and Delbard portfolios. All appraisals are conducted in accordance with the principles of the Charte de l’Expertise en Évaluation Immobilière, AMF recommendations of February 8, 2010 and RICS standards. The fees paid to appraisers, agreed prior to their appraisal of the properties concerned, are fixed on a lump sum basis to reflect the number and complexity of the assets appraised. The fee is entirely unrelated to the appraised value of the assets concerned. (in thousands of euros) Appraisal fees JLL 611 Auguste-Thouard 576 DTZ 428 TOTAL 1 615 All Klépierre Group assets are systematically appraised using 2 methods: yield method and discounted cash flows. According to the yield method, to determine the fair market value of a shopping center, appraisers apply a yield rate to net annual rents for occupied premises, and to the net market rent for vacant properties, discounted for the anticipated period of vacancy. The present value of rebates on minimum guaranteed rent payments, expenses payable on currently vacant premises and non-chargeable work is then deducted from the fair market value calculated above. ANNUAL REPOR T 196 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 CO NSO LIDAT E D FI N AN C I AL STAT E ME N T S AS OF DEC E MB E R 31 , 2 01 3 NO TES TO THE CON SOL I DAT ED F I N A N C I A L STAT EMEN T S 6 A standard vacancy rate is then defined for each asset. The discount rate applied is the same as the yield rate used in the fair market value calculation. Gross rent includes the minimum guaranteed rent, the variable part of the rent and the market rental price for vacant properties. The net total rent is calculated by deducting the following expenses from the gross rent: management charges, non-reinvoiced charges, expenses relating to provisions for vacant premises and the average loss on bad debts over the previous five years. The yield rate is set by the appraiser based on a range of parameters, the most important of which are: retail sales area, layout, competition, type and percentage of ownership, lease income and extension potential and comparability with recent transactions in the market. The discounted cash flows method calculates the value of an asset as the sum of discounted future cash flows based on a discount rate defined by the appraiser. The appraiser estimates anticipated total revenues and expenses relating to the asset, and then measures a “terminal value” at the end of an average ten-year analytical period. By comparing the market rental values with face rental values, the appraiser assesses the reversion potential of the asset, using the market rental value at the end of the lease, after deduction of the expenses incurred in remarketing the property. Lastly the appraiser discounts the forecast cash flow to determine the present value of the property. The discount rate adopted reflects the market risk-free rate (ten-year OAT bond) plus a property market risk and liquidity premium and an asset-specific premium reflecting the location, specification and tenancy of each building. Investment properties under construction and covered by irrevocable development permission also fall within the scope of IAS 40 and are subject to internal valuations. 2.13. Inventory IAS 2 defines inventory as assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, assets in progress and intended for sale and materials and supplies (raw materials) intended for consumption in the production of products and services. Impairment must be recognized if the net realizable value (fair value net of estimated costs of completion and estimated costs needed to make the sale) is lower than the recognized cost. 2.14. Leases 2.14.1. Leases According to IAS 17, the Group distinguishes 2 types of lease: finance lease, which is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards inherent in the ownership of an asset to the lessee. Title to the asset may or may not eventually be transferred at the end of the lease term; other leases are classified as operating leases. 2.14.2. Recognition of stepped rents and rent-free periods Lease income from operating leases is recognized over the full lease term on a straight-line basis. Stepped rents and rent-free periods are recognized as additions to, or deductions from, lease income for the fiscal year. The reference period adopted is the first firm lease term. 2.14.3. Entry fees Entry fees received by the lessor are recognized as supplementary rent. Entry fees are part of the net amount exchanged between the lessor and the lessee under a lease. For this purpose, the accounting periods during which this net amount is recognized should not be affected by the form of the agreement or the rent payment schedule. Entry fees are spread over the first firm lease term. 2.14.4. Early termination indemnities Tenants who terminate their leases prior to the contractual expiration date are liable to pay early termination penalties. Such penalties are allocated to the terminated contract and credited to income for the period in which they are recognized. 2.14.5. Eviction compensation When a lessor terminates a lease prior to the expiration date, he must pay eviction compensation to the tenant. Replacement of a tenant Where the payment of eviction compensation enables asset performance to be maintained or improved (higher rent, and therefore higher asset value), revised IAS 16 allows for this expense to be capitalized as part of the cost of the asset, provided that the resulting increase in value is confirmed by independent appraisers. Where this is not the case, the cost is recognized as an expense. Renovation of a property requiring the removal of resident tenants Where eviction compensation is paid as a result of the fact that major renovation or reconstruction of a property requires the prior removal of tenants, the cost of the compensation is treated as a preliminary expense and recognized as an additional component of the total renovation cost.

Building leases: IAS 40 and IAS 17 Land and building leases are classified as operating or finance leases, and are treated in the same way as leases for other types of assets. Further to the improvements made to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 2009, IAS 17 was subject to an amendment related to the classification of land elements of leases. Until 2009, leased land was classified under operating leases (unless the ownership of the land was intended to be transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease). With effect from January 1, 2010, when a lease comprises both land and building elements, an entity is required to assess the classification of each element as a finance or operating lease individually, based on criteria provided by IAS 17 (an important factor to take into account is that, in principle, land has an indefinite economic useful life). Klépierre considered that, for the land elements of building contracts, the criterion of an operating lease was fulfilled. Initial payments made in this respect therefore constitute pre-lease payments, and are amortized over the term of the lease in accordance with the pattern of benefits provided. Analysis is on a lease-by-lease basis. Under the IAS 40 components method, these initial payments are classified as prepaid expenses. 2.15. Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognized and measured at invoice face value minus accruals for non-recoverable amounts. Bad debts are estimated when it is likely that the entire amount receivable will not be recovered. When identified as such, non-recoverable receivables are recognized as losses. 2.16. Borrowing costs Under IAS 23, borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of eligible assets are included in the cost of the respective assets. When a loan is not directly attributable to an asset, Klépierre uses the capitalization rate applied to the expenses related to the asset in order to measure the attributable cost; if several non-specific borrowing lines exist, the capitalization rate is the weighted average rate of those loans observed during fiscal year 2013. 2.17. Provisions and contingent liabilities In accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets”, a provision is recognized where the Group has a liability towards a third party, and it is probable or certain that an outflow of resources will be required to settle this liability without an equivalent or greater amount expected to be received from the third party concerned. IAS 37 requires that non-interest-bearing long-term liabilities are discounted. 2.18. Current and deferred taxes 2.18.1. The tax status of Sociétés d’investissement immobilier cotées (SIIC) At the general meeting of shareholders held on September 26, 2003, Klépierre was authorized to adopt the SIIC tax status. General features of the SIIC tax status All SIICs are entitled to the corporate tax exemption status introduced by article 11 of the 2003 French Finance Act as implemented under the decree of July 11, 2003 provided that their stock is listed on a regulated French market, that they are capitalized at 15 million euros or more and that their corporate purpose is either the purchase or construction of properties for rent or direct or indirect investment in entities with that corporate purpose. The option to adopt SIIC status is irrevocable. Subsidiaries subject to corporate income tax and owned at least 95% by the Group may also claim SIIC status. In return for tax exemption, till December 31 2012 companies had to distribute 85% of their rental income, 50% of the capital gains made on property disposals and 100% of the dividends received from their subsidiaries subject to SIIC status. The 2013 Amending Finance Law made some amendments to the SIIC regime. From fiscal year 2013, companies now have to pay out 95% of rental income and 60% of the capital gains made on property disposals. They must continue to pay out 100% of any dividends received from subsidiaries. The new entities claiming SIIC status are immediately subject to a 19% exit tax on unrealized gains on properties and on shares in partnerships not subject to corporate income tax. 25% of the exit tax is payable on December 15 of the year in which SIIC status is first adopted, with the balance payable over the following three years. Discounting of exit tax liability The exit tax liability is discounted on the basis of its payment schedule. This liability is payable over a four-year period, commencing at the point when the entity concerned adopts SIIC status. Following initial recognition in the balance sheet, the liability is discounted and an interest expense is recognized in the income statement on each balance sheet date. In this way, the liability is reduced to its net present value on that date. The discount rate is calculated on the basis of the interest rate curve, taking into account the deferment period and the Klépierre refinancing margin. Corporate income tax on companies not eligible for SIIC status Since adopting SIIC status in 2003, Klépierre SA has made a distinction between SIICs that are exempt from property leasing and capital gains taxes, and other companies that are subject to those taxes. Corporate income tax on non-SIICs is calculated in accordance with French common law.

French common law and deferred tax The corporate income tax charge is calculated in accordance with the rules and rates adopted or virtually adopted at the end of the reporting period in each Group operating country for the period to which the profit or loss applies. Both current and future income taxes are offset where such offsetting is legally permissible and where they originate within the same tax consolidation Group and are subject to the same tax authority. Deferred taxes are recognized where there are timing differences between the carrying amounts of balance sheet assets and liabilities and their tax bases, and taxable income is likely in future periods. A deferred tax asset is recognized where tax losses are carried forward on the assumption that the entity concerned is likely to generate future taxable income against which those losses can be offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the liability method and the tax rate expected to apply when the asset is realized or the liability settled on the basis of the tax rates and tax regulations adopted, or to be adopted before the balance sheet date. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities must reflect the tax consequences arising as a result of the way in which the company expects to recover or settle the carrying amounts of its assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. All current and deferred tax is recognized as tax income or expense in the income statement, except for deferred tax recognized or settled at the time of acquiring or disposing of a subsidiary or investment and unrealized capital gains and losses on assets held for sale. In these cases, the associated deferred tax is recognized as equity. Deferred tax is calculated at the local rate applicable at the closing date. The main rates applied are: France 34.43%, Spain 30%, Italy 31.40%, Belgium 33.99%, Greece 26%, Portugal 26.5%, Poland 19%, Hungary 10%, Czech Republic 19%, Slovakia 23%, Sweden 22% and Norway 27%. 2.19. Treasury shares All treasury shares held by the Group are recognized at their acquisition cost and deducted from equity. Any gain arising on the disposal of treasury shares is recognized immediately as equity, such that disposal gains or losses do not impact the net income for the fiscal year. 2.20. Distinction between liabilities and equity The difference between liabilities and equity depends on whether or not the issuer is bound by an obligation to make a cash payment to the other party. The fact of being able to make such a decision regarding cash payment is the crucial distinction between these 2 concepts. 2.21. Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets include long-term financial investments, current assets representing accounts receivable, debt securities and investment securities (including derivatives) and cash. Financial liabilities include borrowings, other forms of financing and bank overdrafts, derivatives and accounts payable. IAS 39 “Financial instruments: recognition and measurement” describes how financial assets and liabilities must be measured and recognized. 2.21.1. Measurement and recognition of financial assets Loans and receivables These include receivables from investments, other loans and receivables. All are recognized at amortized cost, which is calculated using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that precisely discounts estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of the financial instrument. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets include equity interests. Equity interests are the holdings maintained by the Group in non-consolidated companies. Investments in equity instruments not listed in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured must be measured at cost. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash held in bank accounts, short-term deposits maturing in less than three months, money market funds and other marketable securities. 2.21.2. Measurement and recognition of financial liabilities With the exception of derivatives, all loans and other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Recognition of liabilities at amortized cost In accordance with IFRS, redemption premiums on bonds and debt issuance expenses are deducted from the nominal value of the loans concerned and incorporated into the calculation of the effective interest rate. Application of the amortized cost method to liabilities hedged at fair value Changes in the fair value of (the effective portion of) swaps used as fair value hedges are balanced by remeasurement of the hedged risk component of the debt. ANN UAL R E POR T 199 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 CO NSO LIDAT E D FINANCI AL STAT E ME N T S AS OF DEC E MB E R 31 , 2 01 3 NO TE S TO THE CO N SOL I DAT ED F I N A N C I A L STAT EM EN T S 6 Given that the characteristics of derivatives and items hedged at fair value are similar in most instances, any ineffective component carried to hedging profit or loss will be minimal. If a swap is canceled before the due date of the hedged liability, the amount of the debt adjustment will be amortized over the residual term using the effective interest rate calculated at the date the hedge ended. Measurement and recognition of derivatives As the parent company, Klépierre takes responsibility for almost all Group funding and provides centralized management of interest and exchange rate risks. This financial policy involves Klépierre in implementing the facilities and associated hedging instruments required by the Group. Klépierre hedges its liabilities using derivatives and has consequently adopted hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39: hedges to cover balance sheet items whose fair value fluctuates in response to interest rate, credit or exchange rate risks (fair value hedge); hedges to cover the exposure to future cash flow risk (cash flow hedges), which consists of fixing future cash flows of a variable-rate liability or asset. The Klépierre portfolio meets all IAS 39 hedge definition and effectiveness criteria. The adoption of hedge accounting has the following consequences: fair value hedges of existing assets and liabilities: the hedged portion of the asset/liability is accounted for at fair value in the balance sheet. The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized immediately in profit or loss. At the same time, there is an opposite corresponding adjustment in the fair value of the hedging instrument, in line with its effectiveness; cash flow hedges: the portion of the gain or loss on the fair value of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in equity and recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash transaction affects profit or loss. The gain or loss from the change in value of the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument is recognized immediately in profit or loss. 2.21.3. Recognition date: trade or settlement IFRS aims at reflecting the time value of financial instruments as closely as possible by ensuring that, wherever possible, instruments with a deferred start date are recognized on the trade date, thus allowing calculation of the deferred start date. However, this principle cannot be applied to all financial instruments in the same way. For example, commercial paper is often renewed a few days before its due date. If these instruments were recognized at their trade date, this would artificially inflate the amount concerned between the renewal trade date of a paper and its effective start date. Klépierre applies the following rules: derivatives are recognized at their trade date, since their measurement effectively takes account of any deferred start dates; other financial instruments (especially liabilities) are recognized on the basis of their settlement date. 2.21.4. Method used to calculate fair value Financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value are measured either on the basis of market price or by applying measurement models that apply the market parameters that existed on the balance sheet date. The term “model” refers to mathematical methods based on generally-accepted financial theories. The realizable value of these instruments may differ from the fair value adopted when preparing the financial statements. For any given instrument, an active, and therefore liquid, market is any market in which transactions take place regularly on the basis of reliable levels of supply and demand, or in which transactions involve instruments that are very similar to the instrument being measured. Where prices quoted on an active market are available on the closing date, they are used to determine fair value. Listed securities and derivatives traded on organized markets such as futures or option markets are therefore measured in this way. Most OTC (Over The Counter) derivatives, swaps, futures, caps, floors and simple options are traded on active markets. They are measured using generally-accepted models (discounted cash flow, Black and Scholes, interpolation techniques, etc.) based on the market prices of such instruments or similar underlying values. 2.21.5. Tax treatment of changes in fair value In Klépierre’s case: the non-SIIC part of the deferred tax on financial instruments recognized at fair value is calculated pro rata of net financial income; the financial instruments of foreign subsidiaries recognized at fair value generate a deferred tax calculation on the basis of the rates applying in the country concerned. 2.22. Employee benefits Employee benefits are recognized as required by IAS 19, which applies to all payments made for services rendered, except for share-based payment, which is covered by IFRS 2. All employee benefits, whether paid in cash or in kind, short term or long term, must be classified into one of the following 4 main categories: short-term benefits, such as salaries and wages, annual vacation, mandatory and discretionary profit-sharing schemes and company contributions; post-employment benefits: these relate primarily to supplementary pension payments in France, and private pension schemes elsewhere; ANNUAL REPOR T 200 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 CO NSO LIDAT E D FI N AN C I AL STAT E ME N T S AS OF DEC E MB E R 31 , 2 01 3 NO TES TO THE CON SOL I DAT ED F I N A N C I A L STAT EMEN T S 6  ther long-term benefits, which include paid vacation, long-service payments, and some deferred payment schemes paid in monetary units; o severance pay. Measurement and recognition methods vary depending on the category of benefit. 2.22.1. Short-term benefits The Company recognizes an expense when it uses services provided by its employees and pays agreed benefits in return. 2.22.2. Post-employment benefits In accordance with generally-accepted principles, the Group makes a distinction between defined contribution and defined benefit plans. “Defined contribution plans” do not generate a liability for the Company, and therefore are not provisioned. Contributions paid during the period are recognized as an expense. “Defined benefit plans” only do generate a liability for the Company, and are therefore measured and provisioned. The classification of a benefit into one or other of these categories relies on the economic substance of the benefit, which is used to determine whether the Group is required to provide the promised benefit to the employee under the terms of an agreement or an implicit obligation. Post-employment benefits classified as defined benefit plans are quantified actuarially to reflect demographic and financial factors. The amount of the commitment to be provisioned is calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions adopted by the company and by applying the projected unit credit method. The value of any hedging assets (plan assets and redemption rights) is deducted from the resulting figure. 2.22.3. Long-term benefits These are benefits other than post-employment benefits and severance pay, which are not payable in full within twelve months of the end of the financial year in which the employees concerned provided the services in question. The actuarial measurement method applied is similar to that used for post-employment defined benefits, except that actuarial gains or losses are recognized immediately and no corridor is applied. Furthermore, any gain or loss resulting from changes to the plan, but deemed to apply to past services, is recognized immediately. 2.22.4. Severance pay Employees receive severance pay if their employment with the Group is terminated before they reach the statutory retirement age or if they accept voluntary redundancy. Severance pay falling due more than twelve months after the balance sheet date is discounted. 2.23. Share-based payments According to IFRS 2, all share-based payments must be recognized as expenses when use is made of the goods or services provided in return for these payments. For the Klépierre Group, this standard applies primarily to the purchase of shares to meet the commitments arising from its employee stock option scheme. Stock subscription options granted to employees are measured at their fair value determined on the date of allocation. This fair value is not subsequently remeasured for equity-settled share-based payment transactions, even if the options are never exercised. This value, which is applied to the number of options eventually vested at the end of the vesting period (estimate of the number of options canceled owing to departures from the company) is booked as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity which is spread over the vesting period (i.e. the period during which employees must work for the Company before they can exercise the options granted to them). This employee expense reflecting the options granted (corresponding to the fair value of services rendered by employees) is measured by a specialist third-party company. The model adopted complies with the basic assumptions of the Black and Scholes model, adapted to the specific characteristics of the options concerned. 2.24. Segment information IFRS 8 requires the presentation of information about the operating segments of the Group, and replaces the previous provisions applying to the determination of primary (business segments) and secondary segments (geographic segments). Operating segments are identified on the basis of the internal reporting model used by management when evaluating performance and allocating resources. They are limited neither by lines of business nor geography. The various operating segments adopted by Klépierre are presented in Section 3. 2.25. Net earnings per share Earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of current shares in circulation, excluding treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of current shares in circulation, excluding treasury shares, and adjusted to reflect the effects of the diluting options adopted. In accordance with IAS 33, the average number of shares at the balance sheet date is adjusted after payment of the dividend in the form of shares if necessary.

SEGMENT INFORMATION 3.1. Segment income statement at December 31, 2013 For management purposes, the Group is structured into business segments and geographic regions. There are 8 operating segments. Shopping centers are structured into 6 operating segments: France-Belgium (France, Belgium); Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden and Denmark); Italy; Iberia (Spain, Portugal); Central Europe (Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic); other countries (Greece, Slovakia). The remaining 2 operating segments are retail assets and office buildings. The management team monitors the operating results of each business segment independently as a basis for segment decision-making and performance evaluation. Group financial policy (including the impact of financial income and expenses), corporate activities and fiscal result calculation are handled at Group level, and are not allocated to the operating segments.

Main events of the year: In France: – After the tender offer followed by a squeeze-out procedure for the shares of Klémurs which took place respectively from February 21 to March 8, 2013 and from 10 to April 15, 2013, Klépierre SA acquired all of the minority interests, i.e. 15.89% of the capital. The interest held in the share capital of Klémurs increased from 84.11% to 100%. As a result, the interest held in the subsidiaries Klecapnor and Immo Dauland, increased respectively from 84.11% and 84.13% to 100%. The subsidiaries remain consolidated under full integration method. This acquisition of non-controlling interests was recorded as an equity transaction, being a transaction without change in control. As a consequence no goodwill adjustment was recorded. – On November 29, 2013, Klépierre acquired the 50% held by Icade in the Odysseum shopping center in Montpellier (SCI Odysseum Place de France). Following this transaction, Klépierre held 100% of this center. The company is thus consolidated by full integration. This transaction also led to the acquisition of the company SCI Odysseum 2 and the creation of the company SCI Kléber Odysseum, both wholly-owned by Klépierre and consolidated by full integration. This acquisition was handled as a business combination achieved in stages. The fair value on the date of acquisition of the equity stake of shareholders’ equity held by the Group in Odysseum immediately prior to the acquisition totaled 74.4 million euros. An amount of 20.3 million euros was recognized in the line “Income from the disposal of investment properties” in the statement of comprehensive income following the adjustment to fair value of the equity share held by the acquirer before the business combination. The total of net assets at fair value recognized in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date amounts to 148.8 million euros. The 148.8 million euros consideration breaks down into 74.4 million euros of cash for the additional acquisition of 50% of the shares of the company and 74.4 million euros for the previously held 50% revalued at the acquisition date. Since the acquisition date, the SCI Odysseum Place de France contributed 100% to the lease income for 1.3 million euros and to the net result for 0.5 million euros (excluding revaluation). If the acquisition had taken place in the beginning of the year, the contribution at 100% of the company would have been: (in thousands of euros) Lease income 15 270 Profit before tax 6 485 In Norway: – The Group sold 50% of the shares of Nordbyen Senter DA to the company KLP in early February 2013. The subsidiary is now under joint control and therefore was proportionally consolidated from June 30, 2013. In accordance with IAS 27 revised, this transaction which resulted in a loss of control, led to the recognition of a capital gain on disposal and the remaining interest was remeasured at fair value with the change being recognized in income. – As part of the disposal of 4 shopping centers on November 29, 2013, 3 real estate companies left the consolidation scope (Torvbyen Senter AS, Os Alle 3 AS and Storvner Senter AS), as well as a management company (Torvbyen Drift AS). These 4 centers were acquired by Sektor Portefølje II AS, investment vehicle owned by Partner Group managed entities (75%), Sektor Gruppen AS (15%) and Steen & Strøm AS (10%). The residual participation of the Group in these 4 centers is considered as a short-term investment and is classified in investments held for sale in the consolidated financial statements. In Italy: – On December 5, 2013, Klépierre Luxembourg acquired 16.7% of the Italian company IGC from the company Finiper. Following this transaction, Klépierre Luxembourg held 88% of IGC. This transaction has no impact on the consolidation method. In accordance with IAS 27 revised, this acquisition of non-controlling interests was recorded as an equity transaction, being a transaction without change in control. Consequently, no additional goodwill was recognized.

The acquisition cost of purchased securities and gains made on sales of securities were respectively debited from, and credited to, equity. 5.14.3. Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests decreased by 59.8 million euros due to the changes in scope: the acquisition of all minority interests in Klémurs by Klepierre SA and the acquisition of 16.7% of non-controlling interests of the Italian company IGC by Klépierre Luxembourg (see note 4). The remaining change in non-controlling interests concerns the payment of the dividend. 5.15. Current and non-current financial liabilities 5.15.1. Change in indebtedness Current and non-current financial liabilities amount to 7 472 million euros as of December 31, 2013. Net indebtedness totaled 7 191 million euros, compared with 7 353 million euros at December 31, 2012. Net indebtedness is the difference between financial liabilities (excluding fair value hedge revaluation) plus bank overdrafts minus available cash and marketable securities. This 162 million euros decrease can be explained as follows: most of the financing needs for the period were generated by investments (440 million euros), and the payment of the dividend in respect of fiscal year 2012 (293 million euros); the financing needs for the period were covered by the company’s own financing resources, these being a combination of asset disposals (469.5 million euros) and free cash flow; the conversion of foreign currency net debt into euros generated a negative foreign exchange impact of 159 million euros, which reflects the depreciation of Scandinavian currencies against the euro.

Principal sources of financing The Group’s main financial resources are detailed in the table below. The main changes result from the signature of a syndicated revolving credit facility (750 million euros) and bilateral loans (300 million euros) for a total amount of 1 050 million euros. These funds allowed the company to waive undrawn bilateral credit lines maturing on 2016 and 2018 (1 000 million euros). In Scandinavia, the Group ensured the refinancing of a 390 million Norwegian kroner mortgage loan (50 million euros) by a bond issue for the same amount. Steen & Strøm also arranged a credit line of 300 million Norwegian kroner as back-up for commercial paper issuances. Further to the sale of 4 shopping centers in Norway, the Group proceeded to the early repayments of several mortgage loans for an amount of 1 500 million Norwegian kroner (179 million euros).

Hedging instruments 5.16.1. Rate hedging portfolio As part of its risk management policy (see section 8 “Exposure to risks and hedging strategy”), Klépierre has settled interest rate swap agreements allowing it to switch from floating rate to fixed rate debt and vice versa. Thanks to these instruments, the Group’s hedging rate (the proportion of gross financial debt arranged or hedged at fixed rate) was 69% at December 31, 2013.

Income from disposals of investment properties and equity interests Income from disposals totaled 173.4 million euros and resulted from the sale of: the investment property located at 21, avenue Kléber and the company’s business premises located at 21, rue La Pérouse in Paris; the office buildings of Paris Meyerbeer and Paris Neuilly Étoile; shopping centers located in Lomme, Chalon-sur-Saône Sud and Avignon in France and Markedet in Norway; 50% of the Norwegian shopping center Nordbyen (including revaluation of the remaining investment). The sale of equity investments concerns mainly Torvbyen, Senter Stovner and Halden shopping centers located in Norway. The income from disposal also includes the amount of the revaluation of the interests held by the Group in Odysseum (see note 4) before the acquisition of the remaining 50% held by Icade.

This gain mainly comprised of: a 6.5 million euros gain resulting from capitalization and use of losses carried forward during the period; a -4.5 million euros expense, due to the variation of deferred taxes on temporary differences related to investment properties; a -1.7 million euros expense related to the variation of other temporary differences (including deferred taxes on translation differences and derivatives). The “Other changes” column, showing a variation of 50.1 million euros, mainly records the effect of currency fluctuations for 14 million euros and the change in the scope of consolidation for 36 million euros. The ordinary tax losses carried forward are capitalized where their realization is deemed probable. The expected time scale for recovering tax loss carried forward capitalized for all entities within the Group is five to seven years.

EXPOSURE TO RISKS AND HEDGING STRATEGY Klépierre identifies and regularly measures its exposure to the various sources of risk (interest rates, liquidity, foreign exchange, counterparties, equity markets shares, etc.) and sets applicable management policies as required. The Group pays close attention to manage the inherent financial risks in its business activity and the financial instruments it uses. 8.1. Interest rate risk 8.1.1. Interest rate risk – exposure to variable-rate debt Recurrence of variable-rate financing requirement Variable-rate debt represents a significant proportion of the Group’s borrowings (56% at December 31, 2013 before hedging). It includes: bank loans (standard and mortgages), draw downs on syndicated loans, commercial paper and the use of authorized overdrafts. Identified risk An increase in the interest rate against which variable-rate debts are indexed could result in an increase in future interest rate expenses.

It includes the spreading of issue costs and premiums. Hedging strategy Klépierre has set a target hedging rate of approximately 70%. This rate is defined as the proportion of fixed-rate debt (after hedging) to gross borrowings. As the previous table shows, this rate was 69% as of December 31, 2013. In order to achieve its target rate, Klépierre focuses on the use of swap agreements, which enable fixed rates to be swapped for variable rates, and vice versa. Klépierre also hedges its risk from short-term rate increases by buying caps that limit the possible variations compared to a benchmark index. Given the nature of its business as a long-term property owner and its growth strategy, Klépierre is structurally a borrower. Since the Group is not seeking to reduce the proportion of short-term debt in its total indebtedness it is highly likely that its short-term variable-rate loans will be renewed in the medium term. This is the reason why Klépierre’s hedging strategy includes both the long-term and short-term aspects of its borrowings. Generally, hedge terms may exceed those of the debts hedged, on the condition that Klépierre’s financing plan emphasizes the high probability of these debts being renewed.

Interest rate risk – exposure to fixed-rate debt Description of fixed-rate borrowing The majority of Klépierre’s fixed-rate borrowing currently consists of bonds and mortgage loans in Scandinavia. The main source of additional fixed-rate debt is potentially the bond market or convertible bonds and other “equity-linked” products. Identified risk Klépierre’s fixed-rate debt exposes it to fluctuations in risk-free interest rates, as the fair value of fixed-rate debt increases as rates fall, and vice versa. At any given time, Klépierre may also find itself in the position of needing to increase its future fixed-rate debt (e.g.: for a future acquisition). It would then be exposed to the risk of a change in interest rate prior to arrangement of the loan. Klépierre may then consider hedging this risk, which is treated as a cash flow hedge risk under IFRS. Measurement of risk exposure and hedging strategy At December 31, 2013, fixed rate debt totaled 3 159 million euros before hedging. The fair value hedge strategy is calibrated to meet the overall hedging rate target. It is also based on the use of rate swaps allowing fixed-rate payments to be swapped to variable-rate payments. The credit margin component is not hedged. The duration of fair value hedge instruments is never longer than that of the debt hedged, since Klépierre wishes to obtain a very high level of effectiveness, as defined by IAS 32/39. 8.1.3. Marketable securities At December 31, 2013, Klépierre held 16.9 million euros of marketable securities. Cash equivalents refer only to amounts invested in French open-ended money market funds (13.4 million euros) and Italian treasury bills (3.5 million euros). These investments expose Klépierre to a moderate interest rate risk as a result of their temporary nature (cash investments) and the amounts involved. 8.1.4. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The Group recognizes the borrowings in the balance sheet at amortized cost. The following table compares the fair values of debts with their corresponding nominal values. Fair values are established on the basis of these principles: variable-rate bank debt: the fair value is equal to the nominal value; fixed-rate bank debt: the fair value is calculated solely on the basis of rate fluctuations; bonds (and convertibles, where applicable): use of market quotations where these are available. Klépierre has chosen not to revalue the margin component of these unlisted loans as the exceptionally difficult credit market conditions since the beginning of the financial crisis have accentuated the differences between margins on each market (bonds, corporate lending, mortgages, etc.) and made any assessment very uncertain. 12/31/2013 12/31/2012 Change in fair Change in fair value caused by value caused by a 1% increase a 1% increase (in millions of euros) Par value Fair value in interest rate(1) Par value Fair value in interest rate(1) Fixed-rate bonds 2 989 3 241 -133 2 995 3 247 -136 Fixed-rate bank loans 171 183 -2 169 178 -4 Other variable-rate loans 4 078 4 078 – 4 258 4 258 – TOTAL 7 237 7 501 -135 7 422 7 683 -140 (1) Change in the fair value of the debt as a result of a parallel shift in the rate curve. Derivatives are recognized in the balance sheet at their fair value. At December 31, 2013, a 1% rise in rates would have resulted in decrease of 36 million euros in the value of the Group’s euro-denominated interest rate derivatives.

Liquidity risk Klépierre is attentive to the long-term refinancing needs of its business and the need to diversify maturity dates and the sources of finance in such a way as to facilitate renewals. The average duration of indebtedness at December 31, 2013 was around five years, with borrowings spread between different markets (the bond market and commercial paper represent 54%, with the balance being raised in the banking market). Within the banking market, the company uses a range of different loans types (syndicated loans, mortgage loans, etc.) and counterparties. Outstanding commercial paper, which represents the bulk of short-term financing, never exceeds the backup lines. This means that the company can refinance immediately if it has difficulty renewing its borrowings on the commercial paper market. Klépierre also has unused credit lines (including bank overdrafts) totaling 1 733 million euros at December 31, 2013. These lines will be sufficient to absorb the main refinancing scheduled for the next year. Generally speaking, access to finance for real estate companies is facilitated by the security offered to lenders in the form of the companies’ property assets. Some Klépierre sources of funding (bilateral loans, bonds, etc.) are accompanied by financial covenants which could lead to a mandatory prepayment of the debt. These covenants are based on the standard ratios applying to real estate companies, and the limits imposed leave Klépierre with sufficient flexibility. Failure to comply with these covenants may result in compulsory early repayment. Klépierre SA bonds (2 989 million euros) include a bearer option, providing the possibility of requesting early repayment in the event of a change of control generating a change of Klépierre’s rating to “non-investment grade”. Apart from this clause, no other financial covenant refers to Standard & Poor’s rating for Klépierre. The main financial covenants are detailed in the financial report. 8.3. Currency risk Until its acquisition of Steen & Strøm in October 2008, the majority of Klépierre’s business was conducted within the Eurozone with the exception of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. The currency risk in these countries has not been assessed sufficiently high to warrant derivative hedging, since the acquisitions and the acquisition financing were denominated in euros. Generally, rents are invoiced to lessees in euros and converted into the local currency on the billing date. Lessees have the choice of paying their rents in local currency or in euros (or in dollars for some minority leases). The currency risk on minimum guaranteed rents is therefore limited to any variance between the rent as invoiced and the rent actually collected if the currency should fall in value against the euro between the invoice date and the date of payment in local currency by the lessee. At the same time, Klépierre ensures that rent payments from tenants do not represent an excessively high proportion of their revenue in order to avoid any worsening of their financial position in the event of a sharp increase in the value of the euro, which could increase the risk of their defaulting on payments due to Klépierre. In Scandinavia though, leases are denominated in local currency. Funding is therefore also raised in local currency. The principal exposure of the Klépierre group to Scandinavian currency risk is therefore limited essentially to the funds invested in the company (share in equity of Steen & Strøm), which were partially financed in euros. 8.4. Counterparty risk Counterparty risk is limited by the fact that Klépierre is structurally a borrower. This risk is therefore limited essentially to investments made by the Group and the Group’s derivative transactions counterparties. 8.4.1. Counterparty risk on marketable securities The counterparty risk on investments is limited by the type of products used: monetary UCITS managed by recognized institutions, and therefore carrying a range of signatures; government debt (loans or borrowings) of countries in which Klépierre operates; occasionally, deposit certificates issued by leading banks 8.4.2. Counterparty risk on hedging instruments Klépierre conducts derivative instrument transactions only with financial institutions recognized as financially sound. 8.5. Equity risk Klépierre holds no equities other than its own shares (3 913 822 shares at December 31, 2013), which are recognized in equity at their historical cost.

The price paid for Sadyba (part of the Polish acquisitions made in 2005) is subject to an earn-out clause. Klépierre does not own the land of the center fully but under a lease that expires July 31, 2021. An earn-out payment shall be made to the seller if the seller obtains, within ten years starting from July 2005, an extension of the lease or full ownership. As the probability of the lease being extended or full ownership being obtained cannot be measured, the earn-out payment is not currently recognized. 9.1.2. Commitments related to Group financing Financial guarantees given In general terms, the Group finances its assets from equity or debt contracted by its parent company, rather than pledging its own assets. In some cases, especially in Scandinavian countries, Steen & Strøm mainly relies on local currency mortgages to fund its activities.

Commitments related to the Group’s operating activities Commitments on works contracts (Property Development/Sale Before Completion) The commitments on works contracts are reciprocal guarantees given under property development contracts or sale before completion contracts (under which payment is guaranteed by the buyer and completion by the developer). At December 31, 2013, the Group’s main commitments are related to shopping center and office construction projects, such as the Carré Jaude (4.5 million euros), Besançon Pasteur (24.4 million euros) and Pantin (62.5 million euros) projects in France and the Kristianstad (26 million euros) and Emporia (1.5 million euros) projects in Sweden. Commitments under conditions precedent The commitments under conditions precedent relate to purchase promissory agreements on land or assets and earn-out payments on acquisitions. Commitments have been given for acquisition of land (Chaumont), for the amount of 4.6 million euros. The Group is committed to acquire assets as part of the Centre Bourse Grands Magasins project for a total amount of 5.8 million euros. The commitments related to the Claye-Souilly project represent 4 million euros. On January 24th, 2014, the Group signed the binding agreement for the disposal of a portfolio of 127 Carrefour-anchored retail galleries in Europe. This agreement confirms the terms included in the memorandum of understanding signed on December 16, 2013. The portfolio that would be sold to this consortium for 2.01 billion euros (total share, including transfer duties) includes retail galleries in France (57 assets), in Spain (63 assets) and in Italy (7 assets). The transaction is subject to approval by the competition authorities in France and Spain and to the waiver of preemptive rights by French local authorities.

Shareholders’ agreements Shareholders’ agreements relating to Klécar France, Klécar Europe Sud, Solorec and Klécar Participations Italie The shareholder agreements between Klépierre and CNP Assurances and Écureuil Vie were amended by a rider signed on December 30, 2004, the effect of which was to cancel the liquidity commitments given by Klépierre to its partners. The agreement provides the usual protections for non-controlling interests: pre-emption right, joint exit right and the decision-making process applying to investment or divestment. Each agreement contains 2 additional clauses: one in favor of Klépierre: an obligation for the non-controlling shareholders to exit at the request of Klépierre in the event of Klécar assets being sold to a third party; the other in favor of the non-controlling shareholders: a process enabling the non-controlling shareholder to consider a range of exit scenarios in 2016 and 2017 (for the Italian companies) or 2014 and 2015 (for the other shopping centers): – asset sharing or sale; – purchase of non-controlling shareholdings by Klépierre (with no obligation for Klépierre); – disposal to a third party with payment of a discount by Klépierre if the offer is less than the net asset value. Partners’ agreements in respect of Bègles Arcins Signed on September 2, 2003, this agreement between Klépierre and Assurécureuil Pierre 3 contains provisions regulating the relationship between the company partners, and, more specifically, a dispute resolution clause. Partners’ agreement between Klépierre and SCI Vendôme Commerces in respect of SCS Cecobil Signed on October 25, 2007 following the transition of Cecobil to a limited partnership, this agreement provides the usual protections in the event of a proposed sale of equity shares to a third party (first refusal and total joint exit rights) and change of control of a partner. SNC Kléber La Pérouse is no longer party to this agreement since the transfer of its assets and liabilities (TUP) to Klépierre on July 4, 2012. Partners’ agreement between Klépierre and SCI Vendôme Commerces in respect of SCI Secovalde and SCI Valdebac Signed on October 25, 2007, this agreement provides the usual protections in the event of a proposed sale of equity shares to a third party (first refusal and total joint exit rights) and change of control of a partner. This partners’ agreement amended on December 29, 2008 and November 23, 2010, also includes SCI Valdebac since December 8, 2010 when more than 99.99% of its shares were transferred from SNC Kléber La Pérouse and SCI Vendôme Commerces to SCI Secovalde. As a consequence, the partners’ agreement relating to SCI Valdebac alone, signed by SNC Kléber La Pérouse and SCI Vendôme on June 21, 2010, was terminated on December 8, 2010. Kléber La Pérouse is no longer party to this agreement since the transfer of its assets and liabilities (TUP) to Klépierre on July 4, 2012. Partners’ agreements between Klépierre, Klefin Italia, Finiper, Finiper Real Estate & Investment, Ipermontebello, Immobiliare Finiper and Cedro 99 in respect of Clivia, and between Klépierre, Klefin Italia, Klépierre Luxembourg, Finiper, Finiper Real Estate & Investment, Ipermontebello, Immobiliare Finiper and Cedro 99 in respect of Immobiliare Gallerie Commerciali (IGC) A partners’ agreement was signed in 2002 during the acquisition of IGC shares by the Klépierre Group. Its main provisions – including those regarding Klépierre’s preemption right – were restated in a new agreement in 2007 applying to IGC and/or Clivia (owner of the Lonato, Verona and Vittuone shopping centers). In the case of IGC, this was replaced by an agreement signed on July 23, 2009. All these agreements grant Finiper a put (option to sell) enabling it to sell its shares in IGC and/or Clivia to Klépierre. This put expires in 2017 and can be split into 2 parts: 1 of 12% and 1 of 16.70% for IGC; 2 parts – each of 25% – for Clivia. Any refusal by Klépierre regarding the second IGC part and both Clivia parts will result in a penalty becoming payable to the Finiper group. Partners’ agreements between Klépierre and Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP in respect of the Swedish company Nordica Holdco AB, and the Norwegian companies Storm Holding Norway AS and Steen & Strøm The shares in Steen & Strøm were acquired via Storm Holding Norway AS, a company registered in Norway and wholly-owned by Nordica Holdco AB, a company registered in Sweden. This agreement was made on July 25, 2008 and an amendment made on October 7, 2008. It includes the usual provisions to protect non-controlling interests: qualified majority voting for certain decisions, purchase option in the event of deadlock and joint exit rights, as well as the following provisions: a one-year inalienability period applied to Steen & Strøm shares from the date of acquisition; each party has a right of first offer on any shares which the other party wishes to transfer to a third party, subject to the provision that if shares are transferred by one party (other than Klépierre or one of its affiliates) to a Klépierre competitor (as defined in the agreement), the shares concerned will be subject to a right of first refusal and not a right of first offer; from the sixth year following acquisition, either party may request a meeting of shareholders to approve, subject to a two-thirds majority, the disposal of all the shares or assets of Steen & Strøm, or a market flotation of the company. Through deeds of adherence dated December 23, 2009, Storm ABP Holding BV and APG Strategic Real Estate Pool NV adhered to this partners’ agreement. Through a deed of adherence dated September 30, 2011, Stichting Depositary APG Real Estate Pool adhered to this partners’ agreement.

Partners’ agreement between Kleprojet 1 and Holprim’s in respect of Kleprims Signed on September 20, 2010, the agreement gives Kleprojet 1 exit rights if the conditions precedent are unmet as well as the usual protections in the event of a proposed sale of equity shares to a third party (first refusal and total joint exit rights), change of control of a partner and other circumstances affecting the relationship between partners. Partners’ agreement between Klépierre and Cardif Assurance Vie in respect of SCI Portes de Claye This agreement, signed on April 16, 2012, contains provisions governing relations between company partners. It provides the usual protections in the event of proposed sale of equity shares to third parties: reciprocal pre-emption right, reciprocal total joint exit right, total joint exit obligation by non-controlling partner in the event the majority partner plans to sell its full equity stake. It also gives minority partner a right of first offer in the event of a sale of assets by the Company. KC 2 SNC has not been party to this agreement since June 5, 2012, following its transfer of assets and liabilities (TUP) to Klécar France SNC. By decision of the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on June 28, 2012, Klécar France SNC distributed its entire investment in Portes de Claye SCI to Klépierre. 9.4. Commitments under operating leases – lessors The main clauses contained in the lessor’s lease agreement are described below: 9.4.1. Shopping centers Rental periods vary in different countries. The terms governing the fixing and indexing of rents are set out in the agreement. Indexation enables the review of the Minimum Guaranteed Rent. The indices used vary from country to country. Indexation specific to each country France indexes its leases to the French commercial rents index (ILC) or cost of construction index (ICC). The ILC is a compound index derived from the French consumer price index (IPC), retail trade sales value index (ICAV) and cost of construction index (ICC). Leases are modified in line with the index on January 1, each year. Most leases, 75%, are indexed to the ILC for the second quarter, which is published in October and applicable to the following January 1. Most leases have a duration of ten or twelve years, with an opt-out every three years for the tenant. In Spain, the consumer price index (CPI) is recorded annually every January 1. In Italy, the system is based on the consumer price indices (excluding tobacco) for working class and junior management (ISTAT), but is more complex in its implementation. Depending on the lease, either the ISTAT is applied at 75% (“locazione” regulated leases) or the full reference segment index is applied. Under “locazione” leases, the duration is twelve years with an opt-out for tenants after six years. For other types of leases, the duration is not regulated. In Portugal, the index used is the consumer price index (CPI), excluding properties. In Greece, the consumer price index (CPI) is applied. The Eurostat IPCH Eurozone index used in Central Europe is based on consumer prices in the EMU countries. There is no obligatory minimum or maximum period in Norway. However leases are usually written for periods of five or ten years. Unless agreed otherwise, either party may request an annual rent review based on the trend in the Norwegian consumer price index. In Sweden, the period of a commercial lease is agreed by the parties to the agreement. By default leases are open-ended, but most commercial leases are written for at least three years. Where the lease is written for a period in excess of three years, annual indexation linked to the national consumer price index is the norm. In Denmark, the parties are free to agree the amount of rent and rent payment methods. Rents may be fixed or indexed against the revenue reported by the lessee. In most cases, the rent is reviewed annually on the basis of the trend in the Danish consumer price index. Under the terms of commercial lease legislation, either party may request that the rent is adjusted to reflect the market rate every four years. This provision applies unless the parties agree otherwise. Minimum guaranteed rent and variable rent Appraised on a year-by-year basis, the rent payable is equivalent to a percentage of the revenues generated by the lessee during the calendar year concerned. The rate applied differs depending on business type. The total amount of this two-part rent (a fixed part + a variable part) can never be less than the minimum guaranteed rent (MGR). The MGR is reviewed annually by application of the index according to the terms specified above. The variable part of the rent is equivalent to the difference between the revenue percentage contained in the lease and the minimum guaranteed rent after indexation. Wherever possible, all or part of the variable rent is consolidated into the MGR at the point of lease renewal. In this way, the variable part of the rent is usually reduced to zero at the end of the lease. Every year, it is mechanically deducted from the indexation rise in MGR.

Office properties 100% of Klépierre’s offices property assets are located in France and are therefore governed by French law. Commercial businesses are covered by articles L. 145-1 to L. 145-60 of the French Commercial Code and the non-codified articles of decree 53-960 of September 30, 1953 (the “statute”). Some of these clauses are public policies. For example: the length of leasing agreements, which may not be shorter than nine years (in terms of the lessor’s commitment), the right to renewal, the formal conditions to be complied with in the event of cancellation, vacation, renewal, eviction, etc. Exceptionally, leases of two years or less may be exempt from the statute. The most usual lease term is nine years, during which only the lessee may terminate the lease at the end of each 3-year period by sending a 6-month prior notice by extrajudicial act. The parties may also agree upon an early termination of the lease. The rent is usually paid quarterly in advance and is indexed in full annually against the Insee cost of construction index. The rent may be progressive or constant, and may include rent-free periods, but is always set at the point when the lease is signed and for its full term (except for any riders added during the lease term). All charges, including property and office taxes, are usually due by the lessee, with the exception of works regulated by article 606 of the French Civil Code, which are usually paid by the lessor. Professionals (lawyers, chartered accountants, architects, etc.) are not covered by the statute. The minimum duration for such leases is six years, with the lessee free to terminate at any time by giving six months’ notice. These agreements are not renewable. The other conditions are similar to those of commercial leases. A decree on the rent review index for tertiary activities (known as “ILAT”) was published in the French Journal officiel (gazette) on December 29, 2011. The ILAT can now be used as a reference when reviewing rents of office premises, for activities in the professional occupations and for activities carried out in logistics warehouses. The use of this new index is dependent on the agreement of all parties. No leases are currently affected. The ILAT is the weighted sum of three indexes: the consumer price index (50%), the cost of construction index (25%) and the level of gross domestic product (25%). The total amount of conditional rents recognized in income The conditional rent is that portion of the total rent which is not a fixed amount, but is a variable amount based on a factor other than time (e.g. percentage of revenues, degree of use, price indices, market interest rates, etc.). Minimum payments made under the lease are those payments which the lessee is, or may be, required to make during the term of the lease, excluding the conditional rent, the cost of services and taxes to be paid or refunded to the lessor. At December 31, 2013, the total future minimum rents receivable under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: (in thousands of euros) 12/31/2013 Less than one year 877 772 Between one and five years 1 565 286 More than five years 479 798 TOTAL 2 922 856 9.5. Retention commitments In France, some assets are subject to the tax regime set out in article 210-E of the French General Tax Code, under which the buildings must be retained for at least five years after acquisition. These are: all buildings and property finance leases acquired by Klémurs, at the exception of Jardineries Delbard; some equity investments in Galeries Drancéennes (owner of the Drancy Avenir shopping center) and Immo-Dauland owner of the Chalonsur-Saône retail park; the Annecy Courrier shopping center and Monoprix store; 3 finance leases acquired in 2011 and relating to real estate assets located in Roques-sur-Garonne. For reminder, the article 210 E applies to the disposals realized before December 31st, 2011.

The demographic and financial assumptions used when estimating the discounted value of the plan obligations and financed schemes’ assets reflect the economic conditions specific to the monetary zone concerned. The fraction of actuarial variances to be amortized after application of the 10% limit (corridor method) is calculated separately for each defined benefit plan. Klépierre has set up supplementary pension plans under a corporate agreement. Under these supplementary plans, employee beneficiaries will, on retirement, receive additional income over and above their national state pensions (where applicable) in accordance with the type of plan they are entitled to. Group employees also benefit from agreed or contractual personal protection plans in various forms, such as retirement gratuities. In Italy, Klépierre Management Italia operates a “Trattamento di Fine Rapporto” (TFR) plan. The amount payable by the employer on termination of the employment contract (as a result of resignation, dismissal or retirement) is calculated by applying an annual coefficient for each year worked. The final amount is capped. Since the liability is known, it can be recognized under other liabilities and not as a provision for contingencies. In Spain, a provision for retirement commitments may be recognized where specific provision is made in the collective agreement, but this does not affect the staff working in the Spanish subsidiaries of the Klépierre Group. In Scandinavia, has both public and supplemental pension plans. Both require annual contributions to pension funds. In addition to these plans, Steen & Strøm has put in place a private plan for some employees in Norway. To be fully vested for the benefits that this pension plan offers, the recipient must have contributed to the plan for a total of thirty years. The plan pays 60% of the final base salary as of January 1 on the year in which the recipient reaches 67 years of age. Survivor and disability arrangements are also covered by the plan. 67 employees are plan members and 9 are currently receiving benefits. The existing commitments for post-employment medical assistance plans are measured on the basis of assumed rises in medical costs. These assumptions, based on historical observations, take into account the estimated future changes in the cost of medical services resulting both from the cost of medical benefits and inflation.

The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were made for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated financial statements. This report also includes information to the specific verification of information given in the Group’s management report. This report should be read in conjunction with, and is construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2013 on: the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Klépierre; the justification of our assessments; the specific verifications and information required by law. These consolidated financial statements have been approved by Executive Board. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements, based on our audit. I – Opinion on the consolidated financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2013 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. II – Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention on the following matters: notes 2.4 and 2.12.2 to the consolidated financial statements specify that investment properties are assessed by independent appraisers to estimate the fair values of buildings and the impairments, if any. Our procedures consisted notably in examining the valuation methodology used by the appraisers and to ensure ourselves that the impairments as well as the fair values were correctly based on signed external appraisals; note 2.12.1 to the consolidated financial statements indicate that your Group used estimated methods regarding to the follow-up of the value of goodwill. Our procedures consisted in evaluating the appropriateness of the data and the hypothesis based on these estimates, in reviewing the calculation method performed by independent appraiser and your Group, in examining the approval procedures of these estimates by the board and then, in verifying that notes to the consolidated financial statements provide applicable information about the hypothesis used; notes 2.21 and 5.16 to the consolidated financial statements set forth the accounting rules and methods to determine the fair value of derivative instruments as well as the characteristics of the Group’s hedging instruments. We examined the classification criteria and the documentation required specifically by IAS 39 and verified the appropriateness of these accounting methods and the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore served in forming our audit opinion expressed in the first part of this report. III – Specific verification As required by law, we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information presented in the Group’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS 1.1. Buyout of the minority share (non-controlling interests) of the securities of the company Klémurs Following the simplified public tender offer occurred from February 21 to March 8, and then a simplified squeeze-out procedure taking place from April 10 to 15, 2013, on the shares of Klémurs, Klépierre SA acquired all minority interests amounting to 15.89% of the share capital of Klémurs for a total of 32.2 million euros (excluding acquisition costs). 1.2. Dividend payment The General Meeting of April 11, 2013 set the 2012 dividend per share at 1.50 euro and proposed the payment in cash. The total dividend paid was 292.9 million euros. 1.3. New funding arrangements Klépierre obtained a syndicated loan of 750 million euros from a group of 16 leading banks, maturing in 2018. During the second half-year, Klépierre also raised 3 bilateral loans for an amount of 300 million euros. These lines have not been drawn upon to date. These new loans allowed Klépierre to give up the 2 bilateral loan lines granted by BNP Paribas that have not been drawn upon: one for 500 million euros with maturity in March 2016 and another for 500 million euros with maturity in March 2018. 1.4. Real estate asset transactions Klépierre SA continued to apply its disposal policy during the year, resulting in the disposal of the following office buildings: 21, rue La Pérouse, Paris (16th district); 21, avenue Kléber, Paris (16th district); 192, avenue Charles-de-Gaulle, Neuilly-sur-Seine (92); 7, rue Meyerbeer, Paris (9th district). NOTE 2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND MEASUREMENT METHODS 2.1. Application of accounting conventions The corporate financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2013, have been prepared in accordance with the general chart of accounts. General accounting conventions have been applied in compliance with the following principles: prudence; independence of fiscal years; compliance with the general rules applying to the preparation and presentation of annual corporate financial statements, and on the basis of going concern. In accordance with the ANC No. 2013-02 of November 7, 2013 recommendation on valuation rules of pension commitments and similar benefits, the company has opted for the immediate recognition of all of its pension liabilities. The first time application of this recommendation has resulted in the recognition in equity of actuarial losses balance amounting to 22 thousand euros at December 31, 2013. This impact was treated as change in methods and consequently recognized in equity. 2.2. Measurement methods 2.2.1. Fixed assets General criteria applied to the recognition and measurement of assets Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are recognized as assets when all the following conditions are met: it is probable that future economic benefit associated with the item will flow to the entity; their cost or value can be measured reliably. At the recognition date asset values are measured either at their cost of acquisition or their cost of construction. Financial interest relating specifically to the production of fixed assets is included in their cost of acquisition. 2.2.2. Intangible assets: the technical goodwill Generally recognized as a result of mergers or complete transfers of assets and liabilities measured at their book value, the technical goodwill, or “false” goodwill, arise when the net value of the acquired company’s shares as stated in the assets of the acquiring company is higher than the net book asset contributed. To determine whether the goodwill is “true” or “false”, it must be compared to the underlying capital gains on the asset items recognized or not in the accounts of the acquired company after deduction of all assumed liabilities even those not recorded in the accounts of the absorbed company when the accounting is not mandatory (e.g. pensions accruals, deferred tax liabilities). The goodwill shown in the Goodwill item is not amortizable, since the time of use of its future economic benefits cannot be determined reliably.

Property, plant and equipment Definition and recognition of components Based on Fédération des Sociétés Immobilières et Foncières (FSIF – French Federation of Property Companies) recommendations concerning components and useful life, the component method is applied as follows: for properties developed by the companies themselves, assets are classified by component type and measured at their realizable value; where investment properties are held in the portfolio (sometimes for long periods), components were identified depending the type of assets: business premises, shopping centers, offices and residential properties. 4 components have been identified for each of these asset types (in addition to land): structures; facades, cladding and roofing; general and technical installations (GTI); fittings. When applying regulations 2004-06 and 2002-10, existing office buildings have been broken down using the following percentages (according to FSIF template): Depreciable life Components Office properties (straight line) Structures 60% 60 years Facades 15% 30 years GTI 15% 20 years Fittings 10% 12 years All component figures are based on assumed «as new» values. The Company has therefore calculated the proportions of the fittings, technical installations and facade components on the basis of the periods shown in the table applied since the date of construction or most recent major renovation of the property asset concerned. The proportion for structures is calculated on the basis of the proportions previously identified for the other components. In accordance with the recommendations of the Fédération des Sociétés Immobilières et Foncières (French Federation of Property Companies), the depreciable lives have been determined in such a way as to obtain a zero residual value on maturity of the depreciation schedule. Depreciation is calculated on the basis of the useful lifespan of each component. The maintenance expenses involved in multi-year capital repairs programs or major refurbishments governed by legislation, regulations or the standard practices of the entity concerned must be recognized from the outset as distinct asset components, unless a provision has been recognized for capital repairs or major refurbishments. This convention is intended to cover those maintenance expenses whose sole purpose is to verify the condition and serviceability of installations and to carry out maintenance to such installations without extending their working life beyond that initially intended, subject to compliance with the applicable accounting recognition conditions. Principles of asset impairment At each balance sheet and interim reporting date, the Company carries out an appraisal to determine any indication that an asset could have suffered a significant loss in value (article 322-5 of the French General Accounting Code). An asset is impaired when its actual value falls below its net book value. The actual value is the market value (appraised value excluding taxes on the balance sheet date) or the value in use (article 322-1 of the French General Accounting Code), whichever is the higher. The market value of the asset is determined by independent appraisers, with the exception of those assets acquired less than six months earlier, whose market value is estimated as the cost of acquisition. However, given the fact that these appraisals are, by their nature, estimates, it is possible that the amount realized on the disposal of some real estate assets will differ from the appraised value of those assets, even where such disposal occurs within a few months of the balance sheet date. Assets covered by a contract of sale (mandat de vente) are appraised at their selling price net of exit expenses. 2.2.4. Long-term financial investments Equity investments are recognized at their cost of acquisition. At year end, provisions for impairment of investments are booked when inventory value is less than their carrying net value. The inventory value of equities is equivalent to their value in use, as calculated to take into account the net asset value and the future cash flows. The net asset value of real estate companies is estimated on the basis of external appraisals conducted by independent real estate appraisers except for the assets under promise. Management Company shares are valued at each fiscal year end by an independent appraiser. Treasury shares acquired for the purpose of transfer to a vendor as part of an external growth transaction are depreciated if the average stock market price for the last month of the fiscal year is lower than the acquisition value.

Acquisition cost of fixed assets Transfer duties, fees, commissions and legal expenses are included in the capitalized cost of the asset. The Company has exercised the option of recognizing the acquisition cost of long-term financial investments as expenses (articles 321-10 and 321-15 of the French General Accounting Code). 2.2.6. Eviction costs When a lessor terminates a lease prior to the expiration date, he must pay eviction compensation to the lessee. Where eviction compensation is paid as a result of major renovation or reconstruction work on a property requiring the prior removal of tenants, the cost is included in total renovation costs. Expenditure that does not meet the combined criteria applying to the definition and recognition of assets and which cannot be allocated to acquisition or production costs is recognized as an expense: eviction costs paid to tenants during commercial restructuring is recognized as an expense for the fiscal year. 2.2.7. Marketing expenses Marketing, re-marketing and renewal fees are recognized as expenses for the fiscal year. 2.3. Mergers and similar transactions CNC recommendation 2004-01 of March 25, 2004, as approved on May 4, 2004, by the Comité de Réglementation Comptable (CRC), relating to the treatment of mergers and similar transactions states the following rule regarding positive or negative variances in respect of canceled shares: Negative variance A negative variance arising from these transactions must be treated in the same way as a negative merger goodwill: recognition of the technical negative variance in intangible assets; recognition of the balance of the negative variance in financial expenses. Positive variance The positive variance from these transactions must be treated in the same way as a positive merger variance. Any positive variance in the percentage of earnings accumulated by the merged entity (since the acquisition of the acquired company’s equity by the acquiring company) remaining undistributed must be shown in the financial income of the acquiring company. Any residual balance is recognized as shareholders’ equity. 2.4. Receivables, debts and cash and cash equivalents Receivables, debts and cash and cash equivalents have been measured at par value. Trade receivables are estimated individually at each balance sheet date and interim reporting date, and a provision entered wherever there is a perceived risk of non-recovery. 2.5. Marketable securities Marketable securities are recognized at their cost of acquisition net of provisions. Provisions for impairment of treasury shares are taken when their inventory value based on the average stock market price for the last month of the fiscal year is lower than their existing book value. Provisions are made under liabilities for stocks granted to employees as soon as it becomes probable that the stock options will be exercised (continued service and performance conditions met and stocks likely to be exercised). The provision is recognized if the average purchase price exceeds the purchase price offered to employees. 2.6. Deferred expenses: loan issue costs Expenditure that does not meet the combined criteria applying to the definition and recognition of assets must be recognized as an expense. It is no longer possible to amortize these costs over several periods. CNC recommendation 2004-15 on assets dated June 23, 2004 does not apply to financial instruments and related expenditure, such as loan issue costs, insurance premiums and loan repayment premiums. Bond insurance costs and the commissions and fees relating to bank loans are spread over the full loan period. 2.7. Forward financial instruments Expenses and gains on forward financial instruments (swaps) entered into for the purpose of hedging the Company’s risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations are recognized pro rata in the income statement. Unrealized losses and gains arising as a result of the difference between the market value of agreements estimated at the end of the year and their par value are not recognized.

Translation adjustment (assets and liabilities) Receivables and debts in foreign currencies are translated and recognized in local currency based on the Banque de France’s last exchange rate. When the application of the translation rate on the balance sheet date causes the amounts in local currency previously recognized to be modified, the translation differences are recorded under “Translation difference – assets“, and “Translation difference – liabilities“. Unrealized gains are not recognized in income but are recorded under balance sheet liabilities. In contrast, a provision for risks is recognized for unrealized losses. The regulations related to these receivables and debts are compared with the original historical values and result in the recognition of foreign exchange gains and losses without set-off. 2.9. Operating income and expenses Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the full duration of the lease agreement, building expenses are re-billed to clients on payment, and interest is entered on receipt or payment. At the end of the fiscal year, gains and expenses are adjusted by the addition of accrued amounts not yet due and the subtraction of pre-posted non-accrued amounts. Accruals for building expenses are recognized as payables in “Suppliers -invoices to be received”. 2.9.1. Leases Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis throughout the full period of the lease. Stepped rents and rent-free periods are recognized every fiscal year by spreading the resulting increase or decrease in rental income over the reference period. The reference period adopted is the first firm lease term. 2.9.2. Early termination indemnities Tenants who terminate their leases prior to the contractual expiration date are liable to pay early termination penalties. This revenue is allocated to the terminated lease and credited to income for the period in which it is recognized. 2.10. Employee benefits There are 2 types of plans: defined contribution pension plans; defined benefit pension plans grouping long-term benefits and post-employment benefits. In accordance with Recommendation No. 2013-02 of November 7, 2013 the pension commitments have been provisioned in full (preferred method) in order to comply with the new disposals of the revised IAS 19 standard. Under this method commitments are valued according to the same disposals as recommended by the revised IAS 19 standard. 2.11. The tax credit for competitiveness and employment (CICE) The third Amending Finance Law 2012 set up the CICE starting January 1, 2013, with the following main characteristics: a 4% tax credit calculated per calendar year based on compensation less than or equal to 2.5 SMIC paid starting January 1, 2013; unless it is applied to taxes due, the credit will be reimbursable within three years. The CICE is recognized as an employee expense. 2.12. Tax regime adopted by the Company Following its option to apply the regime mentioned in Article 11 of the Finance Law of December 30, 2002, Klépierre SA is exempted from corporate income tax and hence shall follow the following three conditions for distribution: distribution of 95% (versus 85%) of profits from building lease transactions prior to the end of the financial year following the year in which they were made; distribution of 60% (versus 50%) of capital gains made on disposals of buildings, equity investments in companies covered by the provisions of Article 8 whose purpose is identical to that of an SIIC or stocks in subsidiary companies subject to corporate income tax, where such companies have exercised the option prior to the end of the second financial year following the year in which the gains were made; distribution of all dividends received from subsidiary companies exercising the option during the fiscal year following the year in which the dividends were received; the Amending Finance Law 2013 made changes concerning the thresholds for mandatory distributions that are thus higher. Income from the exempt sector is distinguished from that from the taxable sector in accordance with the applicable legal requirements: direct allocation of expenses and income, wherever possible; allocation of general expenses pro rata to the income of both sectors; allocation of financial fees pro rata to the gross fixed assets of both sectors. Klépierre SA also calculates the taxable income of the sector subject to corporate income tax.

Shareholder agreements relating to Klécar France, Klécar Europe Sud, Solorec and Klécar Participations Italie The shareholder agreements between Klépierre and CNP Assurances and Écureuil Vie were amended by a rider signed on December 30, 2004, the effect of which was to cancel the liquidity commitments given by Klépierre to its partners. The agreement provides the usual protections for non-controlling interests: pre-emption right, joint exit right and the decision-making process applying to investment or divestment. Each agreement contains 2 additional clauses: one in favor of Klépierre: an obligation for the non-controlling shareholders to exit at the request of Klépierre in the event of Klécar assets being sold to a third party; the other in favor of the non-controlling shareholders: a process enabling the latter to consider a range of exit scenarios in 2016 and 2017 (for the Italian companies) or 2014 and 2015 (for the other malls): − asset sharing or sale; − purchase of non-controlling shareholdings by Klépierre (with no obligation for Klépierre); − sale to a third party with payment of a discount by Klépierre if the offer is less than the net asset value. Partners’ agreements in respect of Bègles Arcins Signed on September 2, 2003, this agreement between Klépierre and Assurécureuil Pierre 3 contains provisions regulating the relationship between the company partners, and, more specifically, a dispute resolution clause.

Partners’ agreement between Klépierre and SCI Vendôme Commerces in respect of SCI Secovalde and SCI Valdebac Signed on October 25, 2007, this agreement provides for the usual protections regarding sales project of equity shares to a third party (first refusal and total joint exit rights) and change of control of a partner. This partners’ agreement amended on December 29, 2008 and November 23, 2010, also includes SCI Valdebac since December 8, 2010. For instance, in December 8, 2010 more than 99.99% of the shares were transferred from SNC Kléber La Pérouse and SCI Vendôme Commerces to SCI Secovalde. As a consequence, the partners’ agreement that only concerns SCI Valdebac, signed by SNC Kléber La Pérouse and SCI Vendôme on June 21, 2010, was terminated on December 8, 2010. Kléber La Pérouse is no longer party to this agreement since the transfer of its assets and liabilities (TUP) to Klépierre on July 4, 2012.

Its main provisions – including those regarding Klépierre’s preemptive right – were restated in a new agreement of 2007 applying to IGC and/or Clivia (the owner of the Lonato, Verona and Vittuone malls). In the case of IGC, this was replaced by an agreement signed on July 23, 2009. All these agreements grant Finiper a put (option to sell) enabling the latter to sell its shares in IGC and/or Clivia to Klépierre. This put expires in 2017 and can be split into two parts: 1 of 12% and one of 16.70% for IGC; 2 parts, each of 25%, for Clivia. Any refusal by Klépierre regarding the second IGC part and both Clivia parts will result in a penalty becoming payable to the Finiper group. Partners’ agreements between Klépierre and Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP in respect of the Swedish company Nordica Holdco AB, and the Norwegian companies Storm Holding Norway AS and Steen & Strøm The shares in Steen & Strøm were acquired via Storm Holding Norway AS, a company registered in Norway and wholly-owned by Nordica Holdco AB, a company registered in Sweden. This agreement was made on July 25, 2008 and an amendment made on October 7, 2008. It includes the usual provisions to protect non-controlling interests: qualified majority voting for certain decisions, purchase option in the event of deadlock and joint exit rights, as well as the following provisions: a one-year inalienability period applied to Steen & Strøm shares from the date of acquisition; each party has a right of first offer on any shares which the other party wishes to transfer to a third party, subject to the proviso that where shares are transferred by one party (other than Klépierre or one of its affiliates) to a Klépierre competitor (as defined in the agreement), the shares concerned will be subject to a right of first refusal and not a right of first offer; from the sixth year following acquisition, either party may request a meeting of shareholders to approve, subject to a two-thirds majority, the disposal of all the shares or assets of Steen & Strøm, or a market flotation of the Company.

These financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. I. Opinion on the financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and the liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2013 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.

Our assessment of these valuations is based on the process implemented by your company to determine the value of equity investments.

GENERAL INFORMATION 8.1.1. Background Klépierre was formed at the end of 1990 from the demerger of Locabail-Immobilier, whose portfolio of operating leases it retained. Since then, Klépierre has focused on its 2 core businesses: the ownership and management of shopping centers* in France and continental Europe, and premium office buildings in Paris and the Paris Region. At the end of 1998, Klépierre made the strategic decision to become a major player in the creation and development of new retail sites in continental Europe, and made its first acquisition in Italy. The Group‘s principal shareholder at this time was Compagnie Bancaire, which held a 51% stake. The merger of Compagnie Bancaire with Paribas in May 1998 provided Klépierre with the opportunity to create a number of business combinations, including the inward merger of Compagnie Foncière and the contribution of a 100% equity investment in Foncière Chaptal. These acquisitions radically increased the size of the Company and strengthened its position in its core investment segments. Between 2000 and 2011, Klépierre has added continually to its portfolio of shopping centers and increased its presence in continental Europe through partnerships and ad hoc acquisitions: on July 17, 2000, Klépierre signed a major agreement with the Carrefour group for the acquisition of 160 shopping centers adjoining this leading retailer‘s hypermarkets. The agreement also included management and development partnerships. In the space of four years, 151 shopping centers were acquired, mainly in France and Spain. The second part of the Carrefour agreement (consisting of a priority right on all new sites developed by Carrefour in continental Europe) was implemented for the first time at the end of 2001 for 5 new Spanish shopping centers and in 2002 for the acquisition of the Group‘s first center in Portugal; in 2002, Klépierre strengthened its position in Italy with the acquisition of 11 Carrefour shopping centers and the formation of the first Italian shopping center management company (PSG) in partnership with Finim. Klépierre also signed a major agreement with the Finiper retail group for the acquisition of a strategic 40% stake in IGC (owner of 9 Finiper shopping centers), as well as a partnership agreement covering the joint development of new shopping centers; in 2003, Klépierre consolidated its shopping center segment positions in France, Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal with the acquisition of a further 28 centers. Klépierre also made its first investment in the Czech Republic (the Nový Smíchov center in Prague). It extended its network of management subsidiaries with the formation of Sogecaec in Portugal. 2003 was also the year in which Klépierre opted to adopt the French tax status of a Société d‘investissement immobilier cotée or SIIC; in 2004, the Group continued to grow with the addition of 6 centers in France, Italy and Spain, and also gained a strategic position in Hungary with the purchase of 12 shopping centers and the acquisition of a 50% investment in local management company Plaza Centers Management (PCM) through its subsidiary Ségécé. Ségécé strengthened its European management network with the formation of Ségécé Hellas in Greece and the acquisition of 100% of Centros Shopping Gestion in Spain; in 2005, Klépierre acquired 9 shopping centers, including 4 in Poland, a new country for the Group, following the agreement signed with Plaza Centers Europe at the end of July. The deal also included the 100% acquisition by Ségécé of the subsidiary responsible for managing these Polish centers, and assumed total control of PCM Hungary by acquiring the remaining 50% investment in this company. Klépierre also made its first investment in Belgium with the L‘esplanade shopping center in Louvain-la-Neuve; in 2006, Klépierre continued its shopping center development program in 7 of the Group‘s 10 operating countries, and increased integration of the now wholly-owned management network in Italy and the Czech Republic. The Company also embarked on a new route to growth by outsourcing the real estate assets for major retailers to its subsidiary company Klémurs, which floated on the Stock Market in December 2006. At the end of 2006, Klémurs acquired 128 Buffalo Grill restaurant properties in France and signed an important partnership agreement with Buffalo Grill for the future; in 2007, Klépierre invested more than 1 billion euros, chiefly in shopping centers in France, Hungary, Poland and Portugal. Klépierre also acquired full ownership of Ségécé by acquiring the non-controlling interests held by BNP Paribas (15%) and AXA REIM (10%); the main event of 2008 was the acquisition of a 56.1% equity stake in Scandinavia‘s leading real estate company Steen & Strøm. The remaining 43.9% is held by ABP Pension Fund. Klépierre was now operating in 13 countries in continental Europe. During the year, the Company acquired newly-constructed centers in France, Italy and the Czech Republic, as well as starting work on 12 new projects, including new centers and retail parks and extensions to existing sites; from 2009 to 2011, Klépierre continued to create and develop shopping centers, focusing on regions that enjoy strong demographic growth and high purchasing power per capita (mainly in France, Scandinavia and Italy), while intensifying at the same time its asset rotation policy. The majority of these sales related to office buildings and minority stakes in retail galleries. In 2010, several extension and renovation projects on existing centers were launched in France (Arcades in the Paris region), Italy (Pescara Nord), Sweden (Sollentuna, Hageby), Norway (Gulskogen) and Hungary (Corvin). In 2011, investments were dedicated to extension-renovation projects in France (Claye-Souilly, Perpignan-Salanca) and to the development of new shopping centers such as Emporia (Malmö, Sweden) or the retail space of the St. Lazare station in Paris (opened in March 2012). Klépierre inaugurated 2 shopping centers in 2011: Le Millenaire shopping center in Aubervilliers, on the outskirts of Paris, the largest retail development in France in a decade, and Aqua Portimão in the Algarve, a tourist region of Portugal. The Group acquired the E. Leclerc Roques shopping center in Toulouse, one of the most dynamic urban areas in France.

The Group financial structure was reinforced, notably thanks to completed disposals but also thanks to the dividend payment in cash and to the successful bond issue for 900 million euros. In 2011, Klépierre disposed almost 190 million euros of retail assets and offices and almost 900 million euros were raised on the banking and credit market. 8.1.2. Klépierre today 2012 marked for Klépierre an important turning point: the company asserts a strategy of pure player in shopping centers with the launch of an ambitious disposal program of matured retail assets and the withdrawal of the offices business, for a total amount of 1 billion euros over 2012 and 2013. Priority is also given to the reinforcement of its financial structure. In March 2012, Simon Property Group, global leader in the shopping center industry, acquired a 28.7% equity stake in Klépierre from BNP Paribas. This change in ownership reinforces the initiated strategy. 2012 was marked by the delivery of 3 landmark development projects for Klépierre: St.Lazare Paris, a new retail space included in the second busiest railway station in Europe, Les Sentiers de Claye-Souilly extension-renovation (Greater Paris Area) and Emporia, a structuring retail facility in large urban redevelopment scheme in Southern Malmö (Sweden). As a whole, Klépierre invested close to 460 million euros in 2012. The Group also completed disposals for 700 million euros worth of assets (French shopping centers and Parisian office buildings). Klépierre rose close to 1.5 billion euros of new financings in the course of the year, bringing its level of liquidity close to 2 billion euros at year-end. In 2013, Klépierre achieved its disposal program announced beginning 2012 with 1.3 billion euros of assets disposed over two years and consequently achieved its strategy of becoming a shopping center pure player. The company continued to invest in leading shopping malls. With the openings of the extension-renovation of Rives d‘Arcins (Bordeaux) and Vinterbro (Oslo) in spring, followed by Jaude (Clermont-Ferrand) in fall, Klépierre proved, once again, its ability to develop successful shopping malls. Overall, including acquisitions of minorities in centers already owned (50% remaining stake in Odysseum, Montpellier, and 16.7% an additional stake in the IGC portofio of 9 shopping centers bringing Klépierre stake to 88%), a total of 410 million euros were spent in the most dynamic regions of continental Europe in 2013. Finally, thanks to the signature of a memorendum of understanding in December 2013 for the disposal of 127 Carrefour-anchored retail galleries to a consortium of investors, Klépierre will be able to focus further more its asset management expertise on a concentrated and coherent portfolio of shopping centers. This proposed transaction of 2 billion euros in total share, will also complete all efforts undertaken in 2013 to reinforce the Group financial profile and will consequently rank Klépierre among the best-performing REITs globally. 8.1.3.

The balance and any retained earnings together constitute distributable profit, from which is deducted any amount that the General Meeting of shareholders, acting on the recommendation of the Executive Board, and subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, may decide to assign to one or more discretionary, ordinary or extraordinary funds, with or without special appropriation, or to carry forward as retained earnings. The balance is apportioned among the shares. Any shareholder other than a physical person: (i) which directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of rights to dividends in the Company; and, (ii) whose own position or that of its shareholders which directly or indirectly hold 10% or more of its rights to dividends renders the Company liable for the 20% levy stipulated in article 208 C II ter of the French General Tax Code (the “Levy“) (the said shareholder is called a “Taxpaying Shareholder“), will owe the Company a sum equal to the amount of the Levy owed by the Company at the time of payment. If the Company directly or indirectly holds 10% or more of one or more Sociétés d‘investissement immobilier cotées cited in article 208-C of the French General Tax Code (a “SIIC Daughter“), the Taxpaying Shareholder will also owe the Company, when a dividend payment is made, a sum equal to the difference (the “Difference“) between (i) the amount which would have been paid to the Company by one or more SIIC Daughters if the said SIIC Daughter(s) had not been liable for the Levy because of the Taxpaying Shareholder multiplied by the percentage of the rights to dividends held by the shareholders other than the Taxpaying Shareholder and (ii) the amount actually paid by the said SIIC Daughter(s) multiplied by the percentage of the rights to dividends held by the shareholders other than the Taxpaying Shareholder, so that the other shareholders are not liable to pay any of the Levy paid by any of the SIICs in the chain of interests because of the Taxpaying Shareholder. Shareholders other than Taxpaying Shareholders will be in credit with the Company for an amount equal to the Difference, in proportion to their dividend entitlement. If there is more than one Taxpaying Shareholder, each Taxpaying Shareholder will owe the Company the portion of the Levy owed by the Company which its direct or indirect interest generates. The capacity of Taxpaying Shareholder is assessed on the date of the payment. Subject to the information supplied pursuant to the matters set out on page 282 of this registration document, any shareholder other than a physical person, which directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of the Company‘s capital, will be presumed to be a Taxpaying Shareholder. Any payment to a Taxpaying Shareholder is made by an entry in this shareholder‘s individual account (without generating interest), the chargeback from the account occurs within five business days of the entry after the sums owed by the Taxpaying Shareholder to the Company have been set off under the above provisions. The General Meeting of shareholders can grant each shareholder an option between payment of all or part of a dividend or interim dividend in cash or shares. If the payment is in shares, the Taxpaying Shareholder will receive a portion in shares (no odd lots will be created) and the other portion in cash (paid by entry in the individual current account) so the set off mechanism described above can apply to the portion of the dividend entered in the individual account. Except in the event of a share capital reduction, no distribution can be made to shareholders if shareholders‘ equity is, or would be as a result of the distribution, less than the amount of the share capital plus the reserves that cannot be distributed under the law or the bylaws. 8.2.

Breach of legal or statutory shareholding thresholds According to article 7 of the bylaws, any physical person or legal entity, acting alone or in concert with others, that acquires at least 2% of the Company‘s share capital (or any multiple thereof) is required to inform the Company of this fact by means of registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt setting out the number of shares held, and to do so within five trading days of the date on which each threshold is breached. If the 10% threshold of the Company‘s capital is directly or indirectly exceeded (i.e., ownership of 10% or more of the rights to the dividends paid by the Company), any shareholder other than a physical person must state whether or not it is a Taxpaying Shareholder (as defined in article 31 of the bylaws), in its threshold breach declaration. If the said shareholder were to state that it was not a Taxpaying Shareholder, it would have to prove this if requested by the Company and provide the Company with a legal opinion from an internationally reputed tax law firm, on the Company‘s request. Any shareholder other than a physical person who informs the Company that it has directly or indirectly exceeded the 10% threshold of the Company‘s capital must quickly notify the Company of any change in its taxation status causing it to acquire or lose the status of Taxpaying Shareholder. Unless they have been disclosed in accordance with the conditions set out above, the shares exceeding the statutory threshold that should have been disclosed will be stripped of voting rights at general meetings of shareholders where the failure to disclose is brought to the attention of the meeting or where one or more shareholders together holding 2% or more of the Company‘s share capital ask the meeting to do so. This withdrawal of voting rights will apply to all general meetings of shareholders held within two years of the date on which the appropriate declaration is duly made. All parties are also required to inform the Company, in accordance with the procedures and time schedules set out above, if their shareholding falls below any of the thresholds referred to above.

These stipulations are the following: Stipulation concerning the ownership and sale of the BNP Paribas Group’s shareholding in Klépierre and the governance of Klépierre are contained in a share Purchase Agreement covering the purchase of a block of Klépierre share representing 28.7% of its capital, which was agreed on March 7, 2012 by Simon Property Group and BNP Paribas (acting directly and through subsidiaries) and completed on March 14, 2012. The BNP Pariba Group’s lock-up commitment and Simon Property Group’s undertaking not to participate in a public tender offer for Klépierre shares both expirated on April 11, 2013, the date on which Klépierre’s Annual General Meeting was held. The stipulations concerning a) the right of first offer and b) Klépierre‘s governance remain in force.

This right of first offer applies to cases where Klépierre securities are transferred to a third party, it being specified that the notion of “transfer“ is intended to include any transfer of a property right, immediately or in the future, as well as any detachment of ownership, any form of security or trust and any derivative transaction. However, the right of first offer does not apply to the following transactions: (i) contributions to a public takeover bid for Klépierre (ii) sales on a regulated market, (iii) derivative contracts providing for a settlement in cash, (iv) issues of indexed debt securities and (v) loans of securities and the other transactions involving the transfer of ownership on a temporary basis. As an exception to these exceptions, the BNP Paribas group has agreed to give prior notice to the Simon Property Group in the case where the BNP Paribas group contemplates a placement of Klépierre securities representing at least 3% or more of the share capital and voting rights of Klépierre (in the form of a placement on the market, an accelerated book-building procedure or any similar procedure). In this case, the Simon Property Group may, within a period of three business days, exercise a right of first offer for all of the securities concerned by this transaction for the closing price on the day that BNP Paribas group informs the Simon Property Group of its plans. b) Governance of Klépierre Representation on the Supervisory Board: the purchase agreement provides for the representation of the Simon Property Group and BNP Paribas on the supervisory board of Klépierre translating into reciprocal voting agreements at the shareholders‘ meeting and within the supervisory board (for appointments by co-opting) in favor of representatives presented by the other party. It is agreed that the Supervisory Board will be composed of a maximum of 9 members, among which the Simon Property group will have 3 representatives (for as long as the Simon Property holds more than 25% of the share capital of Klépierre(1)) and the BNP Paribas group will have 2 representatives (for as long as the BNP Paribas group holds more than 15% of the share capital of Klépierre(2)). The 4 other members of the Board will be independent members freely appointed by the shareholders‘ meeting of Klépierre. In addition, at the time of the re-composition of the Supervisory Board, the BNP Paribas group agreed to vote for Mr. David Simon, representative of the Simon Property Group, to be appointed Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Klépierre. These voting agreements will remain in force for as long as (i) the Simon Property Group does not control Klépierre, (ii) the Simon Property Group holds at least 5% of the share capital of Klépierre and (iii) the BNP Paribas group holds at least 5% of the share capital and the voting rights of Klépierre. The BNP Paribas group nevertheless reserves the right not to be represented on the Supervisory Board of Klépierre, in which case the voting agreements in respect of the Supervisory Board will no longer apply. Representation on the Supervisory committees: the purchase agreement also provides for the implementation of a new composition of the operating committees of the Supervisory Board and mutual voting agreements from the 2 groups of shareholders to this effect: Investment Committee: 3 of the 6 members (including the chairman) will be chosen from among the representatives of the Simon Property Group and 1 member will be chosen from among the representatives of the BNP Paribas group; Appointment and Compensation Committee: 1 of the 4 members will be chosen from among the representatives of the Simon Property Group and 1 member will be chosen from among the representatives of the BNP Paribas group; Audit Committee: 1 of the 4 members will be chosen from among the representatives of the Simon Property Group and 1 member will be chosen from among the representatives of the BNP Paribas group; Sustainable Development Committee: 2 of the 4 members will be chosen from among the representatives of the Simon Property Group and 1 member will be chosen from among the representatives of the BNP Paribas group. These voting agreements will remain in force for as long as (i) the Simon Property Group does not control Klépierre, (ii) the Simon Property Group holds at least 5% of the share capital of Klépierre and (iii) the BNP Paribas group holds at least 5% of the share capital social and the voting rights of Klépierre and (iv) the BNP Paribas group is represented on the Supervisory Board of Klépierre(3). (1) This number of representatives will be reduced to 2 in the event that the participation of the Simon Property Group falls to between 15% and 25%, and to one representative in the event that the participation of the Simon Property Group falls to between 5% and 15%. (2) This number of representatives will be reduced to one in the event that the participation of the BNP Paribas group falls to between 5% and 15%. (3) The parties also provided for a distribution of the seats on the committees for those cases where the Simon Property Group has only 2 or 1 representative(s) on the Supervisory Board and for those cases where the BNP Paribas group no longer has more than one representative on the Supervisory Board.

REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD Approval of financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 Dear Shareholders, Pursuant to the provisions of article L. 225-68 of the French Commercial Code, we are required to make our observations concerning the Executive Board report which has just been read to you as well as concerning the corporate and consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Supervisory Board has been kept regularly up to date by the Executive Board about the Group’s business and has carried out the required audits and controls. To do this as part of its mission, the Supervisory Board called on the services of the special-purpose committees: the Investment Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nomination and Compensation Committee and the Sustainable Development Committee. The Supervisory Board has no special observations to make concerning the Executive Board’s report and the results of fiscal year 2013. It therefore invites you to approve the financial statements and the resolutions proposed. The Supervisory Board wishes to thank the Executive Board and all Company staff for their work and effort in 2013. The Supervisory Board 9.2. REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD Meeting of the Supervisory Board on January 30, 2014 concernning the 2013 financial year Pursuant to Article L. 225-68 of the French Commercial Code and in my capacity as Chairman of Klépierre’s Supervisory Board, I have the honor of presenting to you this report, as approved by the Supervisory Board at its meeting on January 30, 2014 on the 2013 financial year. It includes information about: the composition and application of the principle of gender balance on the Supervisory Board and the preparation and organization of the Supervisory Board’s work; the internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the Klépierre Group(1); corporate governance; arrangements for shareholders to participate at the Company’s annual General Meetings; and publication of information concerning factors that may have an impact in the event of a public offer. The Corporate governance code to which the Group has voluntarily referred for the purpose of drafting this report is the Corporate governance code for listed companies published in December 2008 and amended in April 2010 and June 2013 by AFEP (French association of private businesses) and MEDEF (French employers association). It is worth noting that the Company has had the corporate form of a société anonyme (joint-stock corporation) with an Executive Board and Supervisory Board since July 21, 1998. This corporate form provides for separation between management of the Company and oversight of this management by the Supervisory Board(2). I – Composition and application of the principle of gender balance on the Supervisory Board – preparation and organization of the Supervisory Board’s work The primary role of the Supervisory Board is to exercise permanent control of the Executive Board’s management. To this end, at all times of the year, it carries out the checks and controls it deems appropriate and may ask for any documents that it deems useful for this task to be communicated to it. The Executive Board must report to it on its management at least once every quarter and submit the financial statements for verification and inspection. The Supervisory Board authorizes the transactions and agreements referred to in Articles L. 225-68 para. 2 and L. 225-86 of the French Commercial Code. (1) The Klépierre Group refers to all the subsidiaries of the Group in France and abroad, including Steen & Strøm, subject to the specific organizational features described below. (2) AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code (Point 3). ANNUAL REPOR T 292 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 G E N E R AL ME E T I N G RE PO R T O F TH E C HA I RM A N OF T HE SU P ERVI SORY BOA RD 9 Pursuant to Article 16 of the Articles of Association(3), it also authorizes: transactions likely to affect the strategy of the Company and its Group and to have an impact on their finances and the scope of their business; issues of negotiable securities, irrespective of their nature, which may lead to a change in the Company’s capital stock; the following transactions where their unit amount exceeds €8 million or an equivalent amount in any other currency; a) acquiring or selling any shareholdings in any companies incorporated or to be incorporated, except for Klépierre Group companies to which properties belonging to the Klépierre Group are contributed or sold; b) acquiring or selling any real property assets, except where they are sold or contributed to a company belonging to the Klépierre Group; c) in the event of a dispute, entering into any agreement or settlement, and accepting any arbitration agreements. The Supervisory Board has granted powers to its Chairman to authorize the Executive Board to carry out the transactions referred to in paragraphs a), b) and c) above where these individually do not exceed 46 million euros or an equivalent amount in any other currency. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board report to the Supervisory Board on the use made of these powers. Composition of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board has at least 3 members and no more than 12 members who are appointed by shareholders at the Ordinary General Meeting for a term of three years(4). Each member of the Supervisory Board must hold at least 60 shares throughout his/her term in office. The Supervisory Board chooses a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman from among these members. During the 2013 financial year, the Supervisory Board had 9 members, namely Messrs. David Simon (Chairman), Vivien Lévy-Garboua (Vice-Chairman), Bertrand de Feydeau, Steven Fivel, Bertrand Jacquillat, François Kayat, and Mrs. Dominique Aubernon, Mrs. Catherine Simoni and Mrs. Rose-Marie Van Lerberghe. The renewal and ratification of the terms in office approved by the General Meeting of the shareholders on April 11, 2013 did not alter the Supervisory Board’s gender balance, with the percentage of women at 33.33%(5). Brief resumes of Supervisory Board members are provided in the Governance section of the 2013 Registration Document, and their appointments and duties are listed in the Corporate governance section of this document. A member of the Supervisory Board is considered as independent when s/he has no relationship whatsoever with the Company, its Group or its management liable to compromise his/her freedom of judgment. According to the definition laid down in the AFEP-MEDEF Code, 4 of the 9 Supervisory Board members are independent based on the criteria presented, namely Messrs. Bertrand de Feydeau(6) and Bertrand Jacquillat, and Mrs. Catherine Simoni and Mrs. Rose-Marie Van Lerberghe(7), (i.e. 44.44%). BNP Paribas held a majority interest in Klépierre until March 14, 2012 when it sold a 28.7% interest in Klépierre’s capital stock to Simon Property Group. Since then, given the absence of a majority shareholder, half of the members of the Supervisory Board should have been independent, which is not yet the case. That said, to move closer towards this threshold, 2 additional independent members were appointed, namely Mrs. Catherine Simoni and Mrs. Rose-Marie Van Lerberghe. The Supervisory Board will continue to move in the direction of compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code as soon as the number of Supervisory Board members whose term of office comes up for renewal allows for making such change without significantly altering the number of representatives of major shareholders on the Board. Meetings of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board meets as often as the interests of the Company require. For the Supervisory Board to deliberate validly, at least half of its members must be present. Members may participate in the Board’s deliberations by video link or by any other means of telecommunication identifying them and guaranteeing that they can participate, except for deliberations involving the verification and control of the annual and consolidated financial statements. (3) AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code (Point 4). (4) Because of the dates on which the Supervisory Board members were appointed, their terms of office are in fact staggered. (5) AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code (Point 6). (6) AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code (Point 9): While Mr. Bertrand de Feydeau has held his office for more than twelve years, the Supervisory Board considers that Mr. de Feydeau has always shown complete independence in his contribution to the Board’s work. Because he is at an advanced stage in his career, there is no risk that Mr. de Feydeau’s independence will be reduced in the future and he cannot be deemed to have developed any close ties with the Company or its executive management that would be liable to compromise his independence in the future. (7) AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code (Point 9).

If votes are evenly split, the Chairman of the meeting holds the casting vote. In accordance with the provisions of Article L. 823-17 of the French Commercial Code, the Company’s Statutory Auditors are asked to attend Board meetings reviewing or approving the annual or interim financial statements. The Board met 10 times during the 2013 financial year, with an attendance rate of 93.33%(8). The main points debated during these meetings were: t he 2012 annual and consolidated financial statements and the corresponding management report; the Executive Board’s quarterly business review; the interim individual and consolidated financial statements; the management documents used for budgeting and forecasting purposes; the report of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board; the renewal of the terms in office and appointment of Supervisory Board members; the renewal of the term in office of the Vice-Chairman of the Supervisory Board; the renewal of the term in office of Executive Board members; the renewal of the term in office of the Chairman of the Executive Board; the compensation paid to Executive Board members; the simplified public tender offer for Klémurs shares, squeeze-out procedure and delisting; the composition of the specialized committees; a bonus share allotment plan; investments and disposals in France and abroad; financing transactions; the operation of the Supervisory Board; the authorization granted annually to the Executive Board to issue guarantees and endorsements; related party agreements. The Supervisory Board decided at its meeting on January 30, 2014, in advance of the annual board appraisal provided for in the AFEP-MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance, to ask each of its members to complete an evaluation questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire will be reviewed at a forthcoming meeting, during which the aforementioned appraisal will be carried out. The work of the Supervisory Board and that of the specialized committees is prepared and organized by their respective Chairmen. Organization and operation of the specialized committees assisting the Supervisory Board To fulfil its duties, the Supervisory Board has set up specialized committees(9). Within its area of expertise, each Committee issues proposals, recommendations and opinions, where required, and reports on its duties to the Supervisory Board. Additional information about the duties and operation of these Committees is provided in the “Committees” section of the business review. The Committees are: The Investment Committee This committee has at least 3 and no more than 6 members chosen by the Supervisory Board from among its members. During the 2013 financial year, the Investment Committee consisted of Messrs. David Simon (Chairman of the Investment Committee), Bertrand de Feydeau, Steven Fivel, François Kayat, and Mrs. Dominique Aubernon and Mrs. Catherine Simoni. 2 of its 6 members (ratio of 33.33%) are considered as independent, namely Mr. Bertrand de Feydeau and Mrs. Catherine Simoni. The role of this committee is to consider potential investments and disposals proposed to it before they are formally authorized by the Supervisory Board. To this end, it reviews the real estate, commercial, legal and financial aspects of the transactions. In particular, it ensures that these transactions are consistent with the strategy and satisfy the investment criteria of the Klépierre Group. Before giving the go-ahead, the Investment Committee may, if needed, ask for additional information about or recommend changes in some or all of the real estate, commercial, legal or financial aspects. It met 6 times during the 2013 financial year, with an attendance rate of 88.89%(10). (8) AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code (Point 11). (9) AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code (Point 15).

The Audit Committee(11) This committee has at least 3 and no more than 6 members chosen by the Supervisory Board from among its members. During the 2013 financial year, it consisted of Messrs. Bertrand Jacquillat (Chairman of the Audit Committee – independent member), François Kayat, Vivien Lévy-Garboua and of Mrs. Rose-Marie van Lerberghe. 2 of its 4 members (ratio of 50%) are considered as independent, namely Mr. Bertrand Jacquillat and Mrs. Rose-Marie Van Lerberghe(12). The committee meets at least twice per year based on a schedule of meetings determined by the Supervisory Board. Even so, the Committee may meet at the request of at least 2 of its members. For it to be able to deliberate validly, at least half of the committee’s members must be present. One Committee member cannot be represented by another. Those attending committee meetings are the Chairman of the Executive Board, Executive Board members, representatives of the Statutory Auditors and any other persons from whom the committee wishes to hear. The Audit Committee has been entrusted by the Supervisory Board with the following tasks: r eview and assessment of the financial documents distributed at the end of accounting periods; review and assessment of the conclusions and recommendations of the Statutory Auditors, as well as appointing them and determining their fees; review and assessment of internal control systems and how the Company discharges its regulatory internal control obligations. To help it fulfil its tasks, the committee may ask the Executive Board to conduct any interviews and provide it with any information it requires. It met 3 times during the 2013 financial year, with an attendance rate of 83.33%(13). Its work focused mainly on: r eviewing the annual and interim individual and consolidated financial statements and the subsequent events and their impact; monitoring the principal indicators, such as cash flow, net asset value and EPRA earnings; tracking bank covenants; keeping track of areas of expertise and expert methodology; conducting a tax review of the Group; reviewing the audit conclusions issued by the Statutory Auditors, their budgets for 2013 and 2014 and their declaration of independence; examining the report by periodic control and permanent control and risk management on their activities during 2013 and validating their action plan for 2014. The Nomination and Compensation Committee(14) This committee has at least 2 and no more than 5 members chosen by the Supervisory Board from among its members. During the 2013 financial year, the Nomination and Compensation Committee consisted of Messrs. Bertrand de Feydeau (Chairman of the Nomination and Compensation Committee – independent member), Steven Fivel, Vivien Lévy-Garboua and Mrs. Rose-Marie Van Lerberghe. 2 of its 4 members (ratio of 50%) are considered as independent, namely Mr. Bertrand de Feydeau and Mrs. Rose-Marie Van Lerberghe(15). This committee, which meets at least once every year, prepares recommendations for the Supervisory Board concerning the nomination and compensation of Executive Committee members, pension and personal protection plans, benefits in kind, and stock option plans and bonus share plans. (11) AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code (Point 16). (12) AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code (Point 16): the composition of the Audit Committee is not fully compliant with the Code, which recommends that independent members should account for at least two-thirds of its members. The departure from these recommendations is justified by the change in the composition of the Supervisory Board during 2012 following the sale by the BNP Paribas Group of a 28.7% interest in Klépierre’s capital stock to Simon Property Group. Nonetheless, the Supervisory Board ensured that the Audit Committee had 2 independent members since 2012 and will continue moving in the direction of compliance as soon as the number of Supervisory Board members whose term of office comes up for renewal allows for making such change.

The Chairman of the Executive Board participated in the work of the Nomination Committee. The compensation paid to Executive Board members in 2013 is disclosed in section “Corporate officers“ of the 2013 Registration document. The Sustainable Development Committee This Committee has at least 2 and no more than 4 members chosen by the Supervisory Board from among its members. During the 2013 financial year, it consisted of Messrs. Steven Fivel (Chairman of the Sustainable Development Committee), François Kayat and Vivien Lévy-Garboua and of Mrs. Catherine Simoni. One of its 4 members (i.e. independence ratio 25%) is regarded as independent, namely Mrs. Catherine Simoni. This Committee, which meets at least twice every year, is tasked with: cataloguing the principal categories of risk to which Klépierre’s business is exposed; monitoring the action program drawn up to contend with these; and reviewing the Klépierre Group’s contribution to sustainable development. It met 3 times during the 2013 financial year, with an attendance rate of 83.33%(17). Its work focused mainly on: extra-financial performance: 2012 results; Klépierre’s commitments for the 2013 to 2020 period: action plan and objectives; sustainable development performance: principal extra-financial ratings for 2013; main projects launched. II – Internal control and risk management framework The Klépierre Group’s internal control framework is predicated on the general risk management and internal control principles laid down in the reference framework published by the Autorité des marchés financiers in July 2010. I) Objectives and principles Internal control is the organization of processes, procedures and controls implemented by management for the ultimate purpose of ensuring overall control of risks and providing reasonable assurance that strategic goals will be achieved. In particular, this organization is predicated on: a  pplying instructions and guidelines laid down by the Executive Board; making operations as efficient as possible and ensuring the Group’s internal processes work smoothly; safeguarding the reliability of information provided to internal and external users; complying with the laws and regulations. Every manager needs to implement effective controls over the activities for which s/he is responsible. Every Klépierre Group employee contributes to the internal control framework in an environment in which: the description of the Group’s governance and organization of its business lines and functions provides the general framework for achieving its objectives; there is a repository of guidelines laying down and circulating the internal rules and procedures to be followed while systematically incorporating instructions about the controls to be carried out; the principle of delegation represents the cornerstone of the system. It is reflected in the use of correspondents who are responsible for consistent implementation of the Group’s policies; (16) AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code (Point 11).

ANNUAL REPOR T 296 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 G E N E R AL ME E T I N G RE PO R T O F TH E C HA I RM A N OF T HE SU P ERVI SORY BOA RD 9 d  uties are segregated by keeping the operational roles separate from supervisory roles; compliance with the laws and regulations is assured by the introduction of professional conduct rules for employees, especially in relation to data confidentiality, a good practice code for relationships with third parties and the use of information system resources. The internal control framework applies to all the (operational and corporate) entities in the Klépierre Group. The internal control framework designed to meet the various objectives outlined above does not, however, provide any certainty that the objectives set will be achieved owing to the inherent limitations of all procedures. Even so, it aims to make a major contribution towards attaining them. II) Organization of risk management and internal control The Group’s risk management and internal control framework is overseen by an Internal Control division. It reports to the Executive Board and encompasses the permanent control, periodic control and ethics & compliance functions. The Internal Control division is ultimately responsible for ensuring the consistency and efficacy of internal control. Within the business lines and foreign subsidiaries, it has direct access to the risk and internal control officers, who form a functional network reporting to it. It is responsible for implementing risk monitoring and mitigation tools and systems, such as risk mapping and an incident database. It is also in charge of work on business continuity planning (BCP) and the crisis management unit. Lastly, it handles reporting to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. Risk management The Klépierre Group aims to anticipate and manage the major risk factors likely to affect attainment of its objectives and compromise compliance with the laws and regulations. Risks are catalogued as part of a risk mapping process conducted by means of business processes and support functions and updated periodically. During each update, the Internal Control division ensures that the following objectives are achieved: identify and assess the risks from strategic to operational level to protect the value, assets and reputation of the Group covering both the inherent risks(18) and the controllable risks; learn lessons from incidents and risks that have arisen and continuously improve the internal control framework; reeinforce and share a common vision of risks within the Group. During 2013, the Group began a new drive to update the risk mapping in order to take into account the impact of the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system implemented across Europe at all subsidiaries (Scandinavia is in the final phase of deployment). The ERP software has transformed the overall information system, modernized processes at every level of the business lines and functions, enhanced the fluidity of data flows by providing a unified platform and made the organization more effective and secure. The system has also helped to strengthen the internal control framework by introducing unified terminology and processes, together with common Group-wide rules. It has automated a large number of first-level controls, so teams can concentrate their efforts on second-level controls. Overall internal control plan The Internal Control division draws up the overall permanent control and periodic control plan. The role of the permanent control function is to coordinate a framework in which operational staff play the leading role. To this end: it raises their awareness and trains them in the principles of internal control; it coordinates the measures they take; it ensures that firstand second-level control plans exist and are integrated within formally defined procedures, and it oversees the Group’s regulatory watch. The periodic control function is handled by the internal audit division, which is responsible for assessing the operation of the risk management and internal control frameworks, regularly monitoring them and making recommendations to enhance them. It plays a part in raising awareness and training managers in internal control, but is not involved in introducing the framework or implementing it on a daily basis. Its analyses and observations help to guide the work of the permanent control function and to identify areas for improvement and strengthen procedures. The periodic control function’s scope of action encompasses all the Group’s activities and risks across all of its units, including the activities of subsidiaries and those outsourced contractually. In addition, the identification of a risk automatically justifies the use of the periodic control function’s power to launch any investigation it deems necessary. The internal audit function conducted two assignments during 2013. The Ethics & Compliance function ensures that the Group complies with ethical and professional standards, prevents insider trading and controls the anti-money-laundering and corruption measures taken. The Group introduced the Business Whistleblowing framework under which any employee can raise questions about the risk of compliance breaches that s/he may encounter. (18) It is worth noting that the risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of the management report correspond more to the risks inherent in Klépierre’s business activities arising from the market, macroeconomic conditions and changes in the regulatory framework.

The Executive Board’s role is to lay down the general principles for the internal control framework, design and implement the appropriate internal control system and the corresponding roles and responsibilities and make sure that it works smoothly, improving it where necessary. At least once every year, it reports to the Audit Committee on the Group’s internal control framework, any changes in it and the findings of the work performed by the various framework participants. A presentation was given to the Audit Committee on activities during 2013 and the action plan for 2014. Under the responsibility of the Internal Control division, the Risk and Internal Control Committee meets at least twice a year and consists of representatives from the business lines and support functions across all regions. Its work and conclusions will be reported to Klépierre’s Executive Board, as well as to the Audit Committee. Supervision also makes use of the comments and recommendations made by the Statutory Auditors or by the regulatory/supervisory bodies. Implementation of remedial action plans is monitored centrally by the Internal Control division and the Accounting division. III) Control measures addressing major risks The control measures are described by major risk area: a) Security and safety of individuals and assets The Klépierre Group attaches great importance to ensuring the safety and security of individuals and assets across its entire portfolio. During a project construction or extension phase, a dedicated team from the Legal Affairs Division is responsible for consulting insurance companies and negotiating and arranging insurance policies covering every development, all aspects of project contracting and all project risks in line with a formal procedure. Suppliers are selected using an internal process based on various criteria concerning their qualification, reputation and financial position. Klépierre requires its suppliers to declare all their subcontractors, which are subject to Klépierre’s approval. In addition, it has a compliance charter, and the compliance clause is incorporated in all contracts with suppliers. Assets in service undergo security and safety checks performed by local teams, which report back to head office in a standardized format at least once every quarter. Technical managers conduct annual inspections of shopping centers, leading to the preparation of action plans and a lifting of restrictions procedure. Furthermore, external control organizations also conduct safety and security checks. Every shopping center manager has an annual schedule of inspection visits. A Monitoring committee is held on a monthly basis to examine the weekly management chart on follow-up of the action plan. In addition, a Risk Management Committee meeting three times every year is charged with learning the lessons from incidents reported and performing the regulatory watch. An incident database has been implemented across the shopping centers in France, Norway and Denmark. Paper records are kept in other countries and will be replaced shortly with electronic systems. These databases, which are updated on a daily basis, help to monitor the risks associated with the safety and security of individuals and assets in the shopping centers. These indicators are monitored by the Risk Management Committee. At the same time, the Internal Audit function conducts audits in France of compliance with the regulations and internal procedures in connection with the management of shopping malls every three years using standard reference frameworks covering the safety and security of individuals and assets and in particular compliance with the regulations applicable to facilities open to the general public. b) Investments All proposals to acquire, develop or sell assets are studied during a pre-committee with the Investment Director and the Development Officer before they are reviewed by the Development Committee. Next the Development Committee selects projects for further analysis and approves a research budget. For transactions of less than €8 million, the decision is made by the Executive Board. Transactions in excess of €8 million are authorized by the Supervisory Board after they have been reviewed by the Investment Committee composed of certain members of the Supervisory Board. To identify all aspects of the risks during the due diligence process, it calls on the services of a large number of specialized and highly reputed advisors (lawyers, notaries, technical experts, etc.). To gain greater insight into the competitive environment, an internal department handles the competitor watch – a role sometimes entrusted to external firms outside France. The Legal Affairs Division reviews all aspects of compliance with the laws and regulations. To keep a tighter grip on costs, a technical team dedicated to supporting the project leader jointly determines the specifications and budget with the assistance of construction analysts and highly reputed project managers. The project’s progress and use of the budgeted funds are tracked on a weekly basis by the operational team, which reports regularly to the regional managers and on a quarterly basis to the Operations Committee. All Klépierre’s assets are valued by external firms twice a year. The asset managers in each area are tasked with providing checked data to experts, who may ask for explanations in the event of major fluctuations in values. The figures duly verified by expert assessments are then controlled and analyzed by the Investment department and by the Accounting department. ANNUAL REPOR T 298 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 G E N E R AL ME E T I N G RE PO R T O F TH E C HA I RM A N OF T HE SU P ERVI SORY BOA RD 9 All Klépierre’s assets are scored each year using an internal qualitative and quantitative tool. Assets considered as sensitive are subject to extensive and regular tracking. c) Commercialization The performance and returns on Klépierre’s portfolio as a whole are monitored regularly. The Group has performance indicators covering its portfolio, revenues, footfall, etc., which are produced automatically. In the event of an abrupt or severe deterioration, meetings are held at the owner’s request, and an action plan is then drawn up. The inter-business Letting Committee meets every 2 weeks to review all the projects, discuss difficulties and make the appropriate decisions. A rental grid and management chart are prepared with indicators used to monitor project lettings. The Development Committee approves the budget and rental grid for the project and makes any requisite adjustments in the event of warnings about the level of the occupancy cost ratio and financial terms. Lease renewals and vacant properties are reported on a weekly basis in a commercial forecasting system. A specific management chart listing the measures to be carried out is validated by the Executive Committee. d) Business continuity Under its risk management policy, Klépierre has to: identify its business continuity requirements; draw up the corresponding action plans; perform regular tests to measure the efficiency of this plan; define and implement a specific crisis management framework. In 2013, the Group updated its business continuity plan (BCP) again. The framework is predicated on a set of organizational and functional procedures geared to the possible types of incident. The following scenarios are covered:  central building is damaged; a the Group’s server room is damaged; a pandemic is declared. The BCP is fleshed out by individual divisions and departments: each manager defines the activities covered, the relevant staff and requisite requirements for ensuring continuity of business. If a central building is affected, teams are transferred to a failover site. In the event of a crisis, a crisis unit is responsible for coordinating the overall response to the situation that has occurred, ensuring the safety of the Group’s entire staff and business continuity. It also has to make sure that its response to the crisis helps to create confidence in the Group and to reduce the public’s potential concerns. During periods of crisis management, the crisis unit makes any decisions necessary for the smooth operation of the Group, until the situation reverts to normal. e) Treasury and financing Klépierre identifies and assesses on a regular basis its exposure to the various sources of risk (interest rate, liquidity, currency and counterparty). The interest-rate hedging strategy was outlined in the financial report, including the quantitative results of interest-rate sensitivity tests. Financial risk management and in particular the Group’s financial position, financing requirements and interest-rate risk hedging are handled by the Treasury and Financing division. From a financing standpoint, a specialized tool has been rolled out across Europe to record and value financing and derivative products. The Treasury and Financing division also has a system monitoring the capital markets in real time. The Treasury and Financing division reports to the Deputy CEO in charge of Finance and the Office Property Segment (Executive Board member), bearing in mind that all major financing and hedging transactions are validated in advance by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board validates the projected financing plan, which lays down the major guidelines in terms of determining the size and type of borrowings and hedging interest-rate risk. During the year, the principal decisions in terms of financial transactions are presented individually for approval to the Supervisory Board, and a report on these transactions is given to it once they have been completed. Trends in the covenant situation (financial ratios) are monitored on a semi-annual basis and in particular when new transactions are arranged. Treasury is managed by the Treasury and Financing division, which coordinates the reporting and monitoring of the subsidiaries’ cash projections, supporting a cash pooling system for the entire Group (except for Steen & Strøm). Reporting takes place on a monthly basis. The Treasury & Financing division also drafts internal procedures stating the roles of the Group’s various participants in relation to cash management and the implementation of Klépierre’s share buyback programs. In addition, it validates the choice of banks and financial terms every time the Group requests the opening of, changes to or close of bank accounts for the whole Group. ANN UAL R E POR T 299 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 G E N E R AL ME E T I N G RE PO R T O F THE CHA I RM A N OF T HE SU P ERVI SORY BOA RD 9 f) Legal affairs and regulations The Group Legal Affairs division, which reports to the Executive Board and has functional responsibility for the legal affairs units in each country, ensures that legal risks arising from the business lines and functions are managed properly in line with the integrated risk management process. The regulatory watch is carried out in constant liaison with specialized external firms. The Group Legal Affairs division has developed a reporting procedure covering disputes. It works closely together with the relevant legal affairs units to defend the Group’s interests. Accordingly, it helps to curb and to manage the legal risks to which the Group is exposed owing in particular to its owner/manager status. It drafts and verifies the contractual undertakings given by the Group and ensures that they comply with the provisions of the law and the regulations. The Group Legal Affairs division is working together with the legal affairs units in various countries on drafting a European-type lease to harmonize legal practices and establish unified positions vis-à-vis international retail chains. The Group Legal Affairs division assists operational staff with the arrangement of specific contracts and generally speaking with any out-of-theordinary requests to ensure that the applicable regulations are complied with, irrespective of the country in which the Group is operating. Likewise, the procedures implemented by the Group Legal Affairs division to curb the risks to which the Group’s operations are exposed and to ensure the proper completion of the requisite legal formalities. The Group Legal Affairs division is also in charge of arranging delegations of authority governing the actions of all the Group’s employees. It also ensures compliance with the selection procedures for the Group’s corporate officers. Finally, as a listed company, Klépierre also has to abide by the rules concerning publications (see the Financial Reporting section below), corporate governance (see the first part of the report) and insider trading. To prevent the risk of insider trading, the Company has adopted a code of conduct governing transactions in its shares, which is updated regularly. Accordingly, permanent insiders are authorized to carry out transactions in the Company’s shares only during clearly defined periods. g) Information system Advances in information technology have paved the way for significant development of corporate information systems. Good information systems governance enhances the efficiency of internal control rules. Klépierre has rolled out an ERP system at its subsidiaries. This new software: provides investors with reliable and consistent business and financial information;  armonizes and aligns processes to enhance the Group’s image and create shared terminology and also facilitates the integration of new units; h simplifies the architecture of the corporate information system by placing restrictions on local systems and facilitating data exchanges; delivers operational improvements through automated transactions and greater organizational efficiency. The principal control measures implemented by Klépierre in its projects are: the use of an ERP system with a single data repository to eliminate the majority of interfaces between business lines and accounting and to protect data integrity; the activation of critical controls in the system to safeguard the consistency of repositories in particular, thereby curbing manual inputs and guaranteeing the unicity of records; the segregation of input and validation duties for transactions, a principle supported by the system through authorization profiles. Every time data considered as sensitive is created or edited, it has to be validated before it can be used in operations (bank data, commitments, etc.); the development of reporting supplements control measures that cannot be automated. Use of this reporting is incorporated in the operational procedures; the core model concept guarantees the consistency of the framework across all the countries in which the Group is present, thereby making the higher-level controls more reliable. All the data is backed up on a daily basis, with the storage media being kept away from operating sites. IV) Preparation and processing of financial and accounting data The reliability of financial and accounting data, as well as compliance with the regulations in force and internal instructions form 2 of the principal internal control objectives of the accounting production process. To ensure adequate coverage of the major accounting risks, accounting internal control is predicated on knowledge of the operational processes and how they are translated in the accounts, on the definition of the responsibilities of the various participants in the process and on information system security. ANNUAL REPOR T 300 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 G E N E R AL ME E T I N G RE PO R T O F TH E C HA I RM A N OF T HE SU P ERVI SORY BOA RD 9 Accounting organization Accounting tasks are carried out by the finance department in each country in which Klépierre has a presence. The individual and consolidated financial statements are prepared by the accounting, management control and information system division, which reports directly to the Executive Board. The deployment of an ERP system across the Group makes it possible to record day-to-day transactions and enter accounting data in an integrated and automated manner. The whole process, which aims to deliver reliable and consistent data for internal and external users, is designed and built around a single repository and common rules, to guarantee data integrity and enhance the consistency of the quality of the accounting data and its traceability. Furthermore, the integration of what traditionally were manual controls in the ERP system helps to reduce sources of error. The restrictions on manual entries helps to boost the quality of the data in the system. All the processes used to prepare accounting data are subject to accounting control programs at various levels, including validation rules, authorizations and instructions concerning supporting evidence for and documentation of accounting tasks. The “accounting internal control” unit, which reports directly to the Deputy CFO is in charge of defining and distributing the accounting control rules and ensuring the smooth operation of the internal control environment. In particular, it is involved in the payment process at Group level with defining the segregation of duties and authorizations. The quarterly reporting system for management control (present at the head office and at the subsidiaries) is used to track trends in the principal key performance indicators by country and by asset and to ensure that these are properly geared to the objectives laid down in the annual budget approved by management. In addition, global reconciliation is handled by Group management control to ensure the consistency of the accounting results with the consolidated management results. The clarity of financial reporting and the pertinence of accounting methods are overseen by the Audit Committee, in tandem with the Statutory Auditors. Financial reporting and accounting data is then presented to and commented on by the Supervisory Board. Account closing process and consolidation The accounts are consolidated by the Consolidation division for the entire scope of the Group. Data for the consolidation system used at almost all Klépierre’s main subsidiaries is provided by the finance department in each country via interfaces with the local accounts. Off-balance sheet commitments are also held centrally in it by consolidated unit. The consolidated financial statements are prepared using a process laid down in instructions and predicated on a detailed schedule circulated to all the finance departments to ensure that the deadlines are met and that the data produced complies with the Group’s accounting standards. The principal accounting controls carried out at each quarterly close in the consolidation process are:  ontrols on changes in the scope of consolidation; c analysis of and supporting evidence for all consolidation adjustments; analysis of and explanations for all deviations from budgets and projections. At each quarterly close, the Accounting division coordinates an internal certification process for the accounting data reported by country, as well as the controls performed, in which the finance director for each country certifies: t he reliability and compliance of the accounting data provided compared to the regulations in force and the Group standards; smooth operation of the accounting internal control system, safeguarding the quality of the accounting data; significant events that occurred after the close of the accounts and their financial impact on the consolidated financial statements.

It is tasked with producing, drafting and distributing the financial reporting documents published with a view to presenting the Group’s various activities to shareholders, institutional investors and financial analysts, explaining its results and outlining its expansion strategy. The financial reporting team continuously monitors its reporting obligations. The disclosure of information to the financial markets takes place according to a precise schedule that is circulated internally. With support from various departments, the team designs the financial press releases, and the earnings and theme-based presentations. It coordinates the preparation of all the various parts of the annual report and ensures that it is distributed. In conjunction with the Legal Affairs division, it makes sure that information is provided in line with the required deadlines and in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations. III – Corporate Governance At its meeting on December 19, 2008, the members of the Supervisory Board confirmed that the Company had agreed to adopt the corporate governance rules laid down in the AFEP/MEDEF(19) Code (available on the web site at www.medef.fr). Compensation of Supervisory Board and specialized committee members(20) : The compensation paid to Supervisory Board and specialized committee members comprises attendance fees. The overall allocation of attendance fees set aside for Supervisory Board members stood at €270 000 for 2013, to be paid out based on the following conditions: €72 000 as a fixed allocation to be distributed evenly among Supervisory Board members;  108 000 as a combined variable allocation divided into 2 equal portions as compensation for (i) actual attendance at Supervisory Board meet€ ings by its members, and (ii) actual attendance by Supervisory Board members at meetings of the special committees. In addition, a combined fixed amount of €90 000 is allocated as compensation for the specific duties of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Supervisory Board and those of the Chairman of the special committees. The share of the attendance fees paid individually to each member of the Supervisory Board in 2013 is shown in the Compensation and benefits paid to corporate officers section of the 2013 Registration Document. Internal rules governing the Supervisory Board and its Committees The internal rules of the Supervisory Board and each of its committees are part of a transparency-based approach, in line with the corporate governance principles applicable to listed companies. These internal rules lay down the duties and modus operandi of the Supervisory Board and the various committees. They were reviewed by the Supervisory Board on March 14, 2012 when the Simon Property Group became a shareholder to facilitate meetings of the Committees and of the Supervisory Board. IV – Arrangements for shareholders to participate at the Company’s Annual General Meetings The rules applicable to General Meetings and in particular to shareholder participation are laid down in Section V of the Company’s Articles of Association and in the General Information section of the 2013 Registration Document. V – Information about factors that may have an impact in the event of a public offer Information about factors that may have an impact in the event of a public offer is disclosed in the General Information section concerning the capital stock in the 2013 Registration Document (capital structure/delegations of powers and authorizations granted to the Executive Board by the General Meetings of the shareholders on April 7, 2011, April 12, 2012 and April 11, 2013) and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements – Note 8.2.

It also approves the transactions reflected in those financial statements and summarized in these reports. It notes that the financial statements for the financial year 2013 do not reflect expenses and charges referred to in article 39-4 of the French General Tax Code. SECOND RESOLUTION (Approval of the consolidated Company’s financial statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2013) The General Meeting, acting in accordance with the quorum and majority requirements for Ordinary General Meetings, having taken into account the reports of the Executive Board, of the Supervisory Board, and of the statutory auditors, approves the Company’s consolidated financial statements as they have been presented for the financial year ending December 31, 2013, including the balance sheet, the income statement and the annex, resulting in a profit of 137 020 000.00 euros. It also approves the transactions reflected in those financial statements and summarized in those reports. THIRD RESOLUTION (Allocation of income for the financial year ending 31 December 2013 and determination of the amount of the dividend) The General Meeting, acting in accordance with the quorum and majority requirements for Ordinary General Meetings, resolves to allocate as follows the income of the financial year, which amounts to 75 526 031.90 euros, as follows: Profits 75 526 031.90 euros Retained earnings 629 296 104.50 euros -----------------------------------------Distributable earnings 704 822 136.40 euros Dividends to shareholders 309 179 027.00 euros – Tax-exempt dividends 185 507 416.20 euros – Taxable dividends 123 671 610.80 euros (resulting in a distribution of 1,55 euro per share) -----------------------------------------Balance of retained earnings 395 643 109.40 euros The dividend amount of 309 179 027.00 euros, which represents a dividend of 1.55 euro per share, constitutes revenue eligible for an allowance at a rate of 40% (as stated in article 158-3-2° of the French General Tax Code) up to 0.62 euro per share. The balance (which would be 0.93 euro per share) corresponding to the exempted activity dividend is not eligible for this tax deduction. These figures were calculated using the total number of shares making up the capital stock at December 31, 2013 and could vary if the number of shares entitled to dividends changes between January 1, 2014 and the ex-dividend date. In accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-210 of the French Commercial Code, the General Meeting determines that the amount corresponding to treasury shares at the dividend payment date, as well as the amount shareholders may waive, will be allocated to “retained earnings”. Such sums will reduce the distribution deducted from the results of the exempted activity and of the taxable activities, in the same proportions as those indicated above (i.e., 0.93 euro per share for the results of exempted activity and 0.62 euro per share for the results of taxable activities). Dividend will be detached from the share on April 14, 2014 and paid in cash on April 17, 2014. As a reminder, according to article 243 bis of the French General Tax Code, the dividends of the last three financial years were as follows: Amount eligible for exemption Amount not eligible for exemption Total dividends to under article 158-3-2° under article 158-3-2° Fiscal year shareholders Net dividend per share of the French General Tax Code of the French General Tax Code 2010 256 025 124.00 1.35 256 025 124.00 2011 274 989 948.00 1.45 91 031 155.20 183 958 792.80 2012 299 205 510.00 1.50 25 931 144.20 273 274 365.80 (in euros) The General Meeting grants all necessary powers to the Executive Board to determine, considering in particular the number of shares held by the Company at the dividend payment date and, where appropriate, the number of shares canceled before that date, the total amount of dividends and, accordingly, the amount of distributable earnings to be allocated to “retained earnings.” ANNUAL REPOR T 314 KL E PI E R R E 2 01 3 G E N E R AL ME E T I N G PROPOSE D RE S O LUTIO NS TO BE S UBMIT TED TO T HE N EX T G EN ERA L M EET I N G OF T HE SHA REHOL D ERS ON A P RI L 1 0, 2 0 1 4 9 FOURTH RESOLUTION (Approval of transactions and agreements referred to in article L. 225-86 of the French Commercial Code) The General Meeting, acting in accordance with the quorum and majority requirements for Ordinary General Meetings, having taken note of the special report of the statutory auditors on the agreements referred to in article L. 225-86 of the French Commercial Code and relating to the financial year ending December 31, 2013, approves such report and all of its provisions, as well as any new agreements that are referred to therein, in accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-88 of said Code.

In such circumstances, the Company will inform its shareholders by means of a press release. The number of shares purchased by the Company is subject to the following limitations: on each redemption date, the total number of shares bought by the Company since the beginning of the redemption program (including those subject to the aforementioned redemption) may not exceed 5% of the Company’s share capital, this percentage being applied to a share capital figure adjusted to reflect transactions affecting the share capital subsequent to this General Meeting, i.e for information only, 9 973 517 shares as at 31 December 2013.

General context of the valuation Context and instructions In accordance with Klépierre’s instructions (« the Company ») as detailed in the signed valuation contracts between Klépierre and the valuers, we have valued the assets held by the Company, taking account of their ownership (freehold, ground lease, etc). This Summary Report has been prepared for inclusion in the Company’s annual report. The valuations were undertaken by our valuation teams in each of the various countries and have been reviewed by the Pan European valuation teams. In order to estimate the market value for each asset, we have not only taken into consideration domestic retail investment transactions but have also considered transactions on a European level. We confirm that our valuations have been prepared in a similar way to other valuations undertaken in Europe, in order to maintain a consistent approach and to take into consideration all the market transactions and information available. The valuations are based on the discounted cash flow method and the capitalisation method, which are regularly used for these types of assets. Our valuations were undertaken as at 31 December 2013. Reference documents and general principles We confirm that our valuations were undertaken in accordance with the appropriate sections of the 8th Edition of the RICS Valuation Standards (the “Red Book”). This is a valuation basis accepted on an international level. Our valuations are compliant with the IFRS accounting standards and the IVSC standards. The valuations have also been prepared on the basis of the AMF recommendations on the presentation of valuations of real estate assets owned by listed companies, published on 8th February 2010. Furthermore, they take into account the recommendations of the Barthès de Ruyter report on valuation of real estate owned by listed companies, published in February 2000. We confirm that we have prepared our valuations as external and independent valuers as defined by the “Red Book” standards published by RICS. We confirm that the appraisal has been performed in accordance with the principles of IFRS 13: we have appraised the highest and best use of each asset. The Market Value defined below generally matches the Fair Value defined in IFRS Standards, and particularly in IFRS 13. Basis of valuation Our valuations correspond to the Market Value and are reported to the Company as both gross values (market value before deduction of transfer costs) and net values (market value after deduction of transfer costs). 10.3.2. Valuation considerations and assumptions Information The Company’s management were asked to confirm that the information provided relating to the assets and tenants is complete and accurate in all significant aspects. Consequently, we have assumed that all relevant information known by our contacts within the Company that could impact value has been made available to us and that this information is up to date in all significant aspects. This includes running costs, works undertaken, financial elements, including doubtful debtors, turnover rents, lettings signed or in the process of being signed and rental incentives, in addition to the list of let and vacant units. Floor areas We have not measured the assets and have therefore based our valuations on the floor areas that were provided to us. Environmental analysis and ground conditions We have not been asked to undertake a study of ground conditions nor an environmental analysis. We have not investigated past events in order to determine if the ground or buildings have been contaminated. Unless provided with information to the contrary we have worked on the assumption that the assets are not and should not be affected by ground pollution and that the state of the land will not affect their current or future usage. Town planning We have not studied planning consents or other permits and have assumed that the assets have been built and are occupied and used in conformity with all necessary authorizations and that any outstanding legal issues have been resolved. We have assumed that the layout of assets conforms to legal requirements and town planning regulations, notably concerning the structural materials, fire safety and health and safety. We have also assumed that any extensions in progress are being undertaken in line with town planning rules and that all necessary permissions have been obtained.

We have assumed, with the exception of what may be mentioned in our individual asset reports, that the assets are not inhibited by any restriction which could impede a sale and that they are free from any restrictions or charges. We have not read the title deeds and have taken as correct the rental, occupational and all other pertinent information that has been provided to us by the Company. Condition of the assets We have taken note of the general condition of each asset during our inspection. Our instruction does not include a building or structural survey but we have indicated in our report, where applicable, any maintenance problems which were immediately apparent during our inspection. The assets have been valued based on the information provided by the Company according to which no deleterious material was used in their construction. Taxation Our valuations were undertaken without taking into account potential sales or legal fees or taxes which would come into effect in the case of a transfer. The rental and market values produced are net of VAT. 10.3.3. Confidentiality and disclosure Finally, and in accordance with our standard practice we confirm that our valuation reports are confidential and are addressed solely to the Company. We accept no liability to third parties. Neither the whole reports, nor any extracts may be published in a document, declaration, memorandum or statement without our written consent as regards the form and context in which this information may appear. In signing this Summary Report, the valuation firms accept no liability for the valuations carried out by the other firms.

BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) Method of environmental assessment for buildings that was developed by the Building Research Establishment (UK). Capitalization rate (cap rate) The average capitalization rate corresponds to the ratio of total expected net rents for occupied and vacant properties to the value, transfer duties excluded, of these same properties. Transfer duties are the fees for any change in ownership when the asset or its owning company is sold (notary fees, deed and title, registration, etc.). Catchment area A habitual or theoretical area from which a point of sale or shopping center draws its potential customers. The scope of this area is influenced by the distance and time it takes to gain access. CDAC (Commission départementale d’aménagement commercial) A French administrative commission that rules on commercial and retail projects submitted for prior approval. CNCC (Conseil national des centres commerciaux) French professional organization that brings together the players that participate in the promotion and development of shopping centers: developers, owners, managers, retailers, service providers and merchant organizations. Constant/current portfolio basis The Group analyzes the change in some indicators either by taking into account all of the holdings it actually owned over the period or date of analysis (current portfolio), or by isolating the impact of any acquisitions, extensions or disposals during the period, in order to obtain a stable basis of comparison (constant portfolio).

Financial occupancy rate (vacancy rate) The financial occupancy rate is the ratio of annual contractual rents occupied to total contractual rents occupied plus target rents for all vacant spaces (the latter are estimated on the basis of market data). A corollary to the financial occupancy rate, the vacancy rate expresses the percentage of vacant properties. Klépierre measures these rates by using the notion of minimum guaranteed rent (MGR) for occupied properties and not the market rents. The EPRA uses the latter for its definition of vacancy rate. GLA (Gross Leasable Area) Total sales area (including the hypermarket if there is one), plus storage area and not including aisles and shared tenant space. Green lease An added clause or schedule to a lease whose aim is to encourage a more constructive dialogue between lessees and lessors on environmental issues in general and energy efficiency in particular.

Hypermarket A retail establishment that displays and sells a broad assortment of both food and non-food products over a sales space that exceeds 2 500 sq.m. Hypermarket mall A shopping center that generally features a limited number of shops whose retail mix is dominated by convenience services and whose retail anchor is a hypermarket. ICC (French Cost of Construction index – Indice du coût de construction) This is one of 2 reference indices used to adjust the rents on retail properties. It is published quarterly by Insee and calculated on the basis of data emerging from the quarterly survey on the trend in the cost price of new housing (PRLN).

In 2008 tax provisions facilitating the sale of real estate assets to a SIIC (provisions of article 201 E, I of the French General Tax Code) commonly referred to as SIIC 3, were extended until December 31, 2011. Reduced taxation applicable to capital gains realized on the sale of properties sold to a SIIC under this regime is not in force since 1 January 2012 anymore. Further provisions, commonly referred as SIIC 4 and SIIC 5 which went into effect on 1 January 2010, stipulate that no shareholder, acting alone or in concert with others, may control more than 60% of the equity capital of a company that has opted for the SIIC status.
