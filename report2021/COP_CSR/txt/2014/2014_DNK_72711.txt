At the end of the year, the Government of Greenland awarded three new concession areas off the coast of Northeast Greenland. However, it will probably be several years before any real activity is seen that will have a social significance. The level of activity in mineral exploration is at the same level as in 2012. Air Greenland wants to continue to be a major player in the mining activities that may be realised in the future. In the scientific sector, Air Greenland carried out a number of flights in 2013. The major ones concerned polar bear tagging for the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, servicing of the so-called G-Net chain (climate research) for NASA (USA) via DTU/Space (DK), and a major ground research project for GEUS in Northeast Greenland.

Air Greenland has worked continuously since to integrate the UN Global Compact’s ten principles on human rights and labour, climate and the environment, as well as anti-corruption into the company’s business strategy and processes. In practice this means that the principles are the basis and framework of Air Greenland’s three priority areas for CSR the good working life, the committed company and the environmentally conscious operation. The areas along with the CSR policy are described on www.airgreenland.gl/om/CSR. I am pleased to confirm that Air Greenland will also support the UN Global Compact in the future and we will continue to work on linking principles to our business. We will look at how the principles can strengthen our strategy to be a natural part of our culture and optimise the daily operation.” Michael Højgaard CEO Air Greenland Corporate Social Responsibility, CSR, is part of Through collaboration with the Greenland stuthe company’s mission, focusing on a number dent organisation in Denmark, we are working of key themes: to bring educated Greenlandic manpower back to Greenland after the end of the education.
