Concerning the CSR information that we considered to be most important (detailed in appendix 1): W for the consolidating entity, we consulted the documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organization, policies, actions), we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and veriﬁed, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the data consolidation, and we veriﬁed their consistency with the other information presented in the management report; W for a representative sample of entities and sites that we have selected (detailed in appendix 2) according to their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we held interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and implemented substantive tests on a sampling basis, consisting in verifying the calculations performed and reconciling the data with supporting evidence. The selected sample represented on average 33% of the Group headcount and between 19% and 38% of the quantitative environmental information. Regarding the other consolidated CSR information, we assessed its consistency in relation to our knowledge of the company. Finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations relating to, where necessary, the total or partial omission of certain information. We believe that the sampling methods and sizes of the samples we used in exercising our professional judgment enable us to express limited assurance; a higher level of assurance would have required more in-depth veriﬁcations. Due to the use of sampling techniques and the other limits inherent to the operations of any information and internal control system, the risk that a material irregularity be identiﬁed in the CSR Information cannot be totally eliminated. R CONCLUSION Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.

Those performance conditions combine an external criterion (performance of the net consolidated margin in comparison with a basket of comparables over a four-year period) and two internal criteria (performance of economic result* and economic margin over successive four-year periods). For the 2011 Plan covering the 2010 ﬁnancial year, vesting by executive directors of the allocated free performance shares is therefore subject to a double set of performance conditions that apply at the time of the share award and at the ﬁnal vesting date. (4) 2012 Plan: With regard to allocations in respect of the 2011 ﬁnancial year, the Board of Directors had set at the beginning of 2011 the economic result* targets to be achieved. Based on the level of achievement of the economic result* target, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on March 7, 2012, determined the initial allocation of 30,710 performance shares to Mr. Gilles Schnepp. On the recommendation of the Nominating and Compensation Committee, the Board also decided to strengthen the performance conditions relating to the ﬁnal vesting of all performance shares by Mr. Gilles Schnepp, thereby retaining the option of cancelling all or part of the initial allocation. According to these conditions, vesting of the full initial allocation is conditional upon an increase in economic result* for a four-year period preceding the vesting of performance shares, thereby demonstrating long-term value creation. However, in the event this ﬁrst criterion is not met, a second criterion will be reviewed to determine whether the Group’s performance, as measured by economic margin, was above that of a panel of peers over the same period. * Adjusted operating proﬁt less the cost of capital employed. If all these shares were to vest (i.e. a total of 2,207,045 shares), the The Executive Director is subject to the requirement to hold at Company’s capital would be diluted by 0.8% as at December 31, 2013. least 30% of all shares acquired (including stock options and performance shares) until the termination of his duties.

In addition, starting with the 2011 Plan, a second set of performance conditions decided by the Board of Directors applies to substantially all of the performance share rights granted to executive directors. They include an external performance condition (consolidated net margin compared with the margins reported by Legrand’s peer group over a four-year period) and two internal performance conditions (economic earnings* and economic margin performance over successive four-year periods). In summary, shares granted to executive directors under the 2011 Plan in respect of 2010 are subject to two sets of performance conditions, one applicable at the date of grant and the other at the end of the vesting period. (4) 2012 Plan: For this plan, which concerns 2011 performance, the Board of Directors set the 2011 economic earnings* target at the start of 2011. At its March 7, 2012 meeting, the Board of Directors granted 30,710 performance share rights to Gilles Schnepp based on actual 2011 economic earnings* compared with the target. In addition, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Compensation Committee, the Board decided to adjust the vesting conditions by setting more challenging performance objectives. If these objectives are not met, some or all of the performance shares may not vest. Based on the new objectives, the shares in the initial grant will not vest in their entirety unless the Company demonstrates an ability to create value over the long term by achieving growth in economic earnings* over the four-year period immediately preceding the vesting date. However, if this ﬁrst condition is not met, Mr. Schnepp may still retain the right to some of the shares based on a second condition, i.e. whether the Group's economic margin performance exceeded that of the companies in its peer group over the same period. * Adjusted operating proﬁt less cost of capital employed. 216 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2013 LEGRAND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE GROUP’S ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS Consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 09 If all these shares were to vest (i.e. 2,207,045 shares), the 12.1.2 Stock option plans Company’s capital would be diluted by 0.8% as of December 31, No stock option plans have been implemented since the 2010 2013.

The Board of Directors set the 2008 economic earnings* target for the 2009 Plan at the start of 2008. Based on the Group’s actual economic earnings compared with the target, Gilles Schnepp and Olivier Bazil were awarded a certain number of performance share rights determined by the Board of Directors at its March 4, 2009 meeting. (2) 2010 Plan: This plan concerns performance share rights granted in 2010 in respect of 2009 performance. The Board of Directors set the 2009 economic earnings* target for the 2010 Plan at the start of 2009. Based on the Group’s actual economic earnings compared with the target, Gilles Schnepp and Olivier Bazil were awarded a certain number of performance share rights determined by the Board of Directors at its March 4, 2010 meeting. The number of rights was deliberately limited, on beneﬁciaries’ suggestion. (3) 2011 Plan: This plan concerns performance share rights granted in 2011, in respect of 2010 performance. The Board of Directors set the 2010 economic earnings* target for the 2011 Plan at the start of 2010. Based on the Group’s actual economic earnings compared with the target, Gilles Schnepp and Olivier Bazil were awarded a certain number of performance share rights determined by the Board of Directors at its March 3, 2011 meeting. In addition, starting with the 2011 Plan, a second set of performance conditions decided by the Board of Directors applies to substantially all of the performance shares rights granted to executive directors. They include an external performance condition (consolidated net margin compared with the margins reported by Legrand’s peer group over a four-year period) and two internal performance conditions (economic earnings* and economic margin performance over successive four-year periods). In summary, shares granted to executive directors under the 2011 Plan in respect of 2010 are subject to two sets of performance conditions, one applicable at the date of grant and the other at the end of the vesting period. (4) 2012 Plan: For this plan, which concerns 2011 performance, the Board of Directors set the 2011 economic earnings* target at the start of 2011. At its March 7, 2012 meeting, the Board of Directors granted 30,710 performance share rights to Gilles Schnepp based on actual 2011 economic earnings* compared with the target. In addition, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Compensation Committee, the Board decided to adjust the vesting conditions by setting more challenging performance objectives. If these objectives are not met, some or all of the performance shares may not vest. Based on the new objectives, the shares in the initial grant will not vest in their entirety unless the Company demonstrates an ability to create value over the long term by achieving growth in economic earnings* over the four-year period immediately preceding the vesting date.
