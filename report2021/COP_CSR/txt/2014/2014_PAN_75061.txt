Even so, it can only be rated as a productive and very important year for the Canal. The organization has sustained its dynamism, productivity and increasing activity, factors have been concurrent in previous years and that have helped maintain the quality of its customer service as well as the contributions to the State, despite the fluctuations caused by the global economic crisis; as the unmistakable sign of a job well done. By the end of the fiscal year, the Panama Canal Expansion Program has reached a 66.6 percent progress. The attention of the entire workforce has focused on these works and on other major modernization projects such as the widening and straightening the Gaillard Cut, the dredging of Canal entrances, and the modernization of the towboat fleet, which are almost complete, and on more recent projects such as a new computer platform and others that have been identified to be accomplished in the future. As a result of the periodic renewal brought about by constitutional mandate, at the end of this period three new directors, Lourdes Castillo, Alberto Vallarino and Henri Mizrachi have been integrated to the Board of Directors. The Board, as a decision making body, continues to work in close coordination with management, providing the necessary tools to maintain the proper safety and profitable functioning of the greatest asset of Panamanian society. As helmsman of a first world company, the Board’s interest and responsibility, including our constitutional concern, surpasses being custodian Roberto Roy of the route and the adjacent areas. We must Chairman of the Board of Directors focus on new projects to keep our greatest asset Canal de Panama competitive, especially in these times when there is the possibility of competition arising with new routes in other geographical areas. That is why we are looking at, along with a pricing strategy that Adolfo Ahumada Marco A. Ameglio S. reflects the value of the expanded Canal, new Director Director policies for the development of complementary activities for transiting vessels. This, complemented with the added value resultant from the physical areas surrounding the Canal, will magnify its role as part of the world’s maritime cluster transforming Panama into a logistics center that will generate employment and enhance Panamanian economy.

PANAMA CANAL In the following pages you will find the most relevant information on operational performance, financial, labor and social aspects of the organization, always committed to fulfill our responsibility of providing accountability to the country in a transparent and timely manner. After two consecutive periods of record tonnage figures for 2011 and 2012, fiscal year 2013 ended, as anticipated, with a reduction in several indicators, as a result of the global outlook in markets like the United States and Europe, where economic recovery has not been as expected. The dry bulk carrier segment of the Panama Canal was hit hard by situations such as the draught in the U.S. , which significantly impacted the dry bulk movement through our waterway. Fiscal year 2013 ended with a total of 320.6 million PC/UMS tons, that is, a reduction of 3.9 percent compared to 2012, which as stated above, had been a record figure. The Panama Canal continued to strengthen its commitment to provide quality service to its clients by adding value through the continuous maintenance and upgrading of essential equipment and infrastructures, such as the procurement of new tugs, in addition to the development of innovative ways to improve service to our customers. It is worth mentioning the trial of the “just-in-time service” system that will allow vessels to have more efficient transits. As part of the culture of maintenance which has been essential to the mystique that has helped the Panama Canal successfully complete 99 years of continuous operations, during the last fiscal year important preventive maintenance projects such as the locks valve replacement were completed. This process was accomplished without affecting normal transit operations. Jorge L.

Several major components of the project have been completed, including the dredging of the Canal entrances in the Atlantic and the Pacific, in addition to the Culebra Cut navigational channels and most of the reaches of Gatun Lake. Important milestones were achieved, and the country and the world witnessed the impressive transport from Italy, and later the arrival Panama Canal Panama Canal On December 31, 1999, the Panama Canal ceased operations under U.S. administration and became a corporate entity of the Panamanian government covered under Constitutional Title XIV and Law No. 19 of 1997. From that time, the business model that adequately served the Canal for 86 years under Jorge L. Quijano U.S. administration became obsolete. The Panama Administrator Canal, under a new legal framework, began its turnover from a break even operation company whose main objective was recovering costs, to a public efficient entity with clear profitable goals. Immediately after its transition and during the first six months of the year 2000, a first strategic planning effort under Panamanian administration took place with the initial purpose of developing the Canal´s vision, mission, corporate values and subsequent strategic objectives. The results were the basis for formalizing and structuring the strategic planning Esteban G.

Corporate Communications Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 eliability Operation at the Service of Global Trade Trade and logistics play a significant role in economic growth across the globe, including emerging markets. In fact, a substantial portion of business costs in developing countries can be traced to inefficiencies in their supply chains, limited by physical bottlenecks and the lack of streamlined administrative procedures. According to the World Bank, in developing nations logistics expenses comprise from 15 to 30 percent of the GDP. Furthermore, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) estimates that transport costs account for up to 2/3 of total logistics expenses, which in turn constitute approximately 15 percent of the final value of goods. It follows that transportation expenditures are the single largest item of public investment programs, in some cases greater than 50 percent. International trade flows, particularly exports, are crucial for the growth and development of countries because they enhance competitiveness and increase government revenues. These benefits are in part derived from the logistics sector, which transfers its savings to consumers through price reductions following a more efficient handling of goods. For instance, supply chain improvements result in the following: • Increased export competitiveness and lower productions costs. • Lower cost of basic consumer products in low income households, where up to 80 percent of the family income is spent on food. • Greater integration between economies. • Environmentally sustainable supply chains. • Increased security and less corruption in the transportation of goods. The Panama Canal is a key player in global trade flows, by facilitating exports. Since its opening in 1914, over 1 million vessels have transited the waterway, totaling over 9,000 million long tons. The Canal’s main advantage is the great distance savings it provides: the Guayaquil – New York route through the Canal is a mere 2,848 kilometers, while sailing around Cape Horn would be 10,388 kilometers. Similar distance savings are observed in other routes, within the American continent and for longer journeys such as the East Asia – United States East Coast route. Panama´s economy is highly dependent on the export of services. Over the last 12 years, total exports have averaged 69 percent as a portion of GDP Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 (including the reexporting of goods from the Export as Percentage of GDP Colon Free Zone).

Therefore, the Canal and the export linked indirectly to Canal traffic, further benefiting of services, including the international logistics from the many competitive advantages Panama hub, are the bedrock of Panama´s economy and a has to offer, including its dollarized economy, support base for other Latin American economies. fiscal incentives, and favorable legal frameworks for the services industry (merchant marine registry, banking center, and legal services). The Canal, the port terminals, the Colon Free Zone, and Tocumen International Airport complement each other’s strengths. In short, the Canal is the main driver within the logistics cluster, and in turn, the cluster strengthens the Canal’s position as an optimal transit option. This cross-sector synergy has a multiplier effect and increases the country’s overall competitiveness, and that of other countries in the region which can use Panama as a hub. In summary, the Canal is a crossroads for economic activities based on maritime traffic. 128 Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 OPERATIONS As for transits, there were 12,045 oceangoing The Panama Canal ended fiscal year 2013 with transits (excluding small vessels), 817 vessels less 320.6 million PC/UMS tons, 13.1 million tons less or a 6.35 percent decrease compared to fiscal year than fiscal year 2012, with an operative cost per 2012 (12,862 transits).

The approved design consists on the widening on both sides of the Canal, considering that there was also the option to dredge only the west side. The estimated dredging volume is 4.8 million cubic meters. For the widening of the reaches north of Bas Obispo, which will be performed internally beginning fiscal year 2014, 1.8 and 8.5 million cubic meters will be excavated and dredged, respectively. During fiscal year 2013, path cuts were completed to allow for topographic surveys, ground exploratory drillings and bathymetric sounding to establish the initial volume. Also disposal sites were defined, and land excavation designs had significant progress. As for the expansion of the Peña Blanca Anchorage, we completed the technical specifications and activities prior to the request for bids for the log removal contract for an estimated area of 743 hectares. The request for bids was published on July 2013 and the evaluation of the proposals began by the end of the period. 137 Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 onnectivity Succesful Performance for the World The Panama Canal PC/UMS (Panama Canal Universal Measurement System) net tonnage for fiscal year 2013 was 320.6 million tons, a 4 percent decrease from the previous year. Global markets improved marginally during fiscal year 2013, falling short of previous years accelerated recoveries. The United States economic growth was weak, with improvements in the mortgage and automotive sectors as a result of low interest rates, but unable to take off due to President Obama’s second term predictable political problems. Unemployment decreased moderately, from 8.2 percent a year ago to 7.3 percent in September 2013. The fiscal cliff problems in January 2013 were followed by the present disagreement pertaining to the debt ceiling, whereby sequester measures were adopted, forcing the United States Federal Government to cut spending in all public entities, which impacted the gross national product (GNP) by at least 0.3 percent. As a result, there was a slowdown of the economic recovery in the last quarter of 2012 and an increased uncertainty until October 2013, when it was decided to extend budget and debt negotiations until January 2014 and February 2014, respectively. Despite the aforementioned, there was a relatively healthy expansion in the third quarter of 2013, estimated to be 4.1 percent by the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), although it tapered off slightly in the last quarter of the year. All economic indicators suggest that the United States’ economic growth will be above 2 percent in 2014. The Eurozone was beset by macroeconomic problems since October 2012, prompting Spain, Italy, Greece and other European countries to request aid form the European Central Bank (ECB). The latter, with the support of Germany and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has implemented solvency-increasing measures in banks, along with other austerity measures, which caused a recession until December 2012. The ensuing economic growth has been extremely slow in the last few quarters, and unemployment figures in Spain have reached 28.0 percent, with similar levels in Italy, Portugal and Greece, among others. In 2013, the Eurozone improved slightly and got over its sovereign debt issues which at some point posed the threat of an economic collapse and the dissolution of the single currency. Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 In Asia, China has followed the same deceleration expansion during 2013. The Japanese GNP pattern, on a much lesser extent.

Colombia’s share the total coal transported through the Panama Canal, increased from 38 percent to 52.5 percent. The main route from Colombia to Chile increased 76.1 percent from 3.7 to 6.5 million long tons. Shipments from Colombia to Guatemala, Mexico and Peru increased 34.5 percent, 73.4 percent 528.7 percent, respectively. Other routes from the United States Gulf to Mexico and Chile increased 22.5 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively. Vehicle Carriers and RoRo Segment The vehicle carriers and RoRo market segment had a modest performance during fiscal year 2013, in which the main indicators of traffic through the Panama Canal showed mixed results compared to the previous fiscal year. Traffic figures for fiscal year 2013 recorded a total of 766 transits and 43.0 million PC/UMS tons, a 2.3 percent decline in transits and a 0.1 percent increase in PC/UMS tonnage. The slight positive variation in PC/UMS tonnage is the result of an increase in the average vessel size, from 54,752 PC/UMS tons to 56,093 PC/UMS tons, a 2.4 percent increase over the previous fiscal year. Vessels ≥ 100 feet beam accounted for 93.6 percent of all transits. Toll revenues for this segment during fiscal year 2013 reached B/.179.4 million, a 1 percent rise compared to fiscal year 2012. This increase in revenues was mainly due to a 1.1 percent 145 Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 increase in the effective toll rate, from B/.4.14 decline represented a drop of 116,700 long tons to B/.4.18 per PC/UMS ton as a result of a 1.7 equivalent to approximately 66,000 light vehicle percent toll rate adjustment effective October 1, units or 16 Canal transits at B/. 250,000 per transit. 2012. Starting in October 2012, the RoRo vessels were included in the vehicle carrier segment. However, from a positive perspective, the shift of production centers has created non-traditional Cargo tonnage totaled 4.4 million long tons, a 4.6 routes for the Panama Canal, as there are more percent decrease compared to fiscal year 2012 in countries manufacturing automobiles. An which 4.6 million long tons were transported via example is Mexico, as we are registering transits the Panama Canal.

This decline is modest. In fiscal year 2013, the segment recorded the result of the reduced share of cruise lines 206 transits (171 full transits and 35 turnarounds), like Seabourn and P&O Cruises, which deployed 5 transits less than in the previous year (171 full fewer ships of less than 30,000 gross tons via the transits and 40 turnarounds). The total number Panama Canal compared to the previous year. of passengers was 225,367, 1.4 percent less than Furthermore, this portion of the segment also the 228,489 registered during the previous fiscal experienced an average vessel size decrease from year.

The intensity of the concrete works for these structures has reached its peak this year, and the great dimension of this engineering wonder becomes evident and irrefutable before our eyes with the arrival of the new lock gates – one of the project’s most critical components. All of the highly committed professionals involved in the project – contractors, subcontractors, and ACP internal forces – press on with the works overcoming each new challenge as they arise. During the year, characterized by a number of activities in multiple work fronts, ACP contractors and internal forces continue facing diverse defying situations in the technical, financial, weather, environmental and occupational safety areas. Many of these challenges have been addressed with innovative solutions that have made it possible for the Expansion Program to achieve a 67 percent progress rate by the end of fiscal year 2013. The contract award rate increased to 98 percent; dry excavations for the Pacific Access Channel totaled 42.9 million cubic meters out of the 49.1 million to be removed; and dredging works in navigational channels reached a total of 48.6 million cubic meters out of the estimated 52.2 million to be dredged. On the other hand, the combined volume reported by the Pacific and Atlantic sites for the construction of the new locks, excavations, and dredging activities, totaled 38.6 million cubic meters from the projected 46.5 million; structural concrete placements added up to 3.1 million cubic meters from the required 4.2 million; and 176 out of the required 197 tons of steel rebars were received. These accomplishments were achieved thanks to over 13,000 workers who have worked day and night to complete this magnificent work. Post-Panamax Locks This program component has advanced a 58 percent progress rate and consists of the construction of two lock complexes – one on the Pacific and another on the Atlantic side – each with three levels and water saving basins. The consortium responsible for this task, Grupo Unidos por el Canal S.A. (GUPCSA), continued with the fabrication of electromechanical components such as valves and gates, and dam construction activities; and has begun placing backfill around some components for which the structures have been substantially completed. Tasks are diverse and require multiple work fronts to move forward the construction of the two lock complexes on both ends of the Canal. In its new schedule, the contractor has estimated the completion date for all works under the contract to be June 2015 (eight months after the contract date). The arrival of the first gates for the new locks is perhaps the most relevant milestone of this year. After the conclusion of the construction of the dock to receive these gates, the first four arrived in Gatun in August and are stockpiled in a provisional area while preparations are done for their transportation and installation into their respective recesses in the new locks. Meanwhile, fabrication of the remaining gates continues in Cimolai S.p.A.’s facilities in Italy and preparations are made to ship a second batch. The ACP locks design overview team maintained a resident engineer in Italy to inspect and follow up on the gate fabrication. Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Fabrication of valves and associated elements is During this year the contractor has focused ongoing in the facilities of Hyundai Samho Heavy mainly on placing structural concrete, an activity Industries Ltd. in South Korea.

The challenges of one of the most valuable resources of the isthmus of Panama are no different from other centennial companies worldwide. Therefore, it is necessary to manage an integrated approach for the meaning of sustainability, by defining and framing it on how to ensure long term business success while contributing to economic and social development, in a healthy environment within a stable society. For our company it is very important to take the lead on sustainability, looking always for a competitive advantage through the design and implementation strategies and the right programs, seeking a balance between all our partners. We look for true sustainability through environment friendly innovative actions. But we are convinced that we can accomplish this by creating value through innovation, renovating, revamping or reinventing our processes and actions while relying on our most valuable asset: our people’s commitment. We inspire efficiency by doing more with less and minimizing our environmental footprint as the greatest challenges for the next 100 years of the Canal. For the Panama Canal sustainability is not just goal, it is the path to follow. Through the years, the ACP has innovated on a numerous amount of projects and initiatives that support environmental management, labor practices and community development, strengthening the business, which has resulted in strong financial management . The synergy created by the combined efforts, together with the contributions of its workforce, the community, their customers and their suppliers, accelerate steps in the right direction, leaving behind seeds of prosperity that will be harvested by future generations. Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 nvironmental Sustainability The Panama Canal Authority incorporates its environmental management as an essential part of its vision and mission, focusing on two aspects: its water and the environmental quality. With respect to water resources, the ACP by means of its organic law is responsible for the administration, maintenance, use, and conservation of the Panama Canal Watershed hydric resources together with the coordination for the conservation of its natural resources to enable the functions of this natural capital. Therefore, the Panama Canal implements and coordinates through the Interinstitutional Commission for the Panama Canal Watershed (CICH) the sustainable development and integrated management of its water resources, through its environmental information system and the active participation of the inhabitants of the territory. Managing the Canal Watershed is paramount because hydric resources are crucial for the water provision to the most populated cities, for the operation of the Panama Canal, and many other economic activities. The water in the zone allows the ACP to operate and maintain its infrastructure and facilities for the provision of drinking water, electricity and cold water for the air conditioning systems. Furthermore, the water from the Watershed contributes to international trade by facilitating the transoceanic movement of goods. In addition to the management of the Watershed, the Canal values corporate performance according to environmental quality standards in its operations, both maintain and use its resources in a sustainable manner, and to accomplish better operational results and provide economic benefits to the country. Hence, it develops procedures, plans and programs for the conservation and environmental protection, including assessment and environmental impact studies, the surveillance of natural resources, environmental education, and community organization. Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 This fiscal year, the Canal reached important Water Resources goals in the areas of water management and The Panama Canal has a permanent hydrological environmental quality. surveillance program, through a network of stations for measuring volumes and water flow, precipitation levels and water resources quality.

In 1914, by contributing environmental and social management, and to to a bunker usage reduction calculated by unit operate on low carbon footprint standards. In load to transiting vessels, as compares to other this sense, the Panama Canal is enforcing an routes. By using the Panama Canal, the global overall plan to manage carbon dioxide emissions by developing a greenhouse gasses baseline maritime sector has managed to reduce its from Canal operations and implementing a carbon dioxide emissions. The expanded Canal strategy for the reduction and compensation of will enable the transit of vessels by carrying these emissions. twice the load compared to those transiting today. In fact, this will enhance the Canal’s This year the Panama Canal Authority received qualification as an emission reduction route. its second certification for its Reforestation and Sustainable Production Models, from the Environmental Economics Incentives Program. In March 2012, the Canal obtained a second certification under the voluntary carbon standard from climate, community and biodiversity, and another this year under the auditable emission reduction CarbonFix Standard (in transition to Gold Standard). Both standards combine actions to improve the quality of life for Watershed communities, the conservation of Watershed biodiversity and the mitigation of greenhouse gasses. With the technical and financial support from the German Agency for International Cooperation, the Canal took on a project to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation actions in the Canal Watershed. 163 Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 The main purpose is to account for carbon Among the green production patterns developed dioxide gases reduction in Canal Watershed by the Panama Canal are the agroforestry mature forests and to obtain additional funds to models, mainly shade-grown coffee production, continue reforestation projects. mainly the Robusta variety (coffee canephora). From this year the Panama Canal has included Environmental Economic Incentives the establishment of cacao agroforestry Program models. Within the context of these activities, In its fourth year, through this program linked the ACP, in conjunction with the Ministry of to the Green Route, the Panama Canal has Agricultural Development of Panama (MIDA), reforested and maintained more than 6,200 hectares in the Canal Watershed.

The topics included water conservation efforts, the Panama Canal, together quality, biodiversity conservation, solid waste with the Institute for Professional Formation and management, climate change adaptation, risk Human Resources Development (INADEH) and management, and reforestation. the Ministry of Education (MEDUCA) carries out an environmental conservation program Corporate Environmental Performance together with job-training. Training is provided Concerning environmental quality to help Watershed residents develop skills improvement, this year the Panama Canal to facilitate the incorporation into the labor Authority continued with efforts in the market. This fiscal year 2013, courses were application of good practices, measures, taught in 27 Canal Watershed educational and regulations and environmental improvements community centers. To date, more than 5,666 in all activities, in order to operate under the residents have participated in this program, cleaner production concept, with efficiency receiving approximately 10,868 certifications. and respect for the environment. These efforts include: (i) quality of effluents; (ii) emissions Another line of knowledge for elementary from stationary and mobile sources; (iii) carbon level students is Our Canal and Its Watershed footprint; (iv) hydrocarbon management and regulatory compliance and (v) waste management. The ACP monitored the quality of the effluents, as well as the emissions of stationary and mobile sources of 83 percent of the motor fleet (100 diesel and 4000 gasoline engine vehicles). Samples were taken from the Miraflores Thermoelectric Plant in compliance with the Standard 2610-EAC-112, and 4 out of 5 types comply with the limits. In line with its continuous improvement philosophy, the Panama Canal continues to work on the implementation of the measures set out in the Environmental Adaptations Plan (PAA), to 165 Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 increase compliance with the standard in this are applied to air conditioning systems, thermoelectric power plant. Finally, emission together with a limit to potential and energy samples were taken from 25 watercrafts from in illumination, the application of sensors and of a fleet of 66. Sample results revealed 100 timers for the control of lights in kitchens, eating percent compliance as specified in MARPOL’s halls, hallways, bathrooms, and conference Annex VI. and classrooms. Insulation standards for walls and ceilings have also been included. Even, the On the other hand, the Canal’s municipal specifications are not limited to the aspect of waste was characterized as common garbage, energy, since to water saving measures and the organic waste, packaging, paper products and recycling logistics were included. cardboard material, wood waste, plastic and glass. The data collected will support future Energy Efficiency actions for waste generation reduction, and The Panama Canal Authority has a 2011-2020 will strengthen processes for the recovery of energy efficiency management plan focused resources and ensure the proper disposal of on rational and efficient energy consumption. those materials that cannot be used. This year a pilot system was implemented for measuring energy consumption in buildings, Green Construction with data collected via Intranet. More This year came into effect the AD-2012-05 guide buildings will be added progressively. The line, which establishes green specifications main objective is to relate the measurement for the projects that will be developed by the to the implementation of energy audits and ACP beginning fiscal year 2014. Therefore, action plans to optimize consumption.

High efficiency standards commitment to energy efficiency. This vehicle 166 Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 was assigned to the Panama Canal Mail Unit on March 26, 2013. This addition to the vehicle fleet encourages the substitution of fossil fuel for a more efficient renewable energy alternative. This vehicle will serve as basis for the analysis of an automobile fleet with diversified technology to optimize energy resources. Clean and Sustainable Energy Power generation for the Canal is important to ensure the reliability of its operation, facilities, and infrastructure. The ACP also invests continuously in improving its energy generation systems for environment friendly technology. Furthermore, the Canal is constantly investing in a more economic and high-technology eco-friendly power system. This year work continued for the replacement of two vapor turbines from the Miraflores Thermoelectric Plant with two stroke-diesel motors, each one of 39.34MW, which started commercial operation in mid-October 2013. A two stroke-diesel motor system was chosen over the four strokediesel motors and the gas and vapor turbines, due to its efficiency. On the other hand, the use of natural gas systems for electrical power generation is a market tendency in Panama; therefore the ACP initiated a feasibility study to incorporate natural gas combustion system in its daily operations. Solar and Wind Energy This year the Panama Canal is looking forward to diversify its thermal plant generation by compiling immediate and accumulating power and energy data of the Mendoza Water Treatment Plant. In addition, a study was conducted based on satellite information and historical climatological records of the potential for wind energy production at Mendoza´s site. The potential identified in Mendoza is too small, but the Panama Canal Authority will continue looking for alternate clean energy sources. On the other hand, the ACP continued collecting information on wind speed and direction to begin the feasibility study that will determine the amount of energy that can be generated at this point. 167 Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 uman Capital Sustainability The greatest asset of the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) is its workforce as the driving force for its day-to-day. Each member of this talented group of people plays a fundamental role, which through professionalism and commitment, strengthens the organizational culture and charts the way to success, allowing the ACP to meet corporate goals and exceed customer expectations. Management, through a solid planning and development process of its human capital, ensures current and future capabilities of the organization to ensure their sustainability over time. With a 6.1 percent turnover rate, well above its historical rate and largely based on the labor force regular retirement process, fiscal year 2013 ended with a total payroll of 10,098 employees, of which 8,288 are permanent and 1,810 are temporary to support the implementation of specific projects or activities and included those participating in the student assistant program. It should be noted that the ACP considers women and men with different backgrounds and training to enrich its work team and reinforce team leadership. The Panama Canal has a highly productive, inclusive and diverse work teams that facework from different perspectives, offering better solutions. It must be noted that of the total workforce, 1,293 are female, and 29 occupy executive or managerial positions while 146 are in occupations traditionally performed by men. There are men in positions that are not traditionally for men, which confirm the importance of equity and the merit and equal opportunity principles in the Panama Canal. Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Employees by Gender 2011 2012 2013 Men 8,724 (87%) 8,933 (87%) 8,805 (87.2%) Women 1,330 (13%) 1,329 (13%) 1,293 (12.8%) Distribution of Men and Women by Supervisory Position Year Level of Supervision Men Women Total 2011 Executives/Managers 87 32 119 Supervisors/Leaders 946 114 1060 Non-supervisory 7691 1184 8875 Subtotal 8724 1330 10054 2012 Executives/Managers 87 32 119 Supervisors/Leaders 987 129 1116 Non-supervisory 7859 1168 9027 Subtotal 8933 1329 10262 2013 Executives/Managers 90 29 119 Supervisors/Leaders 935 124 1059 Non-supervisory 7780 1140 8920 Subtotal 8805 1293 10098 While the majority of the workforce is from the provinces of Panama and Colon, 16 percent come from other provinces and from the indigenous regions of Guna Yala and Darien. This diversity promotes strong quality teams with a wide range of skills that help develop strategies based on the social and cultural context of each region. Training is a cornerstone for the Panama Canal’s human capital management. It represents a significant investment through which the current and future performance of those who contribute to achieving corporate objectives is enhanced. Ongoing training programs for both specific needs and for comprehensive professional development are implemented.

That’s when an aggressive plan to update the database began dividing it in three phases. The first phase is called Pacific database, the second is the Atlantic database and the third the Lake and Cut database. Once this project was finished we proceeded to validate operational experts through simulator exercises. Following this, and as of 2011 began the Pilots and Tug Masters training program, which focuses on the interaction between them during maneuvers and to familiarize them with the NeoPanamax vessels. In parallel, transits have been made in the current locks without locomotives to familiarize personnel with such operations. On the other hand, we have maintained regular training for Canal maritime personnel, in order to keep the necessary skills for the performance of their functions. There are big challenges ahead and we are committed to continue with the next steps for training Pilots and Tug Captains and begin a comprehensive engineer training program for all floating equipment personnel, to meet necessary skill needs. We have also continued an intensive and comprehensive training process for critical works identified by Canal operating areas leaders. These includewelders, shipfitters, sheetmetal workers, roofers, mechanics, electricians, riggers, among others. All these programs have been carried out under theoretical and practical format using class and field practice and, including mentors who serve as coaching staff during their field practice. 173 Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 A Company Based on Ethics and Values contained in the Ethics Regulation and Code The Panama Canal Authority has built a faultless of Conduct of the organization, and to raise management model of excellence, integrity and awareness on the responsibility of behaving transparency as is set out in its corporate vision according to principles and values in the statement.

This reaffirms Panama´s ability to manage the Canal with high levels of productivity, safety and reliability in its operations; as well as the prudence in the management of risks and expenses, and full utilization of its installed capacity, while maintaining a competitive route at the service of world maritime trade. During fiscal year 2013, the global markets showed little improvement and affected the Panama Canal’s performance. The economy of the United States continued to grow slowly, limited mainly by the uncertainties that have arisen from delays in political agreements between the Senate and the House of Representatives regarding tax cuts, debt ceiling, and the national budget. On the other hand, the Eurozone remained in recession, mainly impacted by the sovereign debt crisis and the austerity measures proposed by the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. This drop in demand in developed economies impacted exporting countries, including China and Latin American countries, resulting in a decrease in the global GDP during fiscal year 2013. The Panama Canal continues its commitment as a driver of growth and development of the country, producing the maximum sustainable benefit from our geographical position. In this regard, the National Assembly approved the budget for the 2013 fiscal period, from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013, with estimated 330.1 million PC/UMS tons (Panama Canal Universal Measurement System), total revenues of B/.2,413.2 million, and B/.960.2 million in direct contributions to the National Treasury. Total direct contributions for fiscal year 2013 were B/.981.8 million, exceeding by 2.2 percent the budgeted amount. Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Our 10,098 employee workforce is committed to the development and improvement of ACP´s customer service, the environment and social surroundings. Personal services represent 73 percent of the operating expenses of the 2013 fiscal period, contributing directly to the economy. Additionally, the Expansion Program has generated 32,771 jobs, out of which 91 percent (29,889) are filled by Panamanians, benefiting directly Panama’s economy. The Miraflores and Gatun Visitors Centers received 750,614 and 124,285 visitors, respectively; representing an income of B/.3.9 and B/.0.6 million, while giving them the opportunity to learn about one of the wonders of the world. In January 2013 we held the First International Maintenance Congress, with the theme “Building a Maintenance Culture: Investing to Ensure Profitability and Sustainability”, focusing on the best maintenance cycle practices designed from a strategic point of view, not as an expense but as an investment to ensure service quality and reliability, in order to generate economic benefits for businesses. During thirteen years (2000-2013), under Panamanian administration, the Panama Canal has contributed directly and indirectly to the State with more than B/.7,000 million. It has been one of the drivers of Panamanian economy as it represents close to 6 percent of the current gross domestic product (GDP).

Held-to-maturity investments The ACP financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables, and other financial liabilities.

Hedge accounting Changes in accounting policies The ACP designates certain financial instruments as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Hedges of foreign exchange on IAS 19 Employee Benefits firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The amendment to IAS 19 became effective for accounting periods At inception date of the hedge, the ACP documents the hedging beginning on January 1, 2013. As the ACP’s fiscal year 2013 relationship and the objective and risk management strategy to began on October 1, 2012, this amendment will be applicable to undertake the hedging transaction.

These hedges the BRL shall be classified as long term defined benefit plans due are expected to be highly effective in order to mitigate changes in to the existence of a constructive obligation and in consequence cash flows of the hedged item and are periodically evaluated to an actuarial liability should be recognized. It is an ACP policy to determine if they had been highly effective during the financial fund all its liabilities. Consequently, it is estimated that application reporting periods for which they were designated. of IAS 19 might require ACP to provide funds for approximately B/.228 million in fiscal year 2014. The ACP is evaluating the Cash flow hedges alternatives provided in this standard to reduce the need of resources in the implementation of IAS 19. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are designated and qualified as cash flow hedges is New International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and recognized in other comprehensive income.

Risk management (continued) Exchange rate risk management The ACP has established a policy to manage foreign currency risk related to its functional currency. This policy indicates that all investments, and bank deposits, shall be in the currency of the United States of America, or in other currencies authorized by the Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2013 the ACP does not maintain commitments in other currencies. It only maintains deposits in the currency of the United States of America. Interest rate risk management The ACP is exposed to interest rate risk because it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed by the ACP through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rates and the defined risk tolerance, ensuring that the most cost-effective hedging strategies are applied. Interest rate swap contracts Since March 2010, the ACP established interest rate swap contracts, without collateral, to fix the floating interest rate of the B/.800,000 variable rate loan. Of the B/.800,000, B/.200,000 were disbursed on March 1, 2010; B/.300,000 on October 29, 2010, and B/.300,000 on April Autoridad 13, 2011.

The ACP will pay or receive the difference between the floating and the fixed interest rate on a net basis. All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the ACP's cash flow exposure resulting from floating interest rates on borrowings. 26 Interest rate sensitivity analysis Canal de Panama ANNUAL REPORT 2013 221 The following sensitivity analyses have been determined based on the financial instruments Autoridad del Canal de Panama Notes to Financial Statements September 30, 2013 (In t h o u sa n d s of balboas B /.) 23.
