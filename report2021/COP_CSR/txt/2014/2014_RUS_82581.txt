When the benefit from the stripping activity is improved access to a component of the ore body in future periods, the stripping 286 305 180 5 33 109 919 costs in excess of the average ore-to-waste ratio for the life-of-mine of that component are recognised as a non-current asset. IFRIC 20 became effective for the Group from 1 January 2013. 2012 Prior to adoption of IFRIC 20, the Group’s accounting policy was not to capitalise stripping costs during the production phase. Therefore, as at 1 January 2012 there were no stripping assets on the Group’s balance sheet. The adoption of IFRIC 20 has 260 284 148 7 33 121 852 resulted in the capitalisation of certain stripping costs and a reduction in the cost of sales and inventory recorded in 2012. Strategic report The stripping assets recognised as a result of the application of IFRIC 20 will also affect the level of depreciation charges in future periods. See details in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements. Total cash costs, adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP metrics have been restated accordingly. The capitalised stripping costs in 2013 comprised US$91 million Total cost of sales grew by 32% in 2013 to US$1,124 million, mainly on the back of volume-based growth in production and compared to US$61 million in 2012 and were mainly represented by Omolon, Khakanja and Varvara. sales (21% and 14% year-on-year respectively in gold equivalent terms). Other cost drivers include domestic inflation in Russia (6.5% in 2013), which was only partially offset by Rouble depreciation, and a significant increase in depreciation charges Use of JORC reserves for depreciation calculation as a result of the launch and ramp-up of the Mayskoye concentrator and the Amursk POX plant, which are now both From 1 January 2013, the Group began to use JORC as opposed to GKZ reserves as the basis for unit-of-production in commercial production. depreciation calculations, as management believes this revised basis better reflects the long-term mine plans, which are also being prepared based on JORC reserves estimates. The cost of consumables and spare parts and the cost of services grew by 10% and 7% respectively, with most of the growth being volume-based. Specific cost increases in the period are attributable to consumables and spare parts at the Amursk POX, The increase in profit for the period due to the adoption of IFRIC 20 was almost entirely offset by the change in depreciation which was fully operational during the year and displayed elevated consumption rates due to limited throughput and recovery calculation basis. during the ramp-up process. Amursk POX was the main driver of increased smelting costs during the period. Cost of sales The total cost of labour within cash operating costs in 2013 was US$180 million, a 22% increase mainly stemming from % production volume growth, increase in the rates of payroll tax for highly paid employees, and growth in the average number Cost of sales (excluding write-downs of metal inventories) 2013 2012 change of employees at Amursk and Mayskoye which are now fully in commercial production.

None of the options vested in June 2013, as the performance conditions (excess of price over strike price of US$16.74 per share) were not met. Further, in March 2014 the majority of employees waived their rights under the Old EIP in order to be able to participate in the new Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘New LTIP’). However, the expense previously recognised does not reverse as a credit to the income statement in accordance with IFRS rules as the non-vesting is related to a market-based condition. Should any remaining options vest in June 2014 at the revised target share price (US$18.75 per share), no additional expense 60/61 will be recognised in the income statement.

The impairment model assumes that Polymetal will not proceed with the Sopka heap leach at the prices used, due to a lower than required return on the capital that needs to be invested in the start of the facility, and therefore assigns zero value to the low-grade ore stockpiles accumulated for heap leaching. However, the construction of the heap leach at Birkachan is already completed and leaching is planned from 2014. At the assumed prices of US$1,200/oz for gold and US$18/oz 0 for silver this would result in positive cash flow contribution, making processing of these stockpiles economic. -9 • At Mayskoye, an US$16 million write-down of inventories is represented by relatively low-grade and high-cost concentrate Dukat Voro Khakanja Varvara Omolon Albazino/ Mayskoye Total produced during the first months of the concentrator operation, with higher costs inherently associated with the ramp-up Amursk of the processing facility.

Though income statement volatility may arise in the financial reporting, Polymetal believes that the underlying matching of revenue cash flows against 2012 debt repayments and related interest represents an economically effective hedging strategy. 66 49 79 40 16 2011 68 8 61 14 433 Net earnings, earnings per share and dividends Strategic report The Group recorded a net loss of US$198 million in 2013 versus a net profit of US$428 million in 2012. The loss resulted mainly from non-cash impairment charges (pre-tax amount of US$366 million, equal to after-tax amount of US$315 million), unrealised foreign exchange losses in 2013 versus smaller absolute gains in 2012, and the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. In 2013, total capital expenditure was US$357 million, down 18% year-on-year. All of the Group’s major investment projects are now complete with the launch of the Mayskoye concentrator in April 2013. Consequently, starting from 2H 2013 the bulk Underlying net earnings (excluding the after-tax impact of impairment charges) were US$117 million, compared of the Group’s capital expenditure is now related to stay-in-business spending and exploration. In addition, the implementation to US$431 million in 2012. The decrease in underlying net earnings was mainly a result of a decrease in adjusted EBITDA of IFRIC 20 (refer to ‘Changes in accounting policies’ above) resulted in the partial capitalisation of production-phase stripping by US$334 million year-on-year, as well as the effects of foreign exchange. costs, all of which were previously expensed. Capital expenditure excluding stripping costs would have been US$265 million in 2013 (2012: US$372 million). Basic earnings per share were a loss of US$0.51 per share compared to earnings of US$1.10 per share in 2012. Underlying basic EPS was US$0.30 per share, compared to US$1.13 per share in 2012. The major capital expenditure items in 2013 were: In accordance with the Company’s dividend policy, the Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of US$0.08 per share • US$54 million was spent on completion of construction of the processing plant at Mayskoye and sustaining capital expenditure representing approximately 30% of the Group’s underlying net earnings for the period. During 2013, Polymetal paid a total for the newly launched mine.

On a cash basis, capital expenditure was US$319 million in 2013 (2012: US$397 million). T The difference with the one on the accrual basis is mostly due to depreciation of US$33 million (2012: US$26 million) capitalised into exploration and stripping assets. in respect of those segments’ mining assets (refer to ‘Impairment charges’ above). • Total capital expenditure includes US$6 million of capitalised interest (2012: US$14 million), which declined materially as the Group has already commissioned all of its major growth assets, and led to an increase in finance costs recognised in profit and loss. 66/67 Strategic report Financial review continued Cash flows The Group continues to maintain a comfortable liquidity and funding profile in the current turbulent market environment.

Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and, Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured if applicable, special purpose entities, from the date that control effectively commenced until the date that control effectively to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised ceased. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity in the consolidated income statement. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have so as to obtain benefits from its activities. previously been recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest was disposed of. Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Goodwill and goodwill impairment Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests into line with those used by other members of the Group. in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. All intra-group balances, transactions and any unrealised profits or losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation. If the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest Changes to the Group’s ownership interests that do not result in a loss of control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as a bargain purchase gain. equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Parent. is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on the disposal is calculated as the difference between indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, 1) the aggregated fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and 2) the previous the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and non-controlling interests. assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of net assets recognised at acquisition. Thereafter, a share of the profit or loss for the financial year and other On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. movements in the net assets or liabilities of the subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interests as shown in the income statement and balance sheet. Acquisition of mining licences The acquisition of mining licences is often effected through a non-operating corporate entity. As these entities do not represent Business combinations a business, it is considered that the transactions do not meet the definition of a business combination and, accordingly, IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination. the transaction is accounted for as the acquisition of an asset. The net assets acquired are accounted for at cost. When acquiring new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute an integrated set of activities, whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed Investments in associates as a business by a market participant, and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination, using the guidance An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint provided in the standard.

Functional and presentation currency Property, plant and equipment The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment Mining assets in which it operates. For all Russian entities the functional currency is the Russian Rouble (RUB), as well as for the investment Mining assets and leases include the cost of acquiring and developing mining assets and mineral rights. Mining assets are holding companies, including Polymetal International plc. The functional currency of the Group’s entity located in Kazakhstan depreciated to their residual values using the unit-of-production method based on proven and probable ore reserves according (JSC Varvarinskoye) and operating with significant degree of autonomy is the Kazakh Tenge (KZT). to the JORC Code, which is the basis on which the Group’s mine plans are prepared. Changes in proven and probable reserves are dealt with prospectively. Depreciation is charged on new mining ventures from the date that the mining asset is capable The Group has chosen to present its consolidated financial statements in US Dollars (US$), as management believes of commercial production. In respect of those mining assets whose useful lives are expected to be less than the life of the mine, it is a more convenient presentation currency for international users of the consolidated financial statements of the Group depreciation over the period of the asset’s useful life is applied. as it is a common presentation currency in the mining industry. The translation of the financial statements of the Group entities from their functional currencies to the presentation currency is performed as follows: Capital construction-in-progress assets are measured at cost less any recognised impairment. Depreciation commences • all assets and liabilities are translated at closing exchange rates at each reporting period end date; when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the asset’s carrying amount at the date. The gain or loss arising is recognised in the consolidated income statement. In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised Stripping costs in the consolidated income statement. For all other partial disposals (i.e. reductions in the Group’s ownership interest in associates When it has been determined that a mining asset can be economically developed as a result of established proven and probable or jointly controlled entities that do not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share reserves, the costs to remove any overburden and other waste materials to initially expose the ore body, referred to as stripping of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to the consolidated income statement. costs, are capitalised as a part of mining assets.

If any such indication exists, the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the estimated recoverable amount of the asset in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the Effective interest rate method recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating interest the asset belongs. income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying Financial assets amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised Non-derivative financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: FVTPL, available for sale (AFS) financial as an expense immediately in the consolidated income statement. assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. No financial instruments have been classified as available for sale. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for financial instruments other than those financial assets classified the original carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods. as at FVTPL. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active Inventories market. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. Metal inventories Interest income is determined by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition Inventories including refined metals, metals in concentrate and in process, doré and ore stock piles are stated at the lower of interest would be immaterial. of production cost or net realisable value. Production cost is determined as the sum of the applicable expenditures and expenses incurred directly or indirectly in bringing inventories to their existing condition and location. Refined metals are valued AFS financial assets at the average total cost of production per saleable unit of metal. Work in-process, metal concentrate and doré are valued Investments other than those classified as held for trading, held-to-maturity or loans and receivables are classified as available at the average total production costs at each asset’s relevant stage of production. Ore stock piles are valued at the average for sale financial assets. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and unrealised gains and losses are recognised cost of mining that ore. Where ore stock piles are not expected to be processed within 12 months, those inventories are in equity until the investment is disposed or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity classified as non-current. is included in the consolidated income statement. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for that product based on prevailing spot metal prices, less estimated Impairment of financial assets costs to complete production and selling costs. Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that Consumables and spare parts occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. Consumables and spare parts are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.

The portion of consumables and spare parts not reasonably expected to be used within one year is classified is considered to be objective evidence of impairment. as a long-term asset in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include: • significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or • breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or • it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation; or 116/117 • the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.

Where a provision is measured asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. interest rate. Environmental obligations The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception An obligation to incur environmental restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning costs arises when disturbance is caused Polymetal International plc of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.

Criteria considered but are not limited to the following: Revenue recognition • the level of capital expenditure incurred compared to the construction cost estimates; Revenue is derived principally from the sale of gold and silver bullions and copper, gold and silver concentrate and is measured • the completion of a sufficient level of testing on the mine plant and equipment; at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts. Financial statements • the ability to produce gold, silver or copper in saleable form (within specifications); and Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion and sale of copper, gold and silver concentrate is recognised when the risks and • the ability to sustain ongoing commercial levels of production. rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer, the Group retains neither a continuing degree of involvement nor control over the goods sold, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with When a construction project moves into the commercial production stage and depreciation commences, the capitalisation the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion represents the invoiced value of metal of certain mine construction costs and interest ceases and costs are either regarded as inventory or expensed, except shipped to the buyer, net of value added tax (VAT). for capitalisable costs related to mining asset additions or improvements, underground mine development or ore reserve development. Sale of gold and silver bullion The Group processes doré produced in the Russian Federation (at Dukat, Khakanja, Voro, Omolon, and Amursk-Albazino) The Omolon Merrill-Crowe plant achieved commercial production in April 2012. into London Good Delivery Bars prior to sale. This final stage of processing is carried out on a toll-treatment basis at four state-owned refineries. The Group sells gold and silver bullion to banks through long-term agreements. The sales price, Amursk POX achieved commercial production in November 2012. as determined in the agreement, may be variable based upon the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) spot price or fixed. But the Group’s policy is not to enter into fixed price contracts. For domestic sales, title passes from the Group to the The Mayskoye plant and underground mine reached commercial production in April 2013. purchaser at the refinery gate with revenue recognised at that point. For export sales, once the gold and/or silver bars have been approved for export by Russian customs, they are then transported to the vault of the purchaser, which is typically located Acquisitions in London. Title passes and revenue is recognised at the point when the gold and/or silver bars are received by the purchaser. IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination. When acquiring new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities Sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate assumed constitute an integrated set of activities and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination, The Group sells copper, gold and silver concentrate under pricing arrangements where final prices are determined by quoted using the guidance provided in the standard. In making this determination, management evaluates the inputs, processes market prices in a period subsequent to the date of sale. Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on forward prices and outputs of the asset or entity acquired. for the expected date of final settlement. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment, which is also when risks and rewards pass to the buyer. Revenue is calculated based on the copper, gold and silver content in the concentrate and using the forward As a result of this evaluation process, management has determined that its 2012 acquisitions of Olcha, Semchenskoye and London Bullion Market Association (LMBA) or London Metal Exchange (LME) price to the estimated final pricing date, adjusted Svetlobor did not meet the definition of a business combination and as such the Group has accounted for these transactions for the specific terms of the relevant agreement. Until final settlement occurs, adjustments to revenue are made to take into as asset acquisitions (see Note 4). account the changes in metal quantities upon receipt of new information and assay. Revenue is presented net of refining and treatment charges which are subtracted in calculating the amount to be invoiced Key sources of estimation uncertainty Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and The Group’s sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate are based on a provisional price and as such, contain an embedded assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. from the sale of the concentrate at the forward exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not The determination of estimates requires judgements which are based on historical experience, current and expected economic qualify for hedge accounting, is measured at FVTPL with changes in its fair value recognised within revenue in the consolidated conditions, and all other available information.

The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end Share-based compensation of the reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and The Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to its accounting for share-based compensation. IFRS 2 requires companies liabilities within the next financial period. to recognise compensation costs for share-based payments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The most significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to: The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded in 2010 was calculated by the Group at the grant date using • fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations; the two-stage Monte-Carlo simulation model. The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards. No other share based payment awards were issued by the Group during the year ended 31 December 2013. • ore reserve estimates; • depreciation; The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as a general, administrative and selling expense over the vesting period with • impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment; a corresponding increase in the share-based compensation reserve. Upon the exercise of the awards, the proceeds received, • stock piles and work in-process; net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to the stated capital account, and the amounts recognised within the share-based compensation reserve transferred to retained earnings. • share-based compensation; • environmental obligations; Earnings per share • contingencies; and Earnings per share calculations are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 120/121 • income taxes. Diluted earnings per share are calculated using the treasury stock method, whereby the proceeds from the potential exercise of dilutive stock options with exercise prices that are below the average market price of the underlying shares are assumed to be used in purchasing the Company’s common shares at their average market price for the period. Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued properties, costs to sell the mining properties and the appropriate post-tax discount rate. Reductions in metal price forecasts, Annual Report 2013 Fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations increases in estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount In accordance with the Group’s policy, the Group allocates the cost of the acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities of recoverable reserves and resources and/or adverse current economics can result in a write-down of the carrying amounts assumed based on their fair values as estimated on the date of acquisition. Any difference between the cost of the acquired of the Group’s goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment. entity and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Group exercises significant judgement in the process of identifying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, valuing these assets and liabilities, and In making the assessment for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are allocated to an appropriate Polymetal International plc estimating their remaining useful lives. The valuation of these assets and liabilities is based on assumptions and criteria that, cash-generating unit. Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets that do not generate independent in some cases, include management’s estimates of discounted future cash flows. cash inflows to appropriate cash-generating units, and also in estimating the timing and value of underlying cash flows within the value-in-use calculation. Subsequent changes to the cash-generating unit allocation or to the timing of cash flows could If actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions considered, the Group may have to adjust its estimates of the impact the carrying value of the respective assets. fair values of assets and liabilities recognised and the goodwill balance during the measurement period. Such a remeasurement could have an impact on the amounts reported in the consolidated income statement in current and future periods. Stock piles and work in-process In determining mine operating costs recognised in the consolidated income statement, the Group’s management makes Ore reserve estimates estimates of quantities of ore stacked on leach pads and in process and the recoverable gold and silver in this material An ore reserve estimate is an estimate of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s to determine the average costs of finished goods sold during the period. Changes in these estimates can result in a change Financial statements properties. Ore reserve estimates are used by the Group in the calculation of: depletion of mining assets using the units-ofin mine operating costs of future periods and carrying amounts of inventories. At 31 December 2013 the carrying value production method; impairment charges and in forecasting the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land restoration of the ore stock piles was US$194 million and work in-process was US$78 million. costs. Also, for the purpose of impairment review and the assessment of the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land restoration costs, management may take into account mineral resources in addition to ore reserves where there is a high degree Share-based compensation of confidence that such resources will be extracted. In November 2010, the Group issued equity-settled share appreciation rights to certain employees. Equity-settled share appreciation rights are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. In order to calculate ore reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about geological, technical and economic factors, The fair value determined at the grant date of the awards is expensed as services are rendered over the vesting period, based including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, on the Group’s estimate of the rights that will eventually vest. commodity prices, discount rates and exchange rates. Estimating the quantity and/or grade of ore reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies to be determined by analysing geological data such as the logging and assaying of drill samples. The fair value of share-based compensation was measured using the Monte-Carlo two-stage simulation model. The expected This process may require complex and difficult geological judgements and calculations to interpret the data. life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioral considerations. The awards include an option, exercisable at the discretion of the participant, Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period as additional geological data becomes available during the course to defer the measurement period by one year from June 2013 to June 2014. For further details see Note 33. of operations or if there are changes in any of the aforementioned assumptions. Such changes in estimated reserves may affect the Group’s financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including the following: As at 31 December 2013, all options issued are fully vested and no unrecognised share-based compensation expense • asset carrying values due to changes in estimated future cash flows; remains. No other share based payment awards were issued by the Group during the year ended 31 December 2013. • depletion charged in the consolidated income statement where such charges are determined by using the Environmental obligations units-of-production method; The Group’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the • provisions for decommissioning and land restoration costs where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations environment. The Group’s provision for future decommissioning and land restoration cost represents management’s best about the timing of the payment of such costs; and estimate of the present value of the future cash outflows required to settle the liability which reflects estimates of future costs, • carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities where changes in estimated reserves affect the carrying value inflation, movements in foreign exchange rates and assumptions of risks associated with the future cash outflows; and the of the relevant assets and liabilities. applicable interest rate for discounting the future cash outflows. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ materially from the estimates. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations, life of mine estimates and discount Depreciation rates could affect the carrying amount of this provision. Mining assets are depreciated using the units-of-production method except where the useful lives of the assets are shorter than the life of mine. The units-of-production depreciation calculations are based on proved and probable reserves under Contingencies the JORC Code (JORC), which is the basis on which the Group’s mine plans are prepared as the useful lives of these assets By their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. For other property, plant and equipment, the straight-line method of such contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgements and estimates of the outcome of future events. is applied over the estimated useful life of the asset which does not exceed the estimated mine life. Income Taxes and Mining Taxes The calculation of the units-of-production rate of depreciation could be impacted to the extent that actual production The Group is subject to income tax and mining taxes in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.

Financial statements period up to 2023. Each legal entity within the Group represents a separate tax-paying component for income tax purposes. The tax losses of one entity cannot be used to reduce taxable income of other entities of the Group. As at 31 December 2013 18. Impairment losses and 31 December 2012 the aggregate tax losses carried forward were US$426.8 million (RUB13.9 billion) and US$288.1 million At 30 June 2013, due to significant decline in gold, silver and copper market prices in first quarter 2013, the Group carried (RUB 8.8 billion), respectively. out an impairment review of its property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other non-current assets. As a result of this review, total impairment charges of US$199.1 million were recognised as at 30 June 2013. The Group believes that recoverability of the recognized deferred tax asset (DTA) of US$88.5 million at 31 December 2013 is more likely than not based upon expectations of future taxable income in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan and During second half of the year ended 31 December 2013 there was a stabilisation in gold, silver and copper market prices. available tax planning strategies. Therefore, the impairment review was performed only for the Omolon cash generating unit, where individual impairment indicators exist due to downgrades in reserves and changes in the life of mine plan. As a result, a further impairment Losses incurred in certain taxable entities in recent years have created a history of losses as of 31 December 2013. The Group of US$12 million was recognised as at 31 December 2013. has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to overcome the recent history of losses based on forecasts of sufficient taxable income in the carry-forward period. In the view of management there are no indicators of impairment (or impairment reversal) for other cash generating units as at 31 December 2013 and no further impairment as at 31 December 2013 was recognised. The Group’s estimate of future taxable income is based on established proven and probable reserves which can be economically developed. The related detailed mine plans and forecasts provide sufficient supporting evidence that the Total impairment charges of US$213.4 million (2012: nil) recognised during the year ended 31 December 2013 comprise Group will generate taxable earnings to be able to fully realise its net DTA even under various stressed scenarios.

The Group used a post-tax real discount rate of 7.1% (2012: 7.1%) in the DCF calculations which is equal to its nominal weighted average cost of capital of 9% (2012: 9%) translated into real terms. The DCF method used is based on the following key assumptions: Commodity prices Commodity prices are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked against external sources of information. In the impairment tests performed, the flat real long-term gold, silver and copper prices of US$1,200 per ounce, US$18 per ounce and US$7,000 per tonne, respectively, have been used to estimate future revenues. 134/135 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 18.
