Therefore, in addition to the general management of our business projects and their own sustainability, the Company also emphasizes on other types of projects and activities which lead to sustainability development of the society and the environment. We learn from our experience how to initiate new projects and to organize activities effectively for further development. The Company has divided our projects and activities for the society and the environment clearly into four separate areas, namely, education, arts-culture and sports, environmental rehabilitation and conservation, and other social concerns. This way, all of the Company’s functions are able to systematically move forward in the same direction. In the past year, the Company focused on large projects as they allow the Company to face societal challenges relating to the sustainability development from a wider perspective. 6JGTGHQTGUVCVKQPQHTCKCTGCÁ266'2)4''072ÂKUCP example of the projects which are able to stimulate positive TGURQPUGU CPF RTQFWEG UKIPKÌECPV KORCEVU VQ VJG UQEKGV[ the environment and the organization.
