STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT BY THE EXECUTIVE BOARD PERIOD COVERED BY OUR COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2ND OCTOBER 2013 TO 1ST OCTOBER 2014 We are pleased to reaffirm our support for the UN Global Compact and its ten principles in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti‐Corruption. Swarovski has been a participant of the UN Global Compact since 2010; and, since our last Communication on Progress (COP) in October 2013, Swarovski has made important steps forward in integrating the Global Compact and its principles into our culture, strategy and operations. Following our last COP, we published the Swarovski Sustainability Report 2013 which provided a detailed account of our goals, achievements, performance and initiatives. In this COP, we highlight key practical actions taken by Swarovski in each of the four issue areas and provide updated qualitative and quantitative indications of our progress. With an enduring commitment to social, environmental and ethical good, Swarovski looks to the future with a sense of responsibility that echoes the sentiments of our company founder while also recognising the complex contemporary challenges that all businesses face. We are determined to act positively to ensure that the company remains true to Daniel Swarovski’s vision of a company that not only has its employees’ wellbeing at heart but also that of society and the environment as a whole. Our engagement with the UN Global Compact is an important part of realizing this ambition and we look forward to continued participation as we advance with our commitments to its principles.
