The dividend is not paid until approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting. The possible payment of dividend from Tryg Forsikring A/S to Tryg A/S is influenced by contingency fund provisions of DKK 3,020 (DKK 3,363m in 2012). The contingency fund provisions can be used to cover losses in connection with the settlement of insurance provisions or otherwise for the benefit of the insured.

Due to ment that companies must determine the capital base, which consists its indefinite maturity, the new subordinate loan may be included in of equity minus intangible assets, discount effect and other statutory the capital base by up to 50% of the company’s minimum requirement corrections plus subordinate loan capital. The additional capital can be under Solvency I. It is also expected that the subordinate loan may be included by up to 50% of the minimum requirement under Solvency I, included as Tier 2 capital under Solvency II. although additional capital with a definite maturity may not exceed 25% of the minimum requirement. Tryg’s total subordinated debt is DKK 1,818m.

At 31 December 2013, the share option plan comprised 229.883 share options (551,275 share options at 31 December 2012). Each share option entitles the holder to acquire one existing share with a nominal value of DKK 25 in Tryg A/S. The share option plan entitles the holders to buy 0.4% of the share capital in Tryg A/S if all share options are exercised. In 2013, the fair value of share options recognised in the consolidated income statement amounted to DKK 2m (DKK 7m in 2012). At 31 December 2013, a total amount of DKK 78m was recognised for share option programmes issued in 2006-2011. Fair values at the time of allocation are based on the Black & Scholes option pricing formula. The Group Executive Management includes retired managers with a total of 8.285 units with a value of DKK 0,6m at the time of allocation. Risk-takers are included under ‘Other senior employees’. The following assumptions were applied in calculating the market value of outstanding share options at the time of allocation: The expected volatility is based on the average volatility of Tryg shares. The expected term is 4 years, corresponding to the average exercise period of 3 to 5 years. The risk-free interest rate is based on a bullet loan with the same term as the expected term of the options at the time of allocation. The calculation is based on the strike price as set out in the option agreement and the average share price at the time of allocation. The dividend payout ratio is not included in the calculation as the strike price is reduced by dividends paid in order to prevent option holders from being placed at a disadvantage in connection with the company’s dividend payments. The assumptions for calculating the market value at the end of term are based on the same principles as for the market value at the time of allocation.

The Executive Management and selected risk-takers are allocated one share in Tryg A/S for each share that the Executive Management member or risk-taker acquires in Tryg A/S at market rate for liquid cash at a contractually agreed sum. The shares are reported at market value and are accrued over the 4-year maturation period. In 2013, the reported fair value of matching shares for the Group amounted to DKK 2m (DKK 2m in 2012). At 31 December 2013, a total amount of DKK 4m was recognised for matching shares. 90 | Tryg A/S | Annual report 2013 | Notes Notes DKKm 2012 2013 8 Interest and dividends etc. Interest income and dividends Dividends 15 19 Interest income cash at bank and in hand 26 18 Interest income bonds 1,133 984 Interest income, other 22 8 1,196 1,029 Interest expenses Interest expenses subordinate loan capital and credit institutions -80 -89 Interest expenses, other -20 -23 -100 -112 1,096 917 9 Value adjustments Value adjustments concerning financial assets or liabilities at fair value with value adjustment in the income statement: Equity investments 2 -42 Unit trust units 378 578 Share derivatives -2 30 Bonds 202 -250 Interest derivatives 263 -300 Other loans 0 -5 843 11 Value adjustments concerning assets or liabilities that cannot be attributed to IAS 39: Investment property 82 -21 Owner-occupied property -350 -76 Discounting -475 298 Other statement of financial position items -116 -101 -859 100 -16 111 Exchange rate adjustments concerning financial assets or liabilities which cannot be stated at fair value total DKK -146m (DKK 37m in 2012) Notes | Annual report 2013 | Tryg A/S | 91 Notes DKKm 2012 2013 10 Tax Tax on accounting profit/loss -754 -749 Difference between Danish and foreign tax rates -57 -58 Tax adjustment, previous years 2 -2 Adjustment of non-taxable income and costs 49 152 Change in valuation of tax assets -89 -20 Change in tax rate 12 58 Other taxes 0 -1 -837 -620 Effective tax rate % % Tax on accounting profit/loss 25 25 Difference between Danish and foreign tax rates 2 2 Change in tax rate 0 -2 Adjustment of non-taxable income and costs -2 -5 Change in valuation of tax assets 3 1 28 21 11 Profit/loss on discontinued and divested business Gross premium income 611 202 Gross claims -484 -149 Total insurance operating costs -244 -55 Profit/loss on gross business -117 -2 Profit/loss on ceded business -4 0 Insurance technical interest, net of reinsurance 4 1 Technical result -117 -1 Total investment return after insurance technical interest 32 0 Other income and costs 113 1 Profit/loss before tax 28 0 Tax 0 -4 Profit/loss on discontinued and divested business 28 -4 Run-off regarding discontinued Marine Hull insurance 1 11 Divested finnish branch 27 -15 Profit/loss on discontinued and divested business includes Marine Hull insurance, which was divested in 2010 and the Finnish branch of Tryg Forsikring which was sold in 2012, with authority approval in May 2013. For the year 2013 there has been no line of business with premium income which exceed DKK 70m. 92 | Tryg A/S | Annual report 2013 | Notes Notes Trademarks Assets and customer under DKKm Goodwill relations Software a) construction a) Total 12 Intangible assets 2013 Cost Cost at 1 January 397 178 869 227 1,671 Exchange rate adjustments -16 -7 -26 -1 -50 Transferred to assets held for sale 0 0 0 0 0 Transferred from assets under construction 0 0 77 -77 0 Additions for the year 0 0 16 121 137 Disposals for the year 0 0 0 0 0 Cost at 31 December 381 171 936 270 1,758 Amortisation and write-downs Amortisation and write-downs at 1 January 0 -73 -747 -92 -912 Exchange rate adjustments 0 3 22 0 25 Transferred to assets held for sale 0 0 0 0 0 Amortisation for the year 0 -19 -81 0 -100 Impairment losses and write-downs for the year 0 0 -13 0 -13 Amortisation and write-downs at 31 December 0 -89 -819 -92 -1,000 Carrying amount at 31 December 381 82 117 178 758 2012 Cost Cost at 1 January 380 170 882 257 1,689 Exchange rate adjustments 17 8 12 0 37 Transferred to assets held for sale 0 0 -4 0 -4 Transferred from asset under construction 0 0 14 -14 0 Additions for the year 0 0 13 82 95 Disposals for the year 0 0 -48 -98 -146 Cost at 31 December 397 178 869 227 1,671 Amortisation and write-downs Amortisation and write-downs at 1 January 0 -51 -632 -54 -737 Exchange rate adjustments 0 -2 -9 0 -11 Transferred to assets held for sale 0 0 3 0 3 Amortisation for the year 0 -20 -143 0 -163 Impairment losses and write-downs for the year 0 0 -2 -38 -40 Reversed amortisation 0 0 36 0 36 Amortisation and write-downs at 31 December 0 -73 -747 -92 -912 Carrying amount at 31 December 397 105 122 135 759 a) In cost at 31 December is included developed in-house DKK 245m (DKK 134m at 31 December). Notes | Annual report 2013 | Tryg A/S | 93 Notes DKKm 12 Intangible assets (continued) Impairment test Goodwill At 31 December 2013, management performed an impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill based on the allocation of the cost of goodwill to the cash-generating unit, which consists of the total Swedish insurance activities. In 2009, Tryg acquired Moderna Försäkringar Sak AB, Modern Re S.A., Netviq AB and MF Bilsport & MC Specialförsäkringar. The insurance activities were incorporated into the Tryg Group’s business structure in 2009 and are reported under Sweden. In 2010, the companies, excluding Modern Re S.A., were merged into Tryg Forsikring A/S as Moderna Forsäkringar, a branch of Tryg Forsikring A/S. Modern Re S.A. was discontinued in 2011. Assumptions for impairment test: The Value-in-use method is used. The cash flows appearing from the latest budgets approved by management for the next 5 financial years are used when calculating the value in use of the total Swedish activities acquired. The cash flows in the latest budget period have been extrapolated for financial years after the budget periods (terminal period) and adjusted for expected growth rates determined on the basis of expectations for the general economic growth. The required return is based on an assessment of the risk profile of the tested business activities compared with the market’s expectations for the Group. The impairment test shows a calculated value in use of approximately DKK 1.4bn relative to a recognised equity of DKK 0.8bn and does not indicate any impairment. Assumed Assumed Required annual growth annual growth return 2013 0-10 years > 10 years before tax Moderna 2.0% 0.0% 12.5% 2012 Moderna 2.0% 2.0% 12.4% Trademarks and customer relations As at 31 December 2013, management performed a test of the carrying amounts of trademarks and customer relations as an integral part of the goodwill test. The test did not indicate any impairment. Software and assets under construction As at 31 December 2013, management performed a test of the carrying amounts of software and assets under construction. The impairment test compares the carrying amount with the estimated present value of future cash flows. The test indicated impairment of a small number of projects, resulting in impairment losses. The total impairment of intangible assets amounts to DKK 13m (DKK 138m in 2012). 94 | Tryg A/S | Annual report 2013 | Notes Notes Operating Owner-occupied Assets under DKKm equipment property construction Total 13 Property, plant and equipment 2013 Cost Cost at 1 January 228 1,786 101 2,115 Exchange rate adjustments -8 -60 -6 -74 Transferred to assets held for sale 0 0 0 0 Transferred from assets under construction 0 10 -10 0 Additions for the year 18 2 0 20 Disposals for the year -1 0 0 -1 Cost at 31 December 237 1,738 85 2,060 Accumulated value adjustments Accumulated value adjustments at 1 January 0 -281 -90 -371 Exchange rate adjustments 0 -11 5 -6 Value adjustments for the year at revalued amount in income statement 0 -76 0 -76 Value adjustments for the year at revalued amount in other comprehensive income 0 9 0 9 Accumulated value adjustments at 31 December 0 -359 -85 -444 Accumulated depreciation Accumulated depreciation at 1 January -90 -62 0 -152 Exchange rate adjustments 3 2 0 5 Transferred to assets held for sale 0 0 0 0 Reversed depreciation 0 0 0 0 Depreciation for the year -28 -15 0 -43 Accumulated depreciation at 31 December -115 -75 0 -190 Carrying amount at 31 December 122 1,304 0 1,426 Notes | Annual report 2013 | Tryg A/S | 95 Notes Operating Owner-occupied Assets under DKKm equipment property construction Total 13 Property, plant and equipment (continued) 2012 Cost Cost at 1 January 187 1,760 98 2,045 Exchange rate adjustments 3 27 2 32 Transferred to assets held for sale -8 0 0 -8 Transferred from assets under construction 0 10 -10 0 Additions for the year 55 8 11 74 Disposals for the year -9 -19 0 -28 Cost at 31 December 228 1,786 101 2,115 Accumulated value adjustments Accumulated value adjustments at 1 January 0 27 -88 -61 Exchange rate adjustments 0 0 -2 -2 Value adjustments for the year at revalued amount in income statement 0 -350 0 -350 Value adjustments for the year at revalued amount in other comprehensive income 0 42 0 42 Accumulated value adjustments at 31 December 0 -281 -90 -371 Accumulated depreciation Accumulated depreciation at 1 January -85 -42 0 -127 Exchange rate adjustments -1 -1 0 -2 Transferred to assets held for sale 4 0 0 4 Reversed depreciation 8 0 0 8 Depreciation for the year -16 -19 0 -35 Accumulated depreciation at 31 December -90 -62 0 -152 Carrying amount at 31 December 138 1,443 11 1,592 External experts were involved in valuing the owner-occupied properties.

The plans are based on the employees’ expected final pay, providing the members of the plan with a guaranteed level of pension benefits throughout their lives. The pension benefits are determined by the employees’ term of employment and salary at the time of retiring. Employees having made contributions for a full period of contribution are guaranteed a pension corresponding to 66% of their final pay. Pensions being disbursed are regulated in step with the basic amount of old-age pension paid in Norway (G regulation). Under the present defined-benefit plan, members earn a free policy entitlement comprising disability cover, spouse and cohabitant cover and children’s pension. In connection with new legislation on occupational pensions in Norway, adopted and applicable from 1 January 2014, changes are expected to be made to the defined-benefit pension plan. These changes will affect the future recognition and measurement of the obligation. The pension funds are managed by Nordea Liv & Pension and regulated by local legislation and practice. Description of the Swedish plan Moderna Försäkringar, a branch of Tryg Forsikring A/S, complies with the Swedish industry pension agreement, the FTP plan, which is insured with Försäkringsbranschens Pensionskassa – FPK. Under the terms of the agreement, the Group’s Swedish branch has undertaken, along with the other businesses in the collaboration, to pay the pensions of the individual employees in accordance with the applicable rules. The FTP plan is primarily a defined-benefit plan in terms of the future pension benefits. FPK is unable to provide sufficient information for the Group to use defined-benefit accounting. For this reason, the Group has accounted for the plan as if it were a defined-contribution plan in accordance with IAS 19.30. This years premium paid to FPK amounted to DKK 16m, which is about 3% of the annual premium in FPK (2012). FPK writes in its interim report for 2013 that it had a collective consolidation ratio of 114 at 30 June 2013 (consolidation ratio 104 at 30 June 2012). The collective consolidation ratio is defined as the fair value of the plan assets relative to the total collective pension obligations. 108 | Tryg A/S | Annual report 2013 | Notes Notes DKKm 2012 2013 23 Deferred tax Tax asset Operating equipment 22 14 Debt and provisions 290 105 Capitalised tax loss 13 6 325 125 Tax liability Intangible rights 76 75 Land and buildings 253 227 Bonds and loans secured by mortgages 78 45 Contingency funds 1,061 835 1,468 1,182 Deferred tax 1,143 1,057 Unaccrued timing differences of statement of financial position items 118 122 Development in deferred tax Deferred tax at 1 January 1,191 1,143 Exchange rate adjustments 56 -119 Change in deferred tax relating to change in tax rate -12 -50 Change in deferred tax previous years 7 16 Change in capitalised tax loss 65 5 Change in deferred tax taken to the income statement -247 -7 Change in valuation of tax asset 89 20 Change in deferred tax taken to equity -6 49 Deferred tax at 31 December 1,143 1,057 Tax value of non-capitalised tax loss Denmark 18 18 Sweden 4 3 Finland 0 1 The loss in Tryg A/S cannot be utilised in the Danish joint taxation scheme.
