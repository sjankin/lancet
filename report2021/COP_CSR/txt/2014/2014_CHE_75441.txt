We succeeded to increase Group profit by about 70% to CHF 36.9 million (2012: CHF 21.8 million). Operating cash-flows were strong and amounted to CHF 63.3 million. Net debt of the Group was reduced to CHF 2.9 mil­lion (2012: CHF 41.3 million) while the equity ratio increased to 51.6%. The core business (including Wireless Solutions, Network Testing and Corporate, but excluding the noncore activities related to real estate) achieved an EBITDA margin of 15.7% – the best EBITDA margin­ ever reached in the history of Ascom. In view of the­ ex­cellent results, the Board of Directors will propose to the ­­ Annual General Meeting an increased dividend of CHF 0.40 per share. The stock market honored the positive development of the Company, and the market capitalization of Ascom increased during the year by about 70% to CHF 540 million as of 31 December 2013. Ascom Wireless Solutions further strengthened and expanded its leading global market position in the healthcare segment, and the division further increased its high level of profitability. Ascom Network Testing confirmed the turnaround that was successfully implemented in 2012. ­The division recorded profitable growth and reached a double-digit EBITDA margin. Ascom Group gen­ erated for the core business, which includes Wireless Solutions, Network Testing and Corporate, ­revenue of CHF 439.2 million, representing a growth rate of 2.7%. Substantially increased incoming orders and order backlog form the basis for profitable growth of the Group in 2014. Ascom has defined specific growth initiatives for both divisions in order to reach revenue growth of 5–10% p.a. in its core business for 2014 as well as for 2015. This growth plan includes ­selected smaller acquisitions. Ascom has set its EBITDA margin targets for the core business at ­15–16% for 2014 and at 16–17% for 2015. These EBITDA targets reflect the Group’s strong intention to grow also inorganically and hence anticipate costs related to the integration of the acquired ­businesses in the first twelve months. EBITDA margin of 15.7% for the Ascom core business Ascom realized a strong improvement in the results during fiscal year 2013. In its core business, which includes Wireless Solutions, Network Testing and Corporate, but excludes the non-core activities related to real estate, incoming orders rose by 10.6% year-on-year, also due to a strong order intake ASCom Annual Report 2013 Letter to Shareholders 3 Ascom Group key figures 2013 2012 Revenue in CHFm 459.7 449.8 EBITDA in CHFm 1 67.6 49.0 Group profit 1 in CHFm 36.9 21.8 Earnings per share (EPS) 1 in CHF 1.07 0.64 Employees (FTE) at 31.12. 1,586 1,771 1 Previous year numbers are restated as a result of the adoption of IAS 19. in December 2013. Order backlog increased by 12.4% year-on-year, creating a very good basis for further revenue growth.

Moreover, Ascom closed the year under review with a substantial hike in profitability and posted in its core business EBITDA of CHF 68.9 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 15.7%. Including the non-core activities related to real estate, Ascom Group generated in 2013 total revenues of CHF 459.7 million (2012: CHF 449.8 million) corresponding to a growth rate of 2.2%. EBITDA amounted to CHF 67.6 million (2012: CHF 49.0 million), and the EBITDA margin increased to 14.7% (2012: 10.9%). Non-core activities contributed with a loss of CHF 1.3 million at EBITDA level. Group profit increased by 70% Ascom reported a Group profit for 2013 at CHF 36.9 million, which is about 70% higher than in the previous year (2012: CHF 21.8 million). In view of the excellent results, the Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting an increased dividend of CHF 0.40 per share. As of 31 December 2013, the Ascom Group reduced its net debt substantially to CHF 2.9 million compared to the previous year (2012: CHF 41.3 million); cash and cash equivalents came to CHF 58.2 million (2012: CHF 63.1 million), and the equity ratio increased to 51.6%. Ascom Wireless Solutions – the solution provider for workflow optimization in healthcare Wireless Solutions closed fiscal year 2013 with strong growth in incoming orders and further improved its already high profitability by achieving an EBITDA margin of 17.3%, the highest margin ever. The division was able to strengthen and expand its excellent position in the healthcare segment, in particular in patient systems. During the year, the division successfully completed the integration of the GE Nurse Call business, which has strengthened Ascom’s position in healthcare as well as its value proposition in the US. Furthermore, Wireless Solutions won significant orders in important healthcare markets, in particular in the UK and in Germany. In December 2013, the division announced the acquisition of the Australian company Integrated Wireless, which closed on 2 January 2014. This acquisition is an excellent strategic step to gain access to the Asia Pacific markets and to further expand the division’s leading position in the global healthcare market. Wireless Solutions continued to steadily develop with a high profitability level. The division ­recorded revenue growth of 2.8% year-on-year to CHF 306.1 million (2012: CHF 297.7 million), and exceeded its already strong incoming orders from the previous year. Incoming orders increased by 7.6% to CHF 318.7 million, and order backlog rose by 14.4% to CHF 102.6 million. In terms of profitability, Wireless Solutions further improved its already high EBITDA margin and achieved the best year ever. In 2013, the division recorded an EBITDA of CHF 53.1 million (2012: CHF 48.2 million) corresponding to an outstanding margin of 17.3% (2012: 16.2%). Wireless Solutions positions itself as “the solution provider for workflow optimization in healthcare”. With its leading market position, its broad and comprehensive product portfolio and its excellent knowledge of customer needs, the division is in a prime position to capitalize on the growth opportu4 ASCom Annual Report 2013 Letter to Shareholders Key figures Wireless Solutions Key figures Network Testing CHFm 2013 2012 CHFm 2013 2012 Incoming orders 318.7 296.1 Incoming orders 139.6 118.6 Revenue 306.1 297.7 Revenue 133.3 130.4 EBITDA 53.1 48.2 EBITDA 17.9 (4.6) Employees (FTE) at 31.12. 1,109 1,247 Employees (FTE) at 31.12. 462 507 nities in its addressed markets. Wireless Solutions has set the target to grow 5–10% in 2014. The division is well positioned due to the higher order backlog and the recently concluded acquisition of Integrated Wireless in Australia. Wireless Solutions initiated measures to penetrate further growth markets such as Middle East and Asia. Moreover, specific growth initiatives in the software and service business as well as in the nurse call business shall support the achievement of this goal. Ascom Network Testing – a trusted partner in wireless network investment and management With solid 2013 results, Ascom Network Testing confirmed its successful turnaround implemented in 2012. Having optimized its organizational structure and significantly reduced its cost base in 2012, the division was able to capitalize on the recovery of its addressed markets and succeeded in achieving its financial targets. Network Testing showed a strong growth in incoming orders and grew its revenue organically. The division defended its savings as identified in 2012, and delivered a substantial improvement in profitability, resulting in a double-digit EBITDA margin of 13.4%. In 2013, one of the main business drivers has been requests from customers to support capacity expansion in LTE networks. Network Testing has seen robust customer demand in the Americas as well as in the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), while market conditions in the Asia Pacific region were very disappointing. The division achieved in particular good growth in its product line Reporting & Analysis, this in line with its strategy. The 2013 operating results demonstrate that Network Testing has made substantial progress. Revenue grew by 2.2% totaling CHF 133.3 million (2012: CHF 130.4 million), and incoming orders increased by 17.7% to CHF 139.6 million (2012: CHF 118.6 million). The division recorded a strong improvement in profitability with an EBITDA of CHF 17.9 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 13.4% after a loss of CHF 4.6 million for fiscal year 2012. Network Testing positions itself as “trusted partner in wireless network investment and management”. Network Testing has a strong market position and a widespread organizational footprint with its truly global customer base that provides a solid basis for further organic growth. The division has the ambition to bounce back in Asia Pacific and take advantage in particular of the LTE opportunities in China. In addition, Network Testing is in a good position to capitalize from the continuing strong market conditions in particular in Middle East, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. The division also plans to further grow the software and service content of its business. For 2014, Network Testing has the ambition to grow revenue by 5–10% and to further increase its EBITDA margin. Broader shareholder structure for Ascom Zürcher Kantonalbank divested its 26.86% stake as of 1 November 2013 in a private placement. The placement was well received, and numerous new investors as well as current shareholders from Switzerland and abroad invested about CHF 120 million in the acquisition of Ascom shares what is a strong sign of trust for the Ascom management. The company reports now a 100% free float of shares. The stock market honored the positive development of Ascom, and the market capitalization of Ascom increased during the year by about 70% to CHF 540 million as of 31 December 2013. ASCom Annual Report 2013 Letter to Shareholders 5 Implementation of the new ordinance against excessive compensation As of 1 January 2014, a new Swiss ordinance, “Ordinance against excessive compensation in listed corporations” became effective that aims to further strengthen shareholders’ rights. The new rules will give the General Meeting of Shareholders, inter alia, substantial voting power on Board elections and on compensation for the members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. Ascom has decided to comply with the new ordinance earlier than required and will propose all necessary changes to the Articles of Incorporation at the upcoming Annual General Meeting. The Board of Directors wants to avoid any uncertainties and to find appropriate solutions for Ascom. As a principle, compensation of the members of the Board of Directors and of the members of the Executive Board shall be adequate, competitive and performance oriented, and shall be set in line with the strategic goals, the success of the company as well as long-term interests of the shareholders. As of 1 November 2013, the Ascom Head Office has been relocated to Baar (Canton of Zug). The Board of Directors proposes to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to transfer the legal domicile of Ascom Holding AG to Baar as well. Renewal of the Board of Directors Ascom wants to strengthen its position in the global healthcare industry as well as continue to grow in new markets. Therefore the Board of Directors proposes with Christina Stercken and Dr Harald Deutsch two new candidates to be elected as Members of the Board of Directors. Both candidates have an impressive international track record. Paul E. Otth, Vice Chairman of the Board, has reached the Company’s age limit and therefore cannot stand for re-election. Kenth-Ake Jönsson decided not to stand for re-election for personal reasons. The Board of Directors thanks the leaving Board Members for their precious contributions to Ascom. A word of thanks The positive development of Ascom and the convincing results achieved in fiscal year 2013 would not have been possible without the excellent work of our employees. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors and the Executive Board, we would like to express our gratitude to all our employees. Special thanks go to all our customers for their confidence in our products, solutions and services. Finally, we would like to thank you, our valued shareholders, for your trust and interest in Ascom.

Other capital reserves For equity-settled employee share-based payment transactions, IFRS requires entities to recognize an increase in equity when services are received. The Group has chosen to recognize an expense with a related credit in other capital reserves. The Group provides own shares to employees exercising stock options and elected to recognize the excess or shortfall of cash received over the acquisition cost of those own shares in other capital reserves.

General information Ascom is an international solutions provider with comprehensive technological know-how in Mission-Critical Wireless Communication. The company focuses on two core businesses, Wireless Solutions (an international leader in high-value, wireless and customer-specific on-site communication and workflow optimization solutions) and Network Testing (a global leader in mobile network testing, monitoring and post-processing and performance optimization solutions). In addition, the Group includes certain non-core real estate activities, mainly through long-term sale-leaseback agreements, which will end in 2014 and 2015 and relate to other businesses already disposed of in prior years. Ascom Holding Ltd., the parent company of the Group, is a public limited company and is domiciled in Berne (Switzerland). Ascom registered shares (symbol ASCN) are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich (Switzerland). 2. Summary of the general Group accounting policies 2.1 Basis of preparation The functional and presentation currency of Ascom Holding Ltd. is Swiss francs (CHF). Ascom’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the individual financial statements of each Group company. These are based on historical costs, except for the revaluation of certain financial assets at fair value, and are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) including the standards and interpretation guidelines issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as well as the valuation and accounting policies described below. These policies have been consistently applied. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 2.3. The closing date for the Group and the individual Group companies is 31 December. 2.2 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures a) The following new standards and amendments to existing standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2013: IFRS 10 – “Consolidated Financial Statements”, IFRS 11 – “Joint Arrangements”, IFRS 12 – “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities Joint Arrangements”, IFRS 13 – “Fair Value Measurement”, IAS 27 (revised) – “Separate Financial Statements”, IAS 28 (revised) – “Investments in Associates­ and Joint Ventures”, IAS 1 (amendment) – “Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income”, IFRIC 20 – “Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine”, IFRS 7 (amendment) – “Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, IFRS 1 (amendment) – “Government Loans”, and Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2009–2011 Cycle. These standards have no effect on­ the consolidated balance sheet or statement of comprehensive income of Ascom Group, as they are either mostly disclosure related or of little significance to Ascom Group. IAS 19 – “Employee Benefits” was amended in June 2011. The effects of this amendment on the consolidated financial statements are mainly based on the following modifications of IAS 19: ■■ Elimination of the corridor approach and recognition of all remeasurement gains or losses in other comprehensive income as they occur. Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 55 ■■ Immediate recognition of all past service costs. ■■ Net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit ­liability or asset (funded status) replaces interest cost and expected return on plan assets. Ascom adopted the amended IAS 19 standard retrospectively from 1 January 2012 with the ­following major effects on the consolidated financial statements of the comparative period: Restatement of consolidated balance sheet CHFm 31.12.2012 1.1.2012 Increase in deferred income tax assets 15.5 18.7 Decrease in post-employment benefit assets (13.1) (7.8) Net increase in total assets 2.4 10.9 Net decrease in total shareholders’ equity (56.9) (61.0) Decrease in deferred income tax liabilities (3.3) (1.9) Increase in employee benefit obligations 62.6 73.8 Net increase in total liabilities 59.3 71.9 Restatement of consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income CHFm 2012 Decrease in cost of goods sold 0.7 Decrease in marketing and distribution 0.4 Decrease in research and development 0.1 Decrease in administration 1.9 Increase in earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT) 3.1 Increase in financial expenses (1.9) Increase in income tax expenses (0.3) Net increase in Group profit for the period 0.9 Net increase in other comprehensive income 3.2 Net increase in total comprehensive income 4.1 Restatement of earnings per share CHF 2012 Increase in basic earnings per share from Group profit 0.03 Increase in basic earnings per share from continuing operations 0.03 Increase in diluted earnings per share from Group profit 0.03 Increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 0.03 Restatement of consolidated statement of cash flows CHFm 2012 Net increase in Group profit for the period 0.9 Decrease in employee benefit obligations and post-employment benefit assets (3.1) Increase in interest expenses 1.9 Increase in income tax expenses 0.3 Net increase/(decrease) in cash flow from operating activities – 56 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements b) The Group has early adopted IAS 36 (amendment) – “Recoverable Amount Disclosures for NonFinancial Assets”. The early adoption of this amendment has minor disclosure-related effects on the consolidated financial statements. c) The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published but are not yet effective: Standard AsEffective Planned sessdate application ment by Ascom IAS 32 (amendment) – “Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” ** 1.1.2014 2014 IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 (amendments) – “Investment Entities” * 1.1.2014 2014 IAS 39 (amendment) – “Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of * 1.1.2014 2014 Hedge Accounting” IFRIC 21 – “Levies” * 1.1.2014 2014 IAS 19 (amendment) – “Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions” * 1.7.2014 2015 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010–2012 Cycle ** 1.7.2014 2015 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011–2013 Cycle ** 1.7.2014 2015 IFRS 9 – “Financial Instruments” *** 1.1.2015 2015 * No impact or no significant impact expected on the consolidated financial statements. ** The impact on the consolidated financial statements is expected to result in additional disclosures or changes in presentations. *** The impact on the consolidated financial statements cannot yet be determined with sufficient reliability. d) Based on a revision of the accounting policy, following prior year amounts have been reclassified in the income statement to conform with current presentation relating to Wireless Solutions Division: CHFm 2012 Increase in cost of goods sold (3.4) Decrease in marketing and distribution 3.4 Increase in earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT) – 2.3 Use of judgments and estimates In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the r­ eported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. a) Judgments Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes: ■■ Note 6 – determination of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGU). ■■ Note 6 – internally generated intangible assets: whether the Group has met the criteria for recognition of internally generated development costs relating to the design and testing of new or improved products. Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 57 b) Main sources of uncertainty with regard to assumptions and estimates Information about uncertainties related to assumptions and estimates that have a risk of resulting in a significant adjustment in the year ending 31 December 2014 is included in the following notes: ■■ Note 6 – measurement of intangibles: key assumptions and estimates underlying recoverability of intangible assets from acquisitions initially capitalized at their fair value at acquisition date, including achievement of the forecasted cash flows as used in the initial business plan. ■■ Note 6 – goodwill impairment test: key assumptions and estimates underlying recoverable amounts, including the expected future cash flows from the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated and the discount rate for calculation of the present value of these cash flows. ■■ Note 14 – measurement of defined benefit obligations related to defined benefit plans: key actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, future salary or pension increases and average life expectancy. ■■ Notes 15 and 27 – recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of net future outflow of economic benefits related to onerous lease contracts, including cash flow forecasts, discount rates and likelihood of finding tenants for vacant space in the foreseeable future. ■■ Note 22 – recognition and measurement of the worldwide provision for income tax and recognition of deferred income tax assets: availability of qualified future taxable profit against which tax loss carry-forwards can be used. 2.4 Consolidation The consolidated financial statements cover Ascom Holding Ltd. and all subsidiaries over which the Group has control. Ascom controls a subsidiary when Ascom is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Profits or losses from disposal of subsidiaries are recorded in profit or loss. The list of the consolidated Group companies is included in note 32. Percentages of the Group’s interest in share capital correspond to percentages in voting rights held. Group companies are included in the consolidated financial statements in their entirety. The Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent ­liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 58 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2.5 Foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in Swiss francs (CHF), which is the Group’s presentation currency. All assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into the Group’s presentation currency at the exchange rates prevailing on 31 December. Income, expenses and cash flows of foreign entities are translated at average exchange rates for the year where this is considered an appropriate approximation of the applicable period rates. Exchange differences arising from the reconversion of the net investment in subsidiaries in foreign functional currencies are recorded as currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive income. Also taken to other comprehensive income are differences from the retrans­lation of borrowings that hedge such investments in foreign Group companies. Upon disposal of a foreign operation, accumulated currency translation adjustments are recognized in profit or loss. Foreign currency translation CHF ISO code Unit 31.12. Average 31.12. Average 2013 2013 2012 2012 Euro EUR 1 1.228 1.227 1.207 1.205 Pound sterling GBP 1 1.472 1.449 1.479 1.482 Swedish krona SEK 1 0.139 0.142 0.141 0.139 US dollar USD 1 0.890 0.923 0.915 0.933 Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the rate prevailing on the acquisition date. Transactions in foreign currencies are accounted for at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the conversion of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit or loss. Such balances are converted into the functional currency of the foreign entity at the exchange rates prevailing on 31 December. 2.6 Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allo­cating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). 2.7 Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 59 a) Sales of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods. Goods include hardware and software sold to customers in the two core divisions of the Group. Revenue is recorded based on the price specified in the sales contracts, net of the estimated volume discounts, sales tax or value added tax as well as credit notes for goods returned. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and returns. In certain cases, an assignment of rights for a non-refundable amount under a non-cancellable software license contract permits the customer to use those rights freely and Ascom has no remaining obligations to perform. In these cases, the license sale is recognized on delivery or when the general revenue recognition conditions for the sale of goods are also met. b) Rendering of services Revenue from fixed-price contracts for delivery of services is generally recognized in the period the services are provided, using a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Such revenue could also be recognized based on the services performed to date as a percentage of the total services to be performed, if more appropriate. If the selling price of a product or solution includes an identifiable amount of post-sale services (multi-element transactions), that amount is deferred and recognized as revenue over the period during which the service is performed. The basis for the allocation of the total revenue arising from multi-element transactions is the fair value of the separable components, which is normally the price regularly charged for such a component when sold separately. c) Construction contracts Revenue from construction contracts is determined based on the stage of completion using the percentage-of-completion method (PoC) if the stage of completion and expected outcome can be measured reliably. The respective calculation is based either on the units completed compared to the total number of contracted units, or if this approach is not applicable, on the costs incurred compared to the total costs to complete. If circumstances arise that may change the original estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion, estimates are revised. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs and are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known to the management. If it is probable that the contract costs will exceed the economic benefit, the potential loss is recognized in profit or loss regardless of the project progress. 2.8 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at purchase or manufacturing cost (i.e. historical cost) less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the items acquired. Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group holds the risks and rewards incident to ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the present value of the lease payments (see note 2.20). Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the lease period or, if shorter, the useful life of the asset. Land is valued at cost and is not depreciated. 60 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life as shown in the following table: Useful life in years Buildings 20–40 Installations and transport systems 7–10 Production equipment, measuring and test equipment, IT hardware, furniture 3–5 Tools and demo equipment 3 The assets’ residual value and useful life are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the balance sheet date. If there is any indication that an asset may be impaired an impairment test is carried out. Where the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is higher than the recoverable amount, these assets are impaired to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they incur. Items of property, plant and equipment are eliminated from the balance sheet from their date of disposal. All gains or losses arising from the disposal of such items are included in profit or loss. 2.9 Intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. The amortization charge is calculated on a straight-line basis over the period of its estimated useful ­economic life as shown in the following table: Useful life in years Licenses 3–5 Customer relations 10 Technology 7 Trademarks 5 Internally generated intangibles 3–5 Other 2–5 The assets’ residual value and useful life are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the balance sheet date. If there is any indication that an asset may be impaired an impairment test is carried out. Where the carrying amount of intangible assets is higher than the recoverable amount, these assets are impaired to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 61 Purchased goodwill (the excess of the purchase price over the acquisition-date fair value of the acquired equity interests) that has an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment at least once a year. Each cashgenerating unit or group of cash-generating units to which goodwill or intangible assets not yet available for use are allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which such assets are monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at operating segment level. Goodwill and intangible assets not ready to use are carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 2.10 Research and development costs All research costs are charged immediately to profit or loss. Costs incurred on development projects (relating to the design and testing of new or improved products) are recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria are fulfilled: ■■ It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale. ■■ Management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it. ■■ There is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset. ■■ It can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. ■■ Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available. ■■ The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably. The capitalized assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective product. Development costs that cannot be capitalized are charged to profit or loss in the period in which they occur. Property, plant and equipment used for research and development activities are capitalized in the same way as property, plant and equipment, and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful life. 2.11 Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are classified as “Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss”, “Loans and receivables” or “Financial assets available for sale”. Financial liabilities are classified as “Financial ­liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” or “Other financial liabilities at amortized cost”. a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are either held for trading purposes or designated as such. Financial assets held for trading are purchased with the intention of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in the price. Derivative financial instruments with positive replacement values are classified as at fair value through profit or loss. b) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. c) Financial assets available for sale Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial instruments that are either allocated to this category or do not belong to any other category. 62 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements d) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are either held for trading purposes or designated as such. Derivative financial instruments with negative replacement values and contingent consideration arrangements relating to acquisitions are assigned to the category at fair value through profit or loss. e) Other financial liabilities at amortized cost Other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost specifically include trade payables, borrowings and other liabilities. All financial assets are recorded initially at fair value including transaction costs, except for fi ­ nancial assets at fair value through profit or loss, for which such costs are immediately expensed. All purchases and sales are recognized on the trade date, i.e. on the day an agreement has been entered. After initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are charged to financial income or expenses in the appropriate reporting period. No hedge accounting is applied. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amount is tested for impairment if there are indications for a possible value reduction. Serious financial difficulties, insolvency proceedings of the debtor, financial reorganization and default or delinquency in payments (more than 90 days overdue) are considered as indicators. Following initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are recognized at fair value and changes in value are charged to other comprehensive income. Material or sustained price reductions are indicators of potential impairment. Price reductions of 20% or more are considered material. Sustained price reductions are price reductions that last for at least six months. If there is objective evidence that such a financial asset is impaired, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognized in profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognized in profit or loss. Received dividends on available-for-sale financial assets are recognized in profit or loss as part of financial income. Financial assets are derecognized when Ascom gives up its control over them, i.e. when the rights associated with them are sold or expired. At their initial recognition and subsequently, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value. The transaction costs directly identifiable to the purchase of these liabilities are immediately expensed. Valuation of the non-current portion of financial liabilities measured at amortized cost is subsequently carried out at amortized cost using the effective-interest method. In addition to actual interest payments, financial expenses include annual compound interests and pro rata transaction costs. 2.12 Inventories and work in progress Inventories are stated at the lower of purchase costs/manufacturing costs or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated selling costs. Manufacturing costs include direct material and production costs as well as material and production overheads. The costs are determined using the weighted average method. Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 63 Value adjustments are made for obsolete and slow-moving items. Construction contracts are recognized according to the stage of completion of the contract (percentage-of-completion method), and the respective effect is recognized in profit or loss. Provisions are made to cover all anticipated losses as soon as these are identified. 2.13 Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognized at their fair value and subsequently at amortized cost less any provision for doubtful debts. A provision for doubtful debts is recognized when it becomes obvious that the receivable is not fully realizable. The amount of the provision is the receivable recognized at amortized cost less the amount of the expected realization. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a provision account and the loss is recorded in marketing and distribution expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the provision account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against marketing and distribution expenses. 2.14 Other current assets Prepayments and accrued income are stated at nominal value. 2.15 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash, which is restricted for at least 12 months, is recognized as a financial asset. 2.16 Equity Registered shares are classified as equity. Own shares, expenses for equity-settled share-based payments, realized gains or losses from disposals of own shares as well as costs relating to capital increases and decreases are recorded in equity. Dividends are charged to equity in the period in which they are approved. 2.17 Borrowings Liabilities are stated as being current if they are settled within 12 months or if there is no unconditional right to extend the settlement to at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Initial recognition is at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Valuation is subsequently carried out at amortized cost using the effective-interest method. 2.18 Employee benefit obligations Various employee benefit plans exist within the Group, which are individually tailored to suit the local conditions in their respective countries. For defined contribution plans, the costs to be recognized for the reporting period are the agreed contributions of the employer. In the case of defined benefit plans, the costs to be recognized for the reporting period are determined by external actuaries using the projected-unit-credit method. The liabilities are backed by assets which are managed separately from the assets of the Group by autonomous employee benefit funds (funded employee benefit plans). By contrast, plans that do not have their own assets (unfunded employee benefit plans) are backed by a corresponding employee benefit obligation in the balance sheet. 64 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For defined benefit plans with separate funds, the defined benefit plan asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled. Any assets resulting from surpluses in defined benefit plans are limited to the value of the maximum future savings from reduced contributions. Remeasurement gains or losses result mainly from changes in actuarial assumptions, or from differences between actuarial assumptions and effective values (experience adjustments). Remeasurement gains or losses are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs are recognized immediately in profit or loss. Interest income or expenses relating to defined benefit plans are recognized as financial income or expenses. Other long-term employee benefits (e.g. service anniversary awards) are valued by the method described above and recognized in the balance sheet under employee benefit obligations, with any remeasurement gains or losses being recognized immediately in profit or loss. 2.19 Provisions Provisions are made when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If an outflow of resources to settle an obligation is not probable, a contingent liability is disclosed. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation, using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense. For costs that are expected to arise in connection with site closures, the disposal of companies or business units and restructuring, provisions are made at the time of the announcement of approved measures. For onerous contracts, provisions are provided if the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation exceed the economic benefit to be received. 2.20 Leases A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment, or series of payments, the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time. a) Lessee accounting Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred from the lessor to the lessee are classified as finance leases. The leased assets are carried at cost not higher than the minimal lease payments and depreciated along with other property, plant and equipment (see note 2.8). The corresponding leasing obligations are shown as liabilities. Leasing payments are allocated accordingly as either capital repayments or interest expenses. Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 65 b) Lessor accounting When assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of the net minimum lease payments is recognized as a receivable under financial assets. The difference between the gross receivable (gross investment in leases) and the present value of the net minimum lease payments is recognized as unearned interest income. Each lease installment is allocated between the receivable and interest income. When assets are leased out under an operating lease, the asset is included in the balance sheet based on the nature of the asset. Operating lease income is recognized in profit or loss over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis. 2.21 Share-based payments Selected members of Ascom’s senior management receive remuneration in the form of sharebased payment transactions pursuant to share matching and stock option plans, whereby employees render services as consideration for such equity instruments (equity-settled instruments). Employees which are residents of the USA are granted share appreciation rights, which can only be settled in cash (cash-settled instruments). For share matching plans, the costs of matching shares are measured initially at fair value at grant date, taking into consideration a deduction for the dividend yield as well as expected fluctuation of the plan participants. For stock option plans, the costs of options are measured initially at fair value at the grant date using a binomial model, further details of which are given in note 19. To the extent the vesting conditions in the plans are tied to market-conditions (such as the price of Ascom’s shares), they are taken into consideration in determining the fair value of the plans. If the plans contain non-market vesting conditions (such as the company’s EBITDA margin) Ascom revises its estimates of the number of instruments that are expected to vest based on the best available estimate of the non-market vesting conditions at the end of each reporting period up to and including the settlement date, with changes recognized as personnel expenses. For equity-settled instruments, the initial fair value is recognized over the vesting period under personnel expenses, together with a corresponding increase in other capital reserves in equity, adjusted to reflect actual versus expected levels of vesting. The dilutive effect of outstanding equitysettled instruments is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share (see note 23). The fair value of cash-settled instruments is recognized under personnel expenses over the ­period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability included under other provisions. The liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognized as personnel expenses. 2.22 Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale (i.e. qualifying asset) are capitalized as part of the cost of the respective asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. 66 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2.23 Income tax Income tax is recorded based on the period to which it properly relates. Deferred income tax is recorded in full using the liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise on temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for Group purposes and their related tax values. These temporary differences arise mainly from depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, revaluation of certain non-current assets, employee benefit obligations and tax loss carry-forwards, and, in the case of acquisitions, the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and their tax base. The tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date are used to determine deferred income tax. Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary deductible differences can be offset. Deferred income tax is recognized on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries. Exceptions are temporary differences for which the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset, if the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities, and the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which settle current income tax on a net basis. 2.24 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as completed sale within one year from the date of classification. The assets must be available for immediate sale in their present condition. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount at the date of their first recognition as held for sale and fair value less costs to sell. Such assets are no longer depreciated or amortized systematically. A possible impairment is included in profit or loss. A discontinued operation is a substantial component of the Group that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. 2.25 Definition of non-GAAP measures Earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT) as a subtotal includes all operating income and expenses before addition/deduction of financial income and expenses and income tax. Earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as a subtotal includes EBIT before deduction of depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment as well as amortization and impairment of intangible fixed assets.

Significant transactions and operational changes Outsourcing of production and repair at Ascom (Sweden) AB, Herrljunga At 2 September 2013, Fideltronik Scandinavia AB took over the Wireless Solutions factory of Ascom (Sweden) AB in Herrljunga and will further develop the manufacturing business, also with external customers. Fideltronik is a privately owned technology solutions company with its headquarters in Sucha Beskidzka, Poland. Currently, the Fideltronik Group employs 1,400 people at four sites in Poland. Fideltronik Scandinavia AB is an affiliate of the Fideltronik Group, which already has a solid customer base in the Nordic region. As part of the transaction 150 employees were transferred to Fideltronik. At the same time, Fideltronik and Ascom have entered into a strategic supply agreement to continue the existing production and repair of devices in Herrljunga. Ascom will continue to uphold a supply chain management function with about 20 employees. The purchase price consisted of a cash payment of CHF 0.4 million, which was paid at the closing date of the deal.

Segment information Operating segments reflect the Group’s management structure and the way financial information is regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision maker, defined as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Ascom’s operating and reportable segments are the two focused core divisions: Wireless Solutions and Network Testing, each homogenous units under the common umbrella of Mission-Critical Wireless Communication. Wireless Solutions provides wireless and customer-specific communication solutions, primarily for healthcare but also for retail, industrial, hotel and secure establishments. Network Testing offers expertise and solutions that enable wireless operators to expand and optimize network capacity and operation through testing, benchmarking, measurement and ongoing network analysis. All other activities do not qualify as operating segment and are summarized in “Other”. They comprise non-core activities related to businesses disposed of in prior years, mainly leasing and facility management of industrial properties under long-term sale-leaseback and service contracts ending in 2014 and 2015. Corporate includes Group activities that cannot be assigned directly to the operating segments, primarily corporate headquarters activities.

These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management, covering a four-year period. Cash flows beyond the four-year period are extrapolated using a 1.3% terminal value growth rate (previous year: 0.6%). The discount rate applied is based on a risk-free 10-year bond adjusted for risk. The following assumptions are based on experience, estimated sales volume, product mix and price growth for the next four years. Applied in 2013 2012 Revenue growth rate (CAGR) 1 – Wireless Solutions 6.7% 6.1% – Network Testing 8.4% 4.0% EBIT margin 1 – Wireless Solutions 14%–15% 13%–15% – Network Testing 6%–15% 4%–19% Pre-tax discount rate – Wireless Solutions 12.8% 11.7% – Network Testing 13.0% 11.1% 1 Based on approved four-year financial budgets, excluding foreign exchange impacts. Based on these calculations, there is no need for impairment. Regarding the sensitivity of changes to underlying assumptions used, Ascom Group showed that even a possible change in the pre-tax discount rate up to 15.3% (previous year: 16.5%) would still not result in an impairment of goodwill, neither in Wireless Solutions nor in Network Testing. Also a reduction in EBIT margin assumption of 2.5 percentage points (previous year: 8.0 percentage points) would not lead to an impairment of goodwill. Intangible assets from acquisition consist of customer relations of CHF 21.6 million (previous year: CHF 25.7 million), technology of CHF 20.1 million (previous year: CHF 26.6 million) and trademarks of CHF 1.0 million (previous year: CHF 2.7 million). Customer relations are capitalized using the excessearning method for valuation of the existing customers at acquisition date. Customer relations are amortized over their estimated useful life of 10 years, using the straight-line method. Technology and trademarks are capitalized using the royalty rate method for valuation. Technology is amortized over the estimated useful life of 7 years, and trademarks are amortized over the estimated useful life of­ 5 years, using the straight-line method. Amortization of intangible assets from acquisition of CHF 11.8 million (previous year: CHF 11.3 million), shown as separate line item in the income statement, exclusively contains amortization and impair­ment of intangible assets initially capitalized due to a purchase price allocation at acquisition date. Taking into account the function of expense method, this line item could be reassigned as follows: Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 73 CHF 5.5 million (previous year: CHF 5.3 million) to marketing and distribution, as well as CHF 6.3 million (previous year: CHF 6.0 million) to research and development. In the period under review, development costs in the amount of CHF 4.9 million (previous year: CHF 0.7 million) were capitalized under internally generated intangibles and research and development expenses in the amount of CHF 41.5 million (previous year: CHF 49.8 million) were charged to profit­ or loss. Other intangible assets include mainly software. During 2013, CHF 29.7 million of fully amortized other intangibles were removed following a functional reorganization within the Wireless Solutions Division. A reassessment of the remaining expected life and expected future economic benefits to be generated for all other classes of intangible assets did not lead to an impairment charge during the period under review (previous year: CHF 1.4 million). 7.

The credit facility includes financial covenants such as debt service ratio (calculated as the ratio of net debt and outstanding bank guarantees to EBITDA), net interest coverage (calculated as the ratio of interest expenses to EBITDA) and equity ratio (calculated as the ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets). The financial covenants are fully complied with. At 31 December 2013, non-current loans of CHF 16.0 million are denominated in USD (previous year: CHF 16.5 million) and CHF 45.1 million in CHF (previous year: CHF 87.0 million). The fair value of the borrowings is equal to the carrying amount. 14.

Defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans exist within the Group, covering employees and retirees, referred to as associates. In most cases the defined benefit plans are externally funded in entities which are legally separate from the Group. For certain Group companies, however, no independent plan assets exist for the pension and other post-employment benefit obligations of associates (primarily in the case of the German and Swedish companies). In these cases the related unfunded plan obligations are included in the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations of all major pension and other post-employment benefit plans are subject to annual valuation by qualified actuaries. The valuation methods used are described in note 2.18. Plan assets are recognized at fair value. The major plan of the Group is based in Switzerland, which represents more than 95% of the Group’s total defined benefit obligations for pension plans, whereof details are provided below. 78 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Certain features of the Swiss pension plan required by law preclude the plan from being categorized as a defined contribution plan. These factors include a minimum interest guarantee on retirement savings account balances, a pre-determined factor for converting the accumulated savings account balance into a pension annuity and embedded death and disability benefits. All benefits granted under the Swiss pension plan are vested. Swiss legislation prescribes that the employer has to contribute a fixed percentage of the associate’s insured salary to an external pension fund. Additional employer’s contributions may be required whenever the plan’s statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level. The associates also contribute to the plan. As required by Swiss law, the pension plan is run by a separate legal entity, governed by a Board of Trustees which consists of representatives nominated by the employers and by the active insured associates. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the plan design and the asset investment strategy. In Switzerland, all employees and pensioners of the Group are covered by the Swiss pension plan which is an independent self-governed multi-employer plan. Each employer participating in the fund has its own pension regulation, which defines the level of employee benefits to be provided and the related funding mechanism. As the Swiss pension plan does neither manage nor record the assets for each associate separately, the portion attributable to the associates of the Group is allocated based on the statutory pension obligation weighted with the plan’s statutory funding ratio. In case of the Group’s withdrawal from the plan, a partial settlement is performed, if the plan’s statutory funding ratio exceeds 105% or is below 95%. If the plans’ statutory funding ratio lies between 95% and 105%, partial settlement is not permitted by plan regulations and no surplus or deficit may be withdrawn from the plan in favor or disfavor of the associates of the Group. In case of the plan’s or an employer’s wind-up the Group has no right to any surplus of the plan which would be distributed to the associates of the plan. At 31 December 2013, the statutory funding ratio of the Swiss plan is estimated at 112%. Due to the application of the amended IAS 19, previous year amounts in the following tables are restated as disclosed in note 2.2. The amounts recognized in the balance sheet for defined benefit plans are as follows: CHFm Plan in Switzerland Other plans Total 31.12.2013 31.12.2012 31.12.2013 31.12.2012 31.12.2013 31.12.2012 Present value of funded plan obligations (768.5) (845.3) (19.8) (20.7) (788.3) (866.0) Fair value of plan assets 780.9 792.6 17.0 16.3 797.9 808.9 Funded status 12.4 (52.7) (2.8) (4.4) 9.6 (57.1) Present value of unfunded plan obligations – – (18.7) (23.5) (18.7) (23.5) Unrecognized plan assets (6.3) – (0.2) (0.2) (6.5) (0.2) Net asset/(liability) in the balance sheet 6.1 (52.7) (21.7) (28.1) (15.6) (80.8) Post-employment benefit assets 6.1 – – – 6.1 – Defined benefit plan liabilities – (52.7) (21.7) (28.1) (21.7) (80.8) The Swiss pension plan and one Swedish pension plan show a surplus which is only partially recognized on the basis that future economic benefits are not fully available to Ascom in the form of a reduction in future contributions or a cash refund.

Cash, as well as most of the shares, bonds and investment funds have a quoted market price in an active market. Property, qualifying insurance policies and other, which includes hedge fund and private equity investments usually do not have a quoted market price. The strategic allocation of assets of the different pension plans are determined with the objective of achieving an investment return which, together with the contributions paid by the affiliated companies and their associates, is sufficient to maintain reasonable control over the various funding risks of the plans. Based upon the market and economic environments, actual asset allocations may temporarily be permitted to deviate from policy targets.

This can result in substantial changes in the Group’s other comprehensive income, employee benefit obligations and post-employment benefit assets. The defined benefit obligation is significantly impacted by assumptions regarding the rate that is used to discount the actuarially determined post-employment benefit liability. This rate is based on yields of high quality corporate bonds in the country of the plan. Decreasing corporate bond yields decreases the discount rate, so that the defined benefit obligation increases and the funded status decreases. 82 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements In Switzerland an increase in the defined benefit obligation due to lower discount rates is slightly offset by lower future benefits expected to be paid on the associate’s savings account where the assumption on interest accrued changes in line with the discount rate. The impact of decreasing interest rates on a plan’s assets is more difficult to predict. A significant part of the plan assets is invested in bonds. Bond values usually rise when interest rates decrease and may therefore partially compensate for the decrease in the funded status. Furthermore, pension assets also include significant holdings of shares. Share prices tend to rise when interest rates decrease and therefore often counteract the negative impact of the rising defined benefit obligation on the funded status, although correlation of interest rates with equities is not as strong as with bonds, especially in the short term. The expected rate for pension increases significantly affects the defined benefit obligation of most plans. Such pension increases also decrease the funded status although there is no strong correlation between the value of the plan assets and pension/inflation increases. Assumptions regarding life expectancy significantly impact the defined benefit obligation. An increase in life expectancy increases the defined benefit obligation. There is no offsetting impact from the plan assets as no longevity bonds or swaps are held by the pension funds. Generational mortality tables are used where this data is available. The following table shows the sensitivity of the defined benefit pension obligation to the principal actuarial assumptions on an aggregated weighted average basis: Impact on defined benefit obligation in % Plan in Switzerland Other plans Total 31.12.2013 31.12.2013 31.12.2013 Increase in discount rate by 0.25% -2.3% -4.4% -2.4% Increase in future salary increases by 0.25% – 1.3% 0.1% Increase in future pension increases by 0.25% 2.4% 4.4% 2.5% Increase in life expectancy by 1 year 6.4% 3.6% 6.3% Decrease in discount rate by 0.25% 2.4% 4.7% 2.5% Decrease in future salary increases by 0.25% – -1.3% -0.1% Decrease in future pension increases by 0.25% -0.9% -4.1% -1.1% Decrease in life expectancy by 1 year -6.9% -3.6% -6.7% The expected employer contributions to defined benefit plans for the year ending 31 December 2014 are CHF 1.7 million. The expected benefit payments for the year ending 31 December 2014 are CHF 59.7 million and the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations amounts to­ 10.1 years. In the period under review, CHF 15.3 million are recognized as an expense for defined contribution plans (previous year: CHF 17.6 million).

The main goals were reducing the fixed cost base and enhancing customer focus by implementing a regional structure for the market-facing part of the division. A provision of CHF 12.4 million was initially recognized mainly covering costs related to termination of labor contracts across all functions and onerous license fee contracts. In the current period, CHF 4.6 million were paid out and CHF 0.1 million released. At the balance sheet date, no more provisions are left related to the 2012 ­restructuring program. At the balance sheet date, CHF 0.6 million restructuring provisions are left in connection with events recognized before 2012. Remaining balances are expected to be used within five years. Provisions for onerous contracts mainly include onerous lease contracts for a number of leased properties that are partially vacant. Ascom does not use the vacant space and the Group is experiencing difficulties in subletting the premises. The value of the provisions is based on net cash flows using forecasts with a time horizon to 2015 (date of the expiration of the onerous contracts) and by discounting the costs with a market-related discount rate of 6.0% (previous year: 6.0%). Provisions for warranties are project-related and are based on systematic extrapolation of historical payment patterns, which are verified and adjusted periodically. 84 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Other provisions comprise obligations arising from claims or disputes in connection with the operational business of Ascom companies (CHF 2.1 million), provisions for environmental costs relating to premises (CHF 2.3 million), provisions in relation to termination of labor contracts (CHF 1.1 million), and obligations arising from cash-settled share-based payments (CHF 0.7 million). The residual amount represents an accumulation of several minor events. In 2013, the addition of CHF 3.9 million relates to various individual cases, including a provision in relation to activities in the segment “Other”. After taking appropriate legal advice, the outcome of the legal claims will not give rise to any significant loss beyond the amounts provided at 31 December 2013. Cash outflows of other provisions are mainly expected within three years. In June 2013, a tax case was decided in favor of Ascom and the related provision of CHF 1.8 million was released in the line item income tax in the consolidated income statement. Remaining releases of CHF 1.8 million are related to many individual cases individually not material. 16.

Share-based PAYMENTS Ascom Share Matching Plan 2013 The Board of Directors has decided in its Board Meeting on 14 August 2013 to introduce a share matching plan for the Ascom senior management as a long-term incentive instead of options. With this new long-term incentive plan, the Board of Directors would like to encourage the management to become investors of Ascom in order to ensure an alignment with the interests of the long-term shareholders. The beneficiaries got the opportunity to buy company shares (or phantom shares in the case of residents of the USA) at market price as investment shares up to a certain amount. They have to keep the investment shares until 30 June 2016 in order to benefit from the plan. Beneficiaries get 35% of the number of their investment shares as matching shares after a three-year vesting period for­ free if they are still employed with Ascom at this point of time. As a performance-related part, the beneficiaries may get up to 65% of the number of their investment shares as matching shares in ­addition, provided that defined mid-term profitability targets will be achieved. As a maximum, the company will honor each investment share with one matching share. 13 members of the Ascom senior management decided to participate and they invested in total 61,720 investment shares. At 31 December 2013, matching shares equal to 58% of the investment shares are expected to vest, based on the best available estimate of the non-market vesting conditions. 86 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements In the following table the development of outstanding matching shares is presented: Number of matching shares 2013 Matching shares outstanding at 1.1. – Granted 61,720 Matching shares outstanding at 31.12. 61,720 2013 Remaining contractual life of the matching shares outstanding at 31.12.

At 31 December 2013, no liability is recognized for cash-settled phantom matching shares. Ascom Stock Option Plan 2012 In accordance with the resolution passed by the Board of Directors on 18 April 2012, a total of 486,000 options (equityas well as cash-settled options) were issued to 36 members of Ascom’s senior management on 18 April 2012. Each equity-settled option entitles the holder to purchase one share with a nominal value of CHF 0.50. Each cash-settled option entitles the holder to receive the difference between strike price and fair value at the exercise date in cash. The strike price is CHF 9.00. The options have a life of five years and are subject to an exercise hurdle (outperformance of the SMI index within a period of 12 months). The options are subject to a fixed vesting period of three years (one participant is entitled under the terms of his contract of employment to exercise one third of the ­options after one year and another third in each consecutive year). In 2013, 27,000 of the 480,000 options outstanding at the beginning of the year were exercised and the remaining 453,000 are still outstanding at 31 December 2013. Ascom Stock Option Plan 2011 In accordance with the resolution passed by the Board of Directors on 13 April 2011, a total of 491,000 options (equityas well as cash-settled options) were issued to 42 members of Ascom’s senior management on 13 April 2011. Each equity-settled option entitles the holder to purchase one share with a nominal value of CHF 0.50. Each cash-settled option entitles the holder to receive the difference between strike price and fair value at the exercise date in cash. The strike price is CHF 15.00. The options have a life of five years and are subject to two exercise hurdles (outperformance of the SMI index within a period of 12 months and a minimum share price of CHF 16.50 at the date of exercise). The options are subject to a fixed vesting period of three years (one participant is entitled under the terms of his contract of employment to exercise one third of the options after one year and another third in each consecutive year). The 476,000 options outstanding at the beginning of the year are still outstanding at 31 December 2013. Ascom Stock Option Plan 2010 In accordance with the resolution passed by the Board of Directors on 3 March 2010, a total of 512,000 options (equityas well as cash-settled options) were issued to 42 members of Ascom’s Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 87 senior management on 12 March 2010 (I) and on 10 May 2010 (II). Each equity-settled option entitles the holder to purchase one share with a nominal value of CHF 0.50. Each cash-settled option entitles the holder to receive the difference between strike price and fair value at the exercise date in cash. The strike price is CHF 11.40. The options have a life of four years and are subject both to an exercise hurdle (outperformance of the SMI index within a period of 12 months) and to a vesting period (one third of the options can be exercised after one year and another third in each consecutive year; after three years, all granted options can be exercised). In 2013, 219,000 of the 315,000 options outstanding at the beginning of the year were exercised, 21,000 were forfeited and the remaining 75,000 are still outstanding at 31 December 2013. Ascom Stock Option Plan 2009 In accordance with the resolution passed by the Board of Directors on 2 March 2009, a total of 490,200 options (equityas well as cash-settled options) were issued to 33 members of Ascom’s senior management on 2 March 2009 (I), on 1 June 2009 (II), on 12 June 2009 (III), on 29 June 2009 (IV), on 3 August 2009 (V) and on 12 August 2009 (VI). Each equity-settled option entitles the holder to purchase one share with a nominal value of CHF 0.50. Each cash-settled option entitles the holder to receive the difference between strike price and fair value at the exercise date in cash. The strike price is CHF 7.70. The options have a life of four years and are subject both to an exercise hurdle (outperformance of the SMI index within a period of 12 months) and to a vesting period (one third of the options can be exercised after one year and another third in each consecutive year; after three years, all granted options can be exercised). In 2013, 184,500 of the 192,500 options outstanding at the beginning of the year were exercised, the remaining 8,000 options expired on 1 March 2013. In the following table the development of outstanding options is presented: Number of Exercise Number of Exercise options price (CHF) 1 options price (CHF) 1 2013 2013 2012 2012 Options outstanding at 1.1. 1,463,500 11.30 1,202,330 12.11 Granted – – 486,000 9.00 Exercised (430,500) 9.66 (46,830) 7.70 Forfeited (21,000) 11.40 (112,000) 10.90 Expired (8,000) 7.70 (66,000) 12.50 Options outstanding at 31.12. 1,004,000 12.03 1,463,500 11.30 Options exercisable at 31.12. 120,333 12.66 425,167 9.91 2013 2012 Range of exercise prices of the options outstanding at 31.12.

Thereof CHF 0.2 million (previous year: CHF 0.1 million) represent the total intrinsic value of liabilities for which the employee’s right to cash had vested by the end of the period. The Enhanced American Model (binomial model) was used to determine the fair value of the options. The expected volatility was estimated using the historical long-term volatility, weighted with the implied volatility over a ten-year period to the issue date. The market-related exercise hurdle (market condition) was taken into account in calculating the fair value of the options.

The weighted average expected income tax rate of 25.2% (previous year: 23.2%) is calculated using the expected tax rates based on earnings before income tax of the individual Group companies in each jurisdiction. These rates vary significantly. The increase in the weighted average expected ­income tax rate is mainly due to the different contributions of individual Group companies to the total earnings before income tax of the Group.

Deferred income tax assets result from tax loss carry-forwards, tax credits as well as temporary valuation differences of assets and liabilities. They are recognized to the extent that realization through the future taxable profits is probable. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax relates to the same tax authority. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities pertain to the following line items of the balance sheet: CHFm 31.12.2013 31.12.2012 1 Property, plant and equipment 0.3 0.3 Intangible assets (10.1) (10.2) Financial assets (2.3) – Post-employment benefit assets (1.5) – Inventories and work in progress 1.5 1.8 Other current assets (0.4) (0.5) Employee benefit obligations 1.9 16.5 Other non-current liabilities 0.5 0.5 Current liabilities 1.4 1.0 Tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits 8.1 5.1 Total (0.6) 14.5 Recognized as deferred income tax assets 9.3 22.7 Recognized as deferred income tax liabilities (9.9) (8.2) 1 Previous year numbers are restated as disclosed in note 2.2.

At the balance sheet date, payables due to key management in the amount of CHF 0.7 million (previous year: CHF 0.4 million) existed. A legally independent fund provides for Swiss pensions (see note 14). In the reporting period, lease payments of CHF 0.2 million were disbursed to the Swiss pension fund for buildings occupied by the Group (previous year: CHF 0.2 million). Administrative and facility management services in the amount of CHF 0.4 million (previous year: CHF 0.6 million) were charged to the Swiss pension fund in the year under review. At the balance sheet date, a current receivable of CHF 4.6 million (previous year: CHF 5.1 million) was outstanding, subject to an interest yield of 1.5% (previous year: 1.5%). The Swiss pension fund did not own any Ascom shares in 2013 (previous year: nil). At 1 November 2013, Zürcher Kantonalbank divested its stake of the share capital of Ascom Holding Ltd. and ceased being a significant shareholder (previous year: 26.74%). For its hedging and cash management needs Ascom enters into foreign exchange contracts with Zürcher Kantonalbank. At the prior years balance sheet date, forward contracts with a counter value of CHF 13.0 million were open leading to a positive replacement value at 31 December 2012 of CHF 0.1 million. Throughout the period, foreign exchange deals with counter value of CHF 23.7 million (previous year: CHF 132.2 million) were settled. 25. Risk management As an international company, Ascom is exposed to a variety of financial and non-financial risks that are directly associated with the Group’s business operations. The Group’s risk exposure is addressed in accordance with the principle of risk limitation. Our overall risk management is an integral part of corporate management and the long-term corporate strategy, and it is correspondingly incorporated in the framework of our business processes and procedures. Ascom applies clearly defined management information and control systems to measure, monitor and control the risks to which it is exposed. Our management monitors the effectiveness and efficiency of our risk management activities and control systems at regular intervals and proposes adjustments as required. 25.1 Financial risk Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury and is ensured by the rele­ vant written principles and guidelines laid down by management and approved by the Board of Directors. The Group’s financial risk capacity and appetite for the various financial risk factors are defined 94 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the treasury strategy. The treasury strategy specifies the limit architecture and thereby defines the extent to which risk exposures will be hedged, and the instruments and time-frame for implementation. All strategy proposals in the treasury strategy are reviewed and require annual approval by the Audit Committee. Group Treasury is in charge of risk quantification and hereby measures financial risks by means of at-risk-methodologies, sensitivity analysis and stress testing. Group companies are responsible for the correct identification of the financial risk positions resulting from their business activities. Transactions without underlying core business and all forms of speculation are prohibited. Financial risk comprises liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk: a) Liquidity risk The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that sufficient financial resources are available at any point in time in order to be able to completely and timely fulfill all payment obligations of the Group. As part of an integral budgeting and forecasting process Group Treasury centrally monitors the planned liquidity position of the Group. Group Treasury compares the planned liquidity requirements with the available funds to detect shortages in a timely manner. In addition, a liquidity reserve is held at all times for unplanned occurrences and undrawn credit facilities are available for financial flexibility. The total of committed credit facilities can be found in note 13. An analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities at the balance sheet date of the relevant maturity groupings, based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date, is set out below. Contractual commitments in relation to financial guarantees are further disclosed in note 27. CHFm Carrying Cash flow 1 amount Within Between Later Total 12 months 1 and 5 years Borrowings 61.1 0.5 61.8 – 62.3 Trade payables 24.1 24.1 – – 24.1 Foreign exchange derivatives, outflow (37.0) (37.0) – – (37.0) Foreign exchange derivatives, inflow 37.3 37.3 – – 37.3 Other liabilities 3.9 2.4 1.5 – 3.9 Total at 31.12.2013 89.4 27.3 63.3 – 90.6 CHFm Carrying Cash flow 1 amount Within Between Later Total 12 months 1 and 5 years Borrowings 104.4 2.7 107.8 – 110.5 Trade payables 23.0 23.0 – – 23.0 Foreign exchange derivatives, outflow (20.8) (20.8) – – (20.8) Foreign exchange derivatives, inflow 21.1 21.1 – – 21.1 Other liabilities 6.4 5.0 1.4 – 6.4 Total at 31.12.2012 134.1 31.0 109.2 – 140.2 1 Numbers represent contractual undiscounted cash flows. Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 95 The cash flows shown above are subject to the following conditions and exceptions: ■■ All financial instruments are included for which payments were already contractually agreed on 31 December 2013 and 2012, respectively. Plan figures for future new liabilities are not included. ■■ Foreign currency amounts are translated at the exchange rates prevailing on 31 December. ■■ Variable interest payments for financial instruments are based on the last interest rate fixed on 31 December 2013 and 2012, respectively. ■■ Derivative financial instruments comprise derivatives with negative as well as positive replacement values. This takes into account that all derivative financial instruments, and not only those with a negative replacement value, could have influence on individual time frames. In 2012, Ascom granted a credit line of CHF 2.0 million to a buyer of a divested business (refer to note 27). Earliest possible pay-outs would result in cash outflows of CHF 1.5 million within 12 months and another CHF 0.5 million in 1 to 3 years. Local regulatory limitations related to the transfer of funds exist in a number of countries where Ascom operates, including Brazil, China, India and South Africa. As a consequence, these funds are not available within Group Treasury operations to meet short-term cash obligations outside the respective country. The above described funds are reported as cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet. At 31 December 2013, the balance under such limitations totals CHF 4.0 million (previous year: CHF 4.6 million). b) Market risk Market risk includes foreign currency risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and other price risk. Changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities can affect the Group’s asset and income situation. Apart from interest rate and foreign currency risk, the Group is not exposed to any other significant financial market risk. Foreign currency risk Due to the global nature of its activities, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange gains or losses arise from transactions as well as from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (mainly EUR, USD, SEK and GBP) if these are not the entity’s functional currency. Group Treasury is responsible for managing group-wide foreign exchange transaction risk on an ongoing basis. Regularly, analyses of past and expected future cash flows in foreign currencies are carried out which is the basis for hedging transactions. Respective forward contracts are stated at fair value. All hedging activities are carried out centrally by Group Treasury. The Group has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. These types of translation risk are currently not hedged. 96 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The currency related sensitivity of the Group at year end is shown in the following table: CHFm Reasonable Impact Impact Reasonable Impact Impact shift on net result on equity shift on net result on equity 31.12.2013 31.12.2013 31.12.2013 31.12.2012 31.12.2012 31.12.2012 EUR/CHF +/10% +/-0.2 +/-3.1 +/-15% +/-0.1 +/-5.0 GBP/CHF +/10% +/-0.1 +/-1.3 +/-15% +/-0.6 +/-2.8 SEK/CHF +/10% +/-1.0 +/-17.4 +/-15% +/-1.7 +/-28.8 USD/CHF +/10% +/-0.9 +/-2.4 +/-15% +/-1.0 +/-3.0 EUR/SEK +/10% +/-0.8 +/-0.8 +/-15% +/-1.2 +/-1.2 USD/SEK +/10% +/-1.2 +/-1.2 +/-15% +/-2.5 +/-2.5 The impact on net result is mainly due to foreign exchange gains and losses on cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and loans. The impact on equity additionally includes currency translation adjustments arising from the reconversion of the net investment in subsidiaries in foreign functional currencies. Interest rate risk Every interest position is subject to either a cash flow interest risk (associated with floating ­rate positions) or a market value risk (from fixed interest positions). The revolving multicurrency loan ­facility the Group entered into at 26 May 2011 (see note 13) is the main interest rate risk position in the balance sheet of Ascom. This risk is currently offset with cash surpluses. The Group is holding non-current assets and liabilities which are discounted to reflect the time value of money. All these positions are exposed to interest market value risk. However, neither individually nor in total are these positions material. Based on the interest-bearing assets and liabilities existent at 31 December 2013, a 50 base­ point higher (lower) level of the market interest rates would lead to a CHF 0.1 million (previous year: CHF 0.3 million) lower (higher) net result as well as equity on an annual basis. c) Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Credit risk may result in a financial loss if one party in a transaction is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations. It is Ascom’s objective to limit the impact of a default. Credit risk of financial counterparties is managed centrally by Group Treasury. For banks and financial institutions, only parties with a minimum Standard & Poor’s credit rating of “A” are accepted. Individual risk limits are set by the Board of Directors. The utilization of credit limits and development of credit ratings are regularly monitored. Each Group company is responsible for analyzing the credit risk for each of their new customer and managing the quality of their trade receivables on an ongoing basis. Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 97 The table below sets out the Group’s six major counterparties at the balance sheet date: CHFm Rating 1 Balance 31.12.2013 Counterparty Bank A A 15.1 Bank B A 8.1 Bank C AA4.0 Customer A B4.5 Customer B not rated 1.9 Customer C BBB 1.6 CHFm Rating 1 Balance 31.12.2012 Counterparty Bank A A 19.9 Bank B A 11.2 Bank C AA5.1 Customer A B5.3 Customer D not rated 5.0 Customer E A4.9 1 Long-term credit rating Standard & Poor’s. The number of customers and their geographical distribution reduces the risk of concentration. Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by financial institutions where funds are invested at the reporting date. The Group monitors at subsidiary level the credit worthiness of its key customers by using independent ratings (if available) and by taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. Each division has its own policy in place to manage the quality of trade receivables. The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired at the balance sheet date can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings, if available, or to historical information about counterparty default rates: CHFm “A” or better Without public Total rating 1 rating Financial assets 0.3 4.7 5.0 Cash and cash equivalents 58.2 – 58.2 Total at 31.12.2013 58.5 4.7 63.2 CHFm “A” or better Without public Total rating 1 rating Financial assets 0.4 6.2 6.6 Cash and cash equivalents 62.1 1.0 63.1 Total at 31.12.2012 62.5 7.2 69.7 1 Long-term credit rating Standard & Poor’s. 98 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements In 2012, Ascom granted a credit line of CHF 2.0 million to a buyer of a divested business (refer to note 27). No public rating is available for the borrower. 25.2 Capital risk The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for the shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimally leveraged capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Ascom aims to maintain a stable investment grade rating as perceived by bank partners and debt investors.

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). Level 3: Inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from a stock exchange. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, overthe-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Forward exchange contracts are allocated to this level. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. These inputs reflect the Group’s own assumptions about market pricing using the best internal and external information available. Investments in third parties for which the fair value of the market prices cannot be reliably determined, are allocated to this level and measured at cost less any impairment. Other liabilities allocated to this level consist of the remaining contingent consideration arrangement relating to the prior year acquisition of the technology-related business of Veelong Corp. and requires the Group to pay in cash between 35% and 45% of the revenue realized in relation to the acquired technology in the years until 2014. At closing date, the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of CHF 2.8 million is based on a discount rate of 6% and assumed annual revenues between USD 12.4 million and USD 13.7 million. The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date: CHFm Based on quoted Based on other Based on unobTotal prices in active observable inputs servable inputs markets (level 1) (level 2) (level 3) Available for sale financial assets Investments in third parties – – 0.9 0.9 Balance at 31.12.2013 – – 0.9 0.9 Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Derivative financial instruments, net – 0.3 – 0.3 Other liabilities – – (2.8) (2.8) Balance at 31.12.2013 – 0.3 (2.8) (2.5) Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 101 CHFm Based on quoted Based on other Based on unobTotal prices in active observable inputs servable inputs markets (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Available for sale financial assets Investments in third parties – – 0.9 0.9 Balance at 31.12.2012 – – 0.9 0.9 Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Derivative financial instruments, net – 0.3 – 0.3 Other liabilities – – (5.1) (5.1) Balance at 31.12.2012 – 0.3 (5.1) (4.8) 26.3 Derivative financial instruments Foreign currencies are purchased and forward contracts are entered into at Group level as an economic hedge against foreign currency risk. The open contracts comprise the following forward contracts in various currencies: CHFm 31.12.2013 31.12.2012 Contract volume 37.3 20.8 Positive fair value 0.3 0.4 Negative fair value – 0.1 Breakdown by currency (CHFm) 31.12.2013 31.12.2012 EUR/SEK 37.3 – EUR/CHF – 8.5 SEK/CHF – 6.1 USD/CHF – 6.2 Total 37.3 20.8 The Group periodically reassesses its net foreign currency risk, evaluating the extent of natural foreign currency hedging achieved through ongoing development of Ascom’s businesses. Accordingly, Group Treasury may propose to adapt the Group’s hedging approach. In 2013, the Group changed its approach to hedging foreign currency risk. Based on Ascom’s current global supply chain structure, the most significant foreign currency net risk exposure relates to the EUR/SEK exchange rate. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is included under current financial assets or other current liabilities. The changes in value are recognized in profit or loss under financial income or expenses. 102 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 27. Commitments and Contingencies a) Lease commitments – Group as lessee The future minimum payments under non-cancellable lease obligations fall due as follows: CHFm Finance leases Operating leases 31.12.2013 31.12.2012 31.12.2013 31.12.2012 Within 12 months – – 14.3 17.7 Between 1 and 5 years – – 20.6 21.1 Later – – 5.0 2.6 Total – – 39.9 41.4 Significant leasing agreements exist with regard to the sale and lease back of properties in Berne and Hombrechtikon (Switzerland) which are included in “Other” of the segment reporting (see note 4). These agreements expire in 2014 and 2015, respectively. b) Lease commitments – Group as lessor The future minimum lease receivables under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: CHFm Operating leases 31.12.2013 31.12.2012 Within 12 months 8.4 8.6 Between 1 and 5 years 1.1 5.7 Later – – Total 9.5 14.3 c) Loan commitments In 2012, Ascom granted a credit line in the amount of CHF 2.0 million to a buyer of a business unit of the former Security Communication Division. Under this commitment portions of CHF 0.5 million can be drawn quarterly. The full amount is due for repayment until 31 July 2016. d) Contingencies As an internationally active company, Ascom is exposed to a multitude of legal risks in the normal course of business. These relate particularly to risks associated with product liability, patent law, tax law, and competition law. Some Group companies are involved in legal proceedings. The results of currently pending and threatened law suits cannot be predicted with certainty which means that decisions of courts or other authorities can cause expenses that have significant consequences for the business and on future results. Wherever a reliable estimate of the financial consequences of a past event is possible and an outflow of resources is more likely than not, a corresponding provision is made. At 31 December 2013, contingent liabilities amount to CHF 59.4 million (previous year: CHF 56.4 mil­lion), mainly related to parent guarantees. There is no indication that these liabilities will lead to fulfillment payments. Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 103 The Company has indemnified certain purchasers of divested businesses for potential claims arising from the operations of the divested businesses. There are currently no ongoing proceedings in relation to indemnification. In connection with the prior year divestment of the Defense business, the purchaser has agreed to an earn-out payment dependent on future success in the international business during the years 2012 till 2014, capped at an amount of CHF 8.3 million. At closing date, no receivable is recognized for this contingent consideration (previous year: nil). 28. Pledged assets At 31 December 2013, property, plant and equipment with a total carrying amount of CHF 0.7 mil­ lion (previous year: CHF 0.6 million) and financial assets with a total carrying amount of CHF 0.2 million (previous year: CHF 0.2 million) were pledged. 29. Events after the Balance Sheet date Acquisition of Integrated Wireless At 2 January 2014, Ascom acquired all the shares of GTM Resources Pty. Ltd., which holds all the shares of Integrated Wireless Pty. Ltd. and Integrated Wireless Software Pty. Ltd. Integrated Wireless has its domicile in Sydney with additional offices in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Auckland. All­ 62 employees were taken over at their existing locations. Integrated Wireless is a specialist provider of wireless communication systems for Australia and New Zealand. Integrated Wireless was until now also the exclusive distributor of Ascom Wireless products for Australia and New Zealand. This acquisition gives Ascom Wireless Solutions direct access to the Australian and New Zealand markets and creates opportunities to combine the business activities of Integrated Wireless with its existing portfolio. Moreover, Ascom gains a foothold to further develop its position in the Asia Pacific market. In addition to the initial closing purchase price of AUD 14.0 million, Ascom has agreed to an earnout payment of up to AUD 1.1 million, payable one year after closing, dependent on the achievement of agreed revenue and profitability targets. The total potential amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under this contingent consideration arrangement is between nil and AUD 1.1 million, whereas the fair value of the contingent consideration amounts to AUD 1.1 million, based on assumed revenue and profitability for the earn-out period. The fair value of the acquired asset and liabilities disclosed below is provisional pending receipt of the final valuation. 104 Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CHFm Book value Fair value Fair value adjustments Property, plant and equipment 0.2 – 0.2 Goodwill – 6.3 6.3 Deferred income tax assets – 2.0 2.0 Intangible assets from acquisition 0.6 – 0.6 Non-current assets 0.8 8.3 9.1 Inventories and work in progress 0.6 – 0.6 Trade receivables and other current assets 2.2 – 2.2 Financial assets 2.0 – 2.0 Cash and cash equivalents 2.1 – 2.1 Current assets 6.9 – 6.9 Total assets 7.7 8.3 16.0 Current provisions 0.1 – 0.1 Deferred income tax liabilities – 0.6 0.6 Trade payables and other current liabilities 3.3 – 3.3 Total liabilities 3.4 0.6 4.0 Total purchase price 12.0 Offset by Cash 11.1 Contingent consideration 0.9 The goodwill of CHF 6.3 million arising from the acquisition is attributable to the acquired workforce, additional growth potential in the Asia Pacific markets and other product portfolio synergies. The goodwill recognized is not deductible for income tax purposes. The gross contractual amount of the acquired trade receivables amounted to CHF 2.2 million of which CHF 0.1 million were not expected to be collectible. Therefore, these trade receivables were recorded with a fair value of CHF 2.1 million. At the date of acquisition, the Group held trade receivables with Integrated Wireless in the amount of CHF 0.2 million from sales performed in the year under review. These are included as trade payables in the table disclosed above. Acquisition-related costs of CHF 0.1 million were recorded in administration expenses of the reporting period under review. Since the balance sheet date, no further events have occurred that have an influence on the 2013 consolidated financial statements. 30. Proposal of the Board of Directors For the year ended 31 December 2013, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting on 1 April 2014, a dividend of CHF 0.40 per share entitled to dividends. This represents a total distribution up to CHF 14.4 million. In 2013, a total distribution of share premium of CHF 12.2 million was made to the shareholders of Ascom Holding Ltd.

Board of Directors’ Responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of Swiss law. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards as well as the International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 give a true and fair view of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Group Report of the statutory auditors on the consolidated financial statements 107 Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence. In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we c­onfirm that an internal control system exists which has been designed for the preparation of ­consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Total remuneration for each member consists of a basic salary and a variable component (performancerelated part). The basic salary and variable component are paid in cash. The variable salary component (performance-related part) is linked solely to the achievement of measurable quantitative targets (incoming orders, net revenue, EBIT, net working capital) which are defined at the beginning of each year. The CEO receives a variable salary component of 50% of his basic salary on fully achieving all targets. The other members of the Executive Board receive a variable salary component of 40% of their basic salary on fully achieving all defined targets. If the targets set within the respective member’s area of responsibility as well as the Group targets are exceeded a sum no more than twice the target variable salary component may be paid. The Board of Directors has decided to introduce a share matching plan as a long-term incentive instead of options. The members of the Executive Board as beneficiaries get the opportunity to buy company shares at market price as investment shares up to a certain amount as determined by the Board of Directors. They have to keep the investment shares for a period of three years in order to benefit from the plan. Beneficiaries get 35% of the number of their investments shares as matching shares after a three-year vesting period for free if they are still employed with Ascom at this point of time. As a performance-related part, the beneficiaries may get up to 65% of the number of their investment shares as matching shares in addition, provided that defined mid-term profitability targets will be achieved. As a maximum, the company will honor each investment share with one matching share. In 2013, the CEO invested 30,000 investment shares and the other three Members of the Executive Board in total invested 4,000 investment shares. The fair value of a matching share at grant amounts to CHF 11.34 (weighted average fair value). Thus the fair value of all Matching Shares allocated to the Executive Board amounts to CHF 385,424, whereof an amount of CHF 340,080 for the matching shares allocated to the CEO.

Board of Directors’ Responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 comply with Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation. Ascom Financial Statements 2013 Holding report of the statutory auditors on the financial statements 119 Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence. In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.
