They are also adopting FA (factory automation) integration to enhance work efficiency and safety. FA devices have linked to each other with a variety of network standards, but now the world is moving toward connecting FA devices by industrial Ethernet which is based on Ethernet, the global network standard. Linking numerous control devices by IT allows entire factories to operate efficiently while saving energy and labor. The Renesas Electronics Group was among the first to support various communication protocols for industrial Ethernet. We offer the R-IN SoC, which saves energy while enabling communication speeds that are 5 to 10 times faster than before. Through the R-IN Consortium, a group that we announced in September 2014, we will collaborate with our partner companies to build R-IN platform solutions by offering a range of software and development environments. By developing R-IN for use all the way up to the highest levels of the factory, we will contribute to greater efficiency and savings of energy and labor in factories around FA slave device the world with this de facto solution for all FA devices.
