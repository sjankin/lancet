To keep and develop this position, we are convinced it is a prerequisite to conduct our business in a responsible manner – “Doing Business the Right Way”. Sustainability for materials, products, and operations To create and offer sustainable products, ScanCom control all materials and products for meeting all relevant regulation in our markets. For the wood used in our products, ScanCom was a pioneer in using FSC certified hardwood, and we today use 100 % FSC hardwood with an Stig Maasbøl Group CEO objective to reach 100 % FSC for teak as well. ScanCom International A/S At the same time we continuously optimize our operation activities to reduce consumption of energy and resources, increase recycling, and reduce emissions. Related to this our main operation site in Vietnam received ISO 14001 certificate in spring 2013. Social accountability It is important for ScanCom to assure respect for human and labor rights. Part of this is: BSCI monitoring of all operations in Vietnam since 2008, SA 8000 certificates for the operations in Brazil (2012) and Indonesia (2001), and having our own Code of Conduct. OHSAS 18001 certification in near future together with planned SA 8000 certificate for the Vietnamese operations will reinforce this policy. Being signatory to the UN Global Compact together with BSCI monitoring and certifications not only sends a clear signal to all our stakeholders we are committed to do business the right way, it also supports our activities to meet our global customers’ CSR requirements. Requirements to contract manufacturers and key suppliers Built into the BSCI CoC, SA 8000, and UN Global Compact are requirements for improving CSR level in the supply chain. ScanCom actively practice this by performing CSR audits at the key suppliers and contract manufacturers and requesting them signing our Code of Conduct, and we set targets for continuous improvement on that policy. UN Global Compact commitment I am very pleased that ScanCom even under recent years’ difficult conditions have been able to remain true to our basic CSR values and make progress or maintain same high level on all of the 10 UN Global Compact principles. For the following seasons ScanCom will continue and further develop commitment to UN Global Compact – “Doing Business the Right Way” will remain part of our DNA. 5 ScanCom International A/S Legal Structure Finance figures Below are the financial figures for ScanCom International A/S over the past six seasons. The decrease in financial activity is a result of economical problems in key markets as well as the bad weather in Europe throughout the summer of 2012. 6 ScanCom International A/S Performance indicators and objectives For season 12/13, ScanCom selected the following performance indicators and set key objectives.

This approach has allowed us and our partners achieve very positive BSCI ratings results with improvement year-on-year. ScanCom provides a financial support scheme that covers audit fee for partner’s factories, which are committed to working towards improving social compliance. All our partners have achieved no failures on crucial requirements such as no child labour, no violation of legal wage and other national applicable law and regulation. Supplier audits ScanCom is continually improving the CSR levels of our suppliers by asking them to comply with the ScanCom code of conduct. By end of the season 12/13, 85 % of our suppliers had signed ScanCom’s code of conduct and 29 % had received CSR audit by ScanCom. Child labor During the season ScanCom maintained regular internal audits of contract manufacturers together with customer audits and BSCI audits. For season 12/13, we can report that no cases of child labor were found. Forced labor Similar to the above, no cases of forced labor were found for the season 12/13. Labor ScanCom is committed to supporting labor rights and protection in the workplace. This includes abolishing child labor completely, the elimination of forced labor, freedom of association, and the elimination of any form of discrimination.

For season 12/13 and onwards, on-site contractors working for ScanCom must follow regulation on employment contracts and other occupational regulation, i.e. payment of insurance. 11 ScanCom International A/S Age Headcount turnover in SS Grand Total 2012-2013 18-25 26-35 36-45 46-55 56-60 Male Official worker 358 332 77 6 773 Seasonal worker 1068 620 130 5 1823 Staff 7 13 1 21 Management (from team 2 47 17 2 68 leader up) Total-Male 1435 1012 224 13 1 2685 Female Official worker 102 104 27 5 1 239 Seasonal worker 159 111 33 2 305 Staff 4 11 3 18 Management (from team 3 3 6 leader up) Total-Female 265 229 66 7 1 568 Grand Total 1701 1240 290 20 2 3253 Furniture manufacturing in Vietnam is an industry that traditionally has high labor turnover. ScanCom suffered with high labor turnover for several years, but has actively addressed the issue by creating incentives for people to stay. Employee turnover rate was reduced from 87 % in season 10/11 to 69 % in season 11/12. For season 12/13 the level has increased to that of season 10/11. However, this is still a significant improvement compared to the previous years. The list of labor contract terms show we have made strong progress in building a core team with indefinite contracts. This team is supplemented by a seasonal workforce who is needed during high season. Terms in seasonal contracts are complying with local regulation. Overtime Before 2010/11, high labor turnover, together with the seasonal nature of the outdoor furniture industry had increased overtime rates for ScanCom. However, by improved planning and reduced labor turnover rate this is now under control and complies with Vietnamese regulation. The number of overtime hours per head was reduced from 147 to 71 from season 10/11 to season 11/12, but increased again in 12/13 to 91 hours – a variation we consider acceptable. 12 ScanCom International A/S Discrimination ScanCom does not tolerate any kind of employment discrimination of the workforce in reference to gender, age, or origin.

The median age for the Vietnamese population is 29 years old.

The difference per employment category above relates to the different levels of employment. 13 ScanCom International A/S Health and safety Health and safety data SS 11/12 SS 12/13 Average headcount for accident calculation 3,417 3780 Sick leaves days recorded 9,580 9,214 Total cases of accidents with lost working days 49 53 Total lost days due to accident 738 500 Lost days, all types (incl. maternity leave) 14,375 11,777 Accident frequency rate per 100 employees 1.43 1.4 Severity rate per 100 employees 21.3 3.8 Fire cases detected 6 4 Total hours general labor safety training 95 14,688 Total onsite HSE talks, headcount 2,964 3,514 The ScanCom safety performance in 2013 improved considerably compared to 2012. Incidents causing lost working days remained at same level as the previous season, but number of lost days due to accident and severity rate of accidents was significantly improved. We assign the improvements to increased focus on safety training, machine safety, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). In season 12/13 a project on improving safety on all machines was instigated. The need for PPE was evaluated and defined for all working areas and made clear through signs on the shop floors. New and improved health and safety related training programs were initiated as detailed in the training overview later in this report. In season 12/13, ScanCom established health and safety committees in the factories with representatives from management and workers, representing all workers in each factory. The committees meet quarterly to continually improve health and safety procedures and all decisions are recorded. Wages and benefits In Vietnam the legal minimum wage has over the past few years been adjusted annually, but ScanCom always compensated employees at a higher level, applying principles for actual living costs instead of minimum wage. In season 12/13, the lowest wage level for workers was 38 % higher than the legal minimum. Furthermore, ScanCom’s policy for health and social insurance is 2.5% higher than the legal requirement. Extra support is given to employees with children. 14 ScanCom International A/S Environment ScanCom is committed to protecting the environment and natural resources. We are improving operational efficiency and sustainability to benefit the environment year-on-year. We develop and maintain environmental awareness through training, setting and measuring environmental objectives, and continuously educating our employees. We protect the environment by minimizing waste, reducing emissions, reducing consumption of resources and energy, and by controlling restricted substances in all materials used. ISO 14001 certification of environment management system ScanCom Vietnam received ISO 14001 certificate in spring 2013. We use the ISO 14001 as basis for our control of environmental impact, reporting and continuous improvements. Materials used, recycling, and waste Data In relation to the ISO 14001 certification of ScanCom Vietnam, the methods for registration of use of resources and disposal of waste were significantly improved over the past seasons. The data for season 12/13 is to be considered correct even though there are major differences between the three seasons. Raw material consumption reflects the lower production in a year with lower activity level. Environment related figures SS 10/11 SS 11/12 SS 12/13 Total energy consumption in production, GWh 19.2 16.8 14.8 Water consumption, m³ 92,000 90,000 222,000 Industrial waste required report by law, tons 105 148 3,525 Industrial waste water required report by law, m³ 76,000 84,000 178,000 Total sawn timber consumption in production, m³ 38,000 35,000 32,000 Total aluminum billet consumption in production, tons 3,300 3,000 2,900 Total plastic resin consumption in production, tons 1,720 1,450 1,710 Total saw dust being recycled, tons 291 595 1,740 Total aluminum waste being recycled, tons 24 22 22 Total poly rattan waste being recycled, tons 11 20 20 Water In the reported seasons, ScanCom used water partly from its own wells and the figures given for 10/11 and 11/12 only cover water from public supply. The use of our own wells will continue until local authorities can provide sufficient water amounts to ScanCom. In 12/13 our own underground water was 13,000 m³ out of the total of 222,000 m³. Improved measurement of water consumption was implemented in 2012 and we are confident our registration is correct. 15 ScanCom International A/S Recycling ScanCom continuously increase the recycling of materials. New methods for recycling, mainly in wood plastic composite furniture, are the reasons for the general increase in recycling. ScanCom’s developments in recycling are being continued such as the recycling of all internal plastic process waste. This is expected to make a big impact in the coming season. Furthermore, we plan a partial substitution of virgin plastic materials with recycled plastics from the market. Waste During the certification process for ISO 14001, the waste handling and registration was improved and the data now presented are reliable and traceable. Waste type Quantity (kg) Disposal method Domestic waste 71,530 Collected by contractor Hazardous waste 289,901 Collected and treated by authorized contractors Recyclable waste 3,163,569 Sold to contractors ScanCom cleans waste water to the required level before discharging to the centralized waste water treatment plant of Song Than Industrial Park. The waste water is checked and reports made quarterly. Reliable data is not available for previous years.

ScanCom continually collected all requirements from regulation in our addressable markets as well as from customers to set up our own List of Restricted Substances for monitoring. In general, we built this up following the “lowest common denominator “principle. All new materials developed are tested for compliance, and annual random testing is done for existing materials to assure continued compliance. ScanCom’s cost of assuring chemical compliance in season 12/13 was US$35,000. Investments related to Environment and Health and Safety In season 10/11, ScanCom began upgrading all facilities to comply with Vietnamese regulation as well as customers’ specific requirements. The related investments for season 12/13 are given below: Investment Amount (USD) Fire fighting 105,000 Waste water treatment system 75,000 Secondary containment 40,000 Ammonia smoking 15,000 CO reduction for boilers 19,000 Air cooler system 21,000 Total 275,000 FSC wood ScanCom was one of the pioneers for using FSC eucalyptus hardwood for outdoor furniture and is today the world’s biggest manufacturer of FSC hardwood garden furniture. All eucalyptus hardwood used by ScanCom Vietnam today is 100% FSC – this includes our contract manufacturers. ScanCom Indonesia is now FSC certified and is working towards having all production made by FSC teak, in line with market availability. However, all teak used by ScanCom Indonesia is of verified legal origin. 17 ScanCom International A/S Anti-corruption ScanCom does not accept or tolerate any form of corruption or bribery within our business. A key element in implementing this principle has been establishing and communicating the ScanCom Code of Conduct. Since 2010, ScanCom has maintained the Code of Conduct with annual updates. The code in detail, guides employees, suppliers and partners on ScanCom’s principles for acceptable behavior related to e.g. respect for human rights, anti-corruption. The Code of Conduct is communicated to all employees and all new employees receive training in the content. Furthermore, the Code of Conduct is communicated to all subcontractors, contract manufacturers, and suppliers – and they are requested to sign the code. Training activities for all ScanCom employees in contents of Code of Conduct were increased in season 12/13. Furthermore, in season 12/13 85 subcontractor employees working on ScanCom’s premises received one hour training in ScanCom’s Code of Conduct. Training activities In connection with our increased focus on CSR, ScanCom, in season 12/13 implemented further training of employees to support the understanding and practicing of social compliance and good environmental behavior, including extended training in ScanCom Code of Conduct and human rights.
