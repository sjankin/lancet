SFGL also has a Grievance and Conflict Resolution Policy in place. It is intended as a tool by which an employee or consultant may formally raise a grievance, regarding any condition of their employment and be heard by management of the company. The grievance procedure is a three-stage procedure and allows for timely and effective resolution of the matter. 1.3 Measurement of outcomes SFGL management and HR team actively review any grievances they receive and ensure quick resolution.

A key aspect of the implementation of this policy is the education and leadership of our personnel on the importance of compliance with ABC legislation. SFGL undertakes periodic training of its personnel on what constitutes an illegal act and provides them with the tools and support to avoid taking part in any illegal activities. SFGL reviews its policies on an annual basis to ensure compliance. 4.2 Implementation SFGL has developed an in-house training and is implementing a programme to train the Team Leaders on Anti-Corruption. SFGL aims to roll out the training course to 100% of the company’s consultants in the next twelve months. SFGL records the training undertaken with regard to the ABC Programme. Training is undertaken through a range of formats including formal briefings, semi-formal meetings (Lunch and Learn), and briefing or policy documents. Training targets are monitored. In addition to that, the company has a CARP (Corrective Action Report Process) which collects near miss and non-conformities from across the company including bribery and corruption. Where illegal acts are reported the appropriate policy is reviewed. 4.3 Measurement of outcomes SFGL considers the success of our ABC programme through both general awareness among the personnel and through the results of the programme.
