Statement of the Chairman In 2013, world economy recovered in great difficulties. Domestic economy faced great downturn pressure, global shipping market was in depression continuously and enterprises faced heavy operation pressure. In face of severe market situations, COSCO Group spared all its efforts to create benefits, tried to reduce the costs and increase the benefits by all means, continuously carried out management elevation activity, adjusted the structure and transformed the method in an in-depth manner and achieved new progresses in related work. Year 2013 is the beginning year for acting in the spirits conveyed at the 18th National Congress of the CPC in a comprehensive manner, an important year for implementation of the 12th Five-year Development Planning, and also a key year for COSCO Group to cope with the challenges, elevate the benefits and realize rejuvenation in difficulty. In 2013, COSCO Group insisted on studying and implementing the spirits conveyed at the 18th National Congress of the CPC, the Central Economic Work Conference and the Conference of the Responsible Persons of Central Enterprises under the guidance of scientific outlook of development, focused on the target of ―developing a powerful and excellent enterprise, being world‘s first-tier enterprise‖, seized the overall direction of ―seeking for progress in stability‖, adopted the ―reform, innovation, adjustment and transformation‖ as the main task, voluntarily integrated the sustainability concept into strategic planning and production and operation process of the enterprises, and exerted great efforts to promote continuous growth of terminal, logistics, shipbuilding & ship-repairing and related industries with the deficit-reduction and benefit increase of shipping business as the main direction. In the past year, COSCO Group focused its efforts on controlling the business source and seizing the key sectors, and continuously enhanced the cost control. With respect to fuel management and control, we reduced the expenditure by USD22.76 million through hedging, bidding and batch procurement measures, playing an important role in improving the operating benefits of shipping business. With respect to low-speed navigation, we saved USD387 million of fuel cost accumulatively in the whole year through measures such as scientific dispatch and management, reasonable selection of shipping lines and technical reform of ships. With respect to centralized procurement of parts and components and management of ship-building and ship-repairing business, we have reduced the spare part procurement value by 12.23% year-on-year. With respect to procurement, business outsourcing and supplier management, we have improved the procurement and supplier management systems continuously, laying a solid foundation for systematic cost control. In the past year, COSCO Group constantly enhanced the risk control building to effectively prevent against important risks. With respect to control of operating risks, we insisted on the principles of ―steady operation and ship leasing based on cargos‖, reasonably controlled the proportion of selfowned ships and leased ships to effectively control the risks. With respect to control of investment risk, we timely adjusted the investment structure based on market changes, properly reduced the 6 / 250 investment scale, implemented special risk assessment mechanism for key investment projects, and enhanced the tracking and responsibility-investigation of projects. We strictly controlled the nonproductive investment projects. With respect to control of fiscal risk, we strengthened the centralized management and control of capitals, and did a better job in capital coordination and arrangement to ensure stable production and operation of the group. In the past year, COSCO Group adjusted the structure and arrangement in an in-depth manner, and actively promoted the transformation and upgrade of the enterprise. With respect to adjustment of fleet structure adjustment, we have accelerated the dismantling of old ships and building of new ships to promote younger and professional development of fleet structure, effective reduce the unit cost, realized planned development of carrying capacity and further elevate the competitiveness of fleet. With respect to adjustment of customer structure, we have enhanced the management of strategic and high-value customers, actively developed basic customers and high-quality small and medium-sized customers, so as to optimize the customer structure constantly. With respect to adjustment of cargo source structure and shipping lines, we actively explored the potentials of new emerging markets, exerted great efforts expand domestic and overseas cargo sources and constructed overseas outlets continuously to improve our global marketing network. In the past year, COSCO Group promoted the management elevation activity in an in-depth manner and kept close contacts with advanced enterprises to find the ideas to solve the issues. With respect to the weaknesses and bottlenecks found in management process, we determined the working focuses and made breakthroughs in key sectors. Some significant issues which have influence and constrain development of the enterprises in long period of time have been solved primarily. In 2014, the beginning year for deepening of reform and the key year for completion of 12th Five-year Planning, international economic situations will still be complicated and full of uncertainties. The protectionism of various types will become obvious, potential pressure of inflation and capital bubble will increase, the world economy has entered from rapid development period into in-depth transformation and adjustment period, and economic growth will have many uncertainties. Growth speed of new emerging economic entities will slow down significantly. Chinese economy shows the obvious trend to transform from high-speed growth into medium-speed growth, and the imbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable issues for economic development of China are still significant. In the meantime, the surplus carrying capacity of global shipping market hasn‘t been improved. The pressure of trunk lines, large ships and competition are still huge. With the continuous depression of shipping market, competition structure will also change, the risk factors of the industry will increase and enterprises face greater and greater difficulties to realize continuous and stable growth. However, in the historical process to deepen the reform, the in-depth adjustment of world economy brings opportunities for use to better bring into fully play our advantages and occupy the controlling point in future development. The reform bonus released at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the CPC, and the construction of the ―Silk Road Economic Belt‖ and the ―21st Century Maritime Silk Road will promote stable growth of Chinese economy. Shipping industry‘s elevation to a national strategic industry, release of the policies to dismantle old ships and build new ships, and potential logistics business opportunities brought by transfer of surplus production capacity in domestic market will create favorable conditions for development of the group in the future. COSCO Group will accelerate the ―reform, innovation, adjustment and transformation‖, tightly uphold the main tasks of ―increasing the revenue, controlling the risks, realizing lean management and ensuring 7 / 250 safety”, focused on container shipping and bulk cargo transport businesses, promote benefit increase of shipping business, constantly improved the profit contribution of terminal, logistics, shipbuilding and ship-repairing and related industries, and try to promote continuous, stable and healthy development of the enterprise. COSCO Group will continue to practice the Blueprint for Sustainability Leadership, support the fulfillment of wider Millennium Development Goal of the United Nations, actively cooperated with related parties to cope with key global challenges such as climate change and poverty, and explore the sustainable development mode suitable to the enterprise.

Analysis on Primary Influences, Risks, Opportunities and Measures of Sustainability COSCO Group has insisted on using the scientific development outlook in all kinds of work, systematically analyzed the primary influences, risks, opportunities and measures of sustainability with SWOT analytical method of lean six-sigma theory, correctly identified the external opportunities and threats as well as internal advantages and disadvantages, and formulated related strategies correspondingly, so as to fulfill sustainability of COSCO Group. 13 / 250 (I) Analysis on Primary Influences of Sustainability SWOT analysis on sustainability strategies 14 / 250 (II) Analysis on Main Risks and Opportunities of Sustainability Uncertain, changing and competing environment faced by COSCO Group externally, including imbalanced and uncertain economic and trade development of the world and China; transformation of economic structure of China; periodicity and fluctuation of shipping logistics industries; drastic fluctuation of global and domestic capital and financial markets as well as resources and energy prices, in External particular oil price; increased safety and environmental protection perspective costs upon coming of non-traditional safe and low-carbon economic era; moreover, leading transnational companies are currently promoting the systematic and strategic transformation into a global Long-term company, the competition between transnational companies is risks upgrading from hardware to software. If these risks can‘t be solved properly, they will bring great risks and challenges to COSCO Group‘s sustainability. In general, the biggest risk or challenge to COSCO Group‘s sustainability is how to establish a stable and sustainable operation mode that will not substantially fluctuate with the drastic fluctuation of Internal the market. That is to say, COSCO Group should focus its efforts to perspective build such an operation mode, with which, its operating results will be more stable than its rivals under great market fluctuation, instead of fluctuating greatly. Strategic risks: In face of great uncertainties of global economy, Since the second half of 2008, global countries worldwide enhanced the financial and economic crisis originated adjustment of economic, trade, from the American sub-prime mortgage monetary, taxation and other macrocrisis had resulted in sharp decline of economic policies. COSCO Group international shipping market to the valley. has single industrial chain, poor In 2009, international shipping market industrial structure supplementation continues to develop at a low level. ability, weak anti-risk ability, and Although the international shipping market increased risks in formulation, started to recover in 2010, it still featured selection, implementation and control Short-term instability, great fluctuation and imbalance. of strategies, and needs to further risks In 2011, the imbalances of supplies and enhance its strategic risk management demands, cost and income, market entities, and control strategies. interest demands and profit distribution Market risks. For a certain period of appeared in the market. In 2012, macrotime at present and in the future, economic situation declined and the although the market started to imbalanced market development was not recover, the issues such as rapidly improved. These resulted in fluctuated increased carrying capacity, slowed performance and imbalanced development increase of demands, and imbalanced of enterprises in shipping and related supplies of carrying capacity of industries including COSCO Group. shipping market will be obvious in short term, and the market recovery 15 / 250 will be unstable with great fluctuations. Efforts should be made to cultivate new revenue source and profit growth points. Operational risks. The imbalances of supplies and demands, cost and income, market entities, interest demands and profit distribution has resulted in operational difficulty as well as unstable and unbalanced operational benefits. Global network needs to be improved further. Management risks. In the time when the market and operational benefits are unstable and unbalanced, enterprises will face higher requirements on enhancing the management and reducing the costs. The risks of safety and stability will be enlarged. Efforts should be made to further improve the overseas operation and management mechanism. Financial risks. The cash flow has increased. If the market risks, operational risks and management risks can not be dealt with actively and correctly, financial risks may appear. Moreover, fluctuation of international financial market may increase the financial risks. Efforts should be made to further improve the ability to prevent and control operational risks in capital market. Legal risks. The market is in depression, and the competition becomes fiercer and fiercer. Legal risks brought by the contracts increase. Failure to implement or effectively implement legal risk controlling measures will result in losses of enterprises. Ineffective control of legal risks will bring serious results, and even irrecoverable losses. 16 / 250 Social responsibility risks. Corporate social responsibility has developed into a global campaign. In transnational operation, in particular, in overseas market, the social responsibility-related sectors such as labor relation, human right and environmental protection bring greater and greater risks to M&A, daily operation and reputation of enterprises.

General Information of Shipping Industry Shipping industry as the pillar industry of national economy has special features that are significantly different with other industries. Therefore, judgment and comment on sustainability and profitability of shipping industry have its unique characteristics. Shipping industry is a kind of derivative demand, and is generated with the economic development of various countries to serve for international trade. Development of shipping industry is closely related to changes of global economy and trade, and is affected by periodic factors such as global economy and international financial system. Therefore, shipping industry is one of the industries with most obvious periodic fluctuation. The fluctuation of freight becomes a normal status. Periodical fluctuation will bring various operating and financial risks to shipping companies. Each financial crisis will cause depression of shipping industry. This results in the special operating mode of ―making up the deficits during low season with the profits at peak season‖. Therefore, the appraisal on profit-making situations of shipping industry shall not be based on losses or profits in recent two to three years, but the accumulative profits or average profits in a certain period of time. Each economic crisis will bring bankruptcy and liquidation of many shipping companies. Shipping companies who exist in the economic crisis can enjoy growth in the next cycle. Therefore, appraisal on sustainability of shipping companies shall be based on existence ability of enterprises in low valley and fast profitmaking ability of enterprises in recovery period. Since the financial crisis, development trend of container shipping market has greatly deviated from the traditional rules of peak and low seasons. There are no references for development trends of freight rate in same period of 2013. This is mainly caused by frequent change of competition and cooperation relationships of liner market under the overall situations that supplies exceed demands 21 / 250 continuously, which results in sharp weakening of influences of supplying and demanding rules in low and peak seasons, decreased precipitations of supplying and demanding parties on growth of cargo volume in peak season, and increase the difficulties to increase the freight rate. Under the situations of continuous depression of the industry, more and more container shipping companies enhance the cooperation and unite together to overcome the difficulties, thus elevating the concentration degree of container shipping market significantly. COSCO Group takes the elevation of management level, improvement of business structure, pursuit of service quality and improvement of ship technology as the important competition measures of container shipping company. Cargo-owning ship-owner has become an important force of dry and bulk shipping market, and has brought profound influence to market competition structure. Large cargo-owners gain bargaining power with the monopolized operation in upper and lower streams previously, so as to ensure lease of ships at low price and keep the flexibility of freight cost control. In order to compete with cargoowning ship-owners, shipping companies took various means to optimize traditional operating mode. Firstly, they invest and build a large batch of energy-conservative and high-efficient new ships at the low level of shipping market, upgrade fleet structure and expand carrying capacity; Secondly, they form or expand scale of joint venture, enhance their own competitiveness with scale advantages, win long-term contracts through joint operation, and reduce market risks correspondingly; Thirdly, it pay more attention to service quality, break through service homogeneity, avoid ―price war‖, and offer personalized and whole-processed solutions. After the financial crisis, global economic development and shipping market face extremely severe market environment. Shipping companies and their correlated parties shall have a full understanding on periodic fluctuation of economy, and formulate corresponding policies to cope with such fluctuation. Otherwise, they may lose existence opportunities in the fluctuation. Currently, COSCO Group is paying close attention to and conducting in-depth research on new features and new changes of these periodic fluctuations, so as to master the new rules of periodic change, seize new opportunities for market fluctuation and further elevate the benefit-creating ability and sustainability of COSCO Group‘s fleet. In 2013, COSCO Group, through business collaboration, realized cost reduction and benefit increase, optimized international resource allocation and integration, controlled whole-processed transportation chain, competed for new competition advantages and ensured the demands for maximization of overall benefits of the group. Shipping, logistics, terminal, ship-building and ship-repairing, cargo agency and container leasing companies have close business cooperation, and are key sectors for construction of complete main business industrial chain. Related enterprises provide high-efficient and high-quality services by enhancing internal collaboration, thus developing world‘s first-tier transportation service and making active contributions to promotion of sustainability strategies.

III. General Information of Supply Chain and Industrial Structure of COSCO Group Shipping logistics business operated by COSCO Group is in the middle of the entire industrial chain, and is the part with lowest profits in entire value chain. In upstream, it depends on basic supplying and manufacturing industries, and in downstream, it subordinates to trade and financial services. Profits of the industry are squeezed by the two ends. In order to avoid the risk of strong periodicity of shipping logistics business, world‘s first-tier shipping and logistics companies all developed upstream and downstream to form core competitiveness through advantage supplementation. Through investment or development of non-periodic industries or industries with reverse period with shipping logistics industry as the supplementary industries of shipping logistics business, they can ―offset‖ the periodicity risk of shipping logistics business. In particular, upstream industries can provide decisive chips for existence and profitability of shipping logistics business when the industry is in low valley. 24 / 250 Currently, COSCO Group has become a transnational corporate group with shipping, logistics & terminal and shipbuilding/ship-repairing as the main businesses, and has ranked among Global Fortune 500 list stably. Composition of businesses of the group is as follows: Supply chain of shipping companies is dominated by third party logistics provider, which refers to provider other than producer and seller who can provide logistics planning, lgositics solution and detailed logistics operation service (including warehouse, transportation, cargo freighting, logistics processing, distirubtion, information and other value-added services) for custoemrs by integrating social resources. The third party logistics provider can make use of advanced logistics technologies, market infomration and network to integrate various resources to optimize the supply chain. Due to limitations of related policies of the country, COSCO Group has been dedicated to shipping logistics and related industries. The logistics supply chains formed therefore are belonging to same cycle and there are no supplementary industries to offset the losses of shipping logistics business in 25 / 250 low valley. Therefore, COSCO Group is lack of effective measure for healthy and sustainable development to keep its stable operation upon the coming of low valley. In the meantime, COSCO Group shoulders the duties of promoting economic development and social stability. When it faces great difficulties in operation, the group insists on not making any staff to be unemployed and tries to ensure the employment right of staff and social stability. However, the group had paid the costs significantly higher than international counterparts.

COSCO Group continued to promote the ―Lean Management‖, strengthened quota and benchmarking management, improved cost control work from the origin and all sectors, continuously improved cost control ability and reduced various costs. Main measures taken are as follows: (1) Continue to enhance fuel cost control. Under the circumstance that carrying volume of COSCON increased by 8.5% year-on-year, its fuel consumption volume dropped by 6.2% year-on-year. This, in addition with the decrease of average single-unit fuel price of 8.9% had resulted in decrease of fuel cost by 14.6% year-on-year.

In 2013, selfoperated ships completed 483 voyages, saving 41,058 tons of oils and RMB161.34 million. (2) Continue to promote reduction of rents of dry and bulk carriers with high rents. By the end of December, operating cost of dry and bulk shipping business and related business totaled RMB15.702 billion, down RMB4.892 billion or 23.8% year-on-year. Of which, carrying capacity of leased ships further reduce, and ship leasing fee reduced by RMB3.081 billion or 37.4% year-on-year. (3) Continue to enhance control of port charges, container management fees and cargo handling fees. 118 / 250 (4) Strictly control the administrative fee, elevate management efficiency and release the measures to enhance cost reduction in meeting, business trip, reception, office and business vehicle sectors. (5) Continue to promote the lean management work focusing on cost reduction and benefit increase, and strengthen the control of key costs in operation and management process. Since 2009, COSCO Pacific started to research and promote the oil-to-electricity of tire crane. Till now, it has completed the oil-to-electricity reform of 124 sets of tire cranes.

In particular, the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference held in December 2009 brought focuses of the world to environmental and economic issues caused by climate changes. With the opening of carbon emission trading, the influences of climate changes on financial performance of the company become more and more significant. For COSCO Group, climate changes brought following safety risks and financial risks: 1. Risks Caused by Climate Changes Climate changes affected the typhoon occurrence period, moving path and intensity changes. These, in addition with increase of weathers with poor visibility, threaten shipping safety of COSCO Group's ships in various sea areas. Increase of typhoons and bad weathers with poor visibility need more labors and materials from the bank to guide safe shipping of vessels. In the meantime, as anti-typhoons and bad visibility affect the arrangements in and out the port, increase shipping time of vessels and non-productive berthing time at port. 2. Financial Influences of Climate Changes In order to prevent and fight against the possible damages caused by typhoons, COSCO Group input more human resources and materials into the organization establishment, shore-based shifts, command and coordination. Typhoons also led to the increase in the sailing time and distance as well as the delay in the schedules. In 2013, a total of 101 tropical cyclones (including TD) were generated worldwide, an increase of nine compared with 2012, affecting 653 ships (times) of CSOCO Group. 121 / 250 Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Number of ships (times) 105 87 86 92 101 affected Number of ships affected 342 433 459 918 653 (number of ships) Restricted by poor visibility, many ports have taken entry and departure prohibition measures protect ship security during berthing at the port. This resulted in increase of non-productive berthing time of COSCO Group‘s fleet at Hong Kong. In order to alleviate global environmental pressure, reduce emissions and energy consumption, and in advocacy of Chinese government‘s appeal for energy conservation and emission reduction, COSCO Group has invested material and financial resources to enhance R&D of emission reduction technologies and improvement of related equipment and facilities, so as to save energy consumption and reduce emissions. It also invested capitals to establish management systems of operational quality, environment and occupational health & safety, and opened safety and environment web and occupational health & safety web. Moreover, it has established effective training mechanism to carry out science popularization and operational skill trainings, so as to enhance the environment consciousness and management ability of employees and increase additional costs. COSCO Group has tried to reduce emissions by applying electronic control device cylinder petrol supply system, installing homogeneous fuel equipment on vessel engines, installing waterway guide cover, airscrew clipper, Shipaneng oil-saving devices on vessels. In order to cope with climate changes, the international community had revised the international conventions, resulting in increase of management costs and equipment expenses of COSCO Group. In 2013, COSCO Group adopted 312,900 tons of low-Sulphur fuel with the sulphur content of 1.5%m/m in a bid to satisfy the requirements of MARPOL Appendix VI and reduce emission of ships. This resulted in increase of costs by RMB98.7 million. In the five years since 2009, cost of the group had increased by RMB234.07 million due to the use of low-sulphur fuel. Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 1.5%m/m fuel consumption 79,474 110,475 106,278 187,900 312,922 volume (ton) Cost increased for using 2,848 1,818 2,944 5,927 9,870 1.5%m/m fuel (RMB10,000) COSCO Group has responded to preventative measures taken by port countries and coastal countries to deal with climate changes, resulting in increase of its operating costs of shipping companies under the group. For instance, COSCO Group has actively responded to the Green Ship Flag advocated by California in US, requiring ships to reduce the speed in advance before sailing into or departing from the ports. COSCO Group's ships sail into and depart from ports at a speed lower than 12 nautical miles per hour and use the light oil-based fuels with less sulfur content instead of heavy oil in a bid to 122 / 250 alleviate air pollution. As the price of the light oil is 1.8 times of heavy oil, COSCO Group has to pay more when buying light oil-based fuels for ships. (III) Fixed Welfare Plans Retirement life guarantee is a main factor considered by all employees when selecting their jobs. Proper arrangement of retirement pension can solve the worries of employees and is favorable for attracting and keeping stable employees' team. COSCO Group has attached great importance to fixed welfare plans for employees and paid endowment insurances for every employee according to policies of the State and local employees. COSCO Group calculated the budget for endowment insurances by 20% of total salaries of employees and paid the endowment insurances monthly to the social insurance institutes of the country. By the end of 2013, total number of retired employees of the group reached 33,465. (Please see the table below) Number of newly retired Number of retired employees as of Year employees in the year the year end 2009 1,977 28,074 2010 2,046 29,855 2011 1,752 31,392 2012 1,062 32,454 2013 1,011 33,465 COSCO Group has set up a special institute, dispatched special personnel and allocated special expenditure to provide services for retired employees, ensuring that all retired employees can enjoy pensions when they are old and can have medical treatment when they are ill. In key and important holidays, the group will distribute holiday subsidies to retired employees, allowing them to enjoy the humanistic cares of COSCO Group. (IV) Key Financial Supports Provided by the Government 1. In recent years, COSCON insisted on carrying out energy conservation and emission reduction work in terms of personnel, technology and management. It had spared no efforts to promote lowspeed navigation of ships and energy efficiency management of ships, controlling the total fuel consumption and per unit fuel consumption of the company at a relatively low level. These efforts enabled the company to gain better economic benefits, and social benefits, and received good comments from the government and all circles of the society. In 2013, the COSCON‘s Project to Introduce BOT technology and Realize Technical Energy Conservation of Ships received RMB1.7 million of special fund from the Ministry of Finance. 2.

The results of the assessments are directly related to the company‘s performance, so that raw materials can be conserved. Meanwhile, the group required vessels to enhance the service life of vessel auxiliary materials and binding backers, reduce the use of timber and improve replacement rate. COSCON affiliated to COSCO Group promoted reutilization of spare parts and materials actively. By conducting refurbishment and reparation of main engine cylinder heads and exhaust valves, it had saved RMB15.8929 million of reparation fees of main engine cylinder heads and RMB14.0611 million of exhaust valve reparation fees in 2013. (4) Paper Saving COSCO Group has insisted on office automation and used digital management platform in document and material processing, so as to realize paperless office. Moreover, it also promoted paperless office among its subsidiaries to reduce the paper consumption as much as possible. COSCO (H.K.) Shipping set up waste paper recycling box at all departments, requiring every staff to reduce, re-use and recycle papers voluntarily. It was required that documents that need to be printed shall be checked carefully to avoid re-printing due to errors. When ensuring the basic demands, efforts should be made to reduce the header, footer and edge distance, as well as distance between paragraphs and lines as well as font size, trying to make each paper to have more contents. Besides formal document, internal documents shall be printed on two sides. Papers which are printed in one side shall be used again. (5) Utilization of Renewable Materials COSCO Group has focused on resource recycling and comprehensive utilization, and appealed all its subsidiaries to enhance their efforts in energy conservation and waste recycling. All subsidiaries of COSCO Group carried out lean management project actively to reduce utilization of raw materials. By increasing the life span of supplementary materials and underlays, ships of the group had saved the timber consumption and improved the substitution rate. Management department of the company set 138 / 250 up quota for consumption of spare parts and materials, carried out evaluation on a regular basis and connected the evaluation results with the performance, so as to save the raw materials. 2. Energy As a signatory of the Declaration on Climate Change, COSCO Group actively carried out and implemented the Energy Conservation Laws of the People‘s Republic of China, the Decision on Enhancing Energy conservation Work of the State Council, the Detailed Rules for Traffic Industry to Implement Energy Conservation Laws, the Notice on Implementation Plans and Methods on Statistics, Supervision and Evaluation on Energy conservation and Emission Reduction approved and circulated by the State Council, the Notice on Environmental Protection of the State during 11th Five-year Period issued and printed by the State Council, and SASAC‘s Notice on Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Targets of COSCO group during the 12th Five-year Plan Period, and fulfilled the concretion and feasibility of energy conservation and emission reduction work. Ocean shipping industry is powered by fuel, a non-renewable energy. COSCO Group owns and controls more than 700 vessels, which consumed over 4.825 million tons of fuels and 39,000 tons of lubricant oils in 2013. In order to protect the environment, save energy and reduce emissions, COSCO Group has made great efforts on fuel conservation work in recent years and has achieved significant results. Although total energy consumption volume has increased with its business growth, the specific power consumption was kept or reduced. Total Energy Consumption of COSCO Group in Recent Years Indicator/Year 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Total energy consumption (10,000 tons of standard 628.58 660.01 672.80 688.62 753.75 779.3 707.3 coals) (1) Direct Energy Consumption Direct Energy Consumption of COSCO Group in Recent Years Indicator/Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Specific fuel consumption (kg/kt· sea 4.39 4.12 4.07 3.96 3.84 mile) Total fuel consumption 456 460 513.6 531.1 482.5 of ships (ton) Total gasoline consumption of 78,905 2,505 2,567 3,163 2,950 vehicles (ton) Total diesel consumption of motor 19,877 8,496 8,980 16,845 16,747 diesel (ton) 139 / 250 (2) Measures to Reduce Direct Energy Consumption and Results COSCO Group carried out energy conservation and emission reduction work actively. Based on development trends of energy-conservation and environmental-protection technologies of international community and domestic market, it has timely digested and absorbed advanced technologies. In 2013, it took a series of effective measures for reduction of direct energy consumption and achieved certain results: By implementing the technical reform to plug one booster of the main engine (TC-CUT), COSCON successfully improved the working efficiency of other boosters while lowering the operating speed of main engine, so as to increase the fuel utilization efficiency of main engine and improve the lowburden operating situations of main engine. In the meantime, the scavenging pressure of main engine was greatly improved due to elevation of efficiency of booster. When the main engine is operating at low load, auxiliary blowing machine will stop operation. This reduces the load and oil consumption of auxiliary engine, and save five to seven tons each day. By the end of 2013, the technology was applied at all 38 5,100-TEU ships. All 25 leased 7,000-TEU ships also completed the technical reform except for COSCO Excellence and COSCO Fortune, which will complete the task in early next year. Since implementation of the technical reform in the middle of last year till the end of last year, the project has saved 11,000 tons of fuel. Oil-to-electricity of tire crane. COSCO Pacific continued to promote oil-to-electricity of tire crane, implemented reform of tire crane among five controlling terminal companies, completed oil-toelectricity reform of 124 tire cranes on the basis of 140 tire cranes, increasing the proportion of electric tire crane using clean energy of COSCO Pacific‘s controlling terminals to 86.42%. Before completion of oil-to-electricity of tire crane, the oil consumption per TEU is 1.13L. After completion of the reform, the power consumption of per TEU is 1.77kwh. The average operating cost per TEU dropped by 79.38%, saving over RMB70 million of direct costs and reducing 13,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. (a) Energy Conservation Management To fulfill its commitment to the society in performing Global Compact, COSCO Group actively builds up an environmental and ocean protection, resource saving and environment-friendly enterprises and promotes its sustainability, so as to reduce oil consumption and emission reduction, fulfills its energy conservation and emission reduction responsibility and mobilize all its staff. COSFREXM‘s management measure of ―giving up steering wheel and selecting bicycle for energy conservation and 140 / 250 environmental protection, COSCO Shanghai‘s management measure of ―scientific management and reduction of oil injection rate of ALPHA‖, COSCON Computing Center‘s ―power consumption and electricity saving of air conditions‖ and COSCO Tianjin International Freight‘s management measure of ―transforming procurement method of office equipment and reducing office cost effectively‖ appraised as Top 10 Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Casts of Shanghai and Excellent Case for Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction. (b) Fuel Consumption and Conservation In 2013, total fuel consumption of COSCO Group reached 4.825 million tons and the per-unit fuel consumption of ships was 3.84kg/kt· sea mile, down 3.03% year-on-year. Ship fuel consumption is an important energy consumption of COSCO Group. Therefore, insisting on fuel conservation of ships has significant meaning. All subsidiaries of COSCO Group have applied lean management approach to manage the fuel consumption of ships, timely calculated ship fuel consumption, and guided ships to reduce fuel consumption. It assigned specific persons in charge of fuel consumption work, and listed the fuel consumption in the performance evaluation indicators. They have formulated relatively complete management measures and developed ship fuel consumption information management platform. By analyzing fuel consumption in ship operation process with the information system, it traced and compared the fuel and lubricant oil consumptions of various ships, so as to set up the quota for fuel and lubricant consumption of ships in a scientific and reasonable manner and effective control the fuel consumption of ships. They have started from source control, targets segmentation, enhancement of maintenance, dynamic tracing, process control and key focuses to control all sectors consuming fuels through management approaches, thus fulfilling the management of energy conservation. In 2013, all subsidiaries of COSCO Group designed and implemented slow-steaming programs, adjusted the schedule of vessels on some routes, and reduced vessel speed step by step, so as to save fuel consumption to the maximum extents. In the meantime, all companies enhanced the daily fuel management to further reduce the fuel consumption. Fuel Consumption per 1000 Ton· Sea Mile by Ship Types Indicator/Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Container ship 8.44 7.3 7.29 6.70 6.04 Kg/1000ton· sea mile Bulk ship 2.54 2.47 2.48 2.39 2.29 Kg/1000ton· sea mile Oil carrier 2.11 2.07 2.15 1.96 1.78 Kg/1000ton· sea mile General cargo ship 6.46 5.63 5.61 5.60 5.17 Kg/1000ton· sea mile (c) Lubricant Oil Consumption and Conservation The management of lubricant oil constituted a very important part in COSCO Group‘s energy conservation and emission reduction efforts. The group enhanced regular examination of lubricating 141 / 250 oil on its vessels and ensured that all performance indicators meet the requirements. For cases where the indicators exceeded the standards, the reasons would be analyzed and corrective measures such as changing oil, adding new oil and enhancing separation adopted. Strictly managing the quota of lubricating oil, the group enhanced its examination on lubricating oil consumption based on the actual situation during each voyage. In 2013, COSCO Group consumed a total of 36,000 tons of lubricant oils, a reduction of 5,430 tons compared with 2012. The cylinder oil injection rate of main engines of ships which have installed ALPHA oil injector and sliding spool-styled oil header has been reduced to 0.8k/kwh. Engines of ships can save a great deal of cylinder oil (lubricant oil) during operation at such oil injection rate. In only half a year, the combination of total oil consumption volume of entire fleet can save over RMB100 million of cost for COSCON. In 2013, China COSCO Bulk invested over RMB21 million to install electronic cylinder oil injector for 21 ships. In addition to 26 new ships which already have the cylinder oil injectors, a total of 47 ships have been equipped with electronic cylinder oil injector, accounting for 21.8% of the total. Tests proved that the energy conservation effect reached as high as 30%. Take Panamax carrier for instance, the cylinder oil consumption volume of ships without the electronic cylinder oil injector is 260L. After installation of the electronic cylinder oil injector, the cylinder oil consumption volume can be reduced by 78L. If calculated by 280 days of navigation each year, over 21,840 liters of cylinder oil can be saved each year, saving over RMB270,000 each year if calculated by the oil price of RMB12.4/L. Total Lubricant Oil Consumption of COSCO Group in Recent Years Indicator/Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Total consumption of 44,908.4 49,571.46 47,425.47 44,482.38 39,052.38 lubricant oils (ton) (d) Ship Energy Conservation and Oil Saving Technologies COSCO Group tightly focused on development trends of international ship energy-saving and environmental-protection technologies, and input a great deal of human resources, materials and financial supports to research, digest and absorb internationally leading management methods and energy-saving and environmental-protection technologies and to promote advanced and matured energy-conservation products and environmental-protection technologies. In the meantime, it continuously developed energy-conservation and environmental-protection application technologies for its system, and implemented energy conservation from many aspects with a focus on energy conservation through technologies and management. Tianjinhe Liner for daily internal trade route of COSCON is a 5,089-TEU container ship. Under the leadership of the leaders of the ship, all seafarers insisted on scientific management and lean management, focused on details and actively explored the effective measures for on-time, safety, energy conservation and emission reduction of ships with the implementation of Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans as the focus, and in combination with practical situations of ships, 142 / 250 shipping lines and ports. In the first seven months of 2013, Tianjinhe Liner saved a total of 1,120 tons of fuel. China COSCO Bulk promoted the application of hydropower energy-conservation devices actively, installed wake compensating tube on 15 ships including Zhongxinghai Liner, and installed highefficient helm on 35 ships (of which, six are under construction), realizing energy conservation effects through technical measures. The Ship Energy Efficiency Management Project of COSCO Dalian (sliding spool-styled oil header reform of main engines, cargo oil heating system, electronic cylinder oil injector of main engine and use of energy-conservation paint) passed the approval of the Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Finance, and received the Special Found for Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction of Traffic and Transportation Industry in 2013. (e) Auto Fuel Consumption and Conservation COSCO Group has enhanced management of automobile fuel conservation, and implemented energy conservation technology reform on production automobiles of logistics system to accelerate the elimination of equipment and automobiles with high energy conservation and lagged technologies. In 2013, it mainly eliminated a batch of automobiles that exceed using time limit, have great hidden safety troubles and with high energy consumption and high pollution issues. In the meantime, it formulated fuel standards for vehicles operation and enhanced examination and awarding system. (3) Measures and Achievements to Provide Energy-conservative Products and Services (a) Promoting Low-steaming and Emission Reduction Actively to Build up a Green Shipping Industry At the 2009 World Shipping (China) Summit, COSCO Group released the Qingdao Declaration, and announced that it will try to be a pioneer in energy conservation and emission reduction of shipping industry and promote the sustainability of shipping industry.

The exploration and utilization of water resources are directly related to the sustainability of society. COSCO Group mainly consumes water from the self-supply water system and the desalination of sea water for its production and vessel transportation, which does not exert major impact on rivers, lakes, underground water or glaciers. (3) Water Conservation Measures Water conservation of COSCO Group was comprised of ship water conservation and land-based water conservation. In terms of ship water conservation, all ships of COSCO Group were equipped with seawater desalination devices to de-salt the seawater with waste heat energies of main engines for daily water use of crews and equipment cooling water of equipment, so as to reduce fresh water supply of ships and save fresh water consumption. In terms of land-based water conservation, shipbuilding and ship-repairing enterprises set the objectives of production water conservation, strictly prohibited leakage and conducted the work to protect ocean environment to reduce the pollution on water resources. Land-based units also engaged in water conservation actions and obtained favorable results. (III) Pollution Prevention and Control COSCO Group implemented emission and disposal in strict accordance with requirements on pollution control of exhaust, sewage and waste in related international and national laws and regulations, such as the Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, the Marine Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China, Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Solid waste and the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Marine Pollution from Ships, and reduced the generation of exhaust, sewage and waste to the maximum extent, thus to reduce the unfavorable influences on the environment. In 2011, COSCO Group enhanced energy-conservation and emission strengths, and greatly reduced the total volume of exhaust, sewage and waste. The emission per unit of cargo turnover was kept at a relatively low level. Moreover, all ships operated by COSCO Group have obtained the International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) certificates. In 2013, COSCO Group further deepened the engine management system, strengthened management of old ships and pollution control work, exerted great efforts to promote management and technical evaluation of old ships, ensured the investment and enhanced the training to enhance the prevention control consciousness. 1. Exhaust The international maritime community has been calling for the reduction of greenhouse effect by cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Actively responding to this initiative, COSCO Group has taken effective measures in a number of aspects to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In 2013, it carried out promotion and emission reduction activities throughout the system and tried to reduce exhaust 146 / 250 emissions by reducing fuel consumption, improving fuel efficiency, increasing use of low-sulfur fuel and controlling and reducing exhaust emission of automotives. Use of low-sulfur fuel is an effective measure to reduce emissions of sulfur oxides. Ships of COSCO Group further enhanced the convention performance strengths, and continued to use low-sulfur fuels in specific shipping areas in accordance with the requirements of MARPOL Convention Appendix VI, so as to reduce emissions. In 2013, it used a total of 312,900 tons of low-sulfur fuels, resulting in increase of fuel costs by RMB98.7 million and reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions by 17,953.8 tons.

Noise Control Policies, Regulations and Measures COSCO Group conducted check and acceptance on noise control of ships built in strict accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Control of Pollution from Environmental Noise and in reference to the Engine Room Noise Standard of Transport Ship and the Regulation on Noise Levels of Ocean Ships. It also formulated related measures for prevention and 148 / 250 control of noise pollution for seafarers, which specify that seafarers, when entering a site where the noise level is higher than 90dB, should adopt ear protection measure. Any cabins where the nose level is higher than 90dB should place a visible warning plate at the entrance, indicating ―Ear protectors are necessary when entering high noise area‖. (IV) Alleviation and Adaptation to Climate Changes In order to alleviate and adapt to climate changes, intervention measures shall be adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ships are main assets of COSCO Group. Main source of greenhouse gas emissions is fuel oil of ships. By adjusting fleet structure, increasing operation capacity of ships, optimizing design of shipping lines, reducing navigation speed, adopting matured technologies and developing new technologies, it has successfully reduced specific fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. 1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions In 2013, COSCO Group actively reduced the fuel consumption, optimized the sea route design and strengthened the technical reconstruction of high-power devices to reduce greenhouse gas emission, and effectively controlled the growth rate of greenhouse gas emission of ships. 2. Carbon Footprint Calculation Emission reduction and green ecology are the major themes, enterprises are endeavoring to establish an economic mode that is energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly. COSCO Group promoted scientific and technological innovation in energy conservation and emission reduction by improving energy efficiency and eliminating energy-consuming, pollution-causing production. It is the company‘s social responsibility to develop low-carbon economy and reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, the calculation of carbon footprint serves as a new token of the group‘s commitment to social responsibility and a direction for development of the group. COSCO Group started from its main business – shipping business, and adopted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to calculate and study the carbon emissions throughout the entire life cycle of vessel transportation. Carbon footprint (carbon consumption) was studies on three stages: ship manufacturing, vessel transportation and vessel disposal to know carbon emission volume of different sectors and periods, so as to control and reduce the carbon emissions. 3. The “Green Flag” Program The ―Green Flag‖ program is an environmental protection program initiated by the Port of Long Beach of the United States. The program requires ships entering and departing the port to lower its navigation speed to 12 nodes at the distance of 35 sea· miles to the terminal, so as to reduce exhaust emission generated in combustion. Since the implementation of the Green Flag program, all container ships of COSCO Group arriving at the Long Beach have implemented the requirements of the port carefully, strictly controlled the entry speed, and the compliance rate reached 100%, receiving high praises from the port. COSCON received the Green Flag Award from the Port Authority of Long Beach again. 149 / 250 4. Participation in “At-Berth Clean fuel Program” COSCO Group actively participated in the Green Gateway Partners Awards of Seattle Port in 2013. On the basis of ―clean fuel certificate‖ issued by Seattle Port Authority to each ship and the receiving of ―green flag‖ in 2011, it continued to participate in the ―At-Berth Clean fuel Program‖. After arrival at the port, the ship uses ―clean fuel‖ with the sulfur content of less than 0.5% to reduce the exhaust emission of ships. With the concerted efforts of ship and shore-based personnel, all ships called at Seattle Port of the company had met the emission standards put forward by the port to realize the ―Northwest America air purification strategy‖. 5. Environmental Ship Index (ESI) The Environmental Ship Index is initiated by WPCI affiliated to IAPH and is developed by IAPH. ESI is an international ship rating system based on internet. Ports can take the index as the indicator to give awards to operators who perform better than existing environmental performance standards and criteria, promoting cleanness and environmental protection of ships. ESI locks at various pollutants, including nitrogen oxide, sulfoxide and diesel granular material, and involves greenhouse gas emission issue. Release of ESI will help ships to find useful engine, fuel and technical improvement measures, so as to go beyond existing environmental performance standards. On April 20, 2013, Rotterdam Port in the Netherlands, the largest port in Europe, released 2012 ESI, and five ships of COSCON in Europe included in the Top 10 Sustainable Ships. These five ships are COSCO Pride, COSCO Glory, COSCO Development, COSCO Excellence and COSCO Honesty liners. It is worth mentioning that COSCO Pride has distinguished itself from over 2,000 ships and ranked the first place with the total core of 51 points, and was appraised as 2012 Best Ship for Sustainability. The ship also received the tonnage tax reward of 10% discount offered by the port together with other four ships of COSCO Group. (V) Environmental-protection, Bio-diversity and Natural Habitat Restoration After identifying the value of its ocean shipping and other businesses to bio-diversity in ocean and operational revenues, COSCO Group considered that traditional vessel paints, ballast water and ship pollution have great impacts on marine bio-diversity. Therefore, COSCO Group tracked the requirements for bio-diversity in international conventions, and formulated policies to protect bio-diversity. After active research and effective implementation, nontoxic paint was used in the entire supply chain from shipbuilding to ship maintenance to protect the lives of ocean creatures.
