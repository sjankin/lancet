The industry has been experiencing a slump owing to slow growth, rising interest rates and higher petrol prices which have taken a toll on industry performance. Globally too, the growth in global passenger car markets eased back in 2013, partly because of the continued slump in European market, but also because of the disappointing performance of some emerging markets, notably India and Russia. However, despite the economic turbulence, the automotive industry’s medium-term prospects remains bright, and are expected to be boosted by the growth fueled by private consumption and by demographic trends. This year, we recorded a gross turnover of INR 377.58 billion, leading to a decrease of 23.4%, from the previous year. Our EBITDA margins have gone down from positive 4.8% to negative 1.4% in FY 2013-14. We have made sales of 569,677 (CVBU and PVBU) which is 30.2% lesser as compared to last year’s sales records. Our market share in the Indian automotive industry has been 16.6% which shows a decrease as compared to previous year’s 22.1% market share. We have exported 49,922 vehicles during the FY 2013-14 which is lower by 2.0% as compared to FY 2012-13.

Consequently, the Indian auto industry witnessed a decline in both passenger vehicles and in commercial vehicles segment by 4.7% and 22.4% respectively. However, globalization and outsourcing, have increased the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of products. Innovation has always been an important focus area of our business. With the automobile industry being a fast evolving one, we leverage innovation to stand out from our peers. Consumer expectations drive innovation which focuses on vehicle quality, reliability, safety, and utility Improvisation elevates customer demand and satisfaction. Sustainable transport TML is working on following special projects involving environment friendly technologies using alternative energy; Hybrid Electric Car: A concept hybrid car based on Tata Manza was displayed at the Auto Expo 2012 in Delhi. The prototype is under testing and further development of the vehicle is continuing. Hybrid Bus: TML is developing a Diesel/CNG series hybrid bus for European and Asian markets. The traction system is all electric and a down-sized ultra low emission IC engine runs a generator to charge the batteries. The vehicle has optimised regenerative braking and auto stop-start of engine as well as full accessory electrification in order to maximise fuel economy under heavy urban traffic conditions. Ten hybrid buses have been handed over to the city of Madrid, Spain, and are in revenue service there. Fuel cell Bus: Fuel cell Bus is a derivative of the Series Hybrid Bus, in that the electric power source is a fuel cell. A fuel cell is a primary battery, which oxidises hydrogen to water through a catalyst, generating electrical energy during the process. The oxidation occurs at much lower temperature than combustion temperatures of hydrogen, resulting in no emissions other than water. The first prototype was successfully demonstrated in July 2013. TML is developing a fleet of 10 fuel cell buses for a technology demonstration programme supported by the Government of India. Electric Car: TML is developing an Electric Car based on Indica platform targeted at European markets where there is surplus electricity generation from renewable sources. Several of these Electric cars participated in the 12-month fleet trials under the Coventry and Birmingham Low Emission Demonstrator (CABLED) programme in the UK. The electric powertrain is now in the process of being adapted to newer platforms. Electric Small Commercial Vehicle: An all-electric small commercial vehicle is under development at TML for North America and Europe. The vehicle has been launched in the UK. Development of fleets for pilot demonstration programmes in India are in process. 23 ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• The Greener Nano: With increased demand in the transport industry and continuous depletion of fuel reserves, there was a need for a fuel efficient mode of transport which will not only make the transportation more economical but also can reduce the environmental ill effects of the currently used fossil fuels. With this objective in mind, CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) was found most promising and was planned to be implemented in Nano. Implemented on the current Nano platform with 2 Cylinder MPFI Gasoline engine, the car can run on both Gasoline & CNG fuels thus enhancing the vehicle distance range. It uses single ECU for smartly controlling the fuel changeover based on the driver demand and intelligently detects the various safety problems & applies an immediate corrective action. This initiative also leads to lowest CO2 emission of 75g/km and has won the Idea Notarization for the CNG leakage & healing strategy and Best in class fuel economy of 36kmpkg in CNG Mode. Greener Revotron: Power and fuel-efficiency are what car customers want and that is what Tata Motors will deliver with its new Revotron family of engines. With the Revotron bringing performance, refinement and economy to its cars, the new engine series will add a powerful petrol portfolio to an already strong diesel one. The next-gen petrol engine has been designed keeping in mind varied weather conditions and customer preferences, and tested for global standards in the UK and Korea. Greener Magic: FuelNext promotes a clean and green environment, improve efficiency and make driving a lot more comfortable. The striking Magic Electric is an eco-friendly passenger transport vehicle. Iris EV: Tata Motors has also developed Iris EV that comfortably carry 5 passengers and has a range of 40km in one charge. Greener Indigo: With the launch of the Tata Indigo emax and the Tata Indica emax, Tata Motors has expanded its CNG portfolio. The two variants are now available in Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Tripura. Both the variants are highly fuel-efficient and have low carbon footprints. While the Tata Indigo emax is all about luxury, power and performance, it is also the most fuel efficient sedan on India’s roads. The car is high on driving comfort and suspension. The Tata Indica emax impresses with its fuel efficiency and sports spacious and comfortable interiors.

We confirm that the Report, along with the referenced information in the Annual Report meets the general content and quality requirements of GRI G3.1.

We have evaluated the Report’s adherence to the following principles on a scale of ‘Good’, ‘Acceptable’ and ‘Needs Improvement’ Inclusivity: As a part of its stakeholder engagement process, the Company has engaged (both formally and informally) with key stakeholders for assessing the emerging risks at its operational facilities. The Report may bring out outcomes of stakeholder engagement and the Company’s response to identified material issues based on its engagement. In our opinion, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Acceptable’. Materiality: The Company has identified and reported its material issues of significance based on internal and external stakeholder perspectives at the macro level and has not missed out any known material issues. The management of the Company is committed to effectively identify, manage and report the material aspects based on a continual evaluation for long term sustainability. In our opinion, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Acceptable’. Responsiveness: We consider that the Company has fairly responded to identified key sustainability aspects and challenges in the local sustainability context, including aspects related to the automobile sector, within the reporting boundary. In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Acceptable’. Reliability: The majority of data and information verified at the Corporate Office and four operational sites were found to be accurate.
