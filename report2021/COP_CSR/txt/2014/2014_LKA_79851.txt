Reinsurance is placed in line with policy guidelines approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis in line with the guidelines issued by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka and concentration of risk is managed by reference to counterparties‚Äô limits that are set each year and are subject to regular reviews. On a regular basis management assesses the creditworthiness of reinsurers to update the reinsurance strategy and ascertain the suitable allowance for impairment of reinsurance assets. 17.1.9 Premium receivable UA‚Äôs has a credit risk exposure to receivables where the policyholder or the intermediary cannot settle their dues to UA. In life insurance, credit risk is minimal, since premium is collected before the policy is issued. In non life insurance, the premium warranty clause which states that a claim is not payable if the premium is not settled within 60 days has reduced the credit risk to a greater extent.
