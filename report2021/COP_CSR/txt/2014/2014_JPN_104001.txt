To Our Stakeholders ABOVE AND BE The ANA Group has constantly built its relationship of trust with our customers as a matter of the highest priority while working to develop its business and overcoming a host of issues and difficulties. Now, we are seeing enormous business opportunities ahead. With the rise of the global economy, development of the economies in Asia, and an increasing number of visitors to Japan, the business landscape is expanding and the stage is set for us to achieve our goal of being the world’s leading airline group. In March 2014, there was an increase in the number of international slots from/to Haneda Airport. This should open pathways for even further growth for the ANA Group. In our second year under the holding company structure, we will work to become more competitive in terms of quality and cost level. We will invest effectively and steadily for the future to build the optimal business portfolio, while striving to realize sustainable growth as a group. I ask for your continued support for the ANA Group as we continue our journey. President & Chief Executive Officer 6 ANA HOLDINGS INC.

Annual Report 2014 85 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ANA HOLDINGS INC. and its consolidated subsidiaries 1. Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of ANA HOLDINGS INC. (the corporate name was changed from ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. on April 1, 2013; hereinafter referred to as “the company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan. In preparing the accompanying financial statements, certain reclassifications have been made to the financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, the notes to the consolidated financial statements include information which is not required under accounting principles and practices generally accepted in Japan but is presented herein as additional information. 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (a) Principles of consolidation and accounting for investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all of its significant subsidiaries (62 subsidiaries for 2014 and 57 subsidiaries for 2013). All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in certain subsidiaries and significant affiliates (18 companies for 2014 and 19 companies for 2013) are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. The difference between the cost and the underlying net equity in the net assets at dates of acquisition of consolidated subsidiaries and companies accounted for by the equity method of accounting is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 5 to 15 years. Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates which are not consolidated or accounted for by the equity method (81 companies for 2014 and 65 companies for 2013) are stated at cost. The equity in undistributed earnings of these companies was not significant. Certain subsidiaries have fiscal years ending on December 31 and February 28, and necessary adjustments for significant transactions, if any, are made on consolidation. (b) Foreign currency translation The balance sheet accounts of foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for components of shareholders’ equity which are translated at historic exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing when such transactions are made. Resulting translation differences are recorded in minority interests and in foreign currency translation adjustments under the net assets section of the consolidated balance sheet. Foreign currency payables and receivables are principally translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except payables and receivables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts. (c) Marketable securities and investment securities The accounting standard for financial instruments requires that securities be classified into three categories: trading, held-to-maturity or other securities. Under the standard, trading securities are carried at fair value and held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gains or losses, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method. See Note 4. (d) Allowance for doubtful receivables A general provision is made for doubtful receivables based on past experience. Provisions are also made against specific receivables as and when required. (e) Inventories Inventories include aircraft spare parts, supplies and stock in trade of consolidated subsidiaries. These are stated at cost principally based on the moving average method. Net book value of inventories in the consolidated balance sheet is written down when its net realizable value declines. (f) Property and equipment and depreciation (excluding leased assets) Property and equipment excluding leased assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Ground property and equipment includes ¥50,999 million ($495,520 thousand) and ¥52,826 million of land at March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed based on estimated useful lives by the following methods: Aircraft.................................................... Straight-line method Buildings................................................. Straight-line method Other ground property and equipment.... Straight-line method 86 ANA HOLDINGS INC. The company and certain subsidiaries employ principally the following useful lives, based upon the company’s estimated durability: Aircraft.................................................... 9–20 years Buildings................................................. 3–50 years Major additions and improvements are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repairs, including minor renewals and improvements, are charged to income as incurred. The company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The assets of the company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries are grouped by individual property in the case of rental real estate, assets expected to be sold and idle assets, and by management accounting categories in the case of business assets. An impairment loss is required to be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets significantly exceeds their recoverable amount. See Note 18. (g) Intangible assets and amortization (excluding leased assets) Intangible assets included in other assets are amortized by the straight-line method. Cost of software purchased for internal use is amortized by the straight-line method over five years, the estimated useful life of purchased software. (h) Stock issuance costs New stock issuance costs are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over a period of three years. (i) Bond issuance costs Bond issuance costs are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over the period of redemption of bonds. (j) Business commencement expenses Business commencement expenses are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over the period of five years. (k) Provision for loss on antitrust proceedings On October 29, 2009, the Republic of Korea Fair Trade Commission issued an “Examiner’s Report” to the company with respect to its alleged breach of the South Korea’s Antitrust Law in its air freight transport services. Subsequently, the company filed an appeal against a corrective order from the Commission in November 2010 and a decision of the Seoul High Court in May 2012 with the Supreme Court of Korea in June 2012. A provision is recorded based on the estimated loss at the balance sheet dates considering the possibility of such loss in the future. The estimated amount of the provision may change as the proceedings progress. (l) Retirement benefits The retirement benefit plan of the company and certain subsidiaries covers substantially all employees other than directors, officers and corporate auditors. Under the terms of this plan, eligible employees are entitled, upon mandatory retirement or earlier voluntary severance, to lump-sum payments or annuity payments based on their compensation at the time of leaving and years of service with the company and subsidiaries. The company and certain significant domestic subsidiaries have trustee employee pension funds to provide coverage for part of the lump-sum benefits or annuity payments. The company and certain consolidated subsidiaries adopt defined contribution pension plans as well as defined benefit pension plans. For defined benefit pension plan, accrued retirement benefits for employees at the balance sheet date are provided mainly at an amount Financial/DATA Section calculated based on the retirement benefit obligation and the fair market value of the pension plan assets as of the balance sheet date, as adjusted for unrecognized net retirement benefit obligation at transition, unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and unrecognized prior service cost. The retirement benefit obligation is attributed to each period by the straight-line method over the estimated service years of eligible employees. The net retirement benefit obligation at transition is being amortized by the straight-line method. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized in the year following the year in which the gain or loss is recognized primarily by the straight-line method over periods which are shorter than the average remaining service years of employees. Prior service cost is amortized as incurred by the straight-line method over periods which are shorter than the average remaining service years of employees. See Note 7. The assumptions used in accounting for the above plans as of March 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: 2014 2013 Discount rate 1.2%~2.0% 1.1%~2.5% Expected return on plan assets 2.5%~5.5% 2.5%~7.2% (m) Deferred tax accounting Deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating losses and tax credits carried forward. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is charged to operations in the period that includes the enactment date. See Note 9. Annual Report 2014 87 (n) Leased assets and amortization Leased assets arising from transactions under finance lease contracts which do not transfer ownership to lessees are amortized to a residual value of zero by the straight-line method using the term of contract as the useful life. (o) Derivatives The company and its subsidiaries use derivatives, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, commodity options and swaps, to limit their exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The company and its subsidiaries do not use derivatives for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains or losses charged or credited to operations, except for those which meet the criteria for deferral hedge accounting under which an unrealized gain or loss is deferred as an asset or a liability. Receivables and payables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts are translated at the corresponding foreign exchange contract rates. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses or income. (p) Appropriation of retained earnings Under the Corporation Law of Japan (the “Law”), the appropriation of unappropriated retained earnings of the company with respect to a financial period is made by resolution of the company’s shareholders at a general meeting to be held subsequent to the close of the financial period and the accounts for that period do not therefore reflect such appropriation. See Note 12. (q) Net income per share The computation of net income per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year. Net income per share assuming full dilution is not disclosed due to the nonexistence of dilutive shares. (r) Revenue recognition Passenger revenues, cargo and other operating revenues are recorded when services are rendered. (s) Cash equivalents For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less are treated as cash equivalents. See Note 17. (t) Reclassification Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2013 financial information in the accompanying financial statements to conform with the 2014 presentation. (u) Frequent flyer program The company accrues a frequent flyer liability for the mileage credits that are earned and to be used based on assumptions including analyses of previous experience under the program, anticipated behavior of customers, expectations of future awards to be issued, and analysis of current accumulated mileage balances. (v) Regarding the accounting of the Trust Type Employee Stock Ownership Incentive Plan The company introduced a “Trust Type Employee Stock Ownership Incentive Plan.” The purposes of this plan are to: increase incentives for the employees of the company and its subsidiaries to accumulate their own property as a part of the company and its subsidiaries’ benefit plan and to endeavor to enhance the ANA Group’s corporate value, as well as to ensure stable provision of the company’s shares to the Employee Stock Ownership Group (the “ESOP Group”). Under this plan, the “Employee Stock Ownership Trust” (the “ESOP Trust”), which was established for the purpose of transferring the company’s shares to the ESOP Group, acquires the company’s shares in advance in a quantity sufficient for the ESOP Group to obtain for the next four years, and subsequently sells those shares to the ESOP Group. Taking the conservative view and focusing on the economic substance, the accounting treatment for the acquisition and sale of the company’s shares is based on the assumption that the company and the ESOP Trust form substantially a single entity given that the company guarantees the ESOP Trust’s liability. Therefore, the company’s shares owned by the ESOP Trust as well as the assets and liabilities and income and expenses of the ESOP Trust are included in the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of income, consolidated statement of changes in net assets and consolidated statement of cash flows of the company. 88 ANA HOLDINGS INC. (w) Changes in accounting policies Application of Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits From March 31, 2014, the company applies “Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ) Statement No. 26, May 17, 2012) and “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Guidance No. 25, May 17, 2012) (except for the provisions set forth in Clause 35 of the Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits and Clause 67 of the Guidance on Retirement Benefits). These accounting standards require entities to apply a revised method for recording the retirement benefit obligation, after deducting pension plan assets, as net defined benefit liabilities. In addition, unrecognized actuarial differences and unrecognized prior service costs are recorded as net defined benefit liabilities. The application of the Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits and the Guidance on Retirement Benefits is subject to the transitional accounting treatment set forth in Clause 37 of the Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits. In the year ended March 31, 2014, the effect of the relevant change has been added to or deducted from accumulated other comprehensive income (remeasurements of defined benefit plans). As a result, as of March 31, 2014, the balance of net defined benefit assets was ¥45 million ($437 thousand) and the balance of net defined benefit liabilities was ¥181,101 million ($1,759,628 thousand). In addition, accumulated other comprehensive income decreased by ¥30,168 million ($293,120 thousand), and, net assets per share decreased by ¥8.64 ($0.08). Changes in accounting policies for items that are difficult to distinguish from changes in accounting estimates Previously, the company and certain consolidated subsidiaries in Japan used the declining-balance method to calculate depreciation of tangible fixed assets, except aircraft, buildings and leased assets. However, from the year ended March 31, 2014, the company and certain consolidated subsidiaries in Japan changed to the straight-line method. Due to significant changes in the airline industry environment, such as the capacity expansion at airports in metropolitan areas, the further deregulation of the airline industry, and the increase in the number of low-cost carriers (LCCs), the company reconsidered the current usage of the facilities of the Air Transportation business. As a result of the review, the company has reached the conclusion that the straight-line method, which allocates the cost equally through the useful life of the asset, is reasonable since a more stable usage is expected in the future than it was in the past. As a result of the change in the depreciation method, operating income increased by ¥1,345 million ($13,068 thousand), recurring profit increased by ¥1,433 million ($13,923 thousand) and income before income taxes and minority interests increased by ¥1,460 million ($14,185 thousand). (x) Changes in accounting estimates From the year ended March 31, 2014, the company and certain consolidated subsidiaries in Japan changed the useful lives of some aircraft to those that reflect the projected use in the future. The impact of the change of useful lives is a decrease of ¥7,899 million ($76,748 thousand) in operating income and ¥7,222 million ($70,171 thousand) in recurring profit and income before income taxes and minority interests. (y) Unapplied Accounting Standards Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits (ASBJ Statement No. 26 of May 17, 2012) and Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits (ASBJ Guidance No. 25. of May 17, 2012) Financial/DATA Section (1) Outline The standard provides guidance for the accounting for unrecognized actuarial differences and unrecognized prior services, the calculation methods for retirement benefit obligation and service costs and enhancement of disclosures. (2) Scheduled date of adoption These accounting standards will be adopted from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015. However, as no retrospective application of this accounting standard is required, it will not be applied to consolidated financial statements for prior years. (3) Impact of adoption The impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this accounting standard is currently being evaluated. 3. Financial statements translation The consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in yen and, solely for the convenience of the reader, have been translated into United States dollars at the rate of ¥102.92 = US$1, the approximate exchange rate prevailing on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market on March 31, 2014. This translation should not be construed as a representation that the amounts shown could be converted into United States dollars at such a rate. Translations of United States dollars are rounded down to the nearest thousand and therefore the totals shown in tables do not necessarily agree with the sums of the individual amounts.

Asset retirement obligations 1. Asset retirement obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (a) Overview of asset retirement obligations The company and its subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts for the Head Office, sales branches, airport branches and some other offices. As the company and its subsidiaries have restoration obligations for such properties at the end of each lease period, related legal obligations required by law and the contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as asset retirement obligations. (b) Calculation of asset retirement obligations The company and its subsidiaries estimate the expected period of use as 1 to 30 years and calculate the amount of asset retirement obligations with a discount rate of 0% to 2.27%. The following table indicates the changes in asset retirement obligations for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013: U.S. dollars Yen (Millions) (Thousands) 2014 2013 2014 Balance at beginning of year ¥1,500 ¥ 2,173 $14,574 Liabilities incurred due to the acquisition of property and equipment 88 – 855 Accretion expense 327 408 3,177 Liabilities settled (448) (1,081) (4,352) Others 25 – 242 Balance at end of year ¥1,492 ¥ 1,500 $14,496 Financial/DATA Section 2. Asset retirement obligations not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet The company and its subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts for land and offices at airport facilities including Tokyo International Airport, Narita International Airport, New Chitose Airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport, Osaka International Airport, Kansai International Airport, Fukuoka Airport and Naha Airport. The company and its subsidiaries have restoration obligations when they vacate and clear such facilities. However, as the roles of the above airports are especially important in public transportation, it is beyond the control of the company alone to determine when to vacate and clear such facilities, and it is also impossible to make reasonable estimates as there are currently no relocation plans for the above properties. Therefore, the company and its subsidiaries do not record asset retirement obligations for the related liabilities. Annual Report 2014 95 9.

In addition, the “Act for Partial Amendment of the Local Tax Act, etc.” (Act No. 4 of 2014) and the “Act for Partial Amendment of the Local Corporate Tax Act, etc.” (Act No. 11 of 2014) were promulgated on March 31, 2014, and the company is subject to the amended Local Corporate Tax effective for fiscal years beginning on or after April 1, 2015.

The Law provides that neither additional paid-in capital nor the legal reserve is available for the payment of dividends, but both may be used to reduce or eliminate a deficit by resolution of the shareholders or may be transferred to common stock by resolution of the Board of Directors. The Law also provides that, if the total amount of additional paid-in capital and the legal reserve exceeds 25% of the amount of common stock, the excess may be distributed to the shareholders either as a return of capital or as dividends subject to the approval of the shareholders. Under the Law, however, such distributions can be made at anytime by resolution of the shareholders or by the Board of Directors if certain conditions are met. 13.

The company and consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable as guarantor of loans, principally to affiliates, amounting to ¥941 million at March 31, 2013. 14. Financial instruments Overview (a) Policy for financial instruments The company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “group”) limit their fund management to short-term time deposits and raise funds through borrowings from financial institutions including banks. The company and its subsidiaries use derivatives for the purpose of reducing risk described below and do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. (b) Types of financial instruments, related risk and risk management Trade receivables (accounts receivable) are exposed to credit risk in relation to customers. In accordance with the internal policies of the group for managing credit risk arising from receivables, the group monitors credit worthiness of their main customers periodically and monitors due dates and outstanding balances by individual customer, whereby making efforts to identify and mitigate risks of bad debts from customers who are having financial difficulties. Marketable securities and investments in securities are exposed to risk of market price fluctuations. Those securities are composed of mainly the shares of other companies with which the group has business relationships. The group periodically reviews the fair values of such financial instruments and the financial position of the issuers, whereby making efforts to identify and mitigate risks of impairment. Financial/DATA Section Substantially all trade payables (accounts and notes payable) have payment due dates within one year. Borrowings are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments and certain long-term debt with variable interest rates is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk. However, to reduce such risk for long-term debt-bearing interest at variable rates, the group utilizes interest rate swap transactions as a hedging instrument. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses or income. For derivatives, in order to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk arising from the receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, the group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts for specific receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies mainly for aircraft purchase commitments. In addition, to reduce the interest rate fluctuation risk associated with financial assets and liabilities, the group uses interest rate swap transactions for specific financial assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the group enters into commodity derivative transactions such as swaps and options to mitigate the fluctuation risk of commodity prices of fuel and stabilize operating profit. 1) Management of credit risks (risks such as breach of contract by customers) The group, with respect to trade receivables, exercises the due date management and the outstanding balance management in accordance with internal policies. The group makes best efforts to identify and mitigate risks of bad debts from major customers with financial difficulties by periodically monitoring their creditworthiness. As for derivatives, the group believes that the credit risks are extremely low, as it enters into derivative transactions only with reputable financial institutions with a sound credit profile. Annual Report 2014 99 2) Management of market risks (fluctuation risks such as exchange rate and interest rate) In order to reduce the foreign currency exchange risks, the group, in principle, utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts for receivables and payables in foreign currencies. In order to mitigate the interest rate fluctuation risks of the debts, the group utilizes interest rate swap transactions. As for marketable securities and investment securities, the group periodically reviews the fair values and the financial conditions of the issuers to identify and mitigate risks of impairment. There are internal policies for derivative transactions which set forth authorization levels and maximum upper limits on transaction volumes and the group enters into the derivative transactions in accordance with such policies. Moreover, meetings are held principally on a monthly basis with attendance of board members responsible for derivatives to determine methods and ratios for offsetting risks as well as to report and confirm results of derivative transactions. 3) Management of liquidity risks related to financing (risks that the group cannot meet the due date of payables) The group manages the liquidity risks by setting a financial plan in order to procure and invest funds, which are necessary for the operation of the group for a certain period of time, in accordance with the business operating plan and the budget. (c) Supplementary explanation of the estimated fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, if available. When there is no quoted market price available, fair value is reasonably estimated. Since various assumptions and factors are reflected in estimating the fair value, different assumptions and factors could result in different fair value. In addition, the notional amounts of derivatives in Note 15. Derivatives and hedging activities are not necessarily indicative of the actual market risk involved in derivative transactions. Estimated fair value of financial instruments Carrying value of financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2014 and estimated fair value are shown in the following table. The following table does not include financial instruments for which it is extremely difficult to determine the fair value (Please refer to Note 2 below).

Notes: 1. Methods to determine the estimated fair value of financial instruments and other matters related to securities and derivative transactions Assets 1) Cash on hand and in banks and 2) accounts receivable Since these items are settled in a short period of time, their carrying value approximates fair value. 3) Marketable securities and investments in securities The fair value of stocks is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of debt securities is based on either quoted market prices or prices provided by the financial institutions making markets in these securities. For information on securities classified by holding purpose, refer to Note 4. Marketable securities and investments in securities of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Liabilities 1) Trade notes and accounts payable and 2) short-term bank loans Since these items are settled in a short period of time, their carrying value approximates fair value. 3) Bonds and notes The fair value of bonds issued by the company is present value of the total of principal and interest discounted by an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of each bond and current credit risk. 4) Long-term loans The fair value of long-term loans is based on the present value of the total of principal and interest discounted by the interest rate to be applied if similar new borrowings were entered into. 2. Financial instruments for which it is extremely difficult to determine the fair value U.S. dollars As of March 31, 2014 Yen (Millions) (Thousands) Unlisted stocks ¥30,243 $293,849 Because no quoted market price is available and it is extremely difficult to determine the fair value, the above financial instruments are not included in the above table. 3.

Derivatives and hedging activities The group operates internationally and are exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices of fuel. In order to manage these risks, the group and its subsidiaries utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transactions related to purchase commitments, principally of flight equipment, and foreign currency receivables and payables. Also, the group utilizes interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to their outstanding debt. In addition, the group also enters into a variety of swaps and options in its management of risk exposure related to the commodity prices of fuel. The group and its subsidiaries do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The group has developed internal hedging guidelines to control various aspects of derivative transactions, including authorization levels and transaction volumes. The group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with these internal guidelines. Derivative and hedging transactions initiated by respective operational departments have been examined by the accounting department and these transactions, including their measures and ratios, have been monitored by management generally on a monthly basis. Assessment of hedge effectiveness is examined at inception and, on an ongoing basis, periodically. The consolidated subsidiaries have adopted the same procedures for hedging activities as the group. The group is also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but it is not expected that any counterparties will fail to meet their obligations, because most of the counterparties are internationally recognized financial institutions. 102 ANA HOLDINGS INC.
