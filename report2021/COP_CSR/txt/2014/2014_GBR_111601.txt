THE DEMAND FOR confidence in these respects to live their lives. How we do this is rightly COLLABORATION AND SMART IDEAS part of how we are judged. HAS NEVER BEEN GREATER OUR APPROACH We have a good track record but we are not complacent. By being honest, diligent and accountable we will best serve our customers and their communities, attract and retain a diverse, talented workforce and build a better business for the future. By partnering with external organisations we contribute towards a wider purpose. We are signatories to the UN Global Compact and are committed to integrating into our business the principles of the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation core labour standards. We are members of the ClimateWise initiative and are also active in the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative as founding signatories to the Principles for Sustainable Insurance. There is also much that we do internally, drawing on the strengths of our people to ensure we are making things better together. In 2013, we undertook a strategic review of our corporate responsibility (CR) activities to ensure they remained relevant to us and to those who depend on us. Our aim was to focus our attention on the areas most connected to our business and where we can have the greatest positive impact. 3 There are three themes for our new CR strategy: ‘Safe, Secure World’; ‘Thriving Communities’; and ‘Sustainable Future’. These themes are underpinned by our ‘Responsible Business’ activities, such as our high-risk countries underwriting policy, our diversity strategy and our customer commitment. The development Developing resilience Improving road of the strategy involved senior leadership to extreme weather safety reduces and the views of people from across reduces claims claims our Group to ensure wide engagement.

As SME businesses are the backbone of most economies, accounting for more than 50% of Gross Domestic Product and nearly two-thirds of employment, they are a sector which can help meet this challenge and therefore we want to see them grow. We look to create positive social impact wherever we do business, encourage our employees to focus their community action on this and empower them to support the causes they feel passionate about.
