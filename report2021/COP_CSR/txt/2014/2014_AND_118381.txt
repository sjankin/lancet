CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2013 ENVIRONMENT 19 ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS MANAGEMENT OF ENERGY RESOURCES AND CONSUMPTION One of the annual objectives of the company is the monitoring of energy data and consumption, in order to improve each year by being more effective and trying to minimize the environmental impact and the associated costs. 2011 2012 2013 Electricity consumption (MWh) 604,97 703,53 788,68 Water consumption (m3) 8.214 8.399 9.789 Diesel consumption (litres) 13.424 13.143 10.000 Paper consumption (kg) 1.080 888 804 Not all energy resources’ consumption can be reduced annually, since many of them are directly related to the production process, however much importance is given to raise awareness to the staff for the rational use of resources.

For this reason, TAG Systems has many quality checks along the different production stages in order to ensure a maximum quality level during all the manufacturing process. Quality checks are based on different regulations and standards specifying the requirements for the plastic card manufacturing. Our base is the CQM program (Card Quality Management), based on some of the following rules and specifications: • ISO/IEC 7810 • ISO/IEC 7811-1, ISO/IEC 7811-2, ISO/IEC 7811-6 • ISO/IEC 7816-1, ISO/IEC 7816-2, ISO/IEC 7816-3 • ISO/IEC 10373-1, ISO/IEC 10373-2, ISO/IEC 10373-3 • Controls of Chip hardware functionality with terminals, according to EMV regulations. • Design requirements according to the manual of different card payment brands.

For this reason, when we receive a claim, a complete correcting process is engaged. All necessary corrective and preventive actions are undertaken to correct the problem and avoid it in the future. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2013 CUSTOMERS & SUPPLIERS 23 SUPPLIERS TAG Systems is very concerned on the materials used in the card production. The best raw materials are selected after a strict qualification. When raw materials reach our plant, they are submitted to different incoming goods control where their suitability is determined. Owing to these incoming controls we have achieved an increase on final product quality, as when defective raw materials are detected, those are automatically discarded, and therefore, potential production issues are avoided from the very beginning. In addition to this, TAG Systems does not only prioritize the quality of raw materials, we also value positively those suppliers manufacturing with a smaller environmental impact. One of our requirements when evaluating new potential suppliers is that they have environmental management systems in place.
