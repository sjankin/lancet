UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2013-2014 Reporting period: January 1st 2014 to December 31st 2014 UN Global Compact – our commitment Dear reader, In 2014 JF Hillebrand celebrated 170 years of continuous trading. Since 1844 we have upheld our corporate values of specialization, passion, and service excellence. Such longevity brings with it not only experience, but also responsibility; responsibility to our staff, to our clients, to our industry and indeed to our society. That is why, across our global portfolio of specialist logistics companies, we at the JF Hillebrand Group strive in everything we do to follow the principles of the UN Global Compact in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The UN Global Compact serves an important purpose in providing consistent guiding principles for our company to follow. Since our first Communication on Progress in 2012, we have worked to systematically integrate the principles of the Global Compact into our core business strategy. During the past year, we have undertaken numerous actions at a global and local office level to ensure that these principles are integrated into our daily operations. Our position on sustainability is clear. We continue to make strides in reducing our own carbon footprint and environmental impact, but there are challenges ahead. Climate change is a challenge we share not only with other companies in the transport and logistics sector, but with society as a whole. Our aim is to be at the forefront of sustainable transport in the industries where we operate. In 2014, we welcomed Satellite Logistics Group as the latest addition to our portfolio of logistics companies. Satellite Logistics Group helps its customers in the brewing industry realize their own sustainable supply chain goals, through efficient keg management solutions, and turnkey beverage disposal services. In this document, which we will share with our staff and stakeholders, we report on the progress which we, as a company, continue to make. We are proud of our support of the UNGC and we remain committed to making a real difference in our community. Yours sincerely, Mr. Christophe Bernard CEO, JF Hillebrand Group AG.

Our expertise and extensive market knowledge enables us to meet customer requirements with bespoke solutions and initiatives which can help lower carbon emissions throughout the world. • We continuously strive to improve our environmental performance, through initiatives and best practice, either alone or in partnership with others. • Strategic involvement in non-profit forums such as the Container Owners Association (COA) with the objective to minimise industry-wide pollution risks through constant analysis and reporting on incidents. • Existing logistics initiatives within the JF Hillebrand Group are: o Increased use of “Short-Sea” shipping – we use feeder services into smaller regional ports, as close as possible to the final delivery point. Utilising feeder options minimises road miles and eases congestion at ports and container terminals. o We have introduced a new service for the shipping of wines from Iberia to northern Europe using sea transport as opposed to road transport. This saves 1 kg CO2 per case of wine shipped in Europe. o Use of domestic coastal shipping – we utilize feeder services where appropriate to reduce the use of road transport. o Inland waterways – where possible, we use barges and inland canal routes to cut down on road miles. o Green haulage procurement where possible, we will seek to use low-emission road transport (including LNG trucks where possible). o Use of rail networks in the UK, we have set up a dedicated rail transportation service which removes around 6000 HGV movements from the congested motorways network. In France, we are one of the primary users of the train service between Bordeaux and Le Havre port, further reducing CO2 emissions. • Development of technologies and solutions to minimise environmental impact: o Bulk transport solutions via our flexitank systems. Bulk transportation allows shippers to significantly reduce transportation costs, and dramatically reduce the associated carbon emissions in some cases by up to 50%. Furthermore, importing liquids in bulk and bottling them at destination using recycled, lightweight glass or other materials further reduces carbon emissions. In addition, we have addressed the carbon footprint of the flexitank itself. o We have proactive and long-term Equipment Recovery Management plan to leverage recycling opportunities for our flexitank products. We have invested in recycling facilities and actively assist our clients in the design and implementation of local flexitank recycling solutions o The flexitank material is shredded, baled for granulation and cleaned before being pelletized and manufactured into new products. o We actively manage the collection of steel bulkheads (used for flexitank shipments), which are refurbished and reused throughout our network. o We aim to reduce to zero the number of flexitanks used in landfill. o We have developed our own VinLiner thermal liners as an environmentally friendly alternative to shipping in temperature controlled reefer containers (which require approximately 30% to 40% more energy to refrigerate on the basis of the same transported tonnage). o Our VinLiner product is produced from a fully recyclable material. We also have a VinLiner recollection/recycling programme, with a target that 100% of VinLiner Pallet Covers will be produced from recycled VinLiners. o Development of a Carbon Calculator tool on the JF Hillebrand website, enabling shippers to calculate and compare their carbon emissions via different transport Page 7 of 9 modes. Providing innovative tools such as the carbon calculator helps to foster a culture of environmental awareness amongst our customers and staff, in every country in which we operate. o Development of IT tools Kegspediter, LogiTrax and EcoBev, designed to help clients manage supply chains as efficiently as possible. o EcoBev beverage disposal service is the only green solution for beverage disposal in the USA. o Kegspediter solution increases efficiency of keg usage and helps brewers minimise their environmental impact. • Development of a best practice “How to go green at work” document with guidelines to be implemented in each JF Hillebrand Group office and manufacturing plant, including: o Waste separation. o Recycling waste paper and sourcing paper from renewable sources. o Recycling plastic. o Reducing printing. o Conserving energy. o Switching energy supply to renewable sources. o Use of lower emission company cars. o Use of energy efficient office and IT equipment. o Constantly searching for new ways to limit environmental impact. • Implementation of local office initiatives across our entire network, including: o Housing our IT servers in a carbon neutral data-centre in the Netherlands. o Recycled VinLiners used for low-cost housing roof insulation, or for charitable donation to third world countries and regions affected by natural disasters. o Use of motion sensor and/or low energy lighting in our offices to reduce electricity usage. o Use of cardboard as opposed to polystyrene packaging in mailrooms. o Collection of electronic waste in offices for safe disposal, recycling and, where possible, re-use. o Our SLG Division is a SmartWay Logistics Company Partner since 2009, partnering with SmartWay certified carriers whenever possible, sharing their dedication to reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency. o Introduction of electric company cars and provision of charging points at our offices in the Netherlands. o Provision of transport alternatives to discourage staff from using cars in France. o Environmental enhancements to our office building in Mainz, Germany, including installation of solar panels to produce electricity and installation of new insulating windows to reduce CO2 emissions. o Support of the Bee’ah Green Middle East project in the United Arab Emirates. o Support of the CONIN recycling charity in Argentina. o LEEN certification for our offices in Canada o Use of hybrid cars in Portugal o Support of the FEV (Federacion Espanola del Vino) project “Wineries for the Climate Protection” which promotes sustainable development for the Spanish wine industry. o Support for the Ökoprofit corporate environment consultancy program in Germany. o Implementation of solar panels at our warehouse in Livorno, Italy. o Promotion of online meetings and conferencing to reduce business travel. • We are active members of industry environmental bodies and organisations including the Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG, a B2B initiative managed by BSR/Business for Social Responsibility) and Sedex. Measurement of outcomes • We received independent ISO 14001 (Environmental) accreditation for environmental initiatives. • We have received independent ISO 22000 and HACCP (hazard analysis critical control points) accreditation, adopting a systematic approach to reducing physical, chemical, and biological hazards/risks in production processes. • We are a SmartWay® Logistics Company Partner (applicable to our SLG division).
