Electrical network modernization Every year LESTO taking care of the security of energy supply and of economic and social benefits to the society, pays much attention to the development and modernization of the distribution network. An important aspect of the environmental protection is better conditions for energy conservation, more rational use of it. LESTO by modernizing and expanding the electricity sector, a large part of it being older than 30 years, invests in environmentally friendly modern technologies. During the reconstruction of old electrical substations there are installed wastewater and rainwater collection facilities which meet the highest quality standards that no pollutants enter to the environment. Outdated, worn out power transformers are replaced with quieter operating ones, and less overloaded transformers are replaced with lower power transformers, in order to use the existing assets more efficiently and reduce the power losses.. In the twelve months of 2013, LESTO investments in electricity network expansion and modernization reached LTL 298.5 million. This is 7.6 % less compared to the investment during the same period of 2012. Comparing with the twelve months of 2012, the biggest decrease was in investment in the reconstruction of 0.4 10 kV electricity network (24 %) and in investment in the reconstruction of 110/35/10 kV transformer substations and 10 kV distribution subsections (23.8 %). Investment in the buyout of electricity objects has increased by 18.2 % compared with the same period of 2012. Totally per year 2013, 877 transformer stations of 10/0.4 kV voltage were modernized. In order to avoid vulnerability of the airlines and damages due to natural disasters, LESTO continued laying underground cables for electricity transmission. During twelve months of the year 2013, LESTO laid 1,326 kilometers of cable lines of 10/6/0.4 kV voltage. Cable lines notably reduce number of failures during exploitation, exploitation itself of such lines is cheaper and, if airlines are changed to the cables, the landscape becomes lovelier. LESTO replaces old induction electric meters with new electronic meters, which are twice as accurate. Electricity metering equipment automation has enabled automatically submit bills for electricity consumption for the clients, eliminating a need for customers to declare electricity consumption. 20 AB LESTO Report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 Investors LESTO seeks to maintain close relationships with existing and potential investors in the company.

According to the electricity market development plan, all customers are free to choose an independent electric supplier. LESTO as electricity distribution operator actively encourages business to enter the free market. The representatives of large companies received information, were invited to the meetings and presentations and were consulted on the liberalization of the electricity market. In order to make it easier, LESTO has implemented an automated data collection system, which helps to quickly provide information to energy suppliers and business enterprises that are no longer subject to the public supplier prices. The outcome of the project Customer Service Data” is that independent suppliers have the opportunity to login to the portal and see the potential customers. On 31 December, 2013 independent suppliers delivered electricity to 108,700 objects. According to plan for development of Lithuanian power market signed by the Government of the Republic of Lithuania on 8 July, 2009, on 31 December, 2013 independent electricity supplier has been chosen accordingly: About 86 % of objects with permissible power of 400 kW and more; About 57 % of objects with permissible power of 100 kW and more; About 33 % of objects with permissible power of 30 kW and more; About 47 % of objects with permissible power less than 30 kW. The remaining objects are supplied with electricity by the warranty supplier (LESTO). Customer Settlement Management Satisfaction of clients is measured once per year by running a survey of clients’ satisfaction. In the year 2013, satisfaction level of LESTO clients, which was estimated according to GCSI research methodology, was by 9 points higher than comparative GCSI index of European energy companies. LESTO index equals to 76, whereas average of European energy companies equals to 67 points of the index. This research shows the fact that quality of service and servicing provided by LESTO exceeds the expectations of the clients and is rated better by 1 point than a year before. 21 AB LESTO Report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 For the research of LESTO client‘s satisfaction Global Customer Satisfaction, index (GCSI) methodology was invoked, which is based on American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). GCSI is a global franchise of ASCI research methodology.

In the course of last year, changes of the website www.manoelektra.lt were implemented, clients servicing system was rearranged, processes of the Company enabling more speedy and comfortable provision of usual services were optimized, and centralized briefing of the clients about occurring failures and planned duration for their elimination was implemented. In 2013 the number of customers who uses the remote service channels (self-service website “Mano elektra” and customer service 1802) increased, while the flow of electrical energy users in LESTO customer service centers of smaller towns is decreasing. Due to changing customer needs, the Company consistently invests and expands the services provided by the telecommunications and internet channels. Remote Channel Promotion In 2013 many important services were introduced in self-service website „Mano Elektra“ (www.manoelektra.lt). From now on customers can submit applications for increasing or decreasing the capacity, changing the category of reliability or connection (movement) of new installations. The business customers can notify about a new or changed contract with independent supplier in efficient manner in self-service system. The new self-service website’s www.manoelektra.lt version was introduced on June in 2013.

From now on self-service site provide more than 30 services for private and business customers. The campaign of www.manoelektra.lt awareness raising on TV and radio was implemented at the end of the year (from October to December); the campaign attracted new users and led to greater use of installed services. The declaration of meter readings is the most often used service. This service is used by more than 50 % of regular visitors of the system. Currently 385 thousand of users registered themselves in the system, including 334 thousand domestic users. During 2013, the number of visitors of the website www.manoelektra.lt (by comparing data of the year 2012) increased from 1.711 million to 2.462 million; proportionately, unique visitors increased from 0.891 million to 1.098 million. 22 AB LESTO Report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 During 2013, by short client service telephone 1802 information was provided to more than 937 thousand clients (during relevant period of the year 2012, information was provided to 902 thousand clients), more than 380 thousand requests of the clients on various questions were received and solved (during relevant period of 2012, 517 thousand requests of the clients were received and solved). During 2013, more than 284 thousand clients were served by client service centres located in the five largest Lithuanian cities. Customer Settlement Management The clients have been using electronic means of settlement more and more often. At the end of reporting period, nearly 40 % of all payments for energy consumption were performed by electronic channels. Direct debit means one method of payment for the consumed energy and it becomes more and more popular in Lithuania. Following this method, the client pays equal sum for electricity each month and this amount is automatically deducted from client’s bank account. More than 12.5 % of LESTO customers are paying by direct debit already. Each client, who pays for electricity by means of direct debit, is personally informed about individual contribution amount settled individually. On request of LESTO clients, who selected to pay by direct debit, after carrying periodical inspections of meter readings the amount of contributions is recalculated, and also when the price of the electricity is changed. Moreover, clients themselves can select the most comfortable payment’s date, when invoice for consumed electricity is settled automatically. Clients have the possibility to declare energy consumption readings on self-service website www.manoelektra.lt, which is periodically updated. Corruption prevention LESTO does not tolerate any corruption and speaks up for fair business and transparent communication with the public authorities. The risk is minimized by the operating complex internal control mechanisms designated to identify potential corruption risks.

LESTO invests in environmentally friendly modern technology. LESTO while implementing the environmental projects attempt to reduce the negative impact of energy facilities to people and the environment and to encourage a wider public participation in the initiatives. „Darom 2013“ More than 400 workers of the electricity distribution network operator LESTO across Lithuania joined the initiative “Darom 2013 and collected more various wastes, which pollute the environment by irresponsible people. AB LESTO invited people to behave responsibly throughout the year: to protect the environment, bring waste for recycling, rationally use the resources and electric power. Electric Cars LESTO sees high potential for development of electric vehicles in the future; new technologies using energy more efficiently and their introduction to car industry compete in the market more and more, particularly in comparison with long-standing automobiles that use traditional fossil fuel. In order to run experiments and practically assess possibilities by using new cars, also their potential under Lithuanian climate and roads conditions, LESTO leased electric car for three years period in 2013. Paper Instead of usually used paper bills, we encourage our customers to choose the electronic ones. Electronic document management and archiving is easier and faster: the customers receive their bills by e-mail message and can pay them without leaving their home or by connecting to the self-service system from any computer. In order to reduce the use of paper and document management costs for paper invoices and correspondence administration, our company has implemented an electronic document management system (DocLogix), where all documents are managed and archived electronically. The company newsletter People of Electricity designed for more than 2400 of our employees was also prepared in electronic format only. Unnecessary to print documents such as interim or 24 AB LESTO Report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 annual reports, reports on social responsibility, are prepared in electronic format only. Waste Management LESTO takes care of waste management. It has contracts with waste management companies. The Company has signed a contract with the Electrical and Electronic Equipment Manufacturers and Importers Association EEPA on the collection of energy saving bulbs, batteries and small electronics waste; for this purpose there were special boxes placed in customer service centres of the Company. Natural Heritage Protection LESTO are actively engaged in implementation of one of the most important and oldest nature protection directives, i.e. the Birds Directive in Lithuania. LESTO together with the Lithuanian Ornithological Society and the Institute of Ecology for the Nature Research Center and the partners implement the project of the European Union Financial Instrument for the Environment LIFE + “The White Stork Protection in Lithuania. The stork nests built on the electricity poles are not safe either to birds or to people. When the storks touch the electrical wires they often get fatally injured; and LESTO incur losses due to electrical leakage and breaks in wires. Therefore, the aim of the project is to ensure the protection of the white storks by installing special platforms on electric poles which were safe for birds and airlines. In the beginning of 2013 LESTO finished the project and installed a total of 3,260 artificial nets. 25 AB LESTO Report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 SOCIETY To a wide extent LESTO implements long-term social responsibility projects for children, youth and public. All of them cover active inclusion of target social groups as well as ideas concerning safe and efficient usage of energy and environmental protection. Loss reduction and educational project „Operation 2020“ Until the year 2020, the Company plans to proceed with the implementation of the programme “Operation 2020” in order to motivate responsible behavior with electric devices, increase understanding of people about safety and reduce negative outcomes rising as a result of nonresponsible and malicious behavior of people. By collaborating with judiciary institutions, greater infrastructural plants and communities, 63 criminal acts were detected during the year 2013 (59 cases of thieving oil, 2 of thieving wires, 1 theft of metals and 1 equipment damage from hooliganism cases). The Company suffered loss amounting to LTL 161.3 thousand for these criminal acts (part of loss was repaid), 39 persons were arrested for doing these criminal actions. Totally per year 2013, LESTO lost technologic property of value amounting to LTL 879.3 thousand as a result of theft (in 2012 – LTL 868 thousand). Nearly half of this total loss (LTL 390 thousand) was related to Vilnius region, where volume of theft has increased nearly by one-third. In order to solve the situation in the region, in cooperation with the police commissariats preventive measures plan was prepared. In 2013, LESTO continued active collaboration with The Association of Chiefs of Local Authorities of Lithuania by participating in meetings and conferences organized by the chiefs. Utmost support against theft was provided by public spirit of the people, i.e. messages sent by the whistle-blowers provided help and led to expeditious exposing of the offenders, termination of electricity supply till transformers were repaired before they were burnt. After assessing cases of detected thefts it is possible to say that 50 % of theft cases were detected with the help of the citizens. In order to prevent thefts of the distribution network equipment LESTO cooperate with major infrastructure companies TEO, AB, AB Lithuanian Railways, Electronics collectors association (EEPA), Recycling Association (APĮA).

The representatives of the company actively participates in local community activities (meetings with chiefs of local authorities, local communities, leaders of 26 AB LESTO Report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 local government and other institutions). During 2013 the meetings with local government and community representatives were held in Šiauliai, Panevėžys and Vilnius (Trakai) and Alytus (Druskininkai) departments. For the enhancement of electricity efficiency – „To the Extent Required“ Stimulation of rational energy usage is one of underlying trends of LESTO social responsibility, contributing to environmental protection and saving energy resources due to obligations of the country to pursue the European Union programme with regard to climate change. This project strives at creating traditions of rational life of society by searching for rational way to consume electricity both in daily life and business. “The Green protocol” and “Conference for business on power efficiency”. Companies have been invited to join “The Green protocol” for three years in a row. This refers to an agreement, which is unique in the country and has been initiated by LESTO. By following this agreement, companies and organizations confirm being aware of the ideas of saving environment and stimulating rational energy usage, and their own agreement with such ideas and undertaken realization of those in practice. For the third successive year, LESTO and business daily “Verslo Žinios” organize conferences for businesses on power usage efficiency – this year more than 300 people and more than 160 companies were participating in the conference. Project for apartments In order to draw public attention to power economy as well as safety in common areas, LESTO alongside with social partners UAB “Mano būstas LT”, UAB “ACME Europe” and “UAB “Elektros taupymo sprendimai” is implementing the project “As much as needed for apartments: safe and cost-saving home”. During the project targeted for apartments of four different cities and using the means provided by partners, modern and representative lighting of stairwells and outside doors was upgraded to operate on the basis of state circle: this means that light does not fade not only due to the movement, but also due to presence of a person. By this project, the Company pursues the goal of drawing attention both to energy saving and safety aspects. During the first two days after changing lighting power consumption of stairwells, the saved energy accounted for 26-32 %. Common premises use power both for lighting and circulation of pumps and other mounted equipment. For lighting of stairwell, the used power will decrease after changing incandescent light bulbs by LED bulbs average stairwell shall pay for electricity LTL 61.33 less. For people living in apartments changing of incandescent light bulbs with LED bulbs should cost LTL 480. Investment into the new bulbs will be repaid within the period of 8 months. 27 AB LESTO Report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 Project of modern streets’ lighting In autumn of 2013, LESTO together with Birštonas local authorities and Italian public lightning company “Enet Sole” started an experimental project on efficiency of illuminators based on LED technologies “As much as needed for the city”. 14 usual street illuminators were changed with LED illuminators during the project. LESTO equipped required recording appliances and financed illuminator replacement works. Technical specifications of LED illuminators reflect situation that by modernizing lighting of streets, municipality could save 50-60 % of consumed electricity. According to LESTO data, 150-160 thousand illuminators currently are equipped in the largest cities of Lithuania, and most of them use sodium lamps of capacity from 70 to 250 W. According to preliminary assessment, in 2012 alone municipalities consumed 63.127 million kWh for lighting of streets and paid for consumed power LTL 25 million. Educational project on power saving for children and youth “Elektromagija” Educational initiative “Elektromagija” is pointed towards young people – it is created for training children and youth on power benefits, hazards and safety questions. The initiative's aim is to encourage students to learn safe handling of electricity and electrical facilities, to promote interest in the responsible use of energy, as well as environmental and sustainable development ideas. In the year 2013, students were invited to play new interactive game “Electromagical puzzle”. The aim of this game is both being better acquainted with the sources and electric appliances, and as a stimulation to use electricity safely in order to avoid possible hazards. Main prize of the competition was a tablet computer. While competing for the main prize, children registered more than 2 thousand gaming results; totally the website www.elektromagija.lt was visited by 7,500 players within the period of less than one month. Besides the winner of the main prize, 10 children were selected by drawing lots, who received the books stimulating creativity – “Good ideas with Olstein Kristiansen and the cow of ideas” and “Elektromagija.lt” notebooks. In autumn of 2013, LESTO and Vilniaus kompiuterininkų akademija (VKA) agreed on collaboration and creation of new projects that would be realized by the students. They would receive tasks concerning electric energy – to create games, texts and other sights to visitors of the website “Elektromagija.lt”. Collaboration with academic community A new curriculum module of Energy economics was started in ISM Executive School in 2013. LESTO contributed to preparation of the module content and appointment of qualified lecturers. Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences (LEU), implementing “Green university” mission and striving at the development of social liability together with network distribution operator LESTO, organized a public lecture for academic community of the university “Social responsibility, or how organizations can achieve social benefits”. During the lecture, good practice of typical business social responsibility was discussed by presenting the ways used by University for training consumption culture, motivating students to use electricity, water, gas and other energy resources rationally. Lithuanian Children and Youth Centre ran Global education week events for the whole month in November, where efforts were made to draw attention of 28 AB LESTO Report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 youth to human action aiming at the environment, quality of human life, stimulation of interest in regular development ideas implementation as well as creating new values of consumption culture. During the week, an action day “Jump to sustainable life style” was organized. During this day, the students were visiting workshops and participating in sessions organized by event partners; a lecture “Electric ideas: from bulb to electro-car” provided by electricity distribution company – LESTO, reaped most attention of the students. Cooperation with “Caritas” To us, one of the crucial aspects of our social responsibility is volunteering of our staff and their personal contributions over 450 various gifts to the creation of a more sustainable society and environment as they join environmental projects and unite to help those in need, as we did in cooperation with the catholic charity organization “Caritas”. Crime prevention and briefing the people In summer of 2013, LESTO received a message about cases of fraud by simulating electricians, who tried to intrude into clients’ homes and capture money from clients in a fraudulent manner. LESTO invited people to be watchful and ask all and any home-visiting specialists to show official certificates. Besides, residents must watch, whether arriving transport is marked by special signs. LESTO also briefed the property buyers and stimulated them to check, whether the previous owners of the property had fully settled the invoices with electricity distributing company LESTO, and how it is possible to avoid termination of electricity supply as a result of extraneous debts. Free events on „Energetics Days“ April 17th is considered as the date of the beginning of electrical era in Lithuania.

The events were attended by more than 800 guests. Research on the opinion of the society In the beginning of 2013, following LESTO‘s order, „Baltijos tyrimai“ conducted a research on public opinion about habits of electricity consumption . Most participants had stated that they try to save electricity at home; however, when asked about the means of saving, one third of them could not mention even one. Most of the participants of the study associate savings only with 29 AB LESTO Report on Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 economic lamps and switched off lights. One third of all respondents know about the means to save electricity, but do not use any of them. Improvements in services for clients with special needs In June, LESTO conducted a research, during which the possibilities for improvements in services for physically disabled and elderly people, taking into account their specific needs, were assessed. The study was conducted by „Socialiniu klausimu sprendimai”.
