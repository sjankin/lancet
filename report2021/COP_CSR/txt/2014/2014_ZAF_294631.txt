In this interim report, you will find key indicators and a selection of the progress we have made with our corporate responsibility efforts in 2013. This PDF was created from the content of an online-version, which offers additional, interactive features. ➝ http://www.merckgroup.com/cr-report2013 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 4 Progress Corporate responsibility is a part of our daily conduct and a fundamental prerequisite for our business success. On the following pages we present a selection of our progress and activities in the area of corporate responsibility in 2013. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 5 PROGRESS Compliance New process for the selection of business partners With the introduction of the Global Business Partner Risk Management Policy, Merck made great progress in the field of compliance in 2013. Merck applies a systematic, risk-oriented approach to the selection of sales-related business partners such as distributors, agents, and wholesalers. In essence, the greater we estimate the risk to be with regard to a certain country, ­region, type of service, etc., the closer and more carefully we examine the company before doing business with them. Merck’s Global Business Partner Risk Management aims to ensure that business partners are selected diligently in order to minimize the danger of adverse legal, reputational, and financial effects. This process is especially ­concerned with fighting corrupt practices. Adopted at the end of 2012, the Global Business Partner Risk ­Management Policy now constitutes a fundamental component of the selection process for business partners, along with their overall assessment. The implementation of this policy is leading to an auditable business partner selection p­ rocess with system-based documentation of relevant partner and business information, approval and evaluation. Through this systematic process, we are both minimizing our risk as well as taking into account the modified requirements resulting from new anti-corruption legislation such as the UK Bribery Act. This policy, which is in effect throughout the Merck Group, encapsulates the eight mandatory principles to be taken into account when selecting business partners. The policy stipulates that we shall only collaborate with partners who comply with all applicable laws, who do not engage in bribery, who adhere to environmental, health and safety guidelines, and who refuse to tolerate ­discrimination. Furthermore, we require them to demonstrate a commitment to internationally recognized human rights and labor standards (ILO), as well as to our own compliance standards as defined in our Code of Conduct. In order to train the relevant employees on the revised selection process, Merck’s Group Compliance function ­initiated a training campaign in 2013. “Train the Trainer” kick-off events were held in Darmstadt as well as other ­regions to spread awareness of the new policy. At these events, employees from our Group Compliance ­organization received training, which they then took back to their respective sites to share with those (sales and distribution) employees affected by the new policy. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 6 PROGRESS Human Rights Charter Group-wide human rights charter adopted Merck’s corporate culture has always been characterized by responsible conduct – whether with respect to products, employees, the environment, or society. In line with this approach, Merck is committed to protecting human rights, as demonstrated by our participation in the UN Global Compact. In 2012, we conducted an extensive human rights risk assessment in the course of implementing the Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, which were endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011. Based on the results of this assessment, Merck adopted a Group-wide human rights charter at the end of 2013, thereby achieving another milestone. The charter underscores our commitment to respecting and protecting human rights. It brings together and complements other regulations and guidelines that pertain to human rights, such as our Code of Conduct, our Social Charter, our Environment, Health and Safety Policy, and our Charter on Access to Medicines in Developing Countries. The Human Rights Charter defines our company’s expectations while increasing awareness of human rights within the company. It also allows us to more accurately assess Group-specific risks and to align our ­business operations with our Values. In the course of drafting the charter, we asked external stakeholders what they thought of our approach to ­human rights. These stakeholders included experts for companies and human rights from various countries, trade unions, associations, and specialists in individual aspects addressed in the charter. This step was crucial as it allowed us to consider the situation from various perspectives. Within the German Global Compact Network, Merck is a member of the Human Rights Peer Learning Group, a working group that facilitates best-practice sharing with regard to business and human rights. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 7 PROGRESS Diabetes awareness The Merck Capacity Advancement Program (CAP): Awareness and training on diabetes The rising number of people with diabetes all over the world is a call to prioritize diabetes care and awareness. Merck is committed to improving the accessibility and quality of diabetes treatment. The Merck Capacity Advancement Program (CAP), established in 2012, is a five-year program that aims to expand the professional capacity in Sub-Saharan Africa with a focus on diabetes in the following areas: R&D, clinical research, supply chain integrity and efficiency, pharmacovigilance, medical education for pre-med undergraduates and healthcare providers in rural areas, and community awareness. Merck is collaborating with ministries of health, healthcare institutions, communities, universities, local research institutes, diabetes patients associations, and media. The common goal is to raise awareness of ­diabetes by educating the public and supporting healthcare systems on ways to prevent, diagnose and manage diabetes effectively. One of the key success factors of the CAP is the country-specific, long-term, partnership-based approach, ­featuring initiatives that are aligned with the national strategies of individual countries. In order to inform our CAP approach, we held 154 stakeholder meetings in Kenya, Uganda, Mauritius, Namibia, Mozambique, and Ghana. A wide variety of stakeholders has been involved in order to explore the countries’ needs, thereby ­tailoring the learning materials and the CAP implementation to suit the local communities. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 8 Under the Capacity Advancement Program, by the end of 2013 more than 500 medical students from the ­University of Nairobi, the University of Namibia and the Makerere University in Uganda had benefited from a ­clinical diabetes management training program accredited in Europe, enabling them to act as diabetes ­ambassadors in rural and underserved regions. In 2014, the program will expand to Tanzania, Mozambique, ­Angola, Ghana, Nigeria, and Ethiopia; it aims to reach about 9,000 pre-med undergraduates by 2018. The Merck community awareness campaign “Get InformedGet ActiveGet Healthier” has thus far reached more than 3,000 people in Kenya and Uganda, providing them with free screening and medical checkups. The campaign has been implemented in partnership with the Ministries of Health of both Kenya and Uganda, the Kenya Diabetes Management & Information Centre, the Uganda Diabetes Association, and universities located in the individual countries. Patient education materials were tailored in collaboration with local patient diabetes foundations. More than 50,000 leaflets and 4,000 posters have been distributed at supermarkets, healthcare centers and “Get InformedGet ActiveGet Healthier” training camps in order to reach community members. By 2018, up to 20,000 people will have received free screening and medical checkups. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 9 Progress Smart windows Smart windows improve the energy efficiency of buildings Besides liquid crystals for displays such as televisions, monitors and tablets, Merck is also developing liquid ­crystals for new applications. For instance, we are working with architects, glass makers and facade ­manufacturers to create the windows of tomorrow. Our ambitious goal is to utilize smart windows to make buildings more energy-efficient. The idea behind these windows is that their properties can be modified at the touch of a button. They can be tinted darker or made more transparent depending on environmental conditions such as the season or the time of day, thereby allowing more or less light and/or warmth to enter the building. The windows thus help regulate the temperature in interior spaces; in winter, more light is let in, and in summer less. Merck’s smart energy glass technology is based on liquid crystal mixtures containing tailor-made rod-shaped dyes. When a small electric field is applied, the dye-doped liquid crystals change their orientation to absorb ­either more or less light. This makes it possible to control the transparency of the glass as desired. Within ­seconds, the window can be switched from a bright, transparent state to a defined colored, dark state. These windows boost the energy efficiency of buildings since they reduce HVAC costs. To protect people in buildings from glaring sunlight, it is also possible to adjust the window’s level of tinting individually. The advantage here over external blinds is that the window is not completely darkened nor the outside view blocked. Consequently, lights need not be turned on during the day, and employees can still look out of their windows, resulting in a pleasant work environment. Merck’s smart energy glass technology can also make the windows self-powering. Part of the light absorbed by the dyes is channeled to the glass edges, where solar cells embedded in the frames convert it into electricity to power the windows. Merck is collaborating with the Dutch company Peer+ to develop this concept. The first set of pilot projects were initiated in the Netherlands in 2013 and have proven successful. These windows will also be installed in the innovation center under construction at Merck Group headquarters in Darmstadt, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2014. Merck’s smart energy glass technology boosts the energy efficiency of buildings, conserves energy, and increases people’s sense of well-being – a sustainable and innovative solution for the future. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 10 PROGRESS Design for Sustainability Design for Sustainability: Improving product properties and reducing environmental impacts Design for Sustainability (DfS) is an approach to product development at Merck Millipore that looks to minimize the environmental and health impact at each stage of the product life cycle from manufacturing through use to disposal. At the same time, we look to maximize features that improve product performance and ease of use. We incorporate sustainability considerations early in the design process before impacts of design decisions are locked in, and we use a set of criteria for major impact areas like materials, energy and waste to measure ­improvements. These approaches help reduce energy and water consumption, create more productive processes that minimize waste, streamline packaging, and potentially reduce associated costs. The benefits come both ­during the manufacturing process at Merck Millipore as well as during product usage for the customer. A cross-functional DfS working group including R&D, Marketing, Quality, EHS (Environment, Health and Safety), and Operations (packaging) has worked to develop the DfS processes and criteria as well as propose that the process be a formal part of our product development. Starting in 2014, the DfS process is being applied to Merck Millipore product development projects. Design for Sustainability principles in action: Clarisolve® Depth Filters, used in cell culture processing, were launched in 2013. With reduced pre-flushing ­requirements of the product as an important goal of the design, we completed a Life Cycle Assessment to ­quantify this reduction and other environment-related improvements. The results show that significant progress has been achieved, especially for the use phase of the product. Compared to the alternative product (Millistak+ Pod depth filter) for producing one batch at the customer, Clarisolve® is characterized by 63% reduction in use-phase energy consumption, which is equivalent to avoiding emissions from 21 gallons of gas, by a 46% ­reduction in use-phase water consumption, and by a 24% reduction in solid waste mass at the user facility. This lowers the environmental burden and helps customers to meet their own sustainability goals. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 11 Also in 2013 the EZ-Fit Manifold for laboratory filtration was launched. During the design process, the DfS approach was followed, leading to improved handling, reduced energy use in autoclave, and reduced waste from materials, packaging and disposal (compared to the predecessor Hydrosol Manifold). The 38% reduction in ­emissions from shipping one unit to a typical customer location is equivalent to saving 240 hours of light bulb use (75 watt incandescent bulb).

The aim was to further improve adherence to internationally recognized compliance, environmental, and social standards along supply chains, as well as to prevent violations of those standards. Throughout the world, Merck procures raw materials, products and services from several thousand business ­associates, who in turn have their own suppliers and sub-suppliers. It is therefore an enormous undertaking to ensure that supply chains comply with CR standards. Our activities focus on our direct business partners. Through our Group Procurement Policy, updated in 2013, we are ensuring that our procurement processes ­adhere to CR standards, which includes the selection, assessment and management of suppliers. This procurement policy reflects numerous internal and external guidelines, such as the Merck Code of Conduct, our Social Charter, our EHS policy, and ISO standard 14001. Standard operating procedures for Group Procurement have been revised to reflect this policy. To complement our procurement policy, we drafted the Merck Responsible Sourcing Principles and integrated them Group-wide into our general terms and conditions in 2013. These principles define what we require of our suppliers with regard to responsible conduct, highlighting the responsibility of our suppliers to apply our ­corporate responsibility standards to their upstream value chain. A key element of our optimized supplier management is reviewing and monitoring the CR standards applied by our suppliers. In addition to requiring supplier self-disclosures from both new and existing suppliers, Merck ­conducts annual sustainability audits based on the potential risk posed by a supplier. In 2013, we conducted 22 audits. We found four suppliers with critical flaws, and 20 suppliers with major defects. We demanded that these suppliers provide us with a corrective action plan (CAPA), which describes the course of action needed to address the issues. Auditors will be reviewing their progress. Particularly when it comes to critical flaws, we ­consider the option of terminating business relations if the problems are not sufficiently corrected. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 13 PROGRESS Climate protection & energy efficiency EDISON – our program for climate protection and energy efficiency Being a responsible company, we are resolute in our quest to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Merck has set itself the goal of reducing its ­greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (relative to the 2006 baseline). While our energy-related emissions remained largely stable in 2013, we ­recorded an increase in our process-related emissions1. Although we reduced process-related emissions per product unit by 21%, overall total emissions rose due to a significant increase in production volume. Overall CO2eq ­emissions in 2013 totaled 524 metric kilotons (2012: 502 metric kilotons). Our climate protection program EDISON consolidates all climate protection and energy efficiency activities of the Merck Group. In 2013, we once more identified a number of projects to help us achieve our CO2 reduction targets. We are now conducting around 300 individual projects under the auspices of Progress 2013 EDISON. Around two-thirds of these have already been launched, or are in the Reduction of greenhouse gas process of being implemented. Larger projects include the construction of emissions by around 1%, carbon-neutral biomass power plants in Jaffrey, New Hampshire (USA) and ­relative to the 2006 baseline Goa, India. Approved in 2012 respectively 2013, they are scheduled to go on line in autumn 2014 and will reduce CO2 emissions by around 3,500 metric tons per year in Jaffrey, and 11,500 metric tons per year in Goa. 1 At Merck, process-related emissions are released during a certain production process. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 14 Through the cogeneration plant at our Gernsheim site in Germany that went on line in mid-2013, we are saving around 6,000 metric tons of CO2 per year.­ Case study: Getting Energy management plays a key role in our efforts for sustainable energy energy from a nutshell ­efficiency and climate change mitigation. Merck‘s production sites in At our site in Goa, India, ­Darmstadt and Gernsheim account for around 40% of Merck‘s global energy we are currently constructing consumption. In 2012, both of these sites qualified for ISO 50001 – a power plant that will utilize Energy Management System certificates, which were reaffirmed in 2013. climate-neutral biomass Our ­Taoyuan site in Taiwan received the ISO 50001 certificate in 2013 for as fuel. the first time.

By 2020, we intend to decrease the Group-wide CO2 emissions of our company car fleet by 30% relative to the 2012 baseline. Merck‘s ­vehicles will be more fuel-efficient and emit less CO2, which will enable us to contribute to climate change mitigation and cut down costs. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 15 PROGRESS Diversity and Inklusion Increased success through a diverse workforce A diverse workforce can boost innovation, team performance, and business ­success, as well as make a company highly attractive as an employer. We want to benefit from the opportunities offered by a heterogeneous workforce, which is why we established the Diversity Council in 2013. Consisting of executive managers from all divisions as well as from select Group functions, this council is responsible for developing and elaborating Merck‘s diversity and ­inclusion strategy. Our current focus areas are internationality, demography, and the gender ratio. In 2013, 25% of the management positions at Merck were held by women, which means that we reached our strategic goal of raising this percentage up Progress 2013 to 25% to 30%. And we intend to further increase this ratio by 2016. Fiscal 25% of the management 2013 was the first time that a woman was appointed as head of a Merck ­positions at Merck held Group ­division. by women Since we are an international global player, one of our fundamental principles is to recruit employees from the countries in which we operate and offer them career development opportunities. Currently, people from 114 nations work at Merck. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 16 In Europe and the United States particularly, we are addressing demographic change through various programs; this includes adapting workplaces to the needs of older employees as well as establishing a health management program to maintain their ability to do their jobs. Manager and employee conduct represents a key success factor in the implementation of our corporate strategy. In 2013, we developed a new competency model describing the type of conduct that supports Merck‘s strategic alignment and fosters business success. The types of behavior represented in the six competencies promote ­diversity and inclusion within the company; they provide a crucial basis for all development activities, for ­assessing performance, and for recruiting new employees. The 6 Core Competencies support Diversity & Inclusion Customer-focused RESULT-ORIENTED “Establishes a culture of foreseeing “Establishes a culture of setting and ­customer and consumer needs and achieving challenging goals that take ­realizing organizational offerings” overall business needs into ­consideration” GLOBAL EFFICIENt “Owns the alignment of embracing “Establishes a culture of handling ­diversity and inclusion as well as ­ambiguity in the organization” ­working with people from diverse ­backgrounds and cultural differences” INNOVATIVE ENGAGED “Establishes a culture of the “Establishes a culture of building ­implementation of new work routines ­collaborative networks across the­ within own area of responsibility while ­organization and creating an open, considering overall business needs” positive atmosphere at work” In order to foster diversity and inclusion within the company, we engage in numerous activities both Group-wide ­­ and at the local level. These include mentoring programs and special advanced training on topics such as leadership skills and self-marketing. Diversity and inclusion at Merck is also furthered by internal networks initiated by Merck employees, such as the International Community and Women at Merck, each of which represents the ­interests of a different group. In addition, we are also supporting external networks that work toward diversity and inclusion in the professional world. For instance, in October 2013, Merck hosted the European summit of the Healthcare Businesswomen´s Association (HBA) in Darmstadt. There, attendees discussed the development and advancement of leadership skills for professionals in the health industry – in particular pertaining to women. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 17 PROGRESS Occupational health and safety Number of accidents lower in 2013 as well Merck considers the prevention of work-related illness and workplace ­accidents to be a matter of course for any responsible employer. We therefore set ourselves the goal of reducing the lost time injury rate (LTIR – workplace ­accidents resulting in missed work per million work hours) to 2.5 by 2015. In 2013, as in previous years, we again outperformed this goal, achieving an LTIR of 2.2. We are now working to maintain this level, although our top ­priority is of course to prevent any and all accidents. Progress 2013 In 2013, Merck achieved an LTIR of 2.2. In 2013, Merck presented the Safety Excellence Award for the fourth time, which recognizes those production sites with no workplace accidents on ­record for the year. More than half of all Merck‘s production sites achieved this goal in 2013, with 38 out of 63 sites having received the award. The consistent reduction in the accident rate is particularly attributable to the BeSafe! program, which was initiated in 2010. Since its launch, numerous ­accident prevention and occupational safety measures have been ­implemented at our sites throughout the world. We are focusing heavily 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 18 on our production sites and on training the employees there on the prevention of behavior-related accidents. Nevertheless, our goal is to reduce the accident rate across all of our sites. BeSafe! is a Group-wide program with harmonized standards; local modules allow the program to be adapted to fit the particular needs and preconditions of the individual sites. For instance, our sites each take a different ­approach to engaging managers in the safety culture and building their buy-in; they have their own methods of reinforcing a sense of personal responsibility among staff as well as increasing employee awareness. In 2013, we continued to sensitize our employees worldwide to workplace hazards through numerous initiatives, activities and awareness campaigns, and we also conducted training programs. For instance, newly minted EHS (Environment, Health, Safety) managers now take part in the EHS StartUp! training seminar on occupational health and safety. Furthermore, regional EHS forums in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia ­promote best-practice sharing and educate employees on new topics. In September 2013, 26 EHS managers ­attended the EHS Forum hosted by the Poseung site in South Korea. Our site in Bari, Italy held the third EHS Best Practice Sharing Meeting in December 2013. The more than 50 participants included EHS managers from various Merck sites, as well as representatives of local and ­international companies, representatives from the Italian manufacturing and service company association ­Confindustria, and representatives from the Polytechnic University of Bari. In addition to a presentation on the theory of behavior-based safety, attendees also shared best practices pertaining to safety. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 19 PROGRESS Schistosomiasis Working together to fight schistosomiasis in Africa Since 2007, Merck has been supporting the World Health Organization (WHO) in the fight against the worm ­disease schistosomiasis in Africa. This ailment is highly prevalent in Africa, Asia and Latin America and is one of the most commonly occurring tropical disease in Africa, second only to Malaria. Although the Merck ­Praziquantel Donation Program was originally intended to run for a limited duration, Merck is continuing the fight until the parasitic disease schistosomiasis has been eliminated in Africa. In order to reach this goal, in 2012 Merck pledged to significantly expand its donation, a tenfold increase of up to 250 million praziquantel tablets per year in the medium term. Our efforts to fight schistosomiasis reflect the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and also constitute part of the London Declaration initiative to fight neglected tropical diseases, which was launched by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012. Since the start of the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program, Merck has donated over 160 million tablets. To date, more than 38 million patients in total have thus been treated, consisting primarily of school children. In 2013, around 50 million tablets were provided to the African countries of Angola, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Sudan, and Tanzania. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Progress 20 Good morning Good morning Now we are going to children! sir! learn about... should know What children about bilharzia Oh!

Following the success of the pilot projects, the program is now being rolled out in Senegal with 750,000 brochures and in Malawi with 250,000, in addition to the 75,000 informational posters that are being printed. In order to reach more children, Merck is paying for the brochures to be translated into Swahili, Arabic and Portuguese. Besides its donation and awareness programs, Merck has joined a public-private partnership to research a ­praziquantel formulation for young children since the current tablets are only approved for adults and children over six. As part of its initiative to fight neglected tropical diseases, the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation has provided US$ 1.15 million to Merck and its project partners Astellas Pharma Inc., the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, and TI Pharma to conduct preclinical research. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP Corporate Responsibility REPORT Update 2013 Indicators Economics, Compliance, Employees, Environment, Society The figures presented below pertain to the entire Merck Group, unless otherwise indicated.

Merck achieved strong full-year results, meeting its objectives for 2013 despite a challenging market environment. The company, which offers top-quality high-tech products in the pharmaceutical and chemical sectors, reported solid organic sales growth of 4.2% to € 10.7 billion. Thanks to the accelerated implementation of efficiency measures, EBITDA pre one-time items increased by 9.7% to a record € 3.25 billion. The EBITDA pre margin increased by nearly three percentage points from 27.6% to 30.4%. Merck posted a considerable increase of 67.2% in the operating result (EBIT), which amounted to € 1.61 billion (2012: € 964 million). This was due on the one hand to the good performance of operating business and on the other to the sharp decline in the very high level of one-time items incurred in 2012 due to restructuring measures. At € 1,504 million, R&D costs in 2013 remained at the 2012 level.

In Merck's Annual Report an LTIR of 2.1 was reported for 2013. Due to new data provided from one site the LTIR has been increased to 2.2. ** Incl. temps. Merck employees have been included in the calculation of the indicators as well as supervised employees of external companies. Independent contractors have not been taken into account. Using the LTIR, we record work-related accidents of Merck employees that involve at least one day of missed work. A work-related accident is an injury that results from the type of work, in the course of doing said work, and that has no internal cause (cumulative trauma). Work-related accidents are considered relevant if they occur on the premises, on business trips, during a transport accident, in the course of external influences (e.g. natural disasters), or due to criminal acts involving personal injury. Commuting accidents and accidents during company sporting activities are not included. First-aid incidents are generally not included in the LTIR since these usually do not result in more than one day of missed work. We have set ourselves the goal of reducing the LTIR rate to 2.5 by 2015. In 2013, by means of targeted accident prevention measures we again outperformed this goal as we did in the previous two years, achieving an LTIR of 2.2. For Merck KGaA (24% of the employees of the Merck Group) we report work-related illnesses if these have been diagnosed and certified by a physician. In the reporting period, one case of work-induced illness was recorded. We do not keep track of the number of work-related illnesses throughout the entire Merck Group.

Signatories of the initiative commit themselves to ten ­principles based on key UN conventions regarding human rights, labor ­standards, ­environmental protection, and anti-­ corruption. At the same time, the compact obliges the signatories to actively engage themselves in propagating the principles within their own sphere of influence. www.unglobalcompact.org Merck has been a Global Compact ­participant since 2005. The following­ ­Communication on Progress (CoP) presents the key measures that Merck took in 2013 to implement the principles of the Global Compact. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 CEO’s Declaration of continued support 53 CEO’s Declaration of continued support Responsibility is not optional at Merck – it is part of who we are. For more than three centuries, Merck has combined entrepreneurial success with responsible conduct and has made the fulfillment of our corporate responsibility an integral part of our identity. To align our efforts internationally, we joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2005. We are committed to this path and stand firm in our continued support of the ten principles established by the compact, which cover human rights, labor regulations, environmental protection, and anti-corruption. We want to leverage our knowledge and expertise to help address the major challenges of our time. For example, as a leading company in the pharmaceutical and chemical sectors, Merck is well placed to contribute meaningfully in the field of healthcare. Access to medical care is a universal human right and we want to make sure that it becomes a reality for everyone. For that reason, we have partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO) to combat the tropical disease schistosomiasis. We are donating praziquantel tablets, which are needed to treat this dangerous and wide-spread parasitic worm disease. To date, 38 million children in 19 countries have already been treated. And we intend to do more. After all, Merck has committed to donating tablets until schistosomiasis has been eliminated in Africa. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 CEO’s Declaration of continued support 54 Working to improve global access to health is one aspect of our responsibility efforts, but by no means the only one. As this progress report shows, responsibility is a basic tenet of our activities. We are living the principles of the Global Compact throughout our company – and will continue to do so.

Commitment, principles & goals Our entrepreneurial approach as a conscientious, responsible company includes ethical conduct as well as a commitment to human rights and core international labor standards. Our primary policy documents include: Code of Conduct: The Merck Code of Conduct is a compulsory set of rules for all Merck employees. It explains the principles for interacting with business associates, general partners, colleagues, and employees, as well as with the communities in which we operate. Thus, it supports all employees in acting ethically – not only in their interactions with one another, but also outside the company. Human Rights Charter: At the end of 2013, Merck adopted a Group-wide human rights charter that underscores our commitment to respecting and protecting human rights. It brings together and complements existing regulations and guidelines that pertain to human rights, such as our Code of Conduct, our Social Charter, our Environment, Health and Safety Policy, and our Charter on Access to Health in Developing Countries. The Human Rights Charter defines our company's expectations while increasing awareness of human rights within the company. It also allows us to more accurately assess Group-specific risks and to align our business operations with our Values. Since the Human Rights Charter includes core labor standards of the International Labor Organization (ILO), the Human Rights Charter is replacing the Merck Social Charter. Procurement Policy: Through our Group Procurement Policy, updated in 2013, we are ensuring that our procurement processes adhere to CR standards, which includes the selection, assessment and management of suppliers. This policy reflects numerous internal and external guidelines, such as the Merck Code of Conduct, our Social Charter, our EHS policy, and ISO standard 14001. Standard operating procedures for Group Procurement have been revised to reflect this policy. Merck Responsible Sourcing Principles: To complement our procurement policy, we drafted the Merck Responsible Sourcing Principles and integrated them Group-wide into our general terms and conditions in 2013. These principles define what we require of our suppliers with regard to responsible conduct, highlighting the responsibility of our suppliers to apply our corporate responsibility standards to their upstream value chain. As a member company of the German Federal Association for Materials Management, Purchasing and Logistics (Bundesverband der Materialwirtschaft Einkauf und Logistik e.V. – BME), Merck supports the BME compliance initiative against corruption, cartels and child labor. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 Human rights 56 Access to Health Charter: As described in our Charter on Access to Health in Developing Countries, Access to Health (A2H) is a strategic priority for the Merck Group. Our A2H strategy is designed to contribute to overcoming barriers to access for underserved populations and communities in developing countries. Recognizing that access is a complex and multifaceted challenge with no one-size-fits-all solution, our programs and initiatives are tailored to global, regional and local needs. We take a holistic needs-based approach, working in partnerships to achieve results. Our A2H work cuts across our businesses and is a component of our Corporate Responsibility strategy. Merck is committed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to working with partners to achieve them, as well as to ensuring that health remains an integral component of the post-2015 development framework. Through our efforts to expand access to health solutions, we are working to make Merck a health partner of choice in low and middle income countries as they continue to develop. Our robust patient needs-based approach to addressing the complex challenge of providing access is designed around four pillars, known as the 4A´s for Access to High Quality Health Solutions: Availability, Affordability, Awareness, and Accessibility. Implementation Compliance management: We support compliance with statutory and company-internal rules and regulations through our compliance organization. The central Group function Compliance, with the Group Compliance Officer (GCO) and other specialists, is responsible for maintaining and further developing the compliance program. In the subsidiaries abroad, local compliance officers are responsible for implementing the compliance measures. They are advised by Group Compliance and provided with training documentation, among other forms of support. The local compliance officers report to the GCO at regular intervals. The GCO in turn reports at least once a year to the Executive Board, with a focus on the status of compliance activities, compliance risks, and serious compliance violations. The Executive Board informs the supervisory bodies at least once a year about the key compliance issues. Compliance management is continuously adapted to current requirements. Compliance training: Our employees receive regular training on compliance topics via classroom and online courses. Employees at all levels of the hierarchy are familiarized with Merck's requirements with regard to the Code of Conduct. In 2013, around 108,000 compliance-related courses were conducted for 34,733 employees. Furthermore, 24,168 employees (thereof 12,390 employees ranked Global Grade 10+) were trained in anti-corruption (35,003 courses). The training plan is regularly updated and adjusted in response to new developments. In addition, classroom sessions are adapted to local needs. Human Rights Risk Assessment: In 2012, Merck conducted a Group-wide human rights risk assessment based on the Organizational Capacity Assessment Instrument (OCAI). It aimed to systematically examine and evaluate the effects of Merck's business operations on human rights and the potential risks, as well as to determine the next steps to be taken. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 Human rights 57 Supplier management: Supplier Management is a core task within Procurement and comprises the entire process of supplier assessment, evaluation, development, and phasing-out. It aims at optimizing the performance of the entire supply base in order to realize added value for Merck by using a transparent, holistic and globally uniform approach. Merck expects its suppliers to comply with fundamental rules, such as rules against corruption and child labor, and sets minimum requirements regarding work standards. To complement our Procurement Policy, we developed the Merck Responsible Sourcing Principles, which were incorporated Group-wide into our general terms and conditions in 2013. In order to document our suppliers´ commitment to environmental and social standards, we use supplier self-assessment questionnaires. In 2013, around 600 questionnaires were completed by new and select suppliers (on the basis of a risk analysis). The Group standard Sustainability Audits in Supply Chain regulates audits aimed at evaluating working conditions at key suppliers of the Merck Group, as well as the suppliers' impact on the environment and community. Promoting access to health care in developing countries: Through our programs and our charter on Access to Health in Developing Countries, we strive to lead and collaborate with others to improve global access to medicine. The charter covers the topics of product pricing, intellectual property, research & development for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), anti-counterfeiting as well as pharmaceutical product donations and philanthropy. An important component of our Access to Medicine activities is the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program. Through this initiative, we have been supporting the World Health Organization since 2007 in the fight against schistosomiasis in Africa, a widespread tropical worm disease. Since the program was launched, around 150 million tablets containing the active ingredient praziquantel have been donated, resulting in the treatment of more than 38 million children. In 2007, Merck made a commitment to donate to WHO 200 million tablets of Cesol® 600, which contain the active ingredient praziquantel. By 2017, this was intended to have treated around 27 million children for schistosomiasis in the most severely affected countries in Africa. In 2012, we announced that we will continue our efforts to fight schistosomiasis until the disease has been eliminated in Africa. To this end, Merck is increasing the number of praziquantel tablets donated in the medium term, raising the total to up to 250 million tablets annually. In 2012, our commitment to access to medicines was ranked eighth in the Access to Medicine Index, which ranks pharma companies' access to medicine activities. The next ranking will be published in 2014. Gauging the results Compliance audits: Compliance audits are conducted as part of general assessments by Internal Auditing. The audits focus on the existence and quality of compliance guidelines, processes and structures. In addition, our sites are reviewed for violations of our Code of Conduct and Social Charter. The topic of corruption and the requirements of the Social Charter are an integral part of our standard audit program and are audited within the scope of general audits at our sites. Altogether 30 audits were conducted to check for corruption in 2013. In addition, a total of 27 sites in 27 countries were audited on Social Charter topics in 2013. No violations of the Social Charter rules were found. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 Human rights 58 Central SpeakUp Line for compliance violations: All employees are called upon to report compliance violations to their supervisor, Legal, HR or other relevant departments. Via the SpeakUp Line, a central reporting system, employees can report violations by telephone or via a web-based application in their respective national language, free of charge and anonymously. The reports received are reviewed by the Group Compliance Office (GCO) and submitted to the Compliance committee to coordinate the necessary investigation of the facts. The Compliance committee consists of senior representatives of the Internal Auditing, Compliance, Group Security, Data privacy and Human Resources departments. It monitors the processing of reported incidents and initiates, if necessary, corresponding corrective measures. Disciplinary actions are also taken, where needed, against the employee who has violated a compliance rule. These actions may range from a simple warning up to dismissal of the employee, depending on the severity of the violation. In 2012, 20 compliance-related reports were received via the SpeakUp Line. In five cases in 2012, the alleged violation of our rules of conduct was confirmed. These cases were investigated and reported, action plans were implemented and monitored by Group Compliance. Merck takes such misconduct very seriously and takes appropriate action, including dismissals in line with the applicable laws. 2013 data will be published in June 2014 in our Corporate Responsibility Report – Update 2013. Supplier audits: To assess our suppliers' adherence to social, environmental, and workplace safety standards, a total of 22 supplier audits were conducted in 2013. The suppliers audited were selected on the basis of a risk analysis. We found four suppliers with critical flaws, and 20 suppliers with major defects. We demanded that these suppliers provide us with a corrective action and preventive action plan (CAPA), which describes the course of action needed to address the issues. Auditors will be reviewing their progress. Particularly when it comes to critical flaws, we consider the option of terminating business relations if the problems are not sufficiently corrected. Evaluation of the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program: Since the start of the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program, over 150 million tablets have been donated. To date, more than 38 million patients in total have thus been treated, consisting primarily of school children. In 2013, around 50 million tablets were provided to the African countries of Angola, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Sudan, and Tanzania. As part of a Bertelsmann Foundation project on corporate social engagement, we collaborated on the development of the IOOI method (Input, Output, Outcome, Impact), a way of gauging and assessing social engagement. We have applied this method to our donation program to combat schistosomiasis, which allows us to evaluate the progress of the project. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 Labor standards 59 Labor standards Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labor; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Commitment, principles & goals Our entrepreneurial approach as a conscientious, responsible company includes ethical conduct as well as a commitment to human rights and core international labor standards. The Human Rights Charter listed under Principles 1 and 2 is the primary policy document on compliance with core labor standards within the Merck Group. At Merck, respecting our employees’ dignity, treating them fairly and in compliance with laws and regulations is a matter of course. As a matter of principle, we are guided by the ILO Core Labor Standards. We adhere especially to this claim with respect to the following topics and regularly audit our sites against these requirements: Freedom of association, no forced labor, no child labor, non-discrimination and equal opportunity, wages and salaries, working hours, occupational health and safety, prevention of abuse and harassment The Group-wide EHS Policy (Principles and Strategies for Health, Safety and the Environment), which came into effect back in 1995, is the governing document with regard to the topic of occupational health and safety. This policy is implemented at site level through internal EHS standards that apply Group-wide as well as through guidelines and directives on compliant behavior. The contents of our guidelines are based on the Responsible Care Global Charter, which was instituted by the international chemicals industry. A major goal is the reduction of workplace accidents to an annual LTIR (lost time injury rate) of 2.5 by 2015. We have already reduced this to below the target level for the third time since 2011. We believe that workforce diversity promotes innovation and better team performance. A good balance between different cultures, nationalities, and age groups as well as between male and female employees is conducive to our entrepreneurial success. We have therefore set ourselves the goal of furthering workforce diversity and including all employees in company operations in the best possible way (workforce inclusion). Increasing the proportion of women in management positions is important to us. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 Labor standards 60 We have thus set the target of increasing the percentage of women in management positions (global grade 14+ according to the Global Grading System as per Towers Watson) to 25%-30% by 2016. Implementation Raw materials tracking and education program: Mica is a raw material we use for one of our pigment product groups. When examining the mica supply chain, we discovered in 2008 that at the start of the supply chain, mica is partly also collected by children, generally together with their parents. This is not compatible with our corporate values and the principles of our Human Rights Charter. Consequently, we have realigned the mica supply chain in order to prevent child labor and to ensure that the principles of our Human Rights Charter are complied with. It was important to us to maintain our business relationships with suppliers in the regions where mica comes from and thus safeguard jobs in Jharkhand, a region in northeast India plagued by poverty and political uncertainty. Today we procure mica exclusively from mining and not from collecting. Based on information provided by our suppliers, we have introduced a system for tracking the origin of the raw material. It is regularly checked by staff from the office we recently set up in the region. We maintain regular and close contact with our business partners in Jharkhand and have informed them in detail about our values and our expectations regarding the social and environmental standards to be complied with. In addition, we conduct and commission audits at our suppliers and upstream processing partners. In addition to changing our mica procurement process, we are working to improve education and health care programs in the regions where the raw material comes from. For this purpose, we are financing three schools with an affiliated daycare center, which are now regularly attended by around 430 children, as well as a training center for tailoring and carpentry. We are improving medical care by means of a local health center. A doctor and a nurse are on daily duty, regularly visiting the surrounding villages and our schools. In addition, we support an Indian nongovernmental organization with a project for developing children-friendly villages . This aims to improve the understanding of children's rights and the general conditions for children to regularly attend school. EHS management: Workplace health and safety in the Merck Group is an integral part of our Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) management. Bernd Reckmann, a Merck Executive Board member, bears ultimate responsibility for environmental, health, and safety matters. The Group function Environment Health Safety Security Quality (EQ) is responsible Group-wide for overseeing these topics, and the operational units at the Merck sites are in charge of implementing measures. Employees and supervisors are further sensitized to potential accident risks and hazards through training seminars and other activities such as competitions. In addition to this, Merck's safety culture is further reinforced by rewarding good performance at individual sites (such as the Safety Excellence Award for zero workplace accidents) and through best practice sharing at regional EHS forums. We apply our Operation Excellence Program in order to continuously improve EHS performance at the production sites. Throughout the Merck Group, we also implement preventive occupational health and safety measures for our employees. Ergonomic evaluation of the workplace is one of the tasks of our central EHS Management organization. Other measures are managed and implemented locally. These include fitness activities, information on healthy nutrition, and early detection of diseases such as diabetes or cancer. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 Labor standards 61 Diversity Management: In 2011, we created the position of Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) in order to promote employee diversity. In addition to this, a Diversity Council was formed with representatives from all divisions and functions. This council further develops diversity strategies, promotes their implementation and assesses their progress. In order to foster diversity and inclusion within the company, we engage in numerous activities both Group-wide and at a local level. These include communication measures and special advanced training on topics such as leadership skills and selfmarketing. Diversity and inclusion at Merck is also furthered by internal networks initiated by Merck employees, such as the International Community and Women at Merck, each of which represents the interests of a different group. In 2013, we developed a new competency model describing the type of conduct that supports Merck's strategic alignment and fosters business success. The types of behavior represented in the six competencies promote diversity and inclusion within the company; they are the basis for our recruitment, assessment, performance, and learning offerings. In 2013, we started several pilots. In 2014, the model will be applied at every stage of people management. Gauging the results In order to monitor and assess adherence to the Human Rights Charter both within the Merck Group as well as at our suppliers, we conduct the audits mentioned under Principles 1 and 2; we have furthermore implemented a speak-up line for employees to report compliance violations. In addition to this, we annually gather key figures and publish them in our Corporate Responsibility Report. EHS audits and data management: Workplace health and safety is an important task of Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) management. Regular EHS audits are conducted within the Merck Group to assess compliance with local requirements, regulatory requirements, standards, and business requirements. Data on workplace health and safety are gathered on a monthly basis, evaluated and published on the Merck intranet. In 2013, the lost time injury rate (LTIR – the number of workplace accidents resulting in missed work per 1 million man-hours) was 2.2. No workplace deaths were recorded. The internal Safety Excellence Award, which recognizes sites with no workplace accidents, was presented to 38 sites within the Merck Group. Workforce diversity: In 2013, 25% of the management positions at Merck were held by women, thereby reaching our strategic goal of boosting this percentage to 25% to 30%. We intend to increase this percentage even further by 2016. Fiscal 2013 was the first time that a woman was appointed as head of a Merck Group division. People from a total of 114 different nations work at Merck. Only 27% of Merck employees are German citizens, and 72% work outside of Germany. Audits of the mica supply chain: An audit system, including unannounced audits by Merck and third parties as well as regular visits by Merck employees, has been developed to ensure that the mica-mines and processors are socially compliant. We also check that they adhere to our requirements regarding environmental protection, safety, working standards and compliance. In 2013, six audits were conducted by an external provider in addition to the regular visits. Identified deficiencies have been documented in audit reports, and corrective measures aimed at improving these deficits are being implemented. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 Environmental protection 62 Environmental protection Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Commitment, principles & goals Merck is committed to conserving natural resources as well as protecting the environment. Our responsibility to protect the environment derives from the Merck Values and our corporate strategy. Adherence to Merck's corporate values is a key component of the Merck Code of Conduct, which was described under Principles 1 and 2. The policy document for operational environmental protection is the EHS Policy described under Principles 3,4, 5, and 6. We aim to continually improve our performance as well as to use energy, water and materials economically and efficiently. In addition to this, we want to boost our energy efficiency in order to reduce CO2 emissions, thus contributing to global climate change mitigation. We have set ourselves a goal of reducing direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 20% by 2020 (relative to the 2006 baseline). In 2013, as in 2012 and 2011, the Executive Board earmarked around EUR 10 million for measures to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For the production of environmentally sustainable products, the Performance Materials division has implemented the Green Product Policy for liquid crystal products. Through this policy, we have committed ourselves to complying with all international and country-specific laws and regulations (REACH, RoHS) and also with voluntary bans on substances as well as self-imposed restrictions of certain industries or individual customers, such as the Halogen-Free Policy. As part of the Design for Sustainability program, the Merck Millipore division has developed a number of tools to drive sustainability across the product development process. The program is especially aimed at reducing our customers’ own environmental impact, including their carbon footprint and water use. Implementation Environmental protection has been implemented in our production processes through the EHS management described under Principles 3, 4, 5, and 6. EDISON program for climate protection and energy efficiency: We have consolidated our activities for climate protection and energy efficiency into the EDISON program for energy efficiency and climate protection. Under this program, energy audits are conducted at various sites and energy saving processes implemented. Through the 200 EDISON projects that were launched in 2012 and 2013, Merck aims to annually save around 52 metric kilotons of CO 2 per year in the medium term. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 Environmental protection 63 Product safety management: Through our Group-wide Product Safety Chemicals policy, we have established global processes for defining, steering and implementing product safety, as well as the corresponding management structures. This policy covers all relevant national and international chemical regulations, including the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) and its implementation in regional legislation (such as the CLP regulation in the EU and HazCom in the United States), the European Union chemicals regulation REACH, the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA ), and the German federal law on protection from hazardous substances (ChemG). The policy also incorporates legal standards that relate to the transport of hazardous substances, biocides, cosmetics, chemicals used in food and animal feed, etc. The Group Product Safety Committee (GPSC) is responsible for continuously monitoring the relevant regulatory requirements; the Executive Board member responsible for product safety is a member of this committee. Corporate Regulatory Affairs, a department within the Merck Group function Environment Health Safety Security Quality (EQ), and local units are responsible for compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements for product safety. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 Environmental protection 64 Product development: We strive to continuously enhance the sustainability footprint of our products, developing suitable product and process innovations in order to do so. And we are working to offer our customers products that enable them to reduce the impact of their own activities as well as achieve their own sustainability goals. With the Green³ concept, the Performance Materials division offers its customers a comprehensive package for liquid crystal products. We are developing innovative, environmentally sustainable materials for energy-efficient displays. We also help our customers create environmentally sustainable production processes and support them in producing more environmentally sustainable LC displays. For example, we have developed eco-efficient and WEEE-compliant (EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive) recycling processes for used LCDs. An integral part of this concept is our Green Product Policy, under which we commit ourselves to complying with all international and country-specific laws and regulations (REACH, RoHS); we also comply with voluntary bans on substances and self-imposed restrictions of certain industries or individual customers, such as the Halogen-Free Policy. At the same time, our voluntary safety policy bans the use of acutely toxic, mutagenic or otherwise hazardous substances that remain in the end product. We have expanded the Green3 concept to include cosmetic products from our Performance Materials division. We are working to sustainably procure and produce cosmetic ingredients as well as optimize the related production processes. At Merck Millipore the Design for Sustainability program looks to minimize the environmental and health impact at each stage of the product life cycle from manufacturing through use to disposal. At the same time, we look to maximize features that improve product performance and ease of use. We incorporate sustainability considerations early in the design process before impacts of design decisions are locked in, and we use a set of criteria for major impact areas like materials, energy and waste to measure improvements. Starting in 2014, Merck Millipore will apply the Design for Sustainability process for all new products. An overview of innovative products from Merck can be found on our website. Gauging the results EHS audits: The previously mentioned internal EHS audits are utilized to scrutinize compliance within the Merck Group with the specific regulatory requirements, standards, and business requirements for corporate environmental protection. In 2013, for the fifth year in a row, our group certificate for environmental management systems, which conforms to ISO 14001, was reconfirmed over the course of the annual audit. In addition to this, our suppliers' adherence to environmental standards is scrutinized in the supplier audits described under Principles 1 and 2. EHS data management: A Group-wide EHS data management system is used to regularly collect environmentally relevant data at the individual sites and relay it to the EQ Group function. In 2013, Merck emitted a total of 524 metric tons of CO2, which represents a reduction of 1% compared to 2006 levels. More environmentally relevant data can be found in Merck’s Corporate Responsibility Report – Update 2013. 1 2 3 4 Progress Indicators Goals Global Compact GOP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT UPDATE 2013 Anticorruption 65 Anticorruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery Commitment, principles & goals Merck does not tolerate bribery, extortion or corruption. We are expressly committed to fighting bribery, extortion and corruption across the globe. The primary policy document for this topic is the Code of Conduct mentioned under Principles 1 and 2. Implementation The Code of Conduct has been applied within Merck through the compliance management and the internal compliance training described under Principles 1 and 2. Adopted at the end of 2012, Merck’s Global Business Partner Risk Management Policy now constitutes a fundamental component of the selection process for business partners, along with their overall assessment. Merck's Global Business Partner Risk Management aims to ensure that business partners are selected diligently in order to minimize the danger of adverse legal, reputational, and financial effects. This process is especially concerned with fighting corrupt practices In addition, several internal guidelines were adopted at the end of 2013, which regulate how Merck employees in Pharmaceuticals interact with medical professionals and other representatives of the healthcare sector. These guidelines focus particularly on ensuring that all payments are of legitimate cause and are never made in exchange for prescribing Merck products. The guidelines are supported by a modern electronic compliance management system in which interactions with medical professionals and other representatives of the healthcare sector are proposed, approved, documented, published and monitored. Our suppliers are subject to the supplier management process that is likewise mentioned there. Gauging the results In order to monitor and assess adherence to the Code of Conduct both within the Merck Group as well as at our suppliers, we conduct the audits mentioned under Principles 1 and 2; we have furthermore implemented a speak-up line for employees to report compliance violations. In 2013, 30 internal audits were carried out specifically to check for corruption. Merck – further information: This document only contains the Merck Group's key 2013 figures (unless otherwise indicated) that are relevant for the progress report on the UN Global Compact.
