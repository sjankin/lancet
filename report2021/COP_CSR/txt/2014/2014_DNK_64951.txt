President & Chief Executive Officer CEO STATEMENT 5 6 PANDORA ETHICS REPORT APPROACH In 2013, we continued our efforts to further develop and implement PANDORA Ethics, our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and compliance programme, throughout PANDORA’s value chain – from ensuring ethical sourcing and procurement, through safe and healthy jewellery crafting, to the responsible marketing and sale of our jewellery in approximately 10,300 stores around the world. ETHICAL ASPIR ATIONS During the past decade, PANDORA has developed to become one of the world’s leading jewellery brands.

PANDORA jewellery is composed of quality materials such as silver, gold, leather, stones, pearls, gemstones and diamonds. These commodities, often debated by influential stakeholder groups, are increasingly targeted by regulation. In addition to continuing our overall commitment to responsible business practices, it is becoming ever more pivotal for PANDORA to constantly strive towards a still more sustainable supply chain. Besides core jewellery materials, PANDORA purchase a range of products for use in our stores, including fixtures, furniture, in-store decoration, jewellery bags and gift boxes. RESPONSIBLE SUPPLIER PROGRAMME In 2013, we identified CSR compliance as one of the five pillars that will drive the PANDORA Group Procurement strategy. As a result, the existing CSR expert teams in Bangkok and Copenhagen have been supplemented by a dedicated quality and CSR unit embedded into our procurement team in Hong Kong. At the centre of PANDORA’s value chain are our jewellery crafting facilities in Thailand, where approxi­ mately 6,000 highly skilled craftspeople produce the vast majority of our products. This setup has allowed 11 To ensure the highest possible return on the time and consultants and measured up against PANDORA’s resources we invest in our Responsible Supplier Program­ requirements.

This understanding is clearly reflected in our company values: PRIDE, PASSION and PERFORMANCE, which can be further explored on our corporate website: www.pandoragroup.com.

In 2013, our core management committee was demonstrated at the latest election, where 89% of our Thai colleagues exercised their right to elect their representatives by secret ballot voting. In 2013, we continued our monthly Radar Meetings – a concept we introduced to bring to light any issues, concerns and opportunities existing in our daily operations. All employees can apply to participate and suggest subjects for discussion. In direct response to suggestions raised at Radar Meetings, we implemented a range of changes in 2013, including new uniform rules, improved jewellery crafting tools and an on-site convenience store offering everyday consumables at below market prices. PPT employees’ benefits include free meals, maternity classes, extensive professional and personal development training, annual outings, scholarships, partly employeemanaged radio and TV channels, as well as safe bus transport to and from work. By year-end, more than 4,400 colleagues regularly took advantage of the last benefit, which over the course of the year added up to more than 19,000 trips. 16 PANDORA ETHICS REPORT Twice per week, our HR Services team sets up con­sul­tation centres during lunch breaks to allow employees to ask questions or seek assistance with pay, benefits or employee relations issues at a time and place convenient for the employees. In 2013, the HR Services team dealt with over 6,500 unique visits. Recognising that access to education can be a challenge in Thailand, we have established an Edutainment Centre, which features an e-learning/Internet room and library. This provides our colleagues with a comfortable environment to relax during breaks and before or after work, and an inspiring space to learn and develop. During 2013, the library had more than 43,300 visits, and more than 10,500 books were borrowed throughout the year. FINANCIAL LITERACY, SAVINGS CLUB AND COOPERATIVE Following the launch of our “Happy Money” financial literacy programme in 2011 (which was recognised with the Thai Prime Minister’s Award of Achievement), and the Respecting all human and labour rights is essential to “Manage Debt, Change Your Life” programme in 2012, we PANDORA.

CR AFTING FACILITIES Again as a result of our growth, and not least the complexity of our jewellery designs, our water PANDORA experienced a sharp increase in demand and consumption at PPT increased by 41% from 206,393 M3 produced as many as 79 million pieces of jewellery in in 2012 to 291,572 M3 in 2013. To our disappointment, the 2013, compared with 54 million in 2012. At the same percentage of water recycled fell considerably from 12.5% time, the accelerated pace at which we introduced our in 2012 to 3% in 2013. The reasons for this change have collections, which comprised more complex jewellery partly to do with more accurate methods for measuring designs, made it challenging to significantly reduce our our consumption and partly with technical challenges that energy and resource consumption at our crafting facilities, halted the recycling of water during parts of the year. We PANDORA Production Thailand (PPT). will work to handle the technical challenges related to Having achieved the ISO 14001 certification on water recycling and, with continued focus on our water environmental management in 2012, in 2013 PPT initiated consumption, expect to improve our performance in 2014. a project to achieve ISO 50001 on energy management. The project remains on-track for certification in Q2 2014. As part of our commitment to continuously minimising the company’s environmental footprint, our crafting facilities engaged in a promising partnership with Mahidol Univer­ sity in Bangkok, Thailand in 2013. The project team will conduct a lifecycle assessment of our Thai activities in 2014, and the partnership has already resulted in the recycling of a range of materials used in the crafting processes. PANDORA raised the output of jewellery pieces produced by 40% from 2012 to 2013. This achievement has been accompanied by an increase in electricity consumption of 37% from 13,917,000 kWh in 2012 to 19,170,000 kWh in 2013. As stated in previous CSR reports, we consider the potential for lowering our electricity consumption of our crafting processes as being modest. First, we utilise modern, energy-efficient equipment in our crafting processes and second, 85% of our buildings are air conditioned to ensure proper working conditions. 19 Last year, we reported a waste generation of 3,558 very promising results for these three materials during tonnes from our crafting facilities. Despite the increase in 2013. Now, 46% of the gypsum that previously ended up pieces produced, we have been able to reduce our waste as landfill is recycled in the construction sector, 45% of generation to 2,954 tonnes in 2013. There are two main the Murano glass is used for producing glass tiles and reasons for this decrease.
