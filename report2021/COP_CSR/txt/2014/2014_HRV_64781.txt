SCOTT BADER d.o.o. joined Global Compact in 2007. Since then business conditions and profitability on global market were strongly effected during the crisis lasting now for several years, which forced the most of companies on significant reduction of costs and previously defined plans. However our business approach and practice were not changed in times of crises, but our opinion is that in difficult times everyone should even stronger apply fairness and other right principles in own business environment. We believe that a business is successful only if the profit is gained from socially responsible business activities, not to be sacrificed for (usually short-term) financial goals only and that Global Compact principles keep their importance no matter of changes we witness on the global market. Our company continuous works on our market position improving and achieving the best possible results, but also we are aiming to be involved in positive development of business environment, by conducting our business in such a manner as to respect human rights, protect our environment and respect all of the principles comprehensively summarized by Global Compact into the ten most important principles of responsible business conduct. On behalf of SOTT BADER d.o.o. I can confirm that we continue to apply and promote the concept of socially responsible business conduct and every single principle of Global Compact. March 2014 Chairman of the Management Board Andrej Potežica 3/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Profile 2 – Organizational profile Social Responsibility in Business Performance Social responsibility is one of the founding principles of our Company, as a general idea representing the commitment of SCOTT BADER d.o.o. to perform its activities in a fair, responsible manner and with consideration towards its business partners, employees and owners. This is also the founding principle of the founder of Scott Bader, expressed through the Commonwealth organization (employee unity), based on the decisions and acts of Ernest Bader, the founder and owner of Scott Bader in England, which today is a large international company and has companies on four continents. The founding of the SCOTT BADER Company and Group Scott Bader Company Limited was established in 1923. Ernest Bader was a Swiss emigrant who set up a merchandising venture in London in 1920 with the sole agency for Swiss celluloid in the UK. By 1932 Scott Bader had moved into manufacturing in the East End of London and in wartime 1940 evacuated to Wollaston. The factory built at Wollaston was to manufacture phenolic pastes, reclaim rubber emulsions and produce resins for paints. In 1946 Scott Bader became the first unsaturated polyester resin manufacturer in Europe with licences from America. The Commonwealth The Founders, having experienced industrial strikes and two world wars wanted to create better and peaceful human relationships by moving forward from the usual shareholder/capitalist structures in industry. So in 1951 all the share capital and therefore the ownership of the Company was transferred, free of charge, to Scott Bader Commonwealth Limited, an organisation created for that purpose with charitable status. This highly generous and imaginative act established a common trusteeship business. This means that we have no external Shareholders. All the shares are held in trust and this makes us totally independent. 4/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence The intention of the Founders was to create a radical company, its well-being entrusted to those who work in it with democratic involvement. As a result the employees enjoy many of the benefits (and responsibilities) of ownership without the right to sell the business. The responsibilities, however, is key in that each generation of employees must ensure the ongoing success of the organisation so that future generations can benefit from its continued existence. In April 2011 Scott Bader Group celebrated important jubilee – 60 years of Commonwealth, i.e. 60 years since the former Ernest Bader gave his company to employees for common management and trusteeship. Where does Scott Bader operate today? When Scott Bader became a Common Trusteeship Company it operated only in the UK. Over the last 50 years the company has expanded geographically and today has manufacturing companies not only in United Kingdom, but also in France, South Africa, Emirates and Croatia. It also has distribution companies or research centres in the Ireland, Czech Republic, France, Spain, USA, and China. It employs approximately 600 people worldwide. What is expected of Scott Bader people? The international business structure brings with it distinct challenges in operating as a common-trusteeship. All Scott Bader companies wherever their location must work to a common set of principles: Care Equality (of opportunity) Ethics Involvement No discrimination Respect (human dignity) Service 5/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Following development, organisation and very dynamic changes in business and global world in general, Scott Bader Group continuously monitor and review own policies, not moving further from main principles, those are universal and with no time limits. During year 2011, after large consultation and opinions collected all around the Group, it was agreed existing principles, respecting the past and shaping the future, to cumulate into four main values, those define all principles we apply in achieving our goals, as well as values that should be applied in the activity of each of us in the Group. Those values are (each equally important, no matter of its place when written): Commitment Responsibility Team working Fairness We believe that these principles and values would enable that in the future we also stay Partner for Excellence and Successful, Profitable and Sustainable Organisation. Commitment Team working We’re committed to the We work principles of common co-operatively and in trusteeship and making collaboration with Scott Bader a successful colleagues, customers and sustainable and suppliers to deliver organisation. excellence. Responsibility Fairness We each take personal We are fair, honest and responsibility in how we ethical in how we work with work to do the best for others and how we are Scott Bader. treated at Scott Bader. 6/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence The arrival of SCOTT BADER to Croatia Our company, named Chromos Tvornica Smola stock company at the time, started cooperating closely with the Scott Bader Group in 1999, when Scott Bader invested its financial resources through a loan as well as its own guarantees into helping the company recover and return onto the international market.

In the event of a downturn in trade we will consider whether circumstance make it desirable or practical to share all remaining work rather than expect any of our fellow members to be deprived of employment, even if this requires a reduction in earnings. ii. However should a study of our business reveal that it would be in its best interest to reduce or eliminate certain jobs, we will do this in the fairest and most objective way. In particular we will wherever possible offer alternative work. H We have agreed not to hold second jobs without having first sought the approval from the company. I The foundation/creation of our Commonwealth abolished the existence of Scott Bader share holders and with it the power of share ownership. For this reason we will not acquire other companies, without offering their staff Commonwealth membership as quickly as possible. J We have a responsibility to the society in which we live and believe that should we have a special talent or interest, it would be right to offer this to the wider community. Members are encouraged to engage in some to form of social or public service, however small. K Our social responsibility also extends to 1. Limiting the use of our products to applications beneficial to the community, in particular excluding specific applications used in manufacturing weapons of war 2. Reducing any harmful effects our work has on the natural environment, e.g. by rigorously avoiding the negligent discharge of pollutants 3. Constantly working towards reducing activities that waste the earth’s natural resources L As members of the Commonwealth we support and commit to the principles of the Commonwealth and will do our best to live these out in both our working and private lives 25/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF GLOBAL COMPACT 26/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence The founding principles of Global Compact The principles which we accept in full and act in accordance with: Human Rights Principle 1: Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Scott Bader d.o.o. operates on international market, cooperates with business partners for which we believe that within their business activities in no manner participate in violating human rights or contribute to minimizing them in any of their other activities in a broader community. In the event that we discovered otherwise, our company would terminate its business relationship with such a company. Principle 2: Ensure that the company itself is not complicit in human rights abuses The founding principles of the Scott Bader Group include an explicit principle of respecting human rights, without which the Companies of the Group would not fulfil the most important precondition of their existence. Our Company has internal acts which were enacted in accordance with legal provisions and with the consent of its employees through their Council. A person has been authorised to which all remarks regarding any form of human rights violation, dignity or the endangerment of an employee. We are a small company in which most of our employees have been working for us for many years now and thereby fostering a mutual respect represents a foundation for good cooperation among employees and for including new employees into our labour processes. Labour Standards Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Every employee of Scott Bader d.o.o. has the opportunity to exercise their right to freedom of association. 64% of employees are members of the Trade Union of Chemical Industry Workers and 96% are members of the Commonwealth, a union of employees within the Group, through which they exercise their right to participate in reaching decisions regarding the most important issues related to the Company's business and other issues related to the Statute of the Company. 27/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence The Local Council of Employees, members of the Commonwealth, is based on the same foundations and, alongside with Trade Union representatives, represents an additional form of representing employees and exercising their rights. Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Scott Bader opposes any form of forced and compulsory labour which is contrary to the principles of conducting business. The same is requested from all business partners and members of the greater community to which it belongs. The choice and change of one's job position is a basic human right. Each new employee is fully informed of his/her rights and obligations through all internal acts of the Company, and is enabled to and expected to be an equal member of the team which he/she joins, because this is the only manner in which a company can function well. Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour Scott Bader d.o.o. fully supports the abolition of child labour which is not a humane or permissible way of making a profit but rather an activity with long-term consequences in the future. The principle is clearly stated in our internal acts. Below is age structure per main departments in the company: Administration Operations Years 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Below 18 years 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 18-20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 21-30 2 1 0 0 1 4 3 5 5 6 31-40 1 1 2 2 3 7 7 5 6 7 41-50 5 4 2 2 2 9 7 7 7 7 51-55 2 2 4 3 4 9 8 6 5 4 above 55 years 3 3 3 2 1 14 17 21 23 20 Total 13 11 11 9 11 43 42 44 46 44 Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Our Company does everything in its power, by respecting the founding provisions of legislation, by enacting the Company's internal acts and by acting in a fair and non-discriminating manner with respect to employment and in relations with its employed co-workers, to ensure that there is no discrimination in any segment of our activities. 28/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence In the process of employing new employees there are clearly set criteria which eliminate discrimination with respect to employment. No discrimination may be applied related to sex, race, religion, political affiliation or nationality, family status or personal beliefs. The same criterion is applied to the salaries of our employees. Our internal acts include a description of a mechanism which is at the disposal of our employees for protection from any form of discrimination, as well as procedures set and persons responsible for resolving any situation in which an employee might feel discriminated in any way. Environment Principle 7: Scott Bader d.o.o., being a responsible company operating in the field of the chemical industry, pays special attention to environmental protection. In conformance with its own principles of sustainable development and business operations and guided by the principles of the Group's operations, including explicitly high standards in environmental protection measures, employee health care and improving work conditions in general, the Company meets and increases the high standards in these fields of industry. Being a member of the Scott Bader Group, Scott Bader d.o.o. is further obliged to fulfil all the necessary conditions of operations and activities that lead towards the protection of the environment. Monitoring the performance in the field on a regular basis ensures that all employees, as well as interested partners, are well informed about this segment of our operations and, even more importantly, sets new goals for improvement on the basis of former experiences. Basic issues of environmental protection and business operations are regulated by the Company's internal acts with the purpose of eliminating any adverse impact to environment: Rules on waste management from the technological process of wastewater treatment; Rules on operation and pre-treatment of waste and sewage water; an Operating plan of activities in case of sudden pollution; a Waste management plan; an Operating plan of activities in environmental protection; Rules on the disposal of waste oils; Fire safety rules. By fulfilling legal obligations in enacting the required rules and plans, the Company utilizes such a manner of defining the obligations as an additional opportunity for an on-going review of its achievements in the field. The Company makes continuous investments in the protection of the environment, the improvement of production conditions, safety at work, and improving working conditions in the Company in general. 29/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Here are some of the large-scale interventions and investments made during the course in 2010 and 2011: technological improvement of the production process by introducing Molten PA charging system reconstruction and implementation, by which the production process was made shorter, safety was improved, working conditions were made significantly easier and safety in the protection of the ecological system was improved. improvement in the sewage system of the entire site. This large-scale intervention is carried out over a three-year period and it was completed 2011. It includes a complete reconstruction of the technological water sewage system and the reconstruction of the catchments, precipitation and waste water system, all in compliance with a project approved by Hrvatske vode (Croatian Waters). reconstruction of the flooring in production plants. Its aim is to match the latest environmental and production standards. Reconstruction of the pools in which hazardous substances are stored new pumps and pipes (to prevent leakage) old level indicators on all monomer underground tanks was replaced with new ones new waterproof floor in peroxide warehouse replacement of insulation system (sheet and wool) on all tanks and Pfthalic Anhydride storage tank Continuous care and improvements in waste management (use / separation / disposal). Among others, a press for pressing paper and plastic waste was purchased. an improvement in the power efficiency of storing warm resins into tanks – a closed system of heating tanks using steam was constructed and installed With the aim to improve safety at work, fire protection and environment protection, in 2011 we started to apply Safety opportunity award system. Every month we reward the best suggestion regarding safety at work, fire protection and environment protection. The section Environmental impacts contains indicators of the application of this principle in more detail. Because of our legal obligations to get environmental licence (IPPC directive) most of our investments in 2012 was related with ecological and energy savings improvement: nitrogen in house production. Nitrogen generator was installed and now we are producing nitrogen from compressed air. steam heating of buildings replaced 2012 and 2013 with new more efficient central hot water heating system (steam losses are reduced) 30/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence 150 meter of old underground water pipelines was replaced with new one (water losses are reduced) investment in central dust collector system (dust emissions are reduced to minimum) two new underground double walls tanks for solvent and monomer storage was bought and old single walls tanks are replaced new watertight floor in monomer warehouse -we finished and connected in 9.2013 new Scott Bader doo sewage system DN800 to municipal sewage system in 2013 we made project documentation and asked for construction permit for VOC treatment plant for waste air from Scott Bader d.o.o. proccess plant. We also made same preparinig work and we bought most of equipment for 1 st stage (conecting all process waste air outlets to collecting and mesuring line). Plan is to finish with 1st project stage until 9.2014 and then finish with 2nd project stage (chose, order and install VOC treatment plant) until end of 2015 Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Being a producer of chemical products, our environmental responsibility is exceptionally important in our everyday activities. We support any action which leads towards improving environmental protection, and to that end undertake all measures available within our Company. Through cooperation with our business partners, and primarily our customers, we strive to share all of our knowledge regarding the proper application of our products, which we achieve by providing high-quality comprehensive documentation on our products, obtaining all required certificates, subcontracting transport companies with a high quality of service, providing instructions pertaining to managing packaging, packaging disposal etc. Large-scale changes are being introduced to the chemical industry with the implementation of the REACH regulation. We have been participating in the activities related to implementing the regulation from the very beginning and we try to set an example in the fulfilment of all of the REACH requirements in order to help and motivate others to do the same. 31/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence STATEMENT REGARDING REACH Scott Bader d.o.o., as a responsible company, and in an effort to prevent any surprises regarding the REACH Regulation 1907/2006, since Croatia is yet to accede to the EU, has named Scott Bader Co. Ltd. as its sole representative in the EU, and has pre-registered all substances and all substances used in preparations acquired from the EU market and from non-EU markets. Although confirmations have been received from almost all suppliers that they started the pre-registration process, this alone still provides no guarantee regarding the completion of the registration process. Scott Bader d.o.o. has therefore adopted the so-called safety net approach, in accordance with the recommendations given by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and preregistered all identified substances which are used as monomers or additives. Scott Bader d.o.o. produces polymers dissolved in a certain solvent or monomer, i.e. preparations that are not subject to registration as such; however, as further users need to ensure that only registered substances are procured for production, or, in the event where there are no registered suppliers, need to register the substances themselves for export into EU. Through the pre-registration procedure, and the further registration procedures (>1000 t/year by 30 November 2010, 100-1000 t/year by 31 May 2013, and 10-100 t/year by 31 May 2018) we ensure registered raw materials from our suppliers. From the communication with our suppliers it was confirmed that all supplied raw materials and for those traded products those had to be registered by end of November 2010 are registered and all SDS required are issued, with the date of the registration according to REACH regulations. Also, it is confirmed that the register of substances to be registered by 2013 or by 2018 is also completed. For substances now purchased, suppliers are obligated to issue new SDS, with visible ECHA registration number. When imported, only substances with completed documentation could be accepted. In accordance with Directive 1272/2008 (CLP) SCOTT BDER d.o.o. encourage our RM suppliers and customer in EU that all substances placed on the market will be notified to the Classification and Labelling Inventory. Our SDS are adjusted to this regulation for our products. In accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 453/2010 all SDS for our products (mixtures) comply with Annex I (Annex II) to this Regulation after 1 December 2012. 32/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Scott Bader d.o.o, as well as the sector for development of the Scott Bader Group, works intensively on the development of products, developed and enhanced in a manner in which by no means endanger the environment. It is our goal to place an increasing number of resins on the market with a lower content of volatile compounds, solvents and styrene. To that end we developed a new generation of alkyd “high solid” resins with a drastically reduced content of solvents. Furthermore, a solvent-less resin was developed, which represents the latest generation of environmentally acceptable alkyd resins on a global level. Polyester resins with a low content and low emission of styrene are also being developed along those lines. Furthermore, new acrylic resins with environmentally acceptable solvents (butyl acetate instead of toluene etc.) are also being developed. In alkyd emulsion project we intend to leave solvent based alkyd resins, now we pass lab and pilot plant step. Next phase will be verification of paint formulations and after that scale-up to Plant. Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery Scott Bader d.o.o. decidedly condemns acts of corruption, extortion or bribery committed in order to achieve business goals. We have never been, nor shall we ever let ourselves become involved in a situation that may lead towards any corruptive activity. We shall improve our business operations on both the international market and our local market and achieve our results only by operating in a competitive and fair manner. 33/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence ECONOMIC DIMENSION 34/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence EC1 SCOTT BADER d.o.o. is the only producer of composite resins and specialty polymers in Croatia, recognised on the regional market, but as well as, together with other producers of the Scott Bader Group, on the European and global market. SCOTT BADER d.o.o. enhanced its years-long tradition of supplying high-quality products to its customers, who are industrial producers as well, by introducing product brand and ranges of SCOTT BADER. The future of our Company and the Group, as well as any other company that strives to succeed in chemical industry, depends on investments into product development and new technologies, as well as the ability to continually monitor and use the development achieved by our customers and suppliers, in order to respond in a fast and proper manner to all quality requirements in each business segment. SCOTT BADER d.o.o., being mostly an exporter and also a producer of chemical products, is exposed to oscillations on both the raw-materials market and on the final products market. We operate on a very complex market, subject to extremely swift changes. The Company therefore tries and succeeds in utilising its capacities to a maximum level through continuous improvements of the organization, technology, quality, cost management and human part (personnel) of the business. SCOTT BADER is an important exporter and with a large share of its product range it is an important regional producer. In the last several years export presents over 85% of total sales. Our company in year 2013 continued with sales increase and business improvements. Volume of our product sold was 16.260 t, and it was over budgeted and slightly over last year 16.203 t. But, with improved product mix i.e. with larger sales of better value added products, turnover for the first time exceeded 200 mil HRK. Company's efforts on cost saving, increasing efficency and applying internal solutions for further costs (energy) saving, helped in achieving profit for the year 2013 of 1,2 mil HRK. Increased profitability is even more important as the market we operate on is still very diffciult, manufacturers are exposed to continuous increase of raw material prices, those are still increasing althogh market activity after the main crisis is not recovered in full. Following that, there is a significant presure on the market by the competition too, that is also trying to regain own market position, partly by decreasing own earnings to a minimum. We managed to stabilise market position of our sales, with no debts in risk or looses of collections. We would like to see more developent of local and regional market, those are still slowely recovering, as we are keeping our leading positon on domestic market and strengthening our position in the region. 35/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Trade profit structure Trade profit structure 2009 % 2010. % 2011. % 2012. % 2013. % HRK 000s Domestic sales 20.925 17,8 23.338 15,74 26.601 14,69 29.867 15,24 29.188 14,40 Export sales 96.636 82,2 124.975 84,26 154.505 85,31 166.118 84,76 173.537 85,60 TOTAL 117.561 148.313 181.106 195.985 202.725 200.000 Domestic sales Export sales 150.000 100.000 50.000 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Our products are delivered directly from our site in Zagreb in over 20 countries, and through our distributors wider market is supplied.

Trade income is income from sales of our products on domestic and foreign markets and a small share of income from selling services and merchandise. Other income includes interest, forex, sales from fixed and other long-term assets and other smaller income positions those could appear. The main portion of business expenditures comprises raw-material costs for the production and they define the increase in all expenditures, following the increase in sales / production and the changes in the prices on the world raw-material market. Furthermore, there are also transportation costs, energy and other costs related to production and production plant maintenance. Other business expenditures include royalties, forex, property and employee protection, insurance, bank fees etc. Employees' salaries and benefits include wages, taxes, transportation costs and other costs for the employees as well as paid benefits (bonuses, jubilee awards etc). Paid interest includes the interest paid for a loan granted by Scott Bader Group companies. The intercompany credit decreases the Company's exposure towards third parties and enables a more favourable financial arrangement than it would have been should a loan be granted by a third party (e.g. domestic banks). A nominally paid interest amount is decreasing and does not represent a significant financial burden to the Company. Payments to the State include all mandatory payments regarding taxes, contributions and other payments. * Investments into the Community: this segment shows the specific characteristics of the organization and functioning of the basic principles in the Scott Bader Group and the existence of Commonwealth. The Scott Bader Group is expressively turned towards its local and wider community, and its financial participation is performed through 37/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence donations, voted on Assembly by all members of the Commonwealth and paid from a joint fund on the Group level. Therefore the amounts of donations are not shown in the table above, as no expense for local company occurred, although the donations were made to Croatian charities, following the proposal of SCOTT BADER d.o.o. employees. Donations Our Structure is our Strength SCOTT BADER d.o.o. has been proposing over the years to the joint fund the charities that the donations might be granted to, mostly those providing aid for children, young and ill people. The Scott Bader Commonwealth Limited is a registered charity which owns the shares of Scott Bader Company Limited. It receives all of its income from the company. The amount to be donated is either an amount equal to the amount payable as Group Staff Bonus or 1 per cent of the Scott Bader Group Staff Salary Cost, whichever is the greater Local fund is designated to each of the subsidiaries or small operations of SBCL located around the world and is shared out based upon the number of people employed at each of the locations. It is then for the Commonwealth Members at each location to decide collectively either via a charity committee or similar, which charities they would like to propose to the Trustees In 2013 SCOTT BADER d.o.o. has got from Scott Bader Commonwealth Limited amounts of 7.580GBP to be donated. Those funds were donated to charity organisation we knew for years and we recognized their need for addition financial help. We wanted to keep continuity and of several years and give some kind of additional security to those organisation that, if they fullfil known conditions from Commonwealth, they could rely on help from SCOTT BADER for some time.

Charity was founded in 2004 by parents of cerebral palsied children seeking innovative methods of rehabilitation based on new insights in neuroscience. Neuroplasticity is a phenomenom which gives possibilities of treatmant so far non treatable neurological patients and was recognized about 20-15 years ago. Since institutions of medical system are slow in implementing new ideas in everyday practice we wanted to make an out of institutional medical project complying with our aim. Therefore we found medical doctors willing to work in a new paradigm thus providing our users with project of integral neurorehabilitation Our main achievement consists in reduction of invalidity degree in our members who are cerebral palsy sufferers, submitted to integral neuro-rehabilitation program. The progress is documented by video footage “before and after” as well as with GMFM 66 and 88 questionnaire scoring. Project ” INTEGRAL NEUROREHABILITATION OF CEREBRAL PALSY” is based on new ideas in neuroscience which claim regenerative capacity of injured brain based on ideas of neuroplasticity (www.drroje.com). Thus previously hopeless patients (invalids) with cerebral palsy( especially children) have new hope for their recovery. So far results of project are excellent. The need for this project is huge because it helps children with severe disability to reduce the disability and regain neurologic health. Children treated with integral neurorehabilitation without it will stay disabled. Using it they will have a normal life. SOS Children Village SOS Children's Villages look after children without parents or parental care, regardless of their race, nationality or faith, providing them with love and security in the family environment, as well as a permanent home and education needed for happy and peaceful childhood. Association SOS Children's Village Croatia has been active since February 25, 1992, as a full member of SOS Kinderdorf International, the world’s largest NGO in the field of child and youth care. SOS-KDI is seated in Innsbruck, Austria. SOS Children’s Village Croatia provides home for 250 children in two SOS villages, one in the village of 39/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Lekenik, close to Zagreb, and one in the village of Ladimirevci, in eastern part of Croatia. Children who arrive to SOS Children’s Village Croatia (SOS CVC) sometimes need special expert assistance that cannot be provided by SOS CVC staff. One of those special needs refers to the special learning and reading impediments and SOS CVC has to engage external experts. Costs of such expert assistance per one village for the first two most critical months of the school year amounts to 13.185 Kuna, or approximately £1,500.00 (on June 13th, 2013, rate at the Croatian National Bank was 1GBP = 8,79). As of this current school year they have one learning and reading impediments specialist working with 24 children who suffer from such difficulties. From this group, 9 children attend primary school following specially designed program for children with learning difficulties and are in constant need for expert assistance provided by this specialist. The reminder of the group – 15 children who have other conditions (ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia, emotional difficulties) attend primary school education following the adapted curriculum for which they also need ongoing expert assistance that the same specialist is able to provide. The funds will be used for expert assistance in the SOS Children’s Village Ladimirevci at the beginning of the school year 2013/2014. Udruga Krijesnica (Firefly) Firefly is a humanitarian association for helping children and families facing malignant diseases. It is operating in Zagreb but supports families from whole Croatia as well as families from neighboring countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia, Slovenia). Regular activities:  Providing everyday living space for families of children suffering from malignant diseases while they are waiting for a medical exam, test results etc.  Organizing, intermediating and conducting certain benefits for parents and children (such as beneficiary parking tickets and discount on transportation tickets in the City of Zagreb, discount on train tickets in all parts of Croatia, toll free passage on motorway)  Counseling in achieving social and health rights for parents  Psychological support (support groups, individual counseling/psychotherapy) for parents whose child is in treatment, for parents whose child had died and other members of their families 40/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence  Providing support and assistance when death of a child occurs (counseling, support with completing documentation)  Conducting international rehabilitation camp for children who have completed treatment  Kayak rowing for children who have completed treatment  Nutritional counsel (educations, cooking workshops, group and individual consultations)  Education on achieving social and health rights  Technical support for parents (use of telephone, fax machine, internet, copy machine etc.)  Publishing materials tailored for children, parents and broader public  Interactive video thesaurus for children and youth suffering from malignant diseases titled Oncology-and-Me  Activities for rising public awareness and increasing society’s sensibility for issues of children facing cancer  Activities on advocacy for health and social care rights of sick children and their families Key achievements: Firefly – Association for helping children and families facing malignant diseases has continuously worked with the vision of increasing the quality of life of children facing malignant diseases and their families. During 12 years of our work, from 2000 to 2012, we have been available to the parents of the sick children 24/7 (24 hours per day, seven days per week) and over 1100 direct beneficiaries have benefited from our services. Some of our key achievements are  Over 38 actions were conducted, aimed at gathering direct help for parents and sick children, for equipping oncology wards, acquisition of medication and regular association activities;  15 projects were conducted (of which there had been 9 rehabilitation camps for children who had successfully completed treatment for malignant disease, 3 camps were international because children from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Turkey participated as well);  Firefly is the only centre in Croatia which conducts psychosocial support for parents, organizes support groups for parents whose child is suffering from a malignant disease and support groups for grieving parents, individual psychotherapy sessions for parents, children and youth who have completed treatment;  Firefly provided support for 130 families whose child was in terminal phase which is an extremely significant support for parents  Published sixteen different educational materials  In the year 2012, the service of counseling in achieving social and health rights was provided to over 80 families. Psychological support group for parents whose child is in treatment or had passed away due to cancer has been attended to 26 people. The 41/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence service of long term accommodation was used by 12 families. Organizing, mediating and conducting certain benefits were used by 100 families. Firefly nourishes cooperation and partnership established through membership in national and international associations (such as ICCCPO International confederation of childhood cancer parent organizations, Coalition of associations in health system, Coalition of associations for children etc.) Firefly has been recognized by the parents as the first place to contact when in need of help and as a place where they can receive support during the entire period of dealing with the disease and even after that. Because of Firefly’s actions and work, during the last few years, all childhood oncology wards in Republic of Croatia have been fully equipped, and the greatest contribution has been made to KDB Zagreb. We are especially proud that a new oncology ward in KBC Rijeka has been opened in 2012 greatly due to Firefly’s work. Croatian Association of the blind Croatian Blind Union (CBU) was founded on June 16th 1946, as a non-governmental institution. From then on, persons with visual impairments across Croatia gather in one of their 27 core member associations within umbrella of Croatian Blind Union. These associations are functioning as local city or county associations covering all Croatian territory and gathering around 6200 members and 250 volunteers. Bringing to life the founders’ motto „Blind for the blind, also”, they take their part in sharing the responsibility for a better future The mission of the CBU is as follows: to ensure respect of the human rights and elimination of all forms of discrimination against persons with visual impairments; to promote and implement a proactive policy in the field of social welfare including the provision of immediate humanitarian assistance necessary for persons with visual impairments; to ensure the practical application of the latest achievements in the field of education, rehabilitation and employment of persons with visual impairments; to act in protection and improvement of the health of persons with visual impairments; to participate in improving the environmental and physical planning and adjustment of certain real life solutions for persons with visual impairments; to affirm this population in all areas of social life; to sensitize the public for the social needs of this population; to achieve full inclusion of persons with visual impairments into the life of the community. The project “New Dimension” started in November 2012 and is financed by Ministry of Science, Education and Sports with the grant of 50.000 HRK. Within the project, innovative didactic tool to support tactile learning in pre-school children was developed. CBU plans to produce 200 copies of this didactic set that is intended to be distributed free of charge to blind and partially sighted pre-school children. Project activities are implemented in cooperation with School for the Blind “Vinko Bek” in Zagreb. So far, only 120 children have received the didactic set and it needs to be secured for further 80 children. 42/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Children with visual impairments, due to complete or partial sight loss, are not able to use many children’s books and toys which are accessible only to sighted children. Therefore, it is difficult for them to explore the world as other children do. To address this problem, there are various tactile books and toys being produced on the foreign markets, with some slow progress in Croatia. Accessible books and toys are enabling children with visual impairments to explore the environment and interact with other children more easily. Tactile learning is crucial for developing fine muscle movements and is increasing a sense of independence which contributes to better integration in the local environment and community as a whole. Children’s books that are accessible to blind children of preschool age are more expensive than regular books and for this reason they are often unavailable, especially in Croatia where there is a low number of these products on the market. Toys are ordered from abroad and their price is sometimes ten times higher than the price of “ordinary” toys for children. For example, the ball for preschool child can be purchased for 20 to 30 HRK, while the sound ball for blind child costs around 200 HRK. Encouraged by that fact, many have ventured into the challenge of making tactile picture books in the last five years and there are currently ten tactile picture books available in Croatian market. Unfortunately, blind and partially sighted children often have little to no knowledge about how to use these books, primarily for the reason that they are not introduced properly on how to recognize elements of the book by using tactile perception. Therefore, CBU believes that it is necessary to develop a didactic tool intended primarily for preschool children and first graders of elementary school in order to rise awareness what it means to “look” at the three-dimensional object presented on the paper as a two-dimensional tactile object. In this way, the children will be enabled to “look” at tactile books intended for them and later, when they reach school age, they will be able to use geographic and history charts, as well as other tactile materials. The creation of didactic set is based on many years of educational work in the field of visual culture with visually impaired persons, from the very start of their learning process when they are still very young children. In year 2010 donated money was spent for making more detailed map of Croatia. In year 2011 we supported project „All equall, all different“. Funds were used fot printing the brochure „Rights and Opportunities for the Blind, maintaining website www.savez-slijepih.hr and procurement of equipment Jaws for Windows. In 2012 we were supporting project “Employment Crown of Integration of the Blind Persons” started in July 2011 with the following goals: 1. Raising public awareness of the capabilities and potentials of blind people as a work force 2. Increasing personal potential of unemployed blind people, especially young 3. Informing employers and relevant institutions on the possibility of blind people therefore increasing propensity to employ blind workers 4. Providing technical assistance to employed blind persons and their employers PUŽ (SNAIL) Put u Život (A Way into Life) – Association of parents of children with special needs was founded to improve the quality of life, medical and social protection of children with 43/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence special developmental needs and their families through education, various therapeutic treatments etc. Regular activities are divided into programs for children, parents and public, as well as programs for wider social community. Programs for children consist of group activities (such as art workshop, Orff music workshop, computer workshop, playroom and similar) as well as individual programs (different rehabilitation programs such as Montessori, Marte Meo, DIR/Floortime, Sensory integration and speech therapy. Programs for parents are based on education and assistance which are offered to parents of children with special needs by means of organizing and participating in seminars, conferences and workshops as well as by providing published information. Social gatherings are organized in order to share experience and take concerted actions. Their public activities are directed toward raising level of public awareness and sensibility, issues of integration and inclusion and similar. Also, we are organizing debates, contacting with the media, cooperating with faculties and other institutions that deal with problems of persons with special needs. Programs for wider social community are: Snail’s Speed The Snail's Speed project was aimed at improving the conditions for secondary education of students with disabilities through improvement of competence of teachers and experts in the field of education and rehabilitation, as well as through acquisition of modern and custom equipment. The project is implemented by our association in partnership with Center for Education Dubrava, Zagreb (COOD) and Center for Education, Rehabilitation of Physically Handicapped Children and Adolescents, Kamnik, Slovenia. Project was funded by the European Union through the Grant Contract. Support Network – this project was aimed at improving the environment in a way that contributes to the development and sustainability of CSOs which bring together parents of children and youth with special needs on the Croatian territory, as proactive social factors in the implementation of the EU Acquis. The project was supported by the European Union through EIDHR European Instrument for Democracy & Human Rights, CBSS Country Based Support Scheme. We Can Achieve More – in partnership with Center for education ‘’Slava Raškaj’’ and primary school ‘’Horvati’’ we work on introducing occupational therapy as standard service for pupils with disability. Almost all of their users, children with special needs, especially those who are prematurely born as well as those with autism spectrum disorders, have some sort of – in many cases severe sensory dysfunction. Thus we consider it is extremely important to continue sensory integration therapy in our association. Sensory integration is way too underused in our system, as there are only several educated therapists who do not have adequate conditions for the implementation of the therapy. Implementation of sensory integration therapy is extremely important with children with sensory dysfunction in order for the nervous system of a child to be more organized, so that the child can participate much better in the activities of daily life. 44/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Through our web page and in other ways we will present the benefits of adequate sensory integration therapy to the interested public and thus raise the level of understanding of the problem of sensory integration which will lead to the better quality of life of children with special needs and their families. The money donated in year 2010, as well as in 2009, was used for computer workshop, where help to children with special developmental needs was organised, so they could develop their computer skills. In 2011 donated money also went to computer work-shop. The computer workshops are for children with disabilities in order to raise level of computer skills, make them easier processes of reading and writing education communication and socialization. Direct users were/are 20 children with serious physical disabilities (cerebral palsy, dystrophy and similar). For most children with disabilities computer is and will be basic tool for communication. In 2012 donations was for implementing Sensory Integration therapy for users in order to improve their functioning in daily life. 45/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence SOCIAL DIMENSION 46/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence SOCIAL DIMENSION Aspect: Community SO1. Nature, range and efficiency of a program or general practice by which the impact of business activities on community is assessed and managed, including the stages of input, activity and output. 1. Importance SCOTT BADER d.o.o., being a participant in a social community, both local and wider, by its sheer existence, through employing people and the level of respecting labour relations, has a social impact. Furthermore, as a producer in chemical industry it is highly interested in performing its business activities without having an adverse effect on the environment in which it exists, and that through its financial activities and timely payment of all its duties towards the state and local community contributes to its development and respect all the principles of proper business performance. The Company operates within the industry for half a century, at the same location, so in that sense its involvement with the community is not expressed, but rather it is a continuous adjustment of operations in the community and continual improvement in conduct standards (business and social conduct) in all conditions. We have not encountered corruption and we do not believe that there is a high corruption risk. We are not in any way involved in public politics and we do not use any type of lobbying. We have also never had, neither we ever shall make a donation to or support any political party or a similar institution. No proceedings were ever launched against us regarding a (dis)respect of free competition. In our recent history we were never fined or financially sanctioned for not respecting law and regulations. 2. Compiling data There were no specific programs related only to monitoring social impact, but the basic principles of the functioning of SCOTT BADER and documents related to the system of values in business activities show the goal that the Company wishes to achieve. 47/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence 3. Definitions Individual activities, internal acts and indicators are presented in other sections of this Report. 4. Documentation All feedback that the Company gets from its stakeholders is used as documentation of its social impact: customer satisfaction information; information obtained from other business partners, e.g. suppliers; certificates and permissions from the Company's owner; approvals by the Trade Union and Local Council of decisions reached, documents related to participation in business associations (Croatian Employers Association, Croatian Exporters Association and the like); participation in business polls with the purpose of gathering complete information that shall help improving business environment and labour terms; reports presented by charities regarding the utilization of donations. 48/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSION 49/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Environmental dimension We systematically monitor the impact of our activities and products on the environment and take preventive measures to prevent and reduce unwanted effects. We have a certified environmental management system according to ISO 14001, which ensures that all issues of environmental management are under constant supervision. Taking care about effects on environments is visible through energy utilisation and emission to air and water, as well as cumulating dangerous and non-dangerous waste. There is a continuous request from all responsible sectors (R&D, manufacturing, maintenance) to decrease energy consumption at total, but also per product item. Emission to air is measured on 19 locations in the plan and laboratories and all results are below defined minimal values, that put request to repeat our check every five years. Emission in the air from burnings in our own hot oil boiler is measured, according to the law, every two years. Every year we submit requested reports on emission in the air to the Register ROO. We have renewed Water licence, that regulates emissions to water, in the year 2008, and it is valued till 2013. SCOTT BADER is one of the 250 company in Croatia which are obligated to have Environmental Permit according to IPPC regulation. Analysis of the installation is accepted by Ministry of enironmental protection and Application for the establishment of integrated environmental requirements is already sent to Ministry. Surveillances made each year by inspections of different area (fire protection, health and safety, sanitary, vessel under pressure...) showed that in our company there is a high compliance with law regulations, that secures minimal effects on environment and people's health, as well as enable to prevent and avoid any accidents with risk for people and environment. Great attention is paid to the organization and regulation of the workplace both in indoor and in outdoor areas of our company. With good organization and clarity we ensure there are no incidents which could lead to environmental pollution and injury at work. 50/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence EN3 Direct power consumption For heating of production reactors during resin production we are using 2,5 MW thermal oil heater with natural gas fired burner installed 1999.

Problems in gas supply results in investment in gas burner with possibility to use gas and diesel fuel. In 2010 we have made the reconstruction of the gas burner, which we further reduce gas consumption in 2011. As we from 11.2012 to 5.2013 replaced steam heating of buildings (production plant, production offices and oil warehouse) and some technology heating systems (homogenizers, molten AMK storage tank) with hot water central heating (heat is produced by our natural gas fired Heater) we had increase of natural gas consumption per ton of production in 2013 comparing 2011 for 18,8 % but we had big decrease of steam consumption in 2013 for 41%.

In 2012 we installed two nitrogen generator lines and we produce nitrogen from compressed air. We have bigger consumption of electricity but we reduced nitrogen expenses 50%. Steam consumption is mostly related to heating the plants, working premises and offices and depends on weather conditions. In 2010 we further reduce the consumption of steam with better temperature control inside heated buildings. In 2011 we made new insulation on outside storage tanks for final products (14 pcs) heated with steam and with that investment we manage reduce steam losses in 2012. From 10.2012 until 5.2013 we replaced steam heating of buildings and production storage tanks with new more efficient central hot water heating system (we replaced also steam utilisation with more favourable power source natural gas). In 8.2013 we changed thermal insulation on all production vessels (reactors, tanks, columns). Result was steam consumption 3357 tones (-41 %) less in 2013 comparing 2012. EN8 and EN10 Water All water is obtained from local water supply system which is subject to strict control. For a number of years the meter is checked on a daily basis, with the purpose of providing a timely reaction in case of a leakage or an error in production process. A separate cooling water system with two cooling towers has been in use since 1972, and only the amount lost through evaporation on cooling towers is replaced. 53/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence We also have new vacuum pumps system implemented in 2010, with sealling water closed loop, that additional decreased water consumption. Previously system used sealing water only in one direction, not in circulation. To prevent the accumulation of sediments on cooling planes, till 2012 the water was chemically treated, thus ensuring maximum cooling effect at minimum power consumption. In 2012 we made water treatment reconstruction. Instead of using chemicals, we use ion exchanging treatment. Benefits are that we using less chemicals and water treatment is more efficient. In august 2012 we changed 150 meter of old underground water pipelines with new one and we will decrease water consumption in 2013 for more than 30 %. The reconstruction of water supply system and regular control of water consumption, water losses, and hence consumption has been continuously decreasing.

Emissions of NOx increase with increasing production. To achieve a reduction in NOx emissions it is necessary to change the burner on the hot oil boiler for heating the plants – this is one of the planned investments in the coming years. 55/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence NOx / production NOx kg/year kg/tonne 2009 716 0,0564 2010 1079 0,0690 2011 1384 0,0928 2012 1184 0,0720 2013 1213 0,0739 Dust emissions in air from production In production we are using also solid raw materials and charge them through hoppers into reactors. In 2012 we have invested in Central dust collector and filter system. It is the best solution for reducing organic dust emission during our solid raw material charging. We mesured dust emissions before and after instalation of central filter. We decreased with new filter system installation dust emission to air from 102 to 2,5 mg/m3.

The decrease in disposed waters is connected with strict technological discipline and regular daily monitoring of consumption, followed by a swift reaction to possible variations. With the purpose of reducing disposal, a new closed cooling system was installed in the Laboratory as a replacement for the continuous flow system, which used water supply cooling water a single flow. A new positive step forward is seen when the closed gasket water system in 2011 is installed in the new vacuum station.

With better sorting for non dangerous waste we have more useful waste for collection and for recycle, and less waste ends up in communal waste. For this reason, we have increasing quantity of non-hazardous waste. Quantity of hazard waste is higher past two years because our obligation according to IPPC regulation (reference documents for polymer production) is to send our reaction waste water to thermal treatment (waste incinerators). Dangerous waste, because of its specifics, may currently only be disposed by thermal processing. Only waste oils are recycled in Croatia, while all other dangerous waste is exported by authorised companies to waste incinerators. In recent years, we continuously working to reduce the quantity of hazardous waste generated in production: we use liquid instead of solid raw materials wherever we can, thus reducing the amount of hazardous waste packaging new pumps and pipes are installed to prevent leakage of raw materials and finished products waste resin are sort in order to be re-used in finished products etc. 57/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence Total waste Waste water release Waste water release m³ m³/t of products 2009 7.752 0,611 2010 7.752 0,611 2011 8.174 0,548 2012 7.375 0,449 2013 9.010 0,549 Waste per ton of products Waste water release Waste water release m³ m³/t of products 2009 7.752 0,611 2010 7.752 0,611 2011 8.174 0,548 2012 7.375 0,449 2013 9.010 0,549 EN26 Initiatives for reducing the impact on environment According to positive legal regulations, a producer is obliged, at his expense and at the request of customers, dispose of dangerous substances packaging. A very efficient system has been introduced 4 years ago in SCOTT BADER, by which the packaging from our customers is disposed of in Croatia. The amount of packaging collected and disposed of is related to the sales on the domestic market, so in the year 2007, in the light of record sales on the domestic market, the quantity of disposed packaging was the highest ever. All regular requests made by the customers for the return of packaging were met. 58/59 Global Compact Report 2013 SCOTT BADER Partner For Excellence EN30 Total ecological investments, cost & services 2009 2010 2011 2012 Investments 761.559 1.126.920 1.550.000 700.000 Costs 308.694 291.481 270.000 280.000 Services 109.754 19.100 20.000 20.000 Total 1.182.016 1.437,501 1.840.000 1.000.000 59/59 Global Compact Report 2013
