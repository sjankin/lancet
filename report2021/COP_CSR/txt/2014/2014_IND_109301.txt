PRIMING UP FOR G4 STUDY Across our reporting journey of 6 years, we have consistently demonstrated the highest degree of disclosure and all our reports have been GRI checked A+. Keeping in line with our philosophy to push the reporting envelope, we have commenced our migration to the newly introduced G4 Guidelines which encourage more strategic and focussed reporting, with a high degree of emphasis on materiality and stakeholder engagement and would be reporting on the same in subsequent year.

To tackle this problem, a Directive encouraging vehicle and component manufacturers to design products with reusability, recyclability and recoverability (RRR) in mind, was proposed and has been adopted. The Directive includes the following provisions: It is estimated that 1 Economic operators (this term includes producers, dismantlers and some 75% of a shredders among others) are to establish adequate systems for the collection of ELVs passenger cars and light commercial vehicles vehicle (mainly the metallic content) is 2 Current reuse, recycling and recovery targets that must be met by currently recycled. economic operators are 85% recovery with 80% as a minimum for recycling and increased targets from 2015 are 95% recovery with a minimum of 85% recycling 3 Restrict use of heavy metals such as Lead, Hexavalent Chromium, Mercury & Cadmium to in new vehicles 4 Producer to be responsible for establishing collection systems to take back end-of-life vehicles, and the arrangements for meeting re-use, recycling and recovery targets The remaining 25%, which mostly INTERVENTION comprises of ELV / RRR requirements for present European Export Vehicle variants was made plastic, glass, part of the Mahindra Product Development Systems (MPDS). A vehicle recycling strategy was drawn up, to streamline the vehicle recovery process for compliance rubber, foam and with RRR directive. This strategy involves inclusion of agreed measures right from contaminants, developmental stage of the vehicle, to ensure successful achieving of target is generally 85% recycling and 95% recovery rates. considered either Working groups have been constituted to deal with restrictions on the heavy unsuitable or metals in products exported to European Union. Measures are in place to collect appropriate data through the full supply chain, (in particular the nature and the uneconomic for mass of all materials used in the construction of the vehicles), manage the recycling. breakdown of materials and ensure that no component part listed in Annex V of RRR Directive is used in construction of new vehicles. A number of standards have been mandated to be followed during the vehicle developmental stage and for providing detailed speciﬁcations about ELV / RRR requirements. M&M has also devised a list of Raw Material Codes, which are being incorporated in the PLM systems, so as to understand the material content and gauge approximate recyclability level of the vehicle during the preproduction stage itself. Dismantling information for safe handling of end-of-life vehicles and sound material recovery has been freely made available on Mahindra's website www.mahindra-tis.com, for the beneﬁt of dismantling agencies. 64 IMPACT Mahindra has imbibed these environmental learnings and can now respond rapidly to similar directives if and when they emerge from any geography.

Chairman, Mahindra Group 73 Learning from our innovations To innovate smartly it is essential to focus on innovations which have failed and learn from them. We therefore celebrate genuine innovations even though they might have failed in gaining a foothold. In 2011, we instituted 'Failed Innovations Award' to recognise that learning from failures also leads to success. Below is the proud winner for the year 2013. Infrastructure & Real Estate for their innovation 360° curing and waterproong To cure water seepage in construction materials, this innovation employed nanotechnology. A surface is created on the material to make it waterproof. Though this innovation passed most tests for waterprooﬁng, it did not get satisfactory results for the test which involved compressive strength on concrete. However, it can be used as a waterprooﬁng agent on tiles and other surfaces.

Adverse climate can impact a business operation just as signiﬁcantly as an adverse business operation can impact the climate. Our businesses cover both manufacturing and agricultural sectors, and are hence even more susceptible to temperamental weathers. Although we have institutionalised wide-ranging initiatives to keep our carbon footprint under check, we also appreciate the fact that there is only so much that we can do as an individual organisation. Hence, we take part in diverse national and international think tanks, councils and advisory bodies to effect a larger and more long-term positive change. Mahindra Group is a part of the TERI BCSD forum. TERI-BCSD helps incorporate sustainability into the business strategy of companies by providing advisory and connecting corporates with other stakeholders. 83 This year, one of our companies, Mahindra Sanyo Special Steel Pvt. Ltd. (MSSSPL) became a founding member of India Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Program. The Program is a new industry-led, voluntary initiative, spearheaded by the World Resources Institute (WRI)-India, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). MSSSPL also became one of the only two Indian businesses making a representation at The Warsaw Climate Change Conference 2013. A delegation from the Company took part in the nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 19). Key decisions adopted at this conference include decisions on further advancing the Durban Platform, the Green Climate Fund and Long-Term Finance, the Warsaw Framework for REDD Plus, and the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage. While we strive to contribute towards resisting the climate change, we have also adapted to its adverse impacts by adopting various measures right from getting the right supply of our raw materials to ensuring the right demand of our product, right from adopting the right technology which is favourable to nature to equipping our operations with right infrastructure. We realise that climate change impacts not only our businesses, but also our stakeholders. Hence, we engage with relevant stakeholders and mentor them on climate risk and sustainable practices that will help mitigate this risk. Local supply At Mahindra, when we say that we are an Indian Multinational, the emphasis lies more on the word 'Indian'. The country has given us immense opportunities to grow and we take it as our prerogative to give back in kind. Encouraging local supply is just one such means. Giving local supply a shot in the arm not only makes great business sense owing to the reduced transportation cost and faster deliveries, it also provides a global platform for local manufacturers to exhibit their products, services and proﬁciencies. That being said, we would not want our customer's user experience to be dampened by our enthusiasm towards local suppliers. Hence, we have a stringent process of identifying and empanelling only the most promising suppliers. Some of the factors inﬂuencing supplier selection include: Cost Performance and Compliance on environment, Commitment to reduce Statutory on-time delivery health and safety guidelines the carbon footprint requirements There are some other factors which can inﬂuence the decision to opt for international suppliers like beneﬁts from SEZ, favourable taxes and import duties schemes as compared to local market procurement. But in such cases, the route of policy mandate maintains a fair balance. Although the boundaries of India remain the de facto deﬁnition of local supply for most of our businesses, a few of them have more focussed perimeter. Mahindra World City, Jaipur makes it a point to source from within a 500 km radius while Systech Gears' units at Chakan and Kanhe have a 300 km radius limit for procurement. 84 % of local suppliers (within top 10) 98% 89% 87% 85% 83% 80% 74% 27% MWC MVML MReva Systech MIL MTWL MHRIL MEPC An analysis of the top 10 suppliers as per monetary value for each business shows that on an aggregate basis, Mahindra Group sourced 89% of its requirement locally.

Through sustained collaborations with the suppliers, FD has managed to bring down wood consumption (in kg used per unit of production) from 16 kg/tractor manufactured in FY 09 to 7.8 kg/tractor manufactured produced in FY 14. Similarly during the same period, the consumption of corrugated boxes has come down from 27 kg/tractor manufactured to 17.4 kg/tractor manufactured. Seeding a sustainable SCM at MSSSPL The 4th annual Supply Chain Management workshop at MSSSPL was conducted in October 2013 under the theme: 'Sustainable Supply Chain Meet SSCM 4.0'. The theme aimed to depict the wider scope and the changing paradigms of sustainable SCM. The workshop included sessions on: MSSSPL’s Vision, Discussion and sharing Supplier presentations Presentations made by external Policy and of expectations on the highlighting the organisations like KPMG (on G4 Roadmap for Code of Conduct for sustainability initiative guidelines) and BSI (on BS 8903 SSCM (FY13-FY18) MSSSPL’s suppliers at their locations Sustainable Supply chain Standard) A total of 52 delegates including 15 Tier 1 suppliers and members from Mahindra Systech companies, attended the workshop.

Reduction in Thermal Energy Consumption, Automotive Division, Mumbai CASE STUDY CHALLENGE Energy consumption was affecting the bottom lines of AD's Kandivli Plant. INTERVENTION An intensive study was conducted at the Plant and the thermopac oven was found to be the highest fuel consuming equipment, i.e. around 1,800 m3 PNG per day. After intensive analysis of all the feasible solutions, it was decided that the best route would be to recover waste heat for preheating of combustion air, so that the oven would consume less fuel. For this, a Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger (HPHE), a lightweight compact heat recovery system was pressed into service. It comprises a sealed container, a capillary wick structure and a working fluid. The benefits: Lowers the power requirements and increases Capable of operating at 315° with Maintenance free, zero the overall thermal efficiency of the system 60% to 80% heat recovery capability crosscontamination 99 OUTCOME This energy saving intervention helped the Plant reap multiple beneﬁts, which are listed below: Monetary savings Operational beneﬁts PNG gas saved: CO2 emission reduction: INR 7.25 Lacs 22,700 scm/annum 44 Tons /annum per annum Reduction in exhaust gas temperature leading to decreased surrounding temperature Scope for horizontal deployment: After successful implementation at thermopac oven, horizontal deployment carried out at Thermopac oven 2: Body Top coat oven main entry oven Body Top coat oven OTHER SECTORAL INITIATIVES Hinoday, Urse Over-achieving energy targets During the reporting period, MHIL, Urse over-achieved its energy saving targets of 854 kWh/LMT by achieving savings of 892 kWh/LMT in October 2013 itself. A host of initiatives were carried out to achieve this success, of which the key ones are listed here: Compressor energy Elimination of machine cooling Melting utility Auto shut-off consumption reduced tower & pump resulted in energy reduced by timers for Fume by 425 kWh per day savings of 150 kWh per day 400 kWh per day extraction blowers Rainwater harvesting helped save energy Electrical heating of Dust Collector heater banks converted to LPG required for pumping river water heating, resulting in energy savings of up to 5,000 units per day Furnace cooling coil raw water pump impeller was trimmed to optimise its functioning and thereby reduce power consumption.

The values have always been found to be within the guidelines and limits, defined by the State Pollution Control Boards and local regulatory authorities. Enhancing the Value of Wastewater with Bio-Sanitiser CASE STUDY CHALLENGE The Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at MSSCL's Kanhe facility was using the conventional methodology of adding chemicals for treating sewage, and power operated agitators. There was a continuous odour emanating not just from the STP but also from the treated water. This foul smell rendered the treated water unusable, even for gardening purpose. Thus, the energy and resources spent on the wastewater recycling were going down the drain. INTERVENTION For any environmental measure to be truly sustainable, it needs to be based on sound economics. After a series of discussions with Group Sustainability, alternative ecotechnology was adopted in place of conventional technology. The STP was retrofitted with a Bio-Sanitizer. Developed in India, this treatment, once placed in the flow of wastewater, can aerate and treat the sewage without any recurring costs like power, additional machinery or chemicals. This oxygen-rich water also becomes a resource for eco-sanitation. The project was initiated in March 2013 and completed in May 2013, in phases. Stage-wise Gradual stoppage and removal of Switching off Agitators / Aerators in introduction electrical devices like pumps, blowers old STP tank after few days to allow of enzyme and filters stabilisation of system Use of existing Tube Settler Bypassing Sand and Dosing in treated Testing the water quality in one of the STP tanks Graphite filters water storage tank at regular intervals OUTCOME After installation of the bio-sanitiser, following outcomes have been achieved: POWER SAVINGS COST SAVING 40 units of electricity is being saved The annual maintenance contract every day; leading to savings of is no longer required; leading to INR 95,000 per year savings of INR 2.88 lac SAFETY OF WATER ENHANCED USABILITY No chemicals are being The treated water is now odourless. It can be used in used at the STP gardening and thus, there is no need to order tankers. A second phase is now under execution for further improvements like eliminating suspended solids, and enhancing the capacity of storing treated water. Additionally, a template has now been created for other units and Group Companies to study and emulate. 103 Water Management The Mahindra Way Mahindra Institute of Quality (MIQ) Demand Management, Distribution 50% reduction in water usage in the and Group Sustainability have and Pumping, Stakeholder Perspective past few years. continued their journey towards water towards Sustainability, Statutory 27 participants from various M&M conservation by conducting the requirements, Quality parameters, businesses attended the programme. second batch of training programme Treatment Approaches, Watershed In addition to Mahindra employees, 'Water Management The Mahindra Management at Damoh, Rainwater the programme was also open to Way', in March 2014.

AD, Igatpuri understood the importance of water and initiated proactive measures, based on four broad aspects, to ensure judicious and continued use of water: Accounting and monitoring Cross functional teams were formed and water meters were installed at all prominent locations. Detailed water audit was done to identify areas of high water consumption. Changing process and addressing abnormalities Abnormalities like leaking water lines, frequently overflowing cooling tower tanks and unusually frequent cleaning schedules were identified and addressed. Recycle and reuse Encouraged the use of treated wastewater and installed bio filter plants and root-zone technology STP to treat canteen waste and domestic sewage respectively. Rainwater harvesting Special arrangements were made to harvest the rainwater from the rooftops of various manufacturing locations of Igatpuri. Not wanting to stop at just bringing Two locations with V-shaped valleys down the consumption of water, AD and good water retention potentials Igatpuri also analysed the resource were identiﬁed and a large, shallow Through these measures, pattern for water usage.

As the lake is located in a rocky region, the ground water recharge is not much. This makes it essential to restore the lake to sustain water quality in the surrounding villages. INTERVENTION MWC, Chennai has taken up the task of replenishing the lake via rainwater harvesting The total run-off from roof and non-roof areas 3 and stormwater management. A network of is over 15,000 m /day and 100% of stormwater stormwater drains has been constructed along run-off is diverted to the lake. all the roads & buildings connected to the lake. Restoration measures such as de-silting, de-weeding, solid waste management, capacity restoration, strengthening of embankments and erosion control have been taken up. A common STP arrests wastewater flowing into the lake. OUTCOME Water levels are maintained in the Lake through out the year. Groundwater levels and water quality has been enhanced in the surrounding villages. The rejuvenated Kolavai Lake has also restored its pride as a tourist attraction. Benchmarking an evergreen landscape Mahindra World City, Jaipur CASE STUDY CHALLENGE A landscape designed to inspire, struggled to survive the intense climate at MWCJ. A startling number of withered saplings indicated that the team needed to think afresh. INTERVENTION Existing plants were replaced with select plants suitable for the region. With renewed efforts, the garden once again started blooming with small shrubs. However, the cost of procurement of these new species was very high as these were not available in the local market. To counter this, the team established an in-house nursery for these plants and successfully built capacity within MWCJ. OUTCOME With dedicated research and execution, this nursery has become a repository of best practices in horticulture. Over 5,000 saplings planted from the nursery form a natural ecosystem at MWCJ. The nursery also supplies plants to the residing companies of MWCJ, the parent group company Mahindra and Mahindra, as well as to other companies in the adjoining campuses. This not only reduces costs but also provides a potential revenue stream and helps build relationships with existing and new clients. 107 Materials The sustainability quotient of any product depends on the quantity and the quality of materials used in producing it.

Deeper research by team MWCJ yielded that there were high number of school dropouts and unskilled youth in the villages. INTERVENTION OUTCOME It was decided to establish a centre for vocational training.

A blood disorder in which excessive destruction of red blood cells leads to acute anemia and its treatment involves blood transfusions on a regular basis. At Nashik district, 201 Thalassemia-afﬂicted children were registered at the civil hospital in FY 2013 for blood donation. While these children suffered from this dreaded disease, their parents too remained grieved owing to major economic burden & psychological stress. INTERVENTION Realising the predicament of such afﬂicted children, Esops decided to adopt them all and thus began Project Rakhee. Beyond adding years to the lives of these children, our Esops volunteers from AD Nashik were also determined on adding life to their years. While blood support was meticulously managed, various recreational and counselling activities were organised on a regular basis to enhance their quality of life. A group of 875 dedicated blood donors (6 per affected child) were identiﬁed from Esops volunteers and in-house blood donation drive was organised for employee donors as per the need of each Thalassemia patient. Alongside providing blood transfusion facility several other activities were spearheaded. For example establishing day care centre, free treatment & health check-up camps, procurement of medicines for adopted children, counselling for children and parents, encouraging Yoga & Pranayam, monthly picnics & festival celebrations for parents and children, and spreading Thalassemia awareness among the society.

This is because Indian medical services are unaffordable and inaccessible for large chunks of society. The rural and tribal areas, the socially backward and the economically disadvantaged forms a large population of the country that remains completely cut off from even basic primary healthcare. At Mahindra, we strive to bring basic healthcare access to the lower strata of society in the remotest of regions of the country.
