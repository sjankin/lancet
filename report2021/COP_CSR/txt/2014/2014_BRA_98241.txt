Once again, the CPFL Energia Group has been able to deliver on this. • Sustainable energy solutions • Excellence and competiveness • Integration with the community As a result of these attributes, we were able to meet the challenges of changes to both the Brazilian energy matrix and also pricing levels, plus the effects of tariff reductions – all stemming from Law 12.783/13 which covered the anticipated rollover of electricity generation, transmission and distribution concession agreements due to expire during the 2015-2017 period. 6 | Annual Report 2013 CPFL Energia Annual Report 2013 CPFL Energia | 7 1. CPFL Moreover, these characteristics will be ever more necessary in the light of anticipated medium term structural changes to the energy sector, which will undoubtedly impact the business dynamics of relations among market agents. An increase in distributed generation and micro-generation in the Brazilian energy matrix; considerable growth in the use of renewable energy sources with a view to reducing carbon emissions; an increase in efficiency and improvements to the quality of services with no corresponding price hike; and the adoption of new technologies: these are just some of the experts’ forecasts for the coming years. CPFL Energia is fully immersed in its mission to participate in the construction of the modern Brazilian energy model and takes part in discussion forums such as the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, as well as possessing a portfolio of innovative projects. These aim to increase its process productivity and efficiency in order to more effectively meet the demands of society as well as its shareholders and 7.4 million customers. Reducing costs while maintaining – and improving – the quality of its services was, and continues to be, an objective for the CPFL Energia Group. As a result, at year-end 2013, it reported EBITDA of R$ 3.546 billion and net income of R$ 949 million. These results were instrumental in the Board proposing the distribution of R$ 931 million in dividends to shareholders, reaffirming our practice of exceeding the minimum payout enshrined in company policy. CPFL Energia’s shares were included for the ninth consecutive year in the BM&FBovespa Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) and, for the second time, in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Emerging Markets. In addition, the CPFL Renováveis IPO in 2013 produced a trading turnover of R$ 900 million on BM&FBovespa’s Novo Mercado.

In parallel to this process, the company also reviews its growth guidelines and investment decisions. Finally, the conclusions reached by the directors are put to shareholders for approval. CPFL Energia’s long term strategic planning takes into account sector changes which are likely to affect consumption patterns and the technology employed. Among other examples of variables to be considered is the increase in distributed generation and micro-generation in the energy matrix, identification of renewable generation sources and a focus on a low carbon economy. In this context in 2013, the company developed its “Energy in the City of the Future” project for fostering greater interaction between society and the electricity sector. The project also established guidelines and directives to be adopted by local municipalities as well as putting forward public policies and corporate strategies that both promote innovative and sustainable technologies as well as address consumer concerns. Ten meetings will take place in 2014 (five were held in 2013), bringing together specialists in a range of areas to discuss issues such as the electricity matrix with renewable and non-renewable sources, electric mobility, intelligent distribution, and regulatory trends, among others. 38 | Annual Report 2013 CPFL Energia Relatório Anual 2013 CPFL Energia | 39 4.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The international scenario during the year restricted recovery, aspects carried over from the previous year continuing to cause The context of global deceleration weighed heavily however, not to mention logistical problems and the uncertainty surrounding of unemployment and increasing household incomes. As a combined reflection of these factors, Brazil was able to record a growth a high degree of market uncertainty. the country’s economic policy. And the in GDP of 2.3% for the year. Notable among these was the possibility situation was not helped by weaker of a renewed financial crisis in Europe and confidence levels and rising inflation.

Worldwide economic growth in 2014 is expected to be moderate at about 3.7%, driven 7.3. Principal Results by a reversal in the recessionary tendencies in Europe and economic acceleration in the Operational United States. In Brazil, domestic prospects remain positive in the light of continuing low unemployment, although GDP growth in the next two years will be less than in 2013 at Energy sales in the concession area amounted to 58.463 GWh in 2013, a growth 1.7% and 2.0% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. of 3.1% in relation to the 55,682 GWh sold in 2012.

Monitoring at the Ipê plant resulted in 169.77 mg/Nm3 for the particulate material emission rate and 141.99 mg/Nm3 for nitrous oxide emissions. At the Baldin BioEnergy cogeneration plant, the values obtained were 120.7 mg/Nm for particulate material emissions and 118.9 mg/Nm3 for nitrogen oxide emission. The Bio Pedra cogeneration plant has two chimneys, as it possesses two furnaces. The readings for the chimney of the first furnace were 183.57 mg/Nm3 for particulate material emissions and 168.91 mg/Nm3 for nitrogen oxide emission. For the second furnace’s chimney, the values were 166.86 mg/Nm3 for particulate material emissions and 133.31 mg/Nm3 for nitrogen oxide emission. Finally, the monitoring data for the Esther plant were 104.03 mg/Nm3 for particulate material and 98.46 mg/Nm3 Nm3 for nitrogen oxide emission. We stress that for all cogeneration plants the values obtained for particulate material and nitrous oxide were below the maximum values established by legislation, which are 200 mg/Nm3 for particulate material emissions and 350 mg/Nm3 for nitrogen oxide (NOx ).
