According to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy grew by 2.6% year on year in 2013 and is expected to grow 3.6% in 2014. Globally, the outlook for the oil and gas industry remains positive, providing favorable conditions for pursuing the implementation of our strategic framework. Still promising oil consumption Although global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowed in 2013, it is expected to begin rising again in 2014. Oil demand in 2013(1) was moderately higher than previously thought and projected demand is expected to grow in 2014. The outlook for oil consumption is also promising in the medium and long term. The International Energy Agency (IEA) revised its forecast for 2035 from 99 to 101 million barrels per day. Crude oil prices have been relatively stable above USD 100/barrel over 2013, and there is a consensus that they will remain around this level in the short to medium term. This contributes to supporting the profitability of our clients’ activities, thus projects investments.

Deepwater projects just keep going deeper. 15 years ago, “ultradeepwater” referred to projects operating at a depth of 500 meters. Today, the deepwater market includes production operations close to 3,000 meters below sea-level. Much of this subsea progress has been made possible by Technip innovation in flexible pipes as well as our integrated approach, with a continuous focus on excellence. Innovation that is 40 years young In subsea, the story of Technip is the story of constantly pushing back the limits of deepwater operations by making pipes and field installations stronger and smarter. Today we are the only company in the world to have tested a pipe in real-world conditions at a depth of 3,000 meters. This achievement was made possible by 40 years of constant innovation in pipe technologies, and in particular flexible pipes. To date over 10,000 kilometers of Technip high-pressure flexible pipe have been installed around the world. Besides, Technip leverages its unique vertically-integrated position: we are spanning control on the whole valuechain and processes. This ensures maximum reliability, key to meet ❶ deepwater challenges. ❶ Our R&D centers, such as Technip Innovation and Technology Center opened in 2013 in France, are taking flexible pipe technologies further. Technip 2013 Activity and Sustainable Development Report subsea Ensuring the lead in flexibles Flexible pipe solutions are particularly well suited to the pressure, temperature and corrosion encountered when producing oil and gas at great depths. With each products generation, the capabilities of Technip flexibles increase. Among ❷❸❹ our latest developments in flexible technologies are: ❷ Flexible pipes are fabricated in Technip’s plants around the world, including our new Açuflex facility in Brazil. • I ntegrated Production Bundle (IPB): to meet the needs of flow assurance, Technip’s IPB flexible pipe has an incorporated electrical heating system temperature monitoring. •A  nti-H2S sheath: our patented anti-hydrogen sulfide (H2S) layer is made of a composite material that is placed between the pressure sheath and the pressure vault. It allows flexibles for sour oil to be made of sweet service steel grades, which have advantageous mechanical properties, while protecting against H2S corrosion. •C arbon Fiber Armor: Technip Carbon Fiber Armor replaces steel in risers with layers of carbon composite. The result is a riser five times lighter and twice as strong as steel and naturally resistant to H2S. The riser is, therefore, less subject to tensile fatigue and does not require additional buoyancy systems. ❸ Taking our pipes’ intelligence even deeper At Technip, our subsea expertise goes beyond providing pipes. We are also a leader in subsea services including inspection, repair, maintenance, decommissioning and Asset Integrity Management (AIM). In the North Sea alone, we were awarded four contracts by Shell, Fairfield Energy, Ithaca Energy and TAQA for life of field services in 2013. Technip is forging ahead in AIM, and Technip AIM Services is a major player in this emerging sector. This business unit focuses on life of field to reduce the risk of asset failure and accidents. Its two main products are vibrating wire gauge and acoustic emissions monitoring. The former is for monitoring steel catenary hybrid risers and riser towers. The latter is for monitoring the integrity of tensile armor ❹ wires in flexibles. 40_41 TECHNIP IN 2013 OPERATIONS sustainability Reaping the rewards of recent strategic moves In 2012, Technip integrated Global Industries and formed an alliance with Heerema Marine Contractors in order to maintain our position as one of the leading subsea contractors in the world. The value of these strategic moves was confirmed in 2013, with Technip winning several subsea contracts. Petrobras picked us to supply flexible pipes capable of meeting its requested service life for its pre-salt projects. Our operating center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, will perform the engineering and project management. The flexibles will be fabricated at our existing plant in Vitória, Brazil, and our new plant in Açu, Brazil. Our Flexi France plant in Le Trait, France, ❶ will fabricate flexibles for important contracts such as the Total Egina project, Tullow TEN and one for Statoil. On the other side of the world, our As far as our fleet is concerned, Deep Energy Asiaflex Products plant was awarded 17 projects and Deep Orient, Technip’s two latest pipelay for the supply of flexibles, from 15 different clients vessels, entered into service in 2013.

Most of the deTeta wires developed by Technip’s R&D team in its Flexi France plant. velopments have been and are considering a flexible pipe solution, for which Technip has been the main supplier locally for years. With that in mind, the R&D center in Brazil was created to conduct R&D and qualification programs tailor-made for Brazilian technical challenges. Having grown steadily over the past years, more than 80 people now work in the R&D department, with the main office being in Rio de Janeiro and the technological center (CTF – Center of Technology of Flexibras) in Jucu, near one of our flexible pipe manufacturing plan in Vitória. How does the R&D center help us to keep our leadership? Working close to our main client, Petrobras, allows us to considerably improve communication between both groups of experts. This is a key factor for the success of developing flexible solution for the recently discovered and challenging pre-salt fields. The pre-salt resources are developed by Petrobras in partnership with other oil companies, which could also in the future adopt and replicate the flexible pipe solution on worldwide developments, increasing Technip leadership of flexible products. How is the R&D center interacting with the Innovation and Technology Center (ITC) and the other R&D centers? We are fully aligned with ITC strategic development ❸ and orientation for flexible pipe technology.

Technip 2013 Activity and Sustainable Development Report Environmental indicators Technip’s main environmental indicators In 2013, a larger environmental reporting coverage was recorded among the Group both in terms of number of entities reporting data and total number of manhours worked. Some indicators increased mainly due to the increasing operations within the Group, the improved level of reporting, a new methodology to estimate some indicators and the nature of works on some construction sites. Nevetheless, the global impact of Technip's operations on the environment has decreased, which demonstrates the greater commitment towards the environment accross the Group.
