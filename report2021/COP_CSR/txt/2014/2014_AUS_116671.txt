Our Managing Director again signed up for ‘Movember’ and has raised in excess of $4,000, supporting world class men's health programs that combat prostate and testicular cancer and mental health challenges. These programs, directed by the Movember Foundation, are focused on:  Awareness and education;  Staying mentally healthy;  Living with and beyond cancer;  Living with and beyond mental illness; and  Research. In addition, one of our employees completed the Oxfam Trailwalker in May 2014 and raised approximately $8,000. This Christmas, in lieu of sending cards via the post to our clients and candidates, we are donating to a nine year old boy named Jack who suffers from severe Cerebral Palsy and Epilepsy. The family will use the donation to help fund a custom made postural splint and hand splint for Jack.

We support diversity with our practice and offer a supportive and flexible environment for our employees. Enabling our employees to work from home, in a paperless web-enabled environment, means that we leave less of a carbon footprint each week. 3
