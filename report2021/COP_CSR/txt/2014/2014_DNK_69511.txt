SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 5 HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Statement of continued support In our CSR Policy, we state that we will support and respect the protection of international human rights. We also underline that we will strive to prevent any human rights violations and remedy violations in case we are involved in such. Without our employees, our company is nothing. Concerning the human rights of our employees, we state in our CSR Policy that we will provide them with good employment and that we will follow applicable laws and collective agreements with regard to wages and other employment conditions. We also state that we will work to ensure development opportunities and a safe and healthy working environment. In our Supplier Code of Conduct our suppliers and business partners are requested to support and respect the protection of international human rights and to remedy violations in case they are involved in such. Implementation We have distributed our CSR Policy to our employees and published it on our website to make it available to all interested stakeholders. In March 2013 we initiated a self-assessment screening process of our suppliers of tools based on a general risk assessment of these suppliers. Starting from UN Global Compact and Global Reporting Initiative, our most significant suppliers of tools were asked to report on a number of indicators concerning human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. Our suppliers of materials did not participate in this screening, as they are large reputable international companies that already in a detailed manner publish their efforts in the area of CSR. Measurement of outcomes No incidents of involvement in human rights violations were reported in 2013. The outcome of the 2013-screening of our most significant suppliers of tools fully met our expectations, since we did not find any issues of concern in the selected part of our supply chain in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 6 We will continue to do screenings and self-assessments based on our ongoing risk assessments of our most significant suppliers of tools. We have received no substantiated complaints concerning breaches of employee or customer privacy.3 Likewise we have received no administrative or judicial sanctions for failure to comply with laws and regulations concerning the provision and use of our products and services.4 With regard to the human rights of our employees a number of relevant issues will be described in the following. The total number of employees in all our sites has grown from 615 in 2012 to 676 employees5 in 2013.

SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 7 At our sites in Denmark, wages and salaries and working conditions are determined in collective agreements resulting from central and local negotiations. In Poland and China (the smallest organizational entity), the conditions and rights of the employees are primarily stipulated by legislation, codes and regulation. In general, we follow national labour market regulations and make sure that the salary of our employees is fair and equal; that the workweek is limited to an absolute maximum of 48 hours; that overtime is infrequent and limited; and that employees are given reasonable breaks and rest periods. We also seek to offer our employees additional benefits. We work to ensure a safe and healthy working environment in all our sites.9 In Poland every autumn, we organize vaccination against influenza for interested employees. Lost working Hours10 Number of occupational injuries for employees 4 Lost working hours for employees because of occupational injuries (2.467 hours due to one employee hurting his ankle in SP M China) 3,169 Fatalities of employees arising from an occupational injury 0 Lost working hours for employees because of sickness not due to occupational injuries 15,515 We take measures to improve health and safety at all our workplaces and we provide our employees with protective equipment, including safety shoes, safety glasses, safety gloves and work wear. We also provide our employees with necessary training to perform their tasks safely, including fire handling and first aid training.11 We seek to improve the qualifications of our employees through supplementary training and continuing education.12 Many of our employees receive regular performance and career development reviews.

SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 8 Case: LifeStraw ® Family 2.0 delivers clean, safe drinking water LifeStraw® Family 2.0 is the next generation of Vestergaard’s high-volume point-of-use water filter. It converts microbiologically contaminated water into clean, safe drinking water, filtering up to 30,000 liters of EPA-quality water, enough to supply a family of five with clean drinking water for three to five years. LifeStraw® Family 2.0 is a durable, tabletop version. It includes a large dirty water storage tank and a built in safe storage container with tap. SP Moulding has been instrumental in developing this unique offering from Vestergaard promoting the human right to clean water for families who do not have access to safe drinking water. SP Moulding is now focusing on scaling up production of this LifeStraw® Family 2.0. SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 9 Case: Implementation of industrial robots in Juelsminde In 2013, several industrial robots have been installed in the production and assembly area in the Juelsminde factory. The robots improve efficiency, while reducing unilateral work for employees. The robots have mainly been installed for the handling of high volume parts. In the production area, we have installed three 6-axis robots directly at the injection machines and we have implemented a packaging cell to avoid manual packaging of big quantities of parts. One of the 6-axis robots in connection with an injection-moulding machine (right) has substituted the previous manual work of heating five inserts, cutting inlet and drilling a hole. This is now done automatically inline during the cycle time of the injection moulding. The robot installations have improved the ergonomics and eliminated monotonous repetitive work for the employees, who have now been trained to do other tasks e.g. quality control of finished parts and other more varying tasks, which gives the employees higher commitment and job satisfaction. In the assembly area, we have installed two small 6-axis robots. One robot (left) was installed at a specialized milling machine for pick and place of the parts in and out of the workstation for machining. The other robot (below) was installed in the printing area where it also handles pick and place of parts in and out of fixtures of 5 different printing machines. Previously, the employees did the monotonous repetitive work in the two examples above. Today the employees are filling the conveyers with parts, leaving the monotonous work for the robots and focus on e.g. quality control instead. Introducing the robots has not resulted in any reductions of the workforce, but the total capacity in the production and assembly areas has gone up while health and safety of the employees has been improved at the same time. SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 10 LABOUR Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Statement of continued support In our CSR Policy, we state that we recognize our employees' right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. We also state that we denounce forced labour and child labour, and that we will not discriminate in the workplace. In our Supplier Code of Conduct, our suppliers and business partners are requested to support and respect the protection of these international labour standards. Implementation Our CSR Policy has in 2013 been distributed to our employees and is published on our website to make it available to all interested stakeholders. As described under the Human Rights section, in 2013 we have screened our suppliers of tools with regard to our Supplier Code of Conduct including the UN Global Compact principles. In the screening and self-assessment process of our suppliers of tools, we found no issues of concern with regard to labour rights. SP Moulding is a member of the Confederation of Danish Industries (DI). In its capacity of employer’s association, DI is responsible for collective bargaining at the Danish level within our sector. Through our membership of DI and in our daily practice, we support the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining and many of our employees are members of labour unions. Measurement of outcomes We have not identified sites in Denmark, Poland or China in which the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining have been at significant risk.14 At the sites in Denmark, employees appoint representatives for joint consultation committees and working environment committees where they meet 14 GRI G3 HR-05. SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 11 with local management. At the sites in Poland and China, systems have been established where the employees appoint spokesmen for negotiations with management.15 In general, we do not hire children or young workers below 18 years of age and no claims of child labour were reported in 2013.16 We only have one business unit SP Moulding (Juelsminde) in Denmark – where we hire children above 13 years of age to help us with lighter work after school hours. In 2013, four children between 13 and 18 years of age worked for a maximum of 2 hours a day and we have special quality procedures for these children.17 All our employees are provided with an employment contract and no claims of forced labour were reported in 2013.18 Likewise no claims of discrimination were reported in 2013.19 As an international company, we respect differences in cultures and traditions and we value a diverse workforce.20 When it comes to age and gender we have a relatively diverse workforce. The Board of Directors has decided that the target for the underrepresented sex in the Board should be minimum one member at the time of the General Assembly in 2017. On the next level of management (executive management and management) the target to be met before the end of 2017 for the underrepresented sex is 20 %.

Statement of continued support In our CSR Policy we state that we will work systematically to reduce our negative environmental impact and promote greater environmental responsibility through our certified environmental management systems. In general, plastic has a number of unique characteristics and if plastic is produced and used wisely, it has a positive impact on the environment. In our Supplier Code of Conduct our suppliers and business partners are requested to support and respect these principles of environmental responsibility. Implementation We have a management system implementing our environment policies and goals. We are certified to the ISO 9001 standard and to the ISO 14001 standard. Our management system includes key elements from ISO/TS 16949. We comply with all environmental directives, among these the REACH (1907/2006/CE), Candidate list of Substances of Very High Concern and RoHS directive (2011/65/EU). We have distributed our CSR Policy to our employees and published it on our website to make it available to all interested stakeholders. As described under the Human Rights section, we have screened our suppliers of tools with regard to our Supplier Code of Conduct including the UN Global Compact principles. In the screening and self-assessment process of our suppliers of tools, we found no issues of concern with regard to the protection of the environment. SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 13 Measurement of outcomes We have not received any administrative or judicial sanctions for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations.23 Energy We try to buy green electricity. In our SP Moulding sites Juelsminde and Stoholm (Denmark) and in our SP Medical site in Karise (Denmark) our purchased electricity stems from:24 50% coal power plant 25% natural gas plant 25% wind power energy / water power energy / nuclear power We have done an active effort to save electricity by reducing our energy use and increasing our energy efficiency25 with total savings of nearly one mill. kWh in 2013. Initiatives include: Air-cooling for process water New pumps for circulation of cooling. The pumps are frequency controlled, which gives more stable water pressure, more stable production and at the same time saves energy Frequency converters on injection-moulding machines Automatic movement sensors in corridors Reusing heat from cooling system We continue to reduce our indirect energy source by replacing some of our business-related travel with video conferences and telephone meetings.26 In China, Poland and Denmark we encourage our employees to go to work by bus, metro or bicycle.

SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 16 Development of new environmental friendly products SP Moulding is using regrind of plastic material according to demands from the customers. In addition, we are optimizing the injection process (e.g. cycle time) and ensure continuing maintenance of the production equipment to reduce the consumption of energy and to reduce the amount of waste. It is important for us to influence our customers to use environmentally friendly materials, as well as always focusing on buying the most environmentally friendly auxiliary materials.37 37 GRI G3 EN-26. SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 17 Case: Saving energy and improving the production process at the Juelsminde factory SP Moulding is always concerned about the reduction of energy consumption. This is for example the case when we invest in new injection moulding machines or new installations. During 2013 SP Moulding in Juelsminde installed the first part of a new cooling system using compressors with air-cooling for our process water. The new cooling system (above) saves energy and thereby also helps fulfilling our environmental ambition. We also installed new pumps for circulation of cooling. The pumps are frequency controlled. This gives more stable water pressure, more stable production and at the same time saves energy. Furthermore, during 2013 SP Moulding in Juelsminde has mounted frequency converters on three injection-moulding machines. The machines have a high clamping force, respectively 430 tons, 500 tons and 560 tons. We expect the saved energy for frequency converters to be 75,000 kWh each year. SP Moulding will continue to implement changes to save electricity by efforts to reduce the energy consumption and at the same time increase energy efficiency. SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 18 ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Statement of continued support In our CSR Policy we state that we do not participate in corruption or bribery and that we will not offer, promise or give any kind of bribes to improperly influence public officials, judges or business associates. We also state that we will refrain from receiving or accepting any bribes ourselves and that persons acting on our behalf are subject to the obligation not to participate in corruption or bribery. In our Supplier Code of Conduct our suppliers and business partners are requested to support and respect these anti-corruption principles. Implementation We have distributed our CSR Policy including our statement on corruption and bribery to our employees. In 2014 we are planning adequate procedures against anti-corruption as well as formal training sessions on anti-corruption for core employees. China has a special focus, due to the higher risk potential in this part of the world. Measurement of outcomes Management makes very detailed controls on all sites and any significant transactions are analysed by management. In China, we have established a specific audit team of SP Moulding employees, where 2-3 people regularly audit our suppliers to ensure that our Supplier Code of Conduct and statement on anti-corruption is respected and adhered to. As part of the audit of the Group companies, the auditors have considered the risk of bribery and the measures taken by management to reduce this risk. No claims or request for monetary sanction for corruption and no legal corruption cases against any of our sites were reported in 201338. 38 GRI G3 SO-04 SP Moulding A/S April 2014 Communication on Progress – 2013 Page 19 Global Reporting Initiative (G3) Performance Indicator Index Indicator Indicator Description Page EC-01 Direct economic value 4 EN-01 Materials used by weight or volume. 16 EN-02 Percentage of materials used that are recycled input materials. 16 EN-03 Direct energy consumption by primary energy source. 14 EN-04 Indirect energy consumption by primary source. 14 EN-05 Energy saved due to conservation and efficiency improvements 14 Initiatives to reduce indirect energy consumption and reductions 14 EN-07 achieved.
