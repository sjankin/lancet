The number of sites in the former count was 17 in 2012 and 16 in 2011. R&D spending increased sharply in 2013 (up 24% in one year) and its share compared to new product and process development (42% in 2013 versus 32% in 2012) reflects the Group’s desire to distinguish itself from its competitors with innovative and high-performance technical solutions. In 2013, these R&D efforts resulted in several inventions and patent applications were filed for 61 of them, which is a new record for the Group. This was partly to compensate for a less active 2012 (18 filings) and partly due to initiatives at all levels to encourage patent filings. This outcome was undoubtedly influenced by the talks on intellectual property held in November 2012 at the annual General Managers seminar attended by the Director of INPI (French patent office) as well as awareness training on intellectual property given at many of the Group’s subsidiaries. With eight new patented inventions in 2013, the latest entities to join the Group in 2013 contributed to this result. They also helped enhance the Group’s patent portfolio (36% more patent families), bringing 76 families and 161 patents. 30 / Fives 2013 Financial Report Fives 2013 Financial Report / 31 Non-financial indicators INTRO FOR THE DATA BY SITE AND THE STATISTICS Fives’ Code of conduct is continuously improved, in order to provide the Group’s new recruits with its values and guidelines but also to keep all of its employees regularly up to date with any changes. Fives is currently developing a specific training program on its Code of conduct, to ON ENVIRONMENT/HEALTH/SAFETY/ETHICS further develop and improve the internal dialog on the Group’s common values and “dos and don’ts”. AND GOVERNANCE Training initiatives on the Code of conduct that were expected to be launched in 2013 had to be postponed. However, in 2013 there were many actions to formalize and clarify the Group’s expectations at the corporate level. Development of case studies and of a reading guide for the Code of conduct will encourage more discussion on these values. The Code of conduct will also be supplemented by a new Group Directive. At the end of 2013, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting covered 81% of the Group’s workforce and included all sites with 10 or more employees as of mid-2013 as well as all sites with an industrial activity. Companies that did not have an activity in the Fives Group for the full HEALTH & SAFETY INDICATORS year 2013 were not included in this reporting period. The companies acquired in 2013 (Mag Americas and Oto Mills) alone account for 17% of 2011 2012 2013 the Group’s workforce and so were not included in the CSR reporting scope.

The action plan Work hours allocated to health/safety/environment continues to increase significantly with the 30% increase in full-time equivalent hours.
