Recoverable value has been estimated based on the value in use method as stipulated in LKAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. On transition to SLFRS/LKAS the group re-measured the all identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination at the acquisition date at their fair value. Accordingly the brand value of Rs. 661.9 Mn has been recognised on the business combination of Kotmale Holdings PLC. The ‘Relief from Royalty Method’ has been used for brand valuation. 61 The allocation of Rs. 670 Mn to the brand name represents the part of the consideration paid to acquire brands ‘Three Coins’, ‘Irish Dark’, ‘Sando Cargills (Ceylon) PLC and ‘Grand Blonde’ etc. consequent to the closure of purchase and sale agreement entered by Millers Brewery Limited. This amount has been transfered from the advance payment account in 2010/11. The ‘Relief from Royalty Method’ has been used for brand valuation. Management is in the view that the brand name has an infinite useful life and accordingly no amortisation is done. However, in accordance with LKAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, any intangible asset which has infinite useful life is subject to annual impairment test which is to be carried out in accordance with LKAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Brand has been tested for impairment and found no impairment during the year. Amortisation of intangible assets of Rs. 9.43 Mn (2012 5.79 Mn) has been charged in cost of goods sold and Rs. 2.16 Mn (2012 3.86 Mn) in administrative expenses.
