As part of Calvert’s efforts to educate financial providers and the general public on the global water crisis, we launched the Calvert Water Investing App in November 2013. The free app is available on both Apple and Android mobile devices and includes several features: ■■ The Daily Drip—a roundup of weekly news about water-related issues of interest to investors and financial advisors. ■■ Learn—the place to get up to speed on the facts about global water challenges, environmental impacts and view a short water film. ■■ Views—expert commentary and analysis from Calvert on key water issues, including daily tweets from Calvert water analysts and profiles of water-themed companies. ■■ Invest—facts and performance updates about the Calvert Global Water Fund and the portfolio management team. Calvert updated its white paper in 2013, “Quenching the World’s Thirst for Water,” which discusses water demand and investment drivers. For example, the paper notes that water-related infrastructure alone will require the investment of $22 trillion globally over the next two decades. We also wrote about business model challenges facing water and electric utilities on our website. Both industries must tackle a potential revenue gap from the need to increase rates in order to cover infrastructure and technology modernization, while protecting the public’s ability to afford services. We also work to educate financial advisors and planners about water. Calvert participated in and helped sponsor an hour-long televised webinar in November 2013 presented by Financial Advisor Magazine to inform and engage clients on water investment. The webinar covered the investment thesis for water investment, how water investments can improve client portfolios, investor advocacy on water issues, and the value of active management. About 800 investment advisors registered for the event, with 444 viewing the live event.

We file and co-file shareholder resolutions with CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT: 2011–2013 27 RESEARCH REPORTS AND GUIDES Over the past three years, Calvert has collaborated on and/or independently produced several reports and guides, including: 2011 Transparency in California Supply Chains Guide Calvert co-authored, “Effective Supply Chain Accountability: Investor Guidance on Implementation of The California Transparency in Supply Chains Law and Beyond,” along with Christian Brothers Investments and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR). The Guide, released in November 2011, identified good corporate practices to ensure corporate compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act (SB 657), which legislates accountability for companies to curtail the practices of modern slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains, and makes the business case for compliance and shareholder expectations, along with the elements of a comprehensive human rights due diligence framework. The Guide not only helped companies comply with the Act’s requirements but also served as an advocacy tool for more effective management of labor and human rights risks within global supply chains. 2012 Physical Risks from Climate Change Along with Ceres and Oxfam America, Calvert released “Physical Risks from Climate Change: A guide for companies and investors on disclosure and management of climate impacts” in May 2012. The report featured industry-based risk disclosure recommendations, plus current best practice examples and a checklist for strategic management of physical climate risks. Water risk was also incorporated into the report, which demonstrated that large corporations are increasingly turning to renewable energy to power their operations. Companies are investing in renewable energy because it makes good business sense: renewable energy helps reduce long-term operating costs, diversify energy supply and hedge against market volatility in traditional fuel markets. It also enables companies to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals and demonstrate leadership on broader corporate sustainability and climate commitments. We distributed the report on Capitol Hill, held a briefing to educate House and Senate staff and used the report as a tool for dialogue. We also referenced the report in shareholder resolutions and as a tool to support public policy towards renewable energy. Partnership for Resilience and Environmental Preparedness In July 2012, Calvert and other leading companies from a new partnership initiative on climate change adaptation, Partnership for Resilience and Environmental Preparedness (PREP), released a first guide for businesses to assess and prepare for the risks and opportunities posed by climate change, entitled “Value Chain Climate Resilience: A guide to managing climate impacts in companies and communities”. This report was designed as a tool for corporate leaders and sustainable investors to complement an earlier disclosure guidance report. “Value Chain Climate Resilience” aims to help company executives and senior managers gain a better understanding of climate-related risks throughout their value chains, identify where emerging market opportunities exist, take into account community needs, and develop plans that are integrated throughout the enterprise with the support of communities and civil society. The guide aided financial services and insurance sectors to understand how to engage with the companies they invest in or insure to manage risk, maximize returns, and minimize future losses. Calvert has been referencing the report in our engagement and dialogues with companies, where it has been a useful tool since it has increased our understanding of and expertise on the physical impacts of companies facing climate change today. 28 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT: 2011–2013 Ceres/Environmental Defense Fund Report on SEC Oil/Gas Risk Disclosure Calvert contributed to a report by Ceres and the Environmental Defense Fund, released in August 2012, that analyzed SEC reporting disclosure of major oil and gas companies on climate risk and deepwater drilling risks, including those related to regulatory risks, spill response, drilling safety and environmental management, greenhouse gas emissions, and corporate governance of climate change. We continue to use the report as a basis for advocacy and engagement with these companies on improving climate risk and disclosure. Oil, Gas and Mining Company Public Positions on Free, Prior, and Informed Consent Calvert also contributed to Oxfam America’s report “Community Consent Index Oil, Gas and Mining Company Public Positions on Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)”, which was released in September 2012. The report is an update of a 2009 compilation of public positions of 28 oil, gas and mining companies relating to community consent and social license to operate. Calvert wrote a short statement included in the report on the materiality of the issues related to FPIC and the importance of public disclosure of the policies, programs and performance metrics that indicate its full implementation. Power Forward Report In December 2012, Calvert Investments, Ceres and World Wildlife Fund released “Power Forward: Why the World’s Largest Companies are Investing in Renewable Energy,” which found that more than half of the largest corporations in the U.S. and more than two-thirds of the largest corporations across the globe have set GHG emissions reduction commitments, renewable energy commitments, or both. In fact, clean energy practices are becoming standard procedures for some of the largest and most profitable companies. A revised Power Forward Report 2.0 was released in June 2014, which found that 43 percent of Fortune 500 companies set targets in at least one of three categories: reducing GHG emissions, improving energy efficiency, and procuring more renewable energy. 2013 Calvert’s Third Biennial Diversity Report The third biennial Diversity Report since 2008, “Examining the Cracks in the Ceiling,” evaluating the corporate diversity practices of companies in the S&P 100 was released in March 2013. The report found that large-cap companies are still failing to put substantial numbers of women and minorities in the boardrooms and executive suites. The highest-rated companies included Citigroup Inc., Merck & Co., The Coca-Cola Co., and JPMorgan Chase. The five lowest rated companies included Berkshire Hathaway, Simon Property Group, National Oilwell Varco Inc., Ebay, and Apache Corp. Calvert held a telenews event to help publicize the report, generating wide media coverage, including with Bloomberg, Forbes, and the Motley Fool. We were able to use the report to further our advocacy efforts and will continue to evaluate the corporate diversity practices of companies in the S&P 100. A new Diversity Report is scheduled for release in late 2014. Investor Guide/UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Calvert, ICCR and the Institute for Human Rights and Business launched “Investing the Rights Way: A Guide for Investors on Business and Human Rights” in March 2013 in both New York City and London. The guide outlined how investors can apply the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as a due diligence and risk assessment framework to assess companies within their portfolios. The report and launch events demonstrate Calvert’s intellectual leadership and influence among investors on both sides of the Atlantic on human rights.

Pebble Mine is a proposed copper, gold and molybdenum mine that would be situated at the headwaters of the Bristol Bay Fishery Reserve by the Pebble Partnership, made up of U.K.-based Anglo American and Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. of Canada and would impact Alaska’s Bristol Bay watershed, which produces roughly half of the world’s commercial supply of wild sockeye salmon. The EPA’s draft assessment found that an open pit mine would likely cause significant negative impacts. Calvert and Trillium sent a July 2012 letter on behalf of 30 investors with $61 billion in assets under management to the EPA commenting on the draft assessment, and circulated it to other investors for endorsement. The letter called upon the EPA to move forward with its review of mining activity in the Bristol Bay region in accordance with the Clean Water Act. As a result of such a review, the EPA may prohibit or restrict the disposal of mine waste if it determines that it will have an “unacceptable adverse effect” on water supplies, fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational areas. In September 2013, the multinational mining company, Anglo American, the primary driver of the Pebble Mine project in Bristol Bay, withdrew its support for the project leaving the much smaller Canadian mining firm Northern Dynasty as the sole owner of the stake. While the company did not state that overcoming the huge operational challenges of building and operating a mine in the pristine Bristol Bay region and the fierce opposition to mining on the part of a diverse set of stakeholders in the area were the reasons it pulled out, it was a significant announcement for those concerned about the potential impacts of mining in that part of Alaska. In light of Anglo American’s withdrawal, investors are reiterating their long-standing support for the EPA Assessment process and once again urging the agency to carefully review the potential risks of mining under the Clean Water Act. Support for EPA Rules Related to Electric Utilities two Clean Air Act rules will add nearly 1.5 million jobs, Calvert coordinated an investor letter calling on U.S. Senators or nearly 300,000 jobs per year on average over the next to uphold a recently established EPA Clean Air Act Rule.

The EPA rules were in knowing the steps the company is taking to reduce upheld and our letters were part of a broader effort to chemical use and toxicity, the ways it tracks and responds to support the Clean Air Act Rules in Congress and with the community concerns, and how it minimizes the impacts of EPA, which continues to retain the authority to regulate its water use and manages waste water. such rules. Palm Oil Sustainability Pioneer Natural Resources More and more, consumer packaged goods companies Pioneer Natural Resources is a diversified energy company are making commitments to source sustainable palm oil that employs hydraulic fracturing. Community concerns for use in their products. The industry uses palm oil and about water and air pollution and waste management could its derivatives—from the fruit of the oil palm tree—in restrict access to resources for oil and gas companies, and food, lotions, soaps, shampoo and other items. Although state regulators are watching closely and in some cases there are sustainability advantages to using oil palm trees, CAFE STANDARDS Calvert advocated during 2012 in public testimony for the newly finalized corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards, that require cars to reach 54 mpg by 2025. The White House’s announcement of finalized CAFE standards represents historic progress on vehicle efficiency that will have clear benefits to the environment, energy security, and consumers’ pocketbooks. The new efficiency standards for cars and light-duty vehicles are estimated to reduce oil consumption by 12 billion barrels and represent about $1.7 trillion in consumer savings. The new standards are supported by the major automakers, which have already begun to shift their vehicle strategies to provide the American consumer with more innovative, fuel-efficient, and cleaner cars and trucks. Calvert has been a long-time supporter of increased fuel economy standards, which until 2010 had remained unchanged for decades. Calvert has been a leading investor voice calling for increased standards that we believe will continue to help make American automakers more competitive, while representing a major step in U.S. policy efforts to mitigate climate change. Calvert made the case in public testimony to the EPA (most recently in support of California’s Advanced Clean Cars Program), in meetings with Obama Administration officials, in dialogue with the auto industry, and through the media. We will continue to support greater vehicle efficiency, in addition to the move towards lower-carbon fuels and other environmental objectives, in our on going engagements with leading automakers and in public policy settings. 34 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT: 2011–2013 which produce a great deal of oil with less land, water, and Montreal Carbon Pledge pesticides than many other crops, there are also significant (Although beyond the strict scope of the 2011–2013 report,) problems with the way oil palm trees are typically grown Calvert became the first U.S.-based manager in September in some countries.
