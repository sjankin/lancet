In 2013 we commemorated this special anniversary with a number of activities with our clients and staff. On April 9, 2013, our 22,000 employees officially kicked off our 125th anniversary festivities across the globe with Meet Up & Celebrate sessions. At about the same time, books entitled ‘ARCADIS, A Collective History’ were sent to offices worldwide. These books proudly document the rich history of the companies that have joined ARCADIS and the legacy we have created through the projects we have completed for our clients. Quality of life Embedded in our collective history is the firm belief that we use our capabilities to improve the world in which we all live, work and play, while maintaining a balance with environmental needs. We improve the quality of life. We celebrated our anniversary in the Netherlands with Koninklijke Nederlandse Heidemaatschappij (KNHM), which was the foundation of our firm’s conception in 1888. Nowadays, KNHM actively supports communities who want to improve their physical living environment. Creating tomorrow Our joint anniversary program, called Creating Tomorrow, comprised a number of exciting activities that aimed to create a discussion platform for clients, business connections, the experts of today and the talents of tomorrow. Creating Tomorrow was a multimedia program comprising an internet platform with blogs, news, posters, competitions and twitter conversations, as well as several ‘What’s Next’ client events organized in the Netherlands covering important topics as Healthy Planet, Urban Deltas and Connections. For each ‘What’s Next’ session, several clients were asked to provide a real life challenge they are facing. Preselected groups of promising students then had 48 hours to devise the best solution. The overall winner, team Traffic Jam, won the competition’s first prize of e10,000. Giving back to society Meanwhile, colleagues from around the globe were encouraged to work together to mark our anniversary and make a joint contribution to society. In approximately 125 days, they collectively covered over a million kilometers for charity! Employees were given the opportunity to raise as much money as they could for their local charity-of-choice and add to a global tally of kilometers. When the one-million kilometer mark was reached, ARCADIS donated the appropriate sum of €125,000 across three charities: Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature and Transparency International.

Federal market conditions deteriorated, causing an influx of competition into the private sector. Nevertheless, we won some of the small number of Federal projects that came to market, including the Operating EBITA-margin remediation of Tyndall Air Force Base, a US$32 million 7-year remediation North America project in Florida.

Meanwhile our growing ‘Water for Industry’ 11 12.0 program benefits from already strong relationships with private sector clients in broad range of sectors. In water management, the aftermath of hurricane Sandy generated growth, especially around New York City. Buildings market slow but improving; Infrastructure sees growth The introduction of the Affordable Care Act created a lot of uncertainty and low investment levels in healthcare. Demand for government building projects was also sluggish, affecting Federal work and local education investments. Commercial real estate, housing and workplace work is beginning to rise, with Built Asset Consultancy offering growth opportunities. For the first time in a number of years, growth returned to our infrastructure business, resulting from the success of our Intelligent Traffic Management solutions, and growth in municipal projects, including program management of a major metro project in Los Angeles. Margins recovered to same high level as last year The operating EBITA margin for North America was 11.5%, a decline compared to last year, due to a temporary slump in the second quarter caused by higher than expected legal costs and salary increases, which were required to retain staff. Margin improved to 12% in the second half of the year, similar to 2012. Restructuring charges amounted to €2.7 million (2012: €2.3 million) and were related to organizational adjustments due to reduced demand in environment and water earlier in the year.

Public sector work grew due to the World Cup and Olympic Games with projects including Guarulhos Airport in Sao Paulo and the Olympic Village and sporting venues in Rio. Water activities grew through the acquisition of ETEP, with synergies leading to several sizable new project wins to start during early 2014. The energy market grows as evidenced by the 583MW thermal power plant project in Manaus for Amazonas Distribuidora de Energia where we are performing owner’s engineering services, while environmental activities grew due to private sector demand. In Chile and Peru, we lowered our capacity in reaction to more difficult market conditions. Major programs drive Middle East growth In the Middle East, Buildings is our largest activity, with projects of considerable size such as the Kingdom Tower project, where we are program managers for the world’s tallest building. Meanwhile investments in both social infrastructure (healthcare, education, tourism, sports facilities, parks, commerce, retail) and core infrastructure (ports, airports, rail, bridges, tunnels) continue to provide opportunities and drive growth.

Water management provides opportunity, infrastructure still difficult In 2013, Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic saw some of the most severe flooding in years during summer rain storms, leading to public and private sector opportunities. In Ozarow, Poland, ARCADIS is performing flood risk assessment for logistics centers. In Dresden the new wastewater system designed by ARCADIS worked well and the 2013 floods have not affected the city. Infrastructure markets remained depressed as public funding levels were low. Margin improvement ahead of plan The operating margin in Europe improved to 5.3% (2012: 5.0%), and was ahead of plan as cost actions were accelerated. As the performance improvement actions initiated in the first half of 2013 kicked in, operating margins substantially improved over the second half of the year to 7.5%. With the progress made to date, we are on target to achieve the goal of reaching a 10% operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2014. Total restructuring and integration charges amounted to €14.4 million in 2013. Building on the progress to date we increased the annual savings target for ONEurope from €25 million to €32 million.

Besides this change, the recognition and measurement of defined benefit pension expenses and their presentation in the statement of income were amended. Changes in defined benefit obligations and plan assets have been split into three components: service costs, net interest on the net defined benefit liability/ (asset) and remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability/ (asset). Furthermore, the interest cost and expected return on plan assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 have been replaced with a ‘net-interest’ amount, which is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined liability or asset. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the (estimated) interest income are recognized as part of the remeasurements in other comprehensive income. Additional disclosure requirements have been added for risks and plan objectives.

Litigation ARCADIS has global professional liability insurance coverage and in addition, local insurances in a number of countries. In general, these insurance policies have a self-insured retention and a maximum pay-out level. Clients sometimes claim, justified or not, that they are not satisfied with the services provided by ARCADIS. Estimates by management and (external) advisors lead to an indication of the potential financial risk and whether or not that risk is covered by the insurance policies. This, in turn, determines the amount ARCADIS provides for. Other provisions The other provisions is for expected contract losses and warranties. In some cases, ARCADIS may extend warranties after the completion of activities. In such cases, a provision is recognized, based on estimated cash out flows. Because settlement in these cases generally takes place within a short time frame and because the amounts are relatively limited, no discounting takes place.

Financial expenses in 2013 decreased compared to 2012 reflecting cash generated during the year and the successful efforts made to centralize more cash in the organization to repay external debt. To a lesser extent, increased cash balances in Brazil helped increase interest income during the year, while an interest rate swap matured during the year, allowing ARCADIS to profit from lower floating interest rates. Due to a weak US dollar, reported interest costs of financing our US dollar debts also helped lower interest expense. Interest expense in 2013 amounted to €17.0 million (2012: €20.5 million).

All financial instruments carried at fair value within the Company are categorized in level 2. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the term and maturity of the contract, using market interest rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps is consistent with bank valuations. These valuations are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at measurement date. For loans and receivables fair value is determined for disclosure purposes based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the Company specific market rate of interest at reporting date. For financial leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at reporting date. Due to the short-term character of the receivables, the fair value equals the carrying value. 31 Subsequent events There were no material events after December 31, 2013, that would have changed the judgment and analysis by management of the financial condition of the Company at December 31, 2013, or the profit for the period of the year 2013.
