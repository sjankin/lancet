GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS When assessing the impairment requirement for goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful period, the carrying amount must be compared with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the highest of an asset's net selling price and the value in use. Since there are normally no listed prices that may be used to assess the net selling price of an asset, the value in use will normally be the value that is used to compare with the carrying amount. Calculation of the value in use is based on assumptions and assessments. Key assumptions are the future trends for 48 Mekonomen Group Annual Report 2013 Notes NOTE 5 Average number of employees, salaries, other remuneration and social security contributions 2013 2012 Number of emAverage number of employees No. of employees of which men, % ployees of which men, % PARENT COMPANY Sweden 16 50 68 76 TOTAL IN PARENT COMPANY 16 50 68 76 SUBSIDIARIES Sweden 1 326 82 1 219 83 Denmark 397 87 404 84 Norway 775 82 690 82 Finland 21 81 24 83 TOTAL IN SUBSIDIARIES 2 519 84 2 337 82 GROUP TOTAL 2 535 83 2 405 82 Soc. security Soc. security expenses expenses Salaries and other (of which pension Salaries and other (of which pension SALARIES, REMUNERATION, ETC.

Mekonomen Group Annual Report 2013 65 Notes NOTE 33 (cont.) Interest rate risks Interest rate risks refer to the risk that changes in market interest rates will have a negative impact on the Group's net interest income/expense. The speed at which interest rate changes affect the net interest income/ expense depends on the period of fixed interest for the loan. During the 2013 financial year, interest-bearing liabilities fell compared with the 2012 financial year. This reduction is attributable to amortisations. According to the financial policy, the period of fixed interest must normally be 12 months, with an exception mandate of +6/-9 months. As at 31 December 2013, Mekonomen's net debt is SEK 1 657 (1 875) m. A period of fixed interest is available with a term of more than one year. See also the table in the Sensitivity analysis section on page 22. Financing and liquidity risks Financing risk is seen as the risk of the cost being higher and financing opportunities limited when loans are renewed and that the ability to pay cannot be met as a result of insufficient liquidity or difficulties in securing financing. According to the finance policy, refinancing risks shall be managed by signing long-term and flexible credit agreements. As of 31 December 2013, the Group's total loan financing amounted to SEK 1 921 (2 091) m, of which the long-term portion is SEK 1 658 (1 802) m.

Total amortisation of the loans is SEK 136 m per year. In addition to this, the Group has overdraft facilities totalling SEK 387 m. The Group's cash and cash equivalents are invested short term and any excess liquidity shall primarily be used for amortising loans. Investments may be made in SEK, NOK and DKK in accordance with the finance policy. Investments may occur at or in securities issued by the Swedish Government or Swedish and foreign banks with not less than an A rating, according to the definition of Standard & Poor's (S&P).
