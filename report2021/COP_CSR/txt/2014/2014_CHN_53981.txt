We expanded into many new markets both with the introduction of new products and the addition of new and expanded global manufacturing and development facilities. We achieved all-time record highs for Lenovo revenues, profitability and full-year worldwide market share. While the industry and Lenovo itself are transforming in many ways for the PC Plus era, we are steadfast that some things will not change: our dedication to building sustainable products, operating a sustainable business, and delivering on our commitments to our investors, employees, customers, local communities, the environment, and future generations. We have been preparing for the PC Plus era for years, and are confident that we will lead the way setting the standard for sustainability performance as well. This report outlines Lenovo’s current sustainability-related investments, accomplishments, challenges and shortand long-term targets.

At Lenovo, sustainability means integrating social and environmental values with the traditional economic measures of success in our development and delivery of superior products and services. As our company transforms for the PC Plus era by entering new markets and introducing a range of new products, our sustainability challenges will become inevitably more complex. But we have been preparing for these challenges for years and are well positioned to lead the way in this new era of corporate sustainability. As Lenovo’s Chief Sustainability Executive, I’m proud of the work we’ve done over the past year. We’ve had great success in providing our customers with high-integrity products and services while treating our people with respect, contributing to our local communities, protecting the environment, and growing and managing our business efficiently and profitably. In the last year, we’ve achieved some significant milestones, one of which included publishing our first Corporate Sustainability Policy that formalized our commitment to operating ethically and promoting corporate citizenship and sustainability in all our business activities. Our Chairman and CEO, Yang Yuanqing, signed the Policy, which formalizes our environmental, social and governance values. The Policy clearly states that each business unit at Lenovo is expected to incorporate measurable sustainability objectives in their strategies and to continually improve their performance in this area. In FY12/13, we reduced our Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 13 percent relative to our FY09/10 baseline through a combination of installing a solar energy system in Shanghai, implementing energy efficiency projects at numerous sites, and purchasing renewable energy credits. We recognize that the impact of our business extends well beyond our gates and includes our global supply chain, a key focus in our sustainability programs. In this new era of corporate sustainability, compliance and risk management are critical to ensuring Lenovo’s access to and success in new markets. 2012/2013 Lenovo Sustainability Report 8 Executive Letters Integrating Sustainability PERFORMANCE PEOPLE PLANET APPENDIX We maintain a large percentage of manufacturing in-house, allowing for unique opportunities to demonstrate leadership both in how we treat our employees and how we build and manage our facilities. We also have strong relationships with our suppliers in China, giving us the opportunity to partner with them to ensure they are meeting global standards. This type of partnership makes our relationships stronger and improves our own performance worldwide. As we continue to transform and retain our PC market share lead, and become a global PC Plus innovation leader, there is still much more to be done. While we’ve met the majority of our sustainability goals this year, we understand that our growing and evolving business will bring new sustainability challenges in the year ahead. We’re up for the challenge and we’ll continue to work with our stakeholders to ensure we are leading the way in best-in-class sustainability practices, just as we are doing in the PC Plus industry.

From May 2005 to year-end 2009, Lenovo suppliers used over 1.5 Products Program million net pounds of PIC recycled plastics in the manufacture of Lenovo products, resulting in a number of environmental benefits. Based on this success, Lenovo and selected PIC recycled plastic suppliers began to develop and qualify new grades of recycled plastics with post-consumer content (PCC) Lenovo’s commitment to protecting the environment came prior to its plastics in 2007. Lenovo continued to use PIC recycled plastics until the end establishment as a global company with the acquisition of the IBM PC Division of 2011, but their use in Lenovo products rapidly declined as qualified PCC in 2005. Lenovo had already developed technical specifications for PCs that recycled plastics became available and Lenovo’s product development teams included environmental attributes such as energy efficiency. In addition, all began to use these environmentally preferred materials to satisfy corporate commercial products were designed to meet China’s energy-saving targets. environmental objectives and targets, meet new customer requirements, and With the globalization of Lenovo’s reach, the company took environmental achieve EPEAT™ Gold registrations for our products. sustainability a step further in 2005 by adopting a comprehensive Using these engineered plastics not only saves the natural resources and Environmentally Conscious Products Program aimed toward leadership energy that would have gone into manufacturing new plastics, but also diverts in the global PC business.

Additionally, PCC material use has Laying the Groundwork with Post-industrial Recycled Content been implemented and/or planned in a number of select ThinkPad and IdeaPad notebook computers at levels of one to eight percent where technically feasible. After Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s PC Division in May of 2005, our initial use of recycled content plastics was achieved with post-industrial content (PIC) plastics in the molding of ThinkPad bottom covers and ThinkCentre and Workstation bezels. In some cases, these materials were also used to manufacture select internal parts (e.g., card stiffeners). This success was critical in gaining the confidence of Lenovo product development teams and suppliers in using engineered recycled content plastics and overcoming the misconception that these materials were inferior. The key to Lenovo’s success in this area was in selecting quality PIC sources and working with the plastics manufacturers and compounders to engineer PIC recycled plastics with equivalent properties and performance to that of the prime material targeted ThinkVision® LT1953 ThinkPad® Edge E535 ThinkStation® C30 ThinkCentre ® M78 SFF for replacement.
