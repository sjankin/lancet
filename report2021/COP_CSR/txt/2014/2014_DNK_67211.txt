The report is a key communication tool, part of our commitment to openness and accountability. The report is thus intended to serve as our Communication on Progress (COP) report to UN Global Compact and ensures compliance with section 99a of the Danish Financial Statements Act regarding corporate responsibility reporting. DLH’s Annual Report and CSR Report complement one another, as the former provides an insight into the group’s financial statements while the CSR report provides an overview of non-financial statements material to our business.

We see the integration of our CSR policies into our daily businesses as an on-going process. In 2010, we aligned our CSR strategy with the principles of UN Global Compact and further developed our CSR policies. In 2012, we lauched a new and innovative Good Supplier Programme, which is the group’s supplier risk-assessment tool. As we strengthen our CSR work, our reporting will benefit from improved progress measuring and performance communication. Reporting Scope and Boundary Unless otherwise noted for specific data, the report addresses all DLH’s sales, The report also addresses our relations with suppliers with regards to the implementation of The Good Supplier Programme. The CSR Report 2013 has the same content structure and design of the previous years’ reports. Stakeholders will therefore be able to follow progress easily. 6 Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 STRATEGY & ENGAGEMENTS Corporate Social and Environmental Our business relies upon wood Responsibility at DLH We operate globally and source wood from tropical, temperate and boreal forests, whose preservation is At DLH, we have long-term standards.

Our CSR Strategy Our CSR strategy rests on three pillars: the Environmental Policy, the Social and Human Rights Policy and the Business Integrity Policy. These policies are framed within the principles of UN Global Compact. The backbone of DLH’s Environmental Policy and Social and Human Rights Policy is the Good Supplier Programme (GSP), which is a tool used to collect and evaluate information on how suppliers produce, process and trade timber. Responsibility forms the roof of our global and multicultural company. Therefore it is the group’s CSR Governance 2013 ambition not only to strengthen its position as a Having launched the new GSP supplier due diligence global leading wholesaler of timber and timber programme in 2012, we dedicated this year to full products, but also to be a leader in the wholesale of implementation in all business units as well as timber and timber products manufactured in system improvement.

Deforestation is thus one of the major contributors to climate change accounting for 18% of global carbon emissions. Illegal and destructive logging activities also threaten the conservation of forests. But forestry activities, if conducted in accordance with local laws and international environmental standards, do not contribute to deforestation. Well-managed forests are forests that can continue to perform the numerous valuable services they provide to the global community: climate regulation, natural carbon sinks, biodiversity protection and contribution to the livelihood of 1.6 billion people. Therefore, ensuring that the timber we source has been legally harvested constitute one of the major challenges of our business. Our overriding goal is to contribute to the conservation of the world’s forest and battle against climate change by promoting legality and sustainable forest management. We explain how in the following paragraphs. 10 Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 Our Suppliers Quick Facts about DLH’s Environmental Policy on Suppliers  All our suppliers must commit to and comply with DLH’s environment policy.  In countries where there is a potential risk of non-compliance with this policy, we implement the Good Supplier Programme (GSP, which is the group’s risk-assessment tool. Participation in GSP is a pre-requisite for becoming a DLH Supplier.  In some supply countries, as a result of a country risk assessment, we have taken extra measures to avoid unacceptable wood. In other cases, we have stopped sourcing completely. The current list of countries with special sourcing guidelines includes Brazil, Burma, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa), Liberia, Malaysia (Sarawak), Nigeria, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Sierra Leone.  We will work with our suppliers on knowledge sharing and capacity building. We will use our position as one of the market leaders in certified tropical hardwoods in order to support them in achieving VLO and FSC certification.  DLH will investigate the origin of all timber originating in risk countries. Origin is defined by DLH as the forest in which the timber has been harvested. DLH’s Environmental Policy can be found in the CSR Section on our website or downloaded from here.  The Good Supplier Programme The Good Supplier Programme –also known as GSPis a tool used to collect and evaluate information on the origin, legality, verification and certification of the timber and timber products we source. GSP is an important tool in complying with EU Timber Regulation and the US Lacey Act. All suppliers to DLH must complete the GSP assessment. GSP version 2013 GSP is targeted at all suppliers, but the level of due Business can only proceed with suppliers rated as diligence conducted depends on the supplier risk “Silver”, “Gold” and “Platinum”, which are profile. Based on the country of origin and product considered to be compliant with the international type, our suppliers are divided into two categories, regulations EUTR and US Lacey Act and with DLH namely high risk and low risk. The formers are CSR Policies. Besides undergoing DLH’s own due suppliers from countries with a CPI score diligence, “Gold” and “Platinum” suppliers are (Corruption Perception Index Score) of less than 7 audited by independent certification bodies and, as while the latters are those from countries with a CPI such, are given a higher rate. Gold suppliers provide score of 7 or more. only third-party legally verified timber (e.g. OLB; SW-VLC), while Platinum suppliers provide only CPI scores provide an objective measure of the sustainably certified timber (e.g. FSC-PEFC).

High risk suppliers are required to answer a thorough self-assessment questionnaire and must also provide detailed legality documentation; while Exercising Due Diligence low-risk suppliers are required to disclose less In 2013, all our timber purchases from risk information about their supply chain and production countries underwent GSP due diligence. We had process.

This low percentage is explained by the supplier pre-selection that our Sourcing and Sales staff In three cases, it was necessary to conduct on-site make prior to entering suppliers into our formal due visits of suppliers to further check compliance with diligence system. Our staff is informed our corporate policies and international regulations. 12 Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 Our Products Quick Facts about DLH’s Environmental Policy on Product  DLH strives to purchase as much certified timber as possible and we want to continue to be the leading supplier of certified tropical hardwood in the future.  Our long term target is to only source sustainable timber. The success of this target is dependent on many factors, few of which we have any influence on. We therefore cannot set a fixed deadline for when we will reach this target.  Promote greater uptake of certified products. Over the last decade, DLH’s ambition has been to be a leading supplier of tropical hardwoods originating in well managed forests. Since 2000, DLH has been Chain of Custody certified and has, therefore, been permitted to trade in certified timber. Since 2008, DLH has also been Generic Chain of Custody certified and has, therefore, also been able to trade in timber with third-party verification of legal origin and legal compliance claims. Purchases of verified and certified timber In 2013, 24% of all procured timber (volume) was third-party verified or certified. Approximately 22% was covered by the certification scheme FSC, and 2% by PEFC. Other legality verification systems such as OLB, TLTV, MTCS, VLO and FSC CW account for very small volumes. The volume of third-party verified or certified timber procured decline approximated 2% in relation to 2012 mainly due to the discontinuation of business in Europe. 13 Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 Our Climate As part of the group’s continuous commitment to openness and transparency, DLH reports on carbon and forest footprints in 2013. Our Forest Footprint Our Transport Carbon Footprint As part of DLH’s commitment to openness and Since 2011, DLH reports only on emissions transparency, we report annually to Carbon resulting from the international transport of Disclosure Project’s Forest Program, formerly timber, since this is the largest single contributor known as Forest Footprint Disclosure. to the company’s carbon footprint, accounting for more than 90% of total emissions.

Approximately 50% of our sourcing activities are conducted in countries considered of risk. Therefore it is our responsibility to ensure that we do not directly or indirectly benefit from, contribute to, endorse, or in any way facilitate violations. DLH recognises the importance of the UN Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights, developed by the UN Special Representative John Ruggie. The Guiding Principles have become a global reference framework for the management of business and human rights challenges. As stated by John Ruggie, the “appropriate response by an enterprise to the risk of contributing to human rights abuse through its supply chain is for it to conduct due diligence on its supply chain relationships to identify risks of actual and potential adverse impacts, and to prevent or mitigate both risks and impacts where they arise”1. DLH aims at being able to conduct more systematic human rights due diligence with the aid of GSP v. 2013, which is the group’s supplier risk assessment tool. 1 Ruggie, John. 2010.

We will work actively to ensure a work environment that is culturally respectful. DLH shall not engage in, or benefit from the use of child labour and DLH prohibits any kind of forced labour.  When investing or sourcing in areas with existing or occurring conflicts, we will remain alert to possible violations of human rights and conduct risk assessments to ensure that we do not directly or indirectly benefit from, contribute to, endorse or in any way facilitate such violations.  We expect our suppliers to work actively to ensure fair, good and safe working conditions for their employees and to respect basic human rights in accordance with our Social and human rights policy.

Corrupt practices have also negative effects on business, as they undermine the rule of law by distorting competition and creating unfair business environments. Advancing anti-corruption policies can be challenging for global companies due to cultural differences. Nonetheless the abuse of entrusted power for private gain is unacceptable in all cultures and societies. In view of this, DLH is committed to work for the advancement of ethical practices and against corrupt practices. We will do so by building awareness through the implementation of our Business Integrity Policy. 19 Corporate Social Responsibility 2013 Our Policy Management.
