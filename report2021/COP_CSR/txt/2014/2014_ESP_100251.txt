This document shows our commitment to the company’s economic, social and environmental growth and sustainability, and reaffirms our desire to be transparent with our stakeholders. The 2013 Sustainability Report retains the goal of presenting our most important business operations, giving our employees, clients, partners and suppliers the confidence they need as we share future challenges. In this year of 2013, NEINVER remained committed to growth, overcoming the challenges of a crisis that we are starting to leave behind and a restructuring process that has proven beneficial for the entire group. Today NEINVER has a more solid, agile, flexible place in the market and can compete internationally as one of the sector’s most important players. In 2009 we began the process of rebranding all our outlet centres as The Style Outlets. This year we completed that process in Spain. The Style Outlets meets our customers’ new needs and expectations, turning their visits into a true quality shopping experience while maximising value for investors and store operators. We successfully expanded our presence in Spain by obtaining the building permit for Viladecans The Style Outlets. This new centre located 10 minutes from the city centre of Barcelona, aims to provide an exceptional shopping experience to a new local and international public. We became the first shopping centre management company to earn triple certification in quality management, as all The Style Outlets centres in Spain were certified internationally under both ISO 9001 for Quality Management Systems and ISO 14001 for Environmental Management, as well as OHSAS 18001 certification for Occupational Health and Safety. All our outlet centres in Europe that are more than 2 years old earned BREEAM IN-USE certification, which assesses factors such as the buildings’ reduced environmental impact, their use of natural light and their energy efficiency and decreased water consumption. With thanks to the NEINVER team for their efforts in attaining these results, I invite you to read the 2013 Sustainability Report, covering the key critical aspects of our businesses, and renewing our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact and its globally recognised principles. We became the first shopping centre management Madrid, December 2013 José María Losantos y del Campo company to earn triple certification in quality Chairman management, as all The Style Outlets centres in Spain 6 7 Foreword by the Corporate Communication & CSR Director In our ongoing commitment to corporate responsibility, NEINVER publishes a Sustainability Report each year. Its purpose is to convey a true, balanced picture of the group’s sustainability performance, bearing in mind the socio-economic situation and the climate in this industry. Since 2007, NEINVER has documented its CSR activities in a Sustainability Report. What began as a biennial project is now an annual exercise in transparent reporting. With this 2013 Report, we wish to take a step forward in the information’s materiality and clarity. This tool lets our different stakeholders access concrete, relevant data about the company’s activity and its impact on society. In the interests of transparency, we have sought to document our activities and the company’s milestones in areas such as finance, operations, and social and environmental activities, in a way that allows comparisons with the data from the last three years. Each year numerous professionals from different parts of the company work together to write and edit the Sustainability Report, coordinated by the Corporate Social Responsibility department. For the second year in a row, the company has developed it in exhaustive compliance with the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines (GRI-G3), including detailed information about the company’s nature and strategy, the management team’s vision, and performance indicators of various kinds: economic, social, environmental, workplace, our product and human rights. We at NEINVER declare our commitment to reducing environmental impact and improving the socioeconomic quality of the areas where we do business. We therefore have a Corporate Social Responsibility programme, consistent with the company’s strategic vision of creating a better future every day.

NEWS COMMUNICATION STRATEGY 42 43 02 / Financial performance The NEINVER group’s EBITDA rose from €10.2 million in 2011 to €18.9 million in 2013, reflecting the strength of the business as well as NEINVER’s ability to manage it. This provides a solid foundation to ensure future investment in new properties. Management model After several years in which Spain’s property sector was hard hit by the crisis, the main business indicators seem to show that the situation is changing and we are on the road to economic recovery. Like many of its competitors, from 2011-2013 NEINVER had to perform adjustments to record unrealised losses of more than €250 million from assets and land. Fortunately, its previous financial situation was solid enough to absorb those losses. That process also brought an increase in the group’s recurring income, reducing its exposure and dependence on property transactions. It can therefore reaffirm its commitment to the outlet sector, which has proven totally resistant to economic cycles (and whose main operating indicators have occasionally topped 10%). The group is also committed to seeking operational efficiency to help generate in-house savings. The process also brought support from financial institutions in adapting the group’s bank debts to the new economic situation. “In this period, the support NEINVER received from its stakeholders has been very important. This includes support from shareholders and workers as well as creditors, who have shared the roadmap proposed by NEINVER as the only way to ensure the company’s survival in times of crisis and prepare it for future growth.” Carlos González Chief Financial Officer Galeria Katowicka 44 45 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

Fund management Sale of assets In 2013, the NEINVER group maintained its strategy of disinvestment and reduction of bank debt. This occurred primarily in land-related bank debt, in other words debt from non-incomegenerating assets that were draining funds from the other assets and activities. In its ongoing policy of selling properties deemed non-strategic to the group because they are not associated with the outlet sector, the group sold the following: • 2 industrial facilities in Barcelona and Getafe with an area of around 14,000 sq. m. and a sale price of €4 million. • 1 retail asset in Madrid with a surface of more than 1,100 sq. m. and a sale price of €30 million. • 2 plots of land: one in Poland and one in Palma, Majorca, with a total of 286,495 sq. m. and a sale price of €170 million. These transactions produced a profit of €3.4 million, mostly slated for reducing the group’s financial debt, and partly to finance and launch new properties.

For this reason, no provision is listed for this item. 21 The data is not available to break these figures down by type of waste. 3 NEINVER has no social-benefit obligations to cover. The only exception is a retirement savings plan in Germany, in which employees make voluntary direct contributions, which vary over time, to external plans. 22 The company’s activities have produced no accidental spillage. 4 NEINVER does not employ people under the age of 18 in any of the workplaces it manages because of the nature of the industry we 23 NEINVER’s activities do not involve dumping of any kind. operate in. This policy applies even if a country’s labour laws specifically allow such employment. 24 There have been no fines or sanctions. 5 This like-for-like analysis was calculated by reducing the 2013 total by the amount consumed by FACTORY Annopol and the January to March consumption by Roppenheim The Style Outlets. 25 All NEINVER group personnel are paid an initial salary above the minimum wage stipulated by local law. 6 For the sake of a like-for-like comparative analysis using the same number of centres, it is estimated that the Alegra centre’s waste 26 Part-time employees have the same benefits as full-time staff. Temporary and permanent employees are not eligible for these benefits production in 2012 (for which no data is available) was the same as in 2013.

The 2012 figures included here are the amended, corrected numbers. 33 NEINVER follows a responsible marketing and communication policy, respecting each region’s and country’s cultural norms.

NEINVER can state that none of its activities in Krakow has had any impact at all on this protected natural area.

Given the special nature of such situations, NEINVER does not presently have a strategy or action plan to manage its impact on biodiversity. 16 Currently there is a link to economic performance but not to social and environmental performance. 17 There is no formal process to evaluate how the Board of Directors manages economic, environmental and social issues. There is no intermediary body between the Board and the General Meeting of Shareholders that could effectively perform that evaluation, so management is evaluated by the shareholders. 122 123
