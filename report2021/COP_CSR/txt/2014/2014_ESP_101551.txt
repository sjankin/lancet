This energy is transported either in its original form, from the well or field, through gas pipelines or, in the case of long distances, in liquid form (LNG, Liquefied Natural Gas), through methane tank ships or trucks at a very low temperature, to later return the same to its original form at the regasification plants. After its extraction from the gas wells, or treatment at the regasification plants, the gas can be stored underground or enter directly into the transmission network formed by high pressure (over 4 bar) gas pipelines, which lead to industries or distribution pipelines of lower pressure (lower 4 bar) to provide service to households and businesses.

This means that the Company only requires a not connected to the distribution network placed in a limited investment to maintain its asset base, while allowing street already provided with a gas main. This requires the same to offer magnificent safety ratios. a service pipe connecting the building and further individual installations to reach each customer. The transmission gas pipelines are built with steel pipes, a suitable material for this type of infrastructures, capable of Network Extension. New connection points in operating at high pressure. All pipes have an exterior coating neighbourhoods where no distribution network exists. to prevent corrosion, reducing the need for their replacement Further infrastructure is required to supply these points, in the short term. such as gas mains, service pipes to connect the builds and individual installations to meet each consumer.

In recent years, the natural gas industry in Spain has undergone relevant changes regarding its structure and operation, caused to a great extent by the adjustment of its regulatory framework to the principles set out in the European Directives concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas – Directive 1998/30/ EC, Directive 2003/55/EC and the latest Directive 2009/73/ EC – and its implementing Regulations. The changes have intensified with the progressive incorporation of the new provisions provided for in the latest EU legislative package concerning energy matters. The ultimate goal sought by the European Regulation is to create the framework required for the operation of an internal gas market in 2014, erected on the basis of effective competition among agents, safety of supply, and the tolls approved by the Government for the whole set of transparency. infrastructures within the Spanish territory. At national level such principles have been implemented In August 2001, Royal Decree 949/2001 was published, and incorporated into different legislative developments, which implements the process for third-party access to resulting in a deep evolution of the gas business. the facilities, and which: Act 34/1998, of 7 October, on the Hydrocarbon provides a remuneration system for regulated activities, Sector involved a fundamental modification of the gas market model in Spain, developing the framework sets the tariffs structure for the sale of natural gas and the necessary to promote competition among agents, and tolls to access gas facilities, and the separation of the different activities that make up the business. The current regulatory framework promotes establishes the settlement system for regulated activities the separation of the different non-regulated activities carried out by subjects who operate in the system. from regulated ones, for the purpose of guaranteeing efficiency and competition among the different market In December 2002, Royal Decree 1434/2002 was players. published which regulates transmission, distribution, commercialization and supply activities, as well as Third-party access to the Basic Network facilities and to authorization procedures for natural gas facilities. the natural gas transmission and distribution facilities is guaranteed by the legislation, for reasons of efficiency of This Royal Decree provides, among other matters, the the whole system, given that it is a natural monopoly. The rules to change from the regulated to the non-regulated consideration for the use of such facilities is determined by market and to change supplier, in order to address the 43 2013 AnNUAL report new situations that were taking place in the gas market, the Independence of the System Technical Manager given that, since 1 January 2003, all consumers is strengthened, requiring the legal and functional were entitled to choose the supplier. Additionally, separation of the latter, and the Office for Changes of it introduced a series of measures for the purpose of Supplier is set up, for the purpose of ensuring that the avoiding the underuse of the capacity contracted by right to change supplier is exercised under principles of the different agents. Since the year 2002, transmission objectivity, transparency and non-discrimination. infrastructures planning documents have been prepared and updated, with a 10-year horizon, regarding the needs In the year 2008, Royal Decree 326/2008, of 29 February for gas infrastructures in the national territory. was approved, which establishes the remuneration of the natural gas transmission activity for facilities In 2005, Order ITC/3126/2005 was passed, whereby commissioned after 1 January 2008. the Rules for the Technical Management of the Gas System (Normas de Gestión Técnica del Sistema In 2012, Royal Decree-law 13/2012 was approved, which Gasista -NGTS-) were approved, for the purpose of transposes the Directives concerning the internal market in setting the procedures and mechanisms for the technical electricity and gas, advancing with regard to the separation management of the system, coordinating the activity of functions among the agents, in particular, the network of all subjects or players who intervene in the system manager. Among the modifications made is the requirement to guarantee the correct technical operation of the gas for effective separation of the transmission, supply and/or system, and the continuity, quality and safety of the production activity from the transmission activity. natural gas supply, observing, in any case, the principles of objectivity, transparency and non-discrimination. Lastly, it must be indicated that the remuneration for regulated activities every year, the tolls that will apply Very relevant is the publication of Act 12/2007, of 2 July, to such period, and which allow for the system to be which modifies Act 34/1998 on the Hydrocarbon Sector, economically sustainable, as well as certain regulatory for the purpose of adapting the same to the provisions developments, are established via ministerial orders of Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and that are published at the end of each year. The tolls and Council, of 26 June 2003, concerning common rules for remuneration set forth therein apply during the following the internal market in natural gas. year. The last of such orders was IET/2446/2013. This Act further distinguishes, from a legal and operational This documentation, as well as the rest of related rules, standpoint, the so-called network activities from the can be found in different legal data bases, as well as in production and supply activities, eliminating potential the websites of the Spanish Commission for Markets and competition among distributors and marketers in the Competition (CNMC), the Ministry of Industry, Energy and supply sector, and creating a last resort tariff1.
