Framing the next conversation Report on sustainability Summary report 2014 About the 2014 Report on sustainability our 2014 report includes consolidated social, economic and environmental data. For more information, refer to the Performance Data section in the online version of our report. Economic data is consistent with that reported in our 2013 Annual report unless otherwise noted. This report on sustainability was created using the Global reporting Initiative (GrI) G3.1 Guidelines and oil and Gas Sector Supplement (o&GSS) to the GrI checked A+ application level. GrI’s Application Level check Statement, along with our boundary conditions, can be found online at sustainability.suncor.com in the Performance Data section. Selected performance indicators for the year 2013 were independently reviewed using the GrI G3.1 Guidelines and o&GSS. The results of this review can be found on the online version of our report within the Third Party Assurance section. Stakeholder feedback is an integral part of developing this report. We enlisted the guidance of ceres, a network of investors, labour representatives, environmentalists and other public interest groups, to help ensure our report is relevant and meaningful. We thank ceres and the participating stakeholders for their assistance in creating the 2014 Report on sustainability.

Suncor: report on sustainability 2014 01 The next conversation Energy provides us with countless advantages. It also comes with a unique set of challenges. Addressing those challenges means we must engage in open, honest and authentic conversations. How we deliver the energy the world needs is influenced by each of us through what we think, do and say. The next conversation about our energy future begins today. Together, we can find a better way to get things done. Sustainability at Suncor We pursue a triple bottom line vision of sustainability. That means developing resources in a way that delivers economic prosperity, improves social well-being and creates a healthy environment for today and tomorrow. We’re striving to continuously improve our performance. It’s through our annual Report on sustainability that we are able to share with you the progress we’ve made, the challenges we face and how we can work together to deliver on our goals. 02 Suncor: report on sustainability 2014 A message from our CEO While the global energy landscape is always Sadly, solution-oriented discussions about our evolving, some things remain constant and energy future are in short supply these days. certain.

One was what we were hearing from running or declaring you’re on a diet and then one when it comes to reducing our stakeholders, including an organization falling short. So whenever you set goals, there’s greenhouse gas emissions. If you called Ceres, which is a network of investors, always the risk of not meeting them. But if you fail to meet that one, do you expect labour, environmentalists and other public don’t aspire, you don’t really know what you Suncor to be penalized by investors interest groups we’ve been engaging with can achieve. And with these performance goals, or other stakeholders? for a number of years. They urged us to set we’ve already achieved a lot by challenging Most of our investors want us to operate in firm targets and goals. This dovetailed with ourselves to do better. the most effective and efficient way possible. the second driver – a renewed determination Many also want us to be a leader in terms of by our own leadership group to drive So how close is Suncor to achieving our environmental performance. I think they performance improvements across the these goals? recognize that, even if we don’t fully meet company. We wanted to raise the bar and I think we are very close.

In 2013, we marked a milestone: the official opening of a reconstructed fen, a prevalent type of boreal wetland, near our Oil Sands base plant that is designed to emulate the properties of a natural fen watershed. Our fen – one of the first reclaimed fen watersheds in the world – is the culmination of 10 years of collaborative research. Our partnership with the Alberta Conservation Association entered its second decade in 2013. Together, we have secured the protection of more than 23.4 square kilometres (5,777 acres) of select areas in boreal forest to date. The goal is to offset habitat affected by oil sands operations. Planting and nurturing of vegetation that matures and helps support a healthy selfsustaining ecosystem is a key part of reclaiming disturbed lands and habitat. By the end of 2013, we had planted more than 6.5 million trees, * Reclaimed lands have not been certified as such by government regulators.

The latter is calculated by using full-year net production and the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted from operated facilities. Production 20.3 million tonnes in 2012 – a 1.4 per cent As reported in our 2013 Annual Report, total or 0.3 megatonne increase. This was mainly due upstream production averaged 562,400 barrels to 1.2 megatonnes of CO2e emissions from the of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in 2013, ramp-up of Firebag expansion phases 3 and 4. compared to 549,100 boe/d in 2012.

Improvements in the reliability of our base Please note: The sum of the individual Suncor facilities production will not equal the reported net corporate production. Interand intra-business plant operations also helped to offset intensity unit product transfers (hydrocarbon streams that pass through more than one Suncor facility) are removed from the corporate and business increases. These improvements were achieved unit totals to give the net production. This is done to prevent doublecounting of hydrocarbon streams sent for further processing within the even with the completion of planned upgrader company. Individual facility intensities are calculated based on net facility maintenance and unexpected third-party fuel production; business unit intensities are calculated based on net facility production totals minus intra-business unit material transfers; and the supplier outages. corporate GHG intensity is calculated based on net corporate production, which also removes inter-business unit transfers. Overall energy use and energy intensity Overall absolute emissions and GHG emissions are closely linked to energy emissions intensity use with approximately 89 per cent of direct Absolute full-year CO2e emissions in 2013 GHG emissions being related to the totalled 20.6 million tonnes, compared to consumption of energy for operations.

This was mainly due to significant new production from the ramp-up of Firebag 4. Emission increases were the result of added steam generation required for greater production. Once reservoirs reach desired production levels and steady-state operation, emission intensity typically decreases. Absolute emissions growth in In Situ was offset somewhat by the mid-year sale of the majority of our onshore conventional oil and gas production. Our most effective near-term opportunity for reducing our GHG emissions and emissions intensity continues to be improved energy efficiency and plant reliability. In 2013, we continued to implement a comprehensive Energy Management System (EMS) across our onshore operated facilities, a process we expect to complete by the end of 2014. EMS monitors, benchmarks and improves the energy efficiency of our facilities through operational discipline and targeted projects. DEVELOP RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY 02 We operate Canada’s largest ethanol production plant, and we are currently involved in six operating wind farms – five of which are joint arrangements. Our seventh wind power project is expected to be operational in late 2014 and, subject to regulatory approvals, an eighth project is expected to follow in 2015. INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION 03 We continued to play a leading role in developing long-term bitumen extraction technologies that could significantly reduce the GHG emissions intensity of oil sands production. We also continued to work through organizations like Integrated CO2 Network, Carbon Management Canada and the CO2 Capture Project to advance other potential long-term climate change solutions, including carbon capture and storage. As a member of Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance, we are sharing knowledge and expertise and helping to advance new technologies and innovation in four key environmental areas, including GHG emissions. USE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL OFFSETS 04 Our wind farms continued to generate offset credits. Similar to our participation in the Industry Provincial Offsets Group, an organization dedicated to the design of a domestic offset system, we are also an active member of the International Emissions Trading Association, which is working to develop an international framework for trading in GHG emission reductions. COLLABORATE ON POLICY DEVELOPMENT 05 We continued to consult with provincial, state and federal governments on energy and climate change policy. When it comes to climate change regulations, we continue to press for clarity and certainty; fair and equitable application; flexibility in compliance mechanisms; harmonization across jurisdictions; and international regulation that promotes sustainability reporting and transparency. We also believe that, to be effective, climate change policy must encourage consistent and patient investment in new technologies that could lead to deep emissions reductions. EDUCATE EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC 06 We supported energy literacy programs by organizations like Pollution Probe and The Pembina Institute. We also sponsored several initiatives to expand the conversation on energy choices and challenges, including the Walrus Talks Energy and Student Energy. Our employees continued to take individual accountability for reducing waste and improving energy efficiency as part of our employee engagement initiative. MEASURE AND REPORT OUR PROGRESS 07 We file annually on our GHG emissions to provincial, state and federal authorities. We report our overall progress on managing GHG emissions to stakeholders through our annual Report on sustainability and the Carbon Disclosure Project. 24 Suncor: report on sustainability 2014 80% GHG emissions from a barrel of oil, generated at Climate change: a different kind the point of consumption of tipping point The phrase ‘tipping point’ is frequently invoked when it comes to the challenge of addressing global climate change.

Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could influence financial and operating performance of all of Suncor’s operating segments and activities include, but are not limited to, changes in general economic, market and business conditions, such as commodity prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates; fluctuations in supply and demand for Suncor’s products; the successful and timely implementation of capital projects, including growth projects and regulatory projects; competitive actions of other companies, including increased competition from other oil and gas companies or from companies that provide alternative sources of energy; labour and material shortages; actions by government authorities, including the imposition of taxes or changes to fees and royalties, and changes in environmental and other regulations; the ability and willingness of parties with whom we have material relationships to perform their obligations to us; the occurrence of unexpected events such as fires, equipment failures and other similar events affecting Suncor or other parties whose operations or assets directly or indirectly affect Suncor; the potential for security breaches of Suncor’s information systems by computer hackers or cyberterrorists, and the unavailability or failure of such systems to perform as anticipated as a result of such breaches; our ability to find new oil and gas reserves that can be developed economically; the accuracy of Suncor’s reserves, resources and future production estimates; market instability affecting Suncor’s ability to borrow in the capital debt markets at acceptable rates; maintaining an optimal debt to cash flow ratio; the success of the company’s risk management activities using derivatives and other financial instruments; the cost of compliance with current and future environmental laws; risks and uncertainties associated with closing a transaction for the purchase or sale of an oil and gas property, including estimates of the final consideration to be paid or received, the ability of counterparties to comply with their obligations in a timely manner and the receipt of any required regulatory or other third-party approvals outside of Suncor’s control that are customary to transactions of this nature; and the accuracy of cost estimates, some of which are provided at the conceptual or other preliminary stage of projects and prior to commencement or conception of the detailed engineering that is needed to reduce the margin of error and increase the level of accuracy. The foregoing important factors are not exhaustive. Suncor’s management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) for the first quarter of 2014 dated April 28, 2014 and its Annual Information Form dated February 28, 2014, Form 40-F and Annual Report to Shareholders and other documents it files from time to time with securities regulatory authorities describe the risks, uncertainties, material assumptions and other factors that could influence actual results and such factors are incorporated herein by reference. Copies of these documents are available without charge from Suncor at 150 6th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2P 3E3, by calling 1-800-558-9071, or by email request to info@suncor.com or by referring to the company’s profile on SEDAR at sedar.com or EDGAR at sec.gov. Except as required by applicable securities laws, Suncor disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Non-GAAP measures – Certain financial measures in the publication – namely cash flow from operations, operating earnings and oil sands cash operating costs (excluding Syncrude) per barrel – are not prescribed by Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled in Suncor’s MD&A for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013. These non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are included because management uses the information to analyze operating performance, leverage and liquidity, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reclamation – Reclamation at Suncor is a carefully monitored process with two distinct components: (i) transformation of the area, including tailings ponds, into a solid material that can support vegetation, wildlife and landscape restoration, which includes landform design and soil placement; and (ii) re-vegetation in a way that the reclaimed landscape can support vegetation and wildlife as a self-sustaining ecosystem. When Suncor claims that it has reclaimed land or plans to reclaim land, the reclaimed land will have met or is intended to meet the two distinct components identified in this paragraph. BOEs – Certain natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (boe) on the basis of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet. Any figure presented in boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A conversion ratio of one barrel of crude oil or natural gas liquids to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value. Partnerships – The use of Partnership throughout the document does not necessarily mean a partnership in the legal context. ™ Trademark of Suncor Energy Inc.
