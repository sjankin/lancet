Creating and managing stakeholder value and innovation and best practice sharing are the overarching themes, which also describe our approach to our work, people and other stakeholders. Tangible priorities under driving sustainable growth, transforming our operating model and creating a distinct customer experience define how we at MTN strive to gain a sustainable competitive advantage and superior shareholder returns. 2 MTN Group Limited UNGC Communication of Progress//for the year ended 31 December 2013 Contents MTN Group Limited Statement of Recommitment to the UNGC 4 Scope of the Communication of Progress 5 Sustainability context 6 UNGC Communication of Progress for 2013 7 3 MTN Group Limited UNGC Communication of Progress//for the year ended 31 December 2013 Scope of the COP Materiality and stakeholder inclusiveness As Global Compact signatory, MTN recognizes that the ten principles within the four issues areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption are material to the organisation and that these reflect significant economic, social and environmental impacts. We also recognize that the decisions and assessments of our stakeholders are substantially being influenced by the process and results of MTN’s integration of the ten principles into our operations and strategies. The following sources were taken into account in determining materiality:  Feedback from internal and external stakeholders who review MTN’s annual Sustainability Report  Engagement with external stakeholders via the addresses sustainability@mtn.com and investor_relations@mtn.co.za  Communications with media organisations, civil society and community-based organisations, our customers, and general members of the public  Feedback and engagement with the JSE SRI, the CDP, and MTN’s investors who consult us or assess our responsible business performance  Information from third-party questionnaires and assessments of our publicly reported performance by tertiary institutions and other third parties not commissioned by MTN  Our own internal review and research processes including industry, peer and global developments, and our risk and audit management processes. Issues identified through this process were weighted in an internal materiality review. Material issues were prioritized according to the scale and nature of impact on business operations, economic performance and stakeholder groups. These material issues are reviewed by the executive, and the Group business risk management and/or Group social and ethics committees. 5 MTN Group Limited UNGC Communication of Progress// for the year ended 31 December 2013 Sustainability context MTN’s new vision, introduced in 2012, is ‘to lead the delivery of a bold, new Digital World to our customers’. This is informed by the evolution of new information and communication channels that use digital platforms. We want to expand our presence in the digital space to ensure that our customers access a variety of content and information. This will help us deliver on our mission, which is ‘to make our customers’ lives a whole lot brighter’ through the implementation of our strategy. Sustainability is the cornerstone of any successful business in the world today. One of our five strategic themes is to create and manage stakeholder value, and this is the one that most influences the way we do business sustainably. Our stakeholders – employees, civil society, regulators, and ethically focused investors and shareholders, among others – demand that we account for the organisation’s responsible and sustainable performance. Driving sustainable growth is another MTN strategic theme that links directly to sustainability, and involves the identification of products and services that can be introduced to our markets to meet the needs of our customers. There is much opportunity, through many of our products, to meet the specific societal, socio-economic or environmental needs of our customers, and we are proud of our role in helping close the digital divide. In our new digital world, cloud and machine-to-machine services, MTN Mobile Money, mHealth, mInsurance, mEducation and even our ventures into the Big Data space complement the sustainability of the business as the demand for these services grows. There is increasing awareness of new sources of sustainability risk and opportunity for the company. Each year we report that integrating sustainable business requirements is an ongoing journey for MTN, and various core business functions across MTN are undertaking the necessary actions in their business planning and operations more regularly. This is contributing to the realization of some of the themes that underpin our strategic vision. The roll out and embedding of social and ethics management and governance and the associated policies, processes and procedures will continue. MTN will also continue to develop innovative products and services to make a positive societal or environmental difference while embedding our position in the global digital space. MTN’s sustainability awareness programme will be rolled out to more areas of the business, which should enhance the understanding and advance the integration of sustainability initiatives and programmes Group-wide. 6 MTN Group Limited UNGC Communication of Progress//for the year ended 31 December 2013 UNGC Communication of Progress for 2013 The UN GRI G3 Guidelines and Telecommunications’ Sector Supplement were used in preparation of this COP for 2013.  Please also refer to the Group’s UN GRI Report and Sustainability Report available on www.mtn.com/sustainability  Abbreviations  COP: Communication of Progress for the year ended 31 December 2013  IR: MTN Group Limited Integrated Report for the year ended 31 December 2013  SR: MTN Group Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2013 G3.1 MTN’s Response Disclosure UNGC reporting requirement (Document, Section, Page Number or additional information on # www.mtn.com) HIGH-LEVEL COMMITMENT AND STRATEGY  COP: page 2  IR: Group president and CEO’s report, pages 50–53 1.1 CEO statement on continued UNGC support  SR: Group president and CEO on sustainability, pages 4–5 1.2 Impacts, risks and opportunities  IR: Risk and Opportunities page 18 CONTEXT OF OPERATION AND VERIFICATION 2.1 Name of reporting organisation  MTN Group Limited  https://www.mtn.com/offering/Pages/Solutions.aspx 2.2 Products, services  http://www.mtnbusiness.com/ 2.3 Operating structure  IR: pages 2–3 Phase 2 Building Innovation Centre 216 14th Avenue 2.4 Location of Headquarters Fairland Roodepoort Gauteng South Africa 2.5 Geographic scope / map of operations  IR: pages 2–3 2.6 Nature of ownership and legal form  www.mtn.com/mtngroup/about/pages/structure.aspx 2.7 Profile of customer base  www.mtn.com/offering  IR: pages 2–3 2.8 Scale of operations  SR: Report period and scope page 40  IR: Various sections including strategic path, leadership and 2.9 Changes occurring within the reporting period governance and Group strategic analysis  Various on www.mtn.com including on homepage and press releases.

The environmental compliance situation experienced by MTN Nigeria was not specific to the Company, but a matter of broader political challenges of which all mobile network operators in Nigeria were subjected to, and were attributed to management issues in the mandates, roles and responsibility issues between the Federal Ministry of Environment (FME) and the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA), which are both tasked with environmental oversight in the country. Internal management complications relating to the respective authorities or roles between these two agencies resulted in unforeseen impact on the national telecommunications operators’ industry, and were not specific to the actions of any single network Monetary value of significant fines and total number of operator. As a result, in 2009 NESREA elected to shut down a EN28 non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with number of network sites of all operators without following due environmental laws and regulations. legal, regulatory and stakeholder engagement processes. In 2013 a joint committee of the Federal Ministries of Environment and Communications Technology, NESREA and the Nigerian Communications Commission was convened and a Memorandum of Understanding brokered, which is hoped to improve environmental regulatory management of the national telecommunications sector. MTN was the first operator to embark on an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of operations across Nigeria, and was granted its EIA certificate in 2004. In 2009 MTN Nigeria was one of the network operators which submitted over 15,000 Environmental Assessment Reports to NESREA to provide evidence of environmental compliance. In early 2014 the Federal Government also agreed on environmental procedural guidelines for 170 BTS rollouts as part of MTN Nigeria’s capital expansion programme.

As a proudly South African company, founded on the values of our nation’s democratic vision, MTN is supportive of efforts to strengthen South Africa’s multiparty democracy. Accordingly, the Group has made funding available to 13 political parties currently represented in parliament, as they prepare to take part in the 7 SO6 Financial / in-kind contributions to political parties May 2014 general elections. The funding is in line with the MTN Code of Ethics and Corporate Political Contributions Policy. In determining the allocations, MTN followed the Independent Electoral Commission’s model of proportional representation in parliament, based on the outcome of the 2009 general elections. We believe that political parties need resources to participate in elections, and extending funding to these organisations is critical to ensuring a vibrant and democratic society.

The environmental compliance situation experienced by MTN Nigeria was not specific to the Company, but a matter of broader political challenges of which all mobile network operators in Nigeria were subjected to, and were attributed to management issues in the mandates, roles and responsibility issues between the Federal Ministry of Environment (FME) and the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA), which are both tasked with environmental oversight in the country. Internal management complications relating to the respective authorities or roles between these two agencies resulted in unforeseen impact on the national telecommunications operators’ industry, and were not specific to the actions of any single network operator. As a result, in 2009 NESREA elected to shut down a number of network sites of all operators without following due legal, regulatory and stakeholder engagement processes. In 2013 a joint committee of the Federal Ministries of Environment and Undertake initiatives to Communications Technology, NESREA and the Nigerian Communications Commission promote greater Principle 8 was convened and a Memorandum of Understanding brokered, which is hoped to environmental improve environmental regulatory management of the national telecommunications responsibility sector. MTN was the first operator to embark on an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of operations across Nigeria, and was granted its EIA certificate in 2004. In 2009 MTN Nigeria was one of the network operators which submitted over 15,000 Environmental Assessment Reports to NESREA to provide evidence of environmental compliance. In early 2014 the Federal Government also agreed on environmental procedural guidelines for 170 BTS rollouts as part of MTN Nigeria’s capital expansion programme.  EN29 Significant environmental impacts of transport use : for products, materials, members of the workforce): Although transportation is not a source of significant environmental impacts and is not deemed material, greenhouse gas emissions associated with transport are quantified.
