Brasília – DF INTRODUCTION We have been contracted with the purpose of applying limited assurance procedures on the sustainability information disclosed in the Annual Report of Banco do Brasil S.A., related to the year ended December 31 2013. RESPONSIBILITIES OF COMPANY MANAGEMENT The management of the Banco do Brasil is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the sustainability information disclosed in the Annual Report according to the Guidelines for Sustainability Reports of the Global Reporting Initiative – GRI (GRI-G4) and using the internal controls that it determined as necessary to enable preparation of such information free of any relevant distortion, even though it was resulted by fraud or error. INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express a conclusion about the information in Annual Sustainability Report based on the limited assurance engagement conducted in accordance with Technical Notice (CT) 07/2012 approved by the Federal Accounting Council and prepared in accordance with NBC TO 3000 (Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits and Reviews), issued by the Federal Accounting Council – CFC, which is the equivalent to international standard ISAE 3000 issued by the International Federation of Accountants applicable to Non-Historical Information. These standards require compliance with ethical requirements, including independence ones and also that the engagement is conducted in order to provide a limited assurance that the information disclosed in the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement conducted in accordance with NBC TO 3000 (ISAE 3000) primarily consists of questioning to the management of Company and other Company’s professional involved in preparing the information in the Annual Report and also applying analytical procedures to obtain evidence that allows us to make a limited assurance conclusion about the information taken as a whole. A limited assurance engagement also requires additional procedures when the independent auditor learns of issues which lead them to believe that the information in the Annual Report, taken as a whole, could present material misstatement. The selected procedures were based on our understanding of the issues related to the compilation and presentation of the information in the Annual Report and other engagement circumstances and considerations about areas where material misstatement could exist. The procedures consisted of: a. The planning of the work, considering the relevance, amount of quantitative and qualitative information and the operational systems and internal controls that served as a basis for preparation of the information in the Annual Report; Annual Report 2013 112 Banco do Brasil b. The understanding of the calculation methodology and the consolidation procedures used to of the indicators through interviews with the personnel in charge of the preparation of the information; c. The application of substantive procedures to the quantitative information and enquiries about the qualitative information and its relation to the indicators disclosed in the information presented in the annual report; and d. The comparison of the financial indicators with the financial statements and/or accounting records. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited conclusion. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS The procedures applied in a limited assurance engagement are substantially less extensive than those applied in an assurance engagement aiming to express an opinion about the information in the Annual Report. Due to this, it does not ensure us that we are aware of all the issues that would be identified during an assurance engagement which aim to express an opinion. If we had conducted an engagement in order to express an opinion, we may have identified other issues and possible misstatements which can be in the information presented in the Annual Report. Therefore, we are not expressing an opinion about this information. The nonfinancial data is subject to more inherent limitations than the financial data, due to the nature and diversity of the methods used to determine, calculate or estimate this data. Qualitative interpretations of the data’s materiality and accuracy are subjected to individual presumptions and judgments. Additionally, we did not examine data informed for prior periods or future projections and targets either. The objective of our work was to apply limited assurance procedures on the sustainability information disclosed in the Annual Report of Banco do Brasil, not including its greenhouse gas emissions data, neither the assessment of the appropriateness of its policies, practices and sustainability performance. CONCLUSION Based on the applied procedures, described in this report, nothing has come to our attention that leads us to believe that the information contained in the Annual Report 2013 prepared by Banco do Brasil SA in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative – GRI (GRI-G4), were not compiled, in all relevant aspects, in accordance with the records and files that served as bases for their preparation.
