• reflects upon Landell’s progress in implementing its 2013 Global Compact initiatives; • provides Landell with the opportunity to outline its 2014 corporate social responsibility (CSR) objectives; and • ensures that Landell is accountable for its actions and responsibilities to its stakeholders and the wider community. Landell’s CSR strategy includes the following initiatives undertaken in 2013: • Landell released its Social Procurement Toolkit for the Public Sector. • Landell updated its social procurement toolkit for local councils, developed pro bono by Landell in 2011; • Landell undertook original research pro bono in the form of a survey of all Victorian public hospitals, in order to establish the hospitals’ baseline understanding and implementation of social procurement. As a result of the findings, Landell: o developed the Social Procurement Guide for the Hospital Sector; and rd o presented a summary of the results of the research to the 3 National Health Procurement Conference. • Landell undertook a presentation of social procurement at a local government symposium with Social Traders. • In October 2013, Landell became a founding member of Social Procurement Australia (SPA), which further cements Landell’s leading position in social procurement. • Landell developed and launched the Values of Government and Procurement (VGAP) Accreditation Scheme to help professionals uphold and support the values of the Victorian Public Sector. The VGAP accreditation scheme is designed to equip professionals with an understanding of Victorian Government values, policies and practices so they can make good commercial and ethical decisions when involved in procurement and service delivery activities. • Landell appears to have succeeded in having social procurement included on the 2014 agenda of Global Compact Network Australia. • Landell developed Disability Action Plan 2013-16 (DAP) aiming to eliminate, as far as possible, discrimination in its employment and operational policies. As Landell’s CSR strategy has expanded, so too have the benefits to Landell of our membership of the Global Compact, which include an increase in the positive social effects of our operations on our value chain, the enhanced ability to identify corporate risks and opportunities, continuous organisational performance improvement and an enhancement of stakeholder relations, including the provision of significant learnings to stakeholders through collaboration.
