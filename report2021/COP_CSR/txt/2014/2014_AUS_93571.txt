We apply our focus and positive energies to fulfilling our organizational principles and giving practical expression to the United Nations Global Compact. We are continually committed to the continuous integration of the UNGC principles into our business strategy and operations and to sharing these developments with our staff, clients and students. EQUALS International was founded on the spiritual principles of equality, justice, consultation and unity, and we therefore strive to demonstrate responsiveness to the UNGP’s ten principles. We believe that the Global Compact offers an important tool and opportunity for organizations around the globe to collaboratively work towards sustainable and responsible growth. Should the reader have any queries or require further information, we encourage you to contact Marie Chittleborough at mchittleborough@equals.edu.au. We look forward to another year of continued promotion and innovation.
