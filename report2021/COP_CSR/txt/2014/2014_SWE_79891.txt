Autonomous driving can cut fuel consumption by more than 20 per cent in certain situations but it will also carry Ongoing cooperation with Siemens on electric motors ­significant consumer benefits. Volvo Cars and Siemens have been working together in an electric mobility partnership since 2011. This strategic cooperation between Volvo Cars and Siemens aims to advance the technical development of the electrification of cars. The focus is on taking the joint development of electrical drive technology and power electronics from research to realization. The first product to be launched with this technology will be the new XC90 at the end of 2014. Much testing and demonstrating has been carried out in order to be confident that these systems can be intregrated in Volvo cars with high safety and quality standards. In 2013 the first demo fleet of the C30 electric generation II with a new electric engine was launched. These cars have been upgraded with a new electric engine and a new inverter from Siemens, and have an extended range and better and faster charging capacity. In this fleet, Volvo Cars introduced the world’s first fast-charger that operates on a three-phase supply and is small enough to be fitted in the car. A full charge takes 1.5 hours with a range of 164 km, while a 10-minute plug-in adds power for CO2 emissions and fuel efficiency another 20 kilometres of driving. This will support the partnership’s aim Limiting CO2 emissions is a challenge for all in the automotive business. to develop electric cars with no compromises. Volvo Cars works hard to reduce emissions and increase fuel efficiency. Volvo Cars’ approach to reducing the CO2 emissions of cars Meeting the different legal requirements on CO2 emissions in all markets is a considerable challenge from a product planning perspective. Planning the company’s product range therefore involves careful analysis of the need to meet future legal regulations. This is done in combination with a thorough analysis of foreseen customer expectations on products. This is a demanding task as the automotive industry has very long lead-times, where many years pass between initial planning and the launch of a new product. Volvo Cars does, however, see this challenge as an opportunity to offer driving pleasure with a good conscience. Volvo Cars believes that the most effective way to cut its product range’s total CO2 emissions in Drive Me – Self-driving cars for sustainable mobility the short term is to reduce the fuel consumption of the diesel and petrol Volvo Cars is working towards developing autonomous driving engines of its cars. This is because cutting the emissions of many cars technologies – not only for the sake of safety, but also because it has sold in large volumes will have a bigger total effect and bring favourable positive impacts on the environmental performance of cars. The present results more quickly than making huge cuts in a small number of cars. systems for auto braking, lane keeping aid and adaptive cruise control Volvo Cars has therefore introduced a range of high-efficiency diesel are examples of the first steps towards autonomous driving.

Drive Me: In 2013, Volvo Cars initiated a Swedish pilot project with self-driving cars on public roads – the first project of its kind in the world. The ground-breaking project “Drive Me – Self-driving cars for sustainable mobility” is a joint initiative between Volvo Cars, the Swedish Transport Administration, the Swedish Transport Agency, Lindholmen Science Park and the City of Gothenburg. The aim is to find answers to all questions related to self-driving cars in order to make implementation a reality. Top ranked in the Folksam safety report 2013: Volvo Cars’ leadership in safety was further supported by a safety report of the Swedish insurance company Folksam in September 2013. The report put four Volvo models – the S60, V60, V70 and S80 – at the top of the ranking by an extensive margin, close to 60 per cent lower injury risk compared to the average modern car in Sweden. The Folksam study evaluates the safety performance of 238 car models involved in 158,000 accidents that were reported to the Swedish police between 1994 and 2013. The information is combined with medical reports about 38,000 injured persons in traffic accidents between 2003 and 2013. Volvo Cars’ third edition of “Children & Cars – a Safety Manual”: This award-winning manual provides parents all over the world with ­guidance on how their children can travel safely in the car. The new child safety manual is available at Volvo dealers globally and can also be downloaded via this link: http://esd.volvocars.com/site/TopNavigation/About%20Volvo/Safety/safetymanual2013_eng.pdf The Volvo V40 received a five-star rating with an overall score of 58.2 points in the 2013 China NCAP test. The overall result is the best in the passenger car category since the protocol was upgraded in 2012. The Volvo V40, which comes standard equipped with Volvo Cars’ groundbreaking whiplash protection system (WHIPS), achieved a top result in this test as well as the side impact test. The V40 was also given a top ranking in the Euro NCAP Autonomous Emergency Brake (AEB) tests. The V40 is the overall record holder in the Euro NCAP programme. The Volvo S60, XC60 and V40 top results in new front crash prevention ratings: Two new test programmes for rating the Front crash prevention system were introduced: in Europe by Euro NCAP and in the US by US Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). Both rating institutes tested different new Volvo models with the standard equipped City Safety system as standalone and also in combination with the optional Collision Warning with Full Autobrake system. The combined Volvo City Safety/Collision Warning with Full Autobrake and the standalone City Safety system received top result in both ratings. The safety systems were tested by Euro NCAP in Volvo V40 & S60 and by IIHS in Volvo S60 & XC60. Volvo S60, XC60, S80 and XC90 have an IIHS Top Safety Pick+ in the United States in 2013. All four Volvo cars achieved Top Safety Pick+ results including good performance in the Small Overlap Front test, which replicates what happens when the front corner of a vehicle strikes another vehicle or object, such as a tree or a utility pole – a very severe crash situation. In the test, 25 per cent of the front end on the driver’s side strikes a 5-foot-high rigid barrier at 40 mph (64 km/h). Volvo Cars with auto brake technology passed the one million sales in July 2013. The low-speed City Safety system is standard in all new Volvo models on all markets. Most Volvo models are also available with state-of-the-art technologies that detect, warn and brake automatically for the rear end of vehicles as well as, for example, pedestrians and cyclists swerving out in front of the car. A world first was introduced – Pedestrian and Cyclist Detection with full auto brake, detects and automatically brakes for cyclists swerving out in front of the car. According to accident data, about 50 per cent of all cyclists killed in European traffic have collided with a car. The new advanced software, including more rapid vision processing, has made it possible to extend the present detection and auto brake technology to also cover certain cyclist situations. The technology also covers vehicles driving in front in the same direction. Car 2 Car communication enables vehicles to communicate with other vehicles and with the traffic environment, opening up fantastic possibilities. Vital information can be shared and exchanged – creating a safer and more comfortable and drive. The technology is based on communication between transmitters in vehicles and the road infrastructure, such as road signs and traffic lights. The technology has been tested and demonstrated successfully. The new Active Safety Test facility is being built next to Volvo Cars’ existing proving ground at Hällered, Sweden and operated by the company Active Safety Test Area AB (ASTA). The new facility will open in 2014 and will provide Volvo Cars with tools for the development of tomorrow’s intelligent safety and driver support systems. It plays an important role for Volvo Cars’ continued leadership in the field of safety. 2013 Global NCAP Innovation Award. Volvo Cars’ pioneering work on pedestrian protection was rewarded with the “2013 Global NCAP Innovation Award” in May.
