The main increase in consumption will come from the transport sector in developing countries. Based on forecast growth of the world population by 1.1 billion people in 2010-2025, we expect world consumption of liquid hydrocarbons to grow at an average annual rate of 1.2% and to reach 105 million barrels per day by 2025. Liquid hydrocarbons consumption forecast, million barrels per day Source: CDU TEK, LUKOIL estimates. The refining crisis in Europe will continue Decline in demand for petroleum products in Europe in 2009 led to a decline in loading levels at European refineries. Also, the world’s largest consumer of gasoline, the U.S., is increasing levels of domestic production and therefore reducing imports. This has led to a major crisis in the European refining industry. Commissioning of new capacities in Asia and the Middle East will lead to a redistribution of petroleum product flows, and will increase competition in the European market. Russian refineries will undergo large-scale Source: IEA, IHS CERA, LUKOIL estimates. modernization The share of crude oil in world consumption of hydrocarbons A set of measures by the Russian government to encourage will gradually shrink due its substitution by other energy investment in refinery upgrades and growth of domestic vehicle sources in such sectors as power generation and housing fleets will encourage increase of light product yield and reduce services. production of fuel oil at Russian refineries. More than 70% of supply growth of liquid hydrocarbons Structure of refinery production and refining in 2010-2025 will be from the development of high-tech depth in Russia, % (enhanced recovery) techniques in oil production and use of alternative fuels, such as liquefied gas, GTL and biofuels. Oil production in Russia needs new technologies 90% of oil production in Russia is at fields, which were discovered before 1988, since most of the fields that have been discovered more recently are located in remote areas with harsh climatic conditions and other factors, which impede their development. So future trends in Russian production will depend on the ability of companies to bring new fields into Annual Report 2013 operation in a timely fashion and on increased deployment of modern technology to maintain production levels at old fields. This strategy will require a large amount of investments. Source: Petromarket, LUKOIL estimates.

The Bolshekhetskaya Depression is a priority region for Company development as part of its overall strategy to expand the share of natural gas projects in its business. International Projects Production of marketable gas outside Russia rose by 1.4% to 6.4 billion m3 in 2013, mainly due to higher levels of production in two projects: Tengiz (Kazakhstan) and Shakh Deniz (Azerbaijan).

Main principles of the tax: • The tax base is the financial outcome of a project. Operating income less capital expenditures is used as the tax base to calculate excess profits tax in a specific project (Base for the excess profits tax = operating profit of the project minus capital cost of the project) • Redistribution of the tax burden.

Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, net cash flows have been calculated using a ten percent discount related to the above oil and gas reserves, is calculated in factor. Discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when future accordance with the requirements of Topic 932 of the Codification. expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced. Estimated future cash inflows from production are computed by applying the 12-months average price for oil and gas to year-end The information provided in the tables set out below does not quantities of estimated net proved reserves. Adjustments in this represent management’s estimate of the Group’s expected future calculation for future price changes are limited to those required cash flows or of the value of the Group’s proved oil and gas by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reserves. Estimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and reporting year. Future development and production costs are those change over time as new information becomes available. Moreover, estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and produce probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, the future, are excluded from the calculations. The arbitrary assuming continuation of year-end economic conditions. Estimated valuation, prescribed under Topic 932 of the Codification, requires future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate yearassumptions as to the timing and amount of future development end statutory tax rates. These rates reflect allowable deductions and production costs.

As a result, our daily domestic crude oil In addition to our production, we purchase crude oil in Russia and natural gas liquids production volumes increased by 1.7%, and on international markets. In Russia, we primarily purchase compared to 2012. crude oil from affiliated producing companies and other producers. Then we either refine or export purchased crude oil. Crude oil The structural increase in our domestic production was a result purchased in international markets is normally used for trading of the acquisition of a 100.0% share of ZAO Samara-Nafta and an activities, for supplying our international refineries or for increase in the Group’s ownership in ZAO Kama-oil from 50.0% processing at third party refineries. 2013 2012 2011 (thousand (thousand (thousand (thousand (thousand (thousand of barrels) of tonnes) of barrels) of tonnes) of barrels) of tonnes) Purchases in Russia 5,447 743 1,994 272 4,010 547 Purchases for trading internationally 48,416 6,605 28,170 3,843 56,683 7,733 Purchases for refining internationally 75,607 10,315 91,713 12,512 95,070 12,970 Total crude oil purchased 129,470 17,663 121,877 16,627 155,763 21,250 Annual Report 2013 169 A significant part of our crude oil purchases is for processing. its interest to 60% in April 2011 and to 80% in September 2012, Compared to 2012, our purchases for processing at international when the control over the refinery was obtained and ISAB became refineries decreased by 17.6%, largely, as a result of the increase our consolidated subsidiary, rather than equity affiliate. in volumes of our own crude oil supplies and lower throughput at our refineries outside of Russia.
