The system eradicates volatile organic substances in the atmosphere with aerobic bacteria and facultative bacteria. It is associated with the decomposition of volatile organic compounds a n d t h e t r a n s f o r m a t i o n t o C a r b o n d i o x i d e ( C O 2) a n d w a t e r ( H 2O ) e m i t t e d t o t h e atmosphere. In experiments with this system, results show that in some sources, the concentration of volatile organic compounds could be reduced by more than 99 percent. In addition, Thaioil Group has implemented follow-up programs to check ambient air quality in the surrounding area of Thaioil Group in comparison with standard values. Parallely, the development of systematic diagnosis of factors affecting the dissemination of air pollutants has been developed. Therefore, air quality management can be made in time.

The Committee is responsible for managing energy for the group, developing an energy efficiency master plan, establishing measures to conserve energy and prevent oil loss, monitoring results against identified targets, and establishing energy efficiency projects. In addition to reducing greenhouse gases from 2014 PLAN combustion, the energy efficiency has brought about reductions in production costs as well. The Committee regularly reviews and revises the master plan in order to ensure it suitable with domestic and global energy situations. To set up an energy conservation and oil loss prevention Community of Practice Project for Communication and knowledge sharing in energy savings In 2013, Thaioil Group has implemented the following energy • Crude Distillation Unit 3 (CDU-3) applying Energy Management E N E R G Y E F F I C I E N C Y A N D C L I M AT E C H A N G E conservation activities: System: ISO 50001 to existing energy management • Crude Distillation Unit 2 (CDU-2) maintenance as planned in with plan to extend certifications to other production units Thaioil Group believes that climate change may affect competitive advantage in the future in terms of fuel at Thai Lube Base Public Co., Ltd. and Thaioil’s affiliates.
