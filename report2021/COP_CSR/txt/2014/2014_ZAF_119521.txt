In Chile we focused aggressively on a restructure of our cost base and on building new health-compliant smoking terraces to regain lost revenues. These and other initiatives have resulted in a strong recovery in the second half, with revenues returning back to pre-smoking ban levels and a strong improvement in profit margins. In South Africa we also embarked on a significant restructure of our cost base while simultaneously implementing a number of measures to enhance revenue. These measures, which we started implementing in the first half, took a few months to gain traction and only during the second half did we start to see the benefits materialise with revenue growth of 7.4% and EBITDA growth of 15.8%. Despite the improvement in the second half resulting in fullyear EBITDA being 4.5% above the prior year, at an earnings per share level it was not sufficient to offset the poor first half, and consequently diluted adjusted headline earnings per share was 7% down on last year at 655 cents. Taking cognisance of the number of expansion projects under consideration, the dividend pay-out of 37% of diluted adjusted headline earnings was maintained.

The increased capital expenditure was in line with indications given to shareholders in 2013. 23 Chief Executive AND management report continued OUR APPROACH TO OUR BUSINESS To achieve our strategy we have set ourselves shortand mediumterm objectives and initiatives which are reviewed and updated on a yearly basis. These initiatives and objectives address our key risks, key stakeholder concerns and our strategic growth aspirations. The strategic focus areas set in the prior year have remained largely unchanged and are the basis for measuring management’s performance, starting with the Chief Executive then cascaded to direct reports, and in turn, throughout the organisation. These form our roadmap for the foreseeable future, with our progress in the past year and objectives ahead for each of the following five strategic pillars forming the basis for the rest of this management report: 01 Improve our existing operations and guest experience In challenging the assumption that the markets in which we operate in are relatively mature, we are actively relooking how our business is structured and how we operate to maximise the value we can create and to improve the guest experience. Ensuring that existing and new guests keep choosing Sun International properties as their destination of choice – through offering a great experience – is core to this focus area. P 26 Protect and leverage our existing asset portfolio We have a diverse portfolio of assets including world class five star hotels, modern and well located casinos, some of the world’s 02 premier resorts and some older legacy assets that for various reasons may not be positioned favourably any more. In evaluating our portfolio we have identified those properties that can be better leveraged, those that need protection and those that may no longer be core to our strategy. P 32 24 Sun International Integrated Annual Report 2014 03 Grow our business Overview into new areas and products While we believe there is still latent growth to be had from our existing assets, to effectively grow our business we are considering other geographic areas that offer attractive opportunities for casinos. In particular we are Chairman’s report focusing on Latin America. We are also looking at the alternative gaming market which continues to experience strong growth. P36 04 CHIEF EXECUTIVE and Our people Our people are the enabler of the Group’s management report ability to achieve its strategic objectives. Given the highly competitive service-oriented industry we operate in, our people’s motivation and competence to perform and provide a memorable guest experience are key determinants of the Group’s ongoing success and sustainability. Abridged financial P40 information Governance and sustainability statutory As a responsible corporate citizen, the Group has developed a credible track record that underlies our corporate reputation. Governance and sustainability are fundamental to Sun International’s operations 05 and are interwoven into our strategy and decision-making process, from board and management level to our operations. P 44 25 Chief Executive AND management report continued Improve our existing operations and guest experience Carnival City 26 Sun International Integrated Annual Report 2014 Overview Chairman’s report We restructured the senior operational management team during 2013, recruiting international expertise to assist in bringing our operations up to global best practice. We have also worked to improve the management approach by creating a wider CHIEF EXECUTIVE and management team that meets informally quarterly to deliberate on our operations and strategy. The benefit of this more inclusive group is being felt in greater participation in setting and understanding objectives, with strategic alignment starting to permeate throughout the business. management report We also collapsed the historic divisional structure where gaming was managed separately from hotels/resorts. Gaming represents around 80% of our total business and it was our belief that we could improve our gaming revenues by removing the “silos” and giving our gaming customers better access to our unique hotels and resorts, in particular Sun City. Under the new structure it has been very pleasing to see Sun City’s gaming revenues grow 16% – significantly better growth than prior years due to more frequent visits by our existing customers as well as new Abridged financial gaming customers. Key initiatives currently underway to improve our operational performance include: ❖❖ Simplifying operational structures to achieve cost savings and efficiencies information ❖❖ Restructuring the sales and marketing approach for gaming, hotels and our website ❖❖ Developing and launching our new brand ❖❖ Developing and launching our new loyalty programme ❖❖ Insourcing food and beverage and other services Update on operational restructure Following the restructure of the management team, we focused next on the organisational structures of the rest of statutory the business, in particular to try and achieve better operational efficiencies. In Chile this could be achieved rapidly and was successfully implemented in September 2013, leading to a significant improvement in margins without negatively impacting on guest experience. In South Africa, this process, implemented in terms of section 189 of the Labour Relations Act, has involved a thorough and lengthy consultation process with unions and other stakeholders such as provincial gambling boards. We offered a voluntary retrenchment/early retirement programme which was accepted by approximately 700 of our 6 800 employees in South Africa. The cost associated with this programme (and other performance-related retrenchments) amounted to R165 million and this was provided for at 30 June 2014 (with the affected employees leaving then or shortly thereafter). A further 500 to 700 employees are likely to be retrenched following an extensive assessment. These employees have been identified and will leave the organisation by end October 2014, with associated costs of approximately R100 million. The anticipated benefits of the more efficient operational structure will start to flow through in the 2015 financial year. As can be expected, it has been a very difficult time for all employees across the Group, exacerbated by the protracted time frame necessitated by the extensive consultation process. The improvement in operating results in recent months has been achieved in a very uneasy environment with staff morale at an all-time low and we would like to thank and commend everyone, including those no longer with us, for the immense effort in very trying conditions. 27 Chief Executive AND management report continued Q&A Mervyn Naidoo DIVISIONAL DIRECTOR: Western AND EASTERN Cape REGIONS Q There have been significant operational Q W e are making fundamental changes to changes over the past year.

Although we delivered a strong performance in the last six months, we are implementing strategy and assessing progress on a monthly basis. 28 Sun International Integrated Annual Report 2014 Overview Chairman’s report CHIEF EXECUTIVE and management report Revitalising our brand The increasingly digital environment favours the simple and short; the new logo is instantly recognisable at any scale, and In line with our efforts to improve all aspects of our operations, the brand architecture will follow in, for example, Sun City, we have also revitalised our brand strategy.

The transactions CHIEF EXECUTIVE and concluded and announced are in various stages of implementation. Shareholder approval, where required, has been obtained and it is largely regulatory approvals that are outstanding. While our primary focus is on executing the transactions already management report announced, we continue to evaluate other opportunities to better leverage our assets and believe there are a number which will hopefully come to fruition in the year ahead.

We still believe that there is no potential for Abridged financial significant additional gaming revenue to be had in the region to justify establishing another large casino in the catchment area of the city. On 13 May 2014, the Group announced that it had concluded a transaction which will see GPI exit its investments information in SunWest and Worcester. Tsogo will acquire a 40% shareholding in both properties including the acquisition from Sun International of a 14.9% interest in each of SunWest and Worcester for a combined cash consideration of R635 million. GPI has, since inception, been the primary BEE stakeholder in SunWest and Worcester and wishes to monetise its stake in these assets to pursue other interests. Tsogo has limited exposure to the Western Cape metropolitan markets and wishes to increase its presence in this market. Sun International and GPI are of the considered view that Tsogo is the only party that can provide similar BEE ownership credentials to that of GPI, and furthermore, Tsogo has the financial capability to implement a transaction statutory of this magnitude. Sun International and its employee share trust will own 60% of SunWest and Worcester and will continue to control and consolidate these assets. Tsogo will have representation on the board of directors of SunWest and Worcester with typical minority shareholder protections. All operations will continue to be managed by Sun International Management Limited under each of its existing management contracts. The proposed transaction is subject to competition commission and gambling board approval and the relevant submissions have been made. Shareholders voted in favour of the transaction at the general meeting held on 22 August 2014. We believe that this deal is in the best long-term interest of SunWest and Worcester. The R635 million proceeds to be received will be useful in funding the Group’s expansion plans and from an empowerment perspective, we are especially pleased with the R2.2 billion value created for GPI. 33 Chief Executive AND management report continued Monticello As announced on SENS on 2 July 2014, Sun International reached agreement to acquire a further 54.7% interest in THE ORIGINAL SUN CITY VACATION Monticello for approximately US$114 million on 30 June 2014.

In addition, R300 MILLION REFURBISHMENT Sun International will acquire shareholder loans and cash of approximately US$32 million. TO BRING THEM TO A WORLD CLASS STANDARD. The transaction provides the opportunity for Sun International to acquire an increased economic interest in, and gain strategic control over, what is regarded as one of Latin America’s best casinos. The transaction acts as a catalyst for establishing a portfolio of premier assets in the region as well as providing the platform for further growth and consolidation of Sun International’s strategic position in the casino industry. Shareholder approval was received on 29 September 2014 and the purchase is now subject only to Chilean Gambling Board approval, for which the relevant submission has been made. An accrual of R1 687 million has been raised in non current liabilities for the purchase consideration. From an operational point of view we have had to take some swift and significant action during the year to mitigate the negative impact of the smoking ban introduced early in 2013. We downsized the work force to match the lower levels of revenue and four smoking decks with slot machines have been constructed allowing natural airflow and complying with the anti-smoking legislation. Our approach was to create an environment of comparable quality and experience with the non-smoking areas of the casino and this has been well-received by the Santiago market. With encouraging growth in casino revenue we have commenced Since the opening of these decks, coupled with improved the refurbishment of the main casino at an estimated cost of marketing focus, revenues have improved steadily.

From its founding in 1978 with a single beachfront resort in Pattaya, Minor is today one of the largest hospitality statutory and leisure companies in the Asia Pacific region. With over 100 hotels and resorts, 1 500 restaurants and 250 retail trading outlets, Minor meets the growing needs of consumers in Thailand and in 25 markets from Africa to Australia.

The deal with Sun International gives Minor greater access to hotel opportunities in southern Africa. With Minor’s balance sheet strength and Sun International’s existing relationships and understanding of these markets, we see the deal as an ideal opportunity to service and improve the offerings in these countries while rightsizing our interest in these African assets to align with our strategy. There is strong rapport between the management and chairmen of the two groups, with the relationship built up over the course of the year. We look forward to working closely with Minor. Starting with the existing African assets, it is the intention of the alliance to explore other hotel and gaming opportunities that may arise, particularly in Africa and Asia. 35 Chief Executive AND management report continued 03Grow our business into new areas and products Monticello Grand Casino 36 Sun International Integrated Annual Report 2014 Overview Chairman’s report We are pleased to report that we have made significant progress in growing our business in line with our strategy.

Sun International and the other casino operators, through the Casino Association of South Africa (CASA), made calls to national government for a national framework to be put in place to regulate EBTs but certain provinces are moving ahead regardless. For example, at the Boardwalk in the Eastern Cape, where we have recently invested almost R1 billion as part of our licence renewal, the gaming board has gone ahead with allowing EBT operators into our catchment area. This new, and unforeseen, commercial challenge makes it harder for us to grow in this market, however we believe that while we undoubtedly will lose some revenue, ultimately the majority of our existing and new players will choose the far superior experience offered at our properties. 38 Sun International Integrated Annual Report 2014 The O ce a n Sun Casino opened its doors for business on 1 2 September 2014.

Our credible track record that underlies our corporate reputation protects our current business and supports our expansion into new territories, given the focus of governments and regulators on operators who understand and deliver on their responsibilities as responsible corporate citizens. Given the strategic importance of attaining a solid corporate reputation, the challenge for the Group this year was to move beyond the realm of just compliance and to build an integrated platform to support the Group’s strategic objectives. The many good initiatives that have previously been undertaken by the Group, were at times driven in isolation and hence we were achieving good but fragmented results in the sustainability domain. We found that as we started to consider the elements of governance and sustainability as one, a process which we reported on last year, the more naturally certain elements and processes lent themselves to a way of integrated thinking and doing. At the heart of this integrated thinking is the premise that the development, operation and management of our hotels, resorts and gaming operations have ethical, environmental and social implications on the communities within which we operate. Not only do we have a responsibility to these communities, we are also aware that our corporate behaviour within these communities, tells a story that forms the perceptions of our many stakeholders and informs our reputation as we seek to expand into new territories. 45 Chief Executive AND management report continued Our legal licence to operate is informed by our social licence and companies and we will continue to ensure that these guests hence our approach to governance and sustainability will always have reason to support our properties. remain an imperative to the Group.

The Group has stayed true to its commitment to interact only with SACCAWU, our official union, unless they request the involvement of Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). While the restructuring process has at times been stressful, we are pleased that discussions have been robust and we thank SACCAWU for the constructive engagement and spirit throughout the consultation process.

Overview Chairman’s report CHIEF EXECUTIVE and management report Outlook Abridged financial information Over the past year there has been little change in the operating environment which remains subdued, with minimal improvement expected in the medium-term. Despite the poor economic conditions, the second half of the financial year has reflected an encouraging improvement in both revenue and EBITDA as a result of the revenue enhancing and cost-cutting initiatives implemented during the year and the significantly improved trading of Monticello. statutory The benefit of these initiatives should continue to have a positive effect in the new financial year, in particular with the conclusion of the restructure in South Africa. As detailed above, these initiatives have brought about significant change in the Group and a key focus of management in the year ahead will be ensuring that the benefits achieved are sustainable. On balance, the Group is confident that it will achieve growth in both EBITDA and adjusted headline earnings in the 2015 financial year. We are excited by the prospects for our projects coming on stream in higher-growth economies, which we expect to build up in the year ahead. We expect to see the impact from 2016 onwards. My thanks to the board for their support and advice during a year of change, and to the management team and the people of Sun International for their commitment and focus in the face of uncertainty.

Reason and effect for special resolution 1.1 At the time of constituting the social and ethics committee in 2011, the fees for this committee were aligned to that of the nomination committee. The social and ethics committee fees have since increased by the same salary increment as the Group. The nature of the statutory committee’s work has grown more expansive and intensive and accordingly the fees have been aligned with the scope of the committee’s mandate and in accordance with their statutory obligations. It is proposed that the social and ethics fees be increased in order to reflect the extent of the committee’s duties. 1.2 Approval of THE investment committee fees To consider and, if deemed fit, to pass, with or without modification, the following special resolution: Resolved that in terms of section 66(9) of the Companies Act, the fees payable to the Chairperson and members of the investment committee for meetings in person as set out below: Proposed for the 2014/2015** financial year Proposed base fee Proposed attendance fee Investment Committee – Chairperson 42 600 24 500 Investment Committee – Members 21 300 12 300 ** Based on 4 meetings per year. 63 Notice of the Sun International annual general meeting continued Reason and effect for special resolution 1.2 Special resolution number 2: Approval of no The purpose of the investment committee is to consider and more than 10% for non-executive director evaluate the viability of proposed investment opportunities, AND COMMITTEE fees disposals and expansion projects for recommendation to the To consider and, if deemed fit, to pass, with or without modification, board for their consideration and approval.

The investment committee period for which this resolution remains valid unless revoked will now be convening quarterly committee meetings in person before the expiry of the two year period. and as a result the investment committee meeting fees are proposed as set out above. Reason and effect for special resolution 2 As the approval for director fees is valid for a period of two Quorum for special resolutions 1.1 and 1.2 years, it is recommended that shareholders approve a 10% In order for these resolutions to be adopted, the support of more increase for each of the two forthcoming years unless an than 75% of the voting rights exercised on the resolution by alternative proposal is tabled at any general or annual general shareholders present or represented by proxy at the annual meeting before the expiry of two years. An increase of no more general meeting and entitled to exercise voting rights on the than 10% each year is not considered excessive and the resolutions are required.

To compare changes in implemented during 2014. Group waste from 2013 as the baseline, 2014 has been normalised to exclude 292 tonnes, thereby reflecting a 6.69% waste increase to landfill. WATER CONSUMPTION BREAKDOWN To reduce the volume of waste being disposed to landfill, waste separation and recycling initiatives are being implemented at the majority of our properties. General waste recycled includes paper and cardboard, glass, cans, plastic, metal, e-waste, wetwaste sent to worm and pig farms, and garden waste used for composting. 25% of waste generated by Sun International was recycled during 2014. Potable Water 84% No significant spill incidents were reported during 2014. Recycled 16% WASTE STREAMS Six of our properties use recycled water, comprising treated wastewater either from the municipality or from their own onsite water treatment plants. During 2014, 741 kilolitres of the Waste recycled Group’s total water was recycled. 25% Non-hazardous waste WASTE MANAGEMENT 75% Hazardous waste Waste generation is one of the main concerns for the Group. 0% With the exception of Sun City, who owns their own licenced landfill site, all waste is disposed at municipal landfill sites. During 2014, total waste generated throughout the Group was 12 481 tonnes, with 3 128 tonnes waste recycled. 9 325 tonnes non-hazardous waste was sent to landfill and 28 tonnes hazardous waste was disposed at registered hazardous waste sites. Total waste to landfill equates to an average of 0.01 tonnes per square meter of floor space of waste generated. The amount spent on waste management for the Group was approximately R8 million over the year. Sun International 2014 Report 78 Sun International sustainability continued emissions should be included, although Scope 3 emissions are RECYCLED WASTE BREAKDOWN optional.

These additions should 1 072 1 074 therefore be taken into account when comparing total annual emissions and Scope 1 emissions. The financial control approach is used to consolidate all emissions within the specified boundary. This approach sees the inclusion of properties where Sun International has the ability to “direct the financial and operating policies of the latter with view to gaining economic benefits from its activities” (GHG Protocol, 238 261 263 15 revised edition). 110 95 25 properties fall within the boundary of Sun International.

Adjusted headline earnings include adjustments made for certain items of income or expense. These adjustments include preopening expenses and material items considered to be outside the normal operating activities of the Group and/or of a nonrecurring nature. For the diluted earnings per share calculation the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to take account of potential dilutive share awards granted to employees. The number of shares taken into account is determined by taking the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options and awards. This calculation is done to determine the ‘unpurchased’ shares to be added to the ordinary shares outstanding for the purpose of computing the dilution.

The Maslow forms part of the operating segment, South African operations. The recoverable amount has been calculated using a discounted cash flow valuation. A discount rate of 11.7% was used. Net carrying value of property, plant and equipment held under finance leases is R99 million (2013: R107 million) and relate mainly to equipment. A copy of the register of properties is available for inspection by members of the public at the registered office of the Company. Borrowing costs of R13 million (2013: R13 million) were capitalised during the year and are included in ‘Additions’ above. The capitalisation rate used of 3.9% (2013: 7.4%) is equal to the specific borrowing costs of the loans used to finance the relevant projects.

The brand was tested for impairment by discounting five years of projected cash flows on relevant operations and management contracts. Discount rates were based on the risk free rate of the appropriate country, a standard risk premium and a country risk premium and ranged from 7% to 13%. In determining the growth rates applied in the impairment calculations, consideration was given to the location of the business, including economic and political facts and circumstances. Based on these calculations, there is no indication of impairment. Goodwill The goodwill opening balance relates to the acquisition of San Francisco Investment Resorts SA (SFIR) on 20 August 2008. Goodwill comprises intellectual property and the casino licence. The R14 million addition to goodwill relates to the acquisition of Powerbet Gaming Proprietary Limited (Powerbet). Goodwill was tested for impairment by performing a 'value-in-use' valuation by applying a discount rate that ranges from 8% to 12%. The recoverable amount of all cash generating units has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated above. The recoverable local territory tax rates were applied and a terminal growth rate based on local inflation plus a premium. The difference between the 'value-in-use' valuation and the net asset value of the cash generating unit (including goodwill) is R106 million for SFIR and R17 million for Powerbet.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT INFORMATION Valuation in terms of the Financial Services Board (FSB) guidelines A valuation of the defined benefit fund was carried out on 1 July 2013 by an independent firm of consulting actuaries and was approved by the FSB in August 2014. The fund was found to have a surplus of R377 million, of which R144 million has been designated as a solvency reserve by the trustees in terms of circular PF 117 issued by the Financial Services Board (FSB). Any allocation of assets to contingency reserves reduces the amount of surplus available for distribution to former members and other stakeholders. The Group carries out statutory actuarial valuations every three years.

It should be noted that this valuation is performed on a different basis to the valuation in terms of the FSB guidelines.

In applying the asset ceiling the present value of the retirement benefit surplus that may be recognised as an asset is limited to the lower of the amount as determined above or the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan plus any cumulative unrecognised net actuarial losses and past service costs.

A 1% decrease in the future rate of increase of the pension fund liability assumption from 9.45% per annum to 8.45% per annum results in the liability increasing by R57.7 million, or 14.8% and the resultant increase in the total of the service and interest costs on the defined benefit obligation is R2.2 million, or 5.3%. The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: Discount rate 9.45% 9.00% Inflation rate 6.60% 6.00% Expected return on plan assets 9.45% 9.00% Future salary increases 8.10% 7.50% Future pension increases 6.60% 6.00% The average life expectancy in years of an employee retiring at age 60 at 30 June 2014 and of a member retiring at age 60, 20 years after the statement of financial position date are as follows: Male 19.4 19.4 Female 24.2 24.2 Mortality rates are assumed to be in accordance with the following standard tables: Before retirement: SA1985-90 Ultimate table for males and females After retirement: PA 90 rated down 2 years for males and females Plan assets comprise: Listed equity investments 74% 76% Bonds and cash 25% 19% Other 1% 5% Pension plan assets include the Company's ordinary shares with a fair value of R3.6 million (2013: R3.5 million).

The process is still ongoing and has taken longer than expected due to extensive but constructive consultation with the unions and affected parties. The process is expected to be completed in the first half of the next financial year. R53 million has already been paid out during the financial year and a provision of R112 million has been raised for employees who have accepted early retirement and voluntary retrenchment. The liability is calculated based on the current remuneration level as well as years of employment. This brings the total cost relating to the restructure to R165 million (refer to note 3). Progressive jackpots This is the provision for wide area progressives. The full provision is expected to be utilised within the next financial year. 37 Sun International 2014 Report R million 2014 2013 25.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group at all times maintains adequate committed credit facilities in order to meet all its commitments as and when they fall due. Repayment of borrowings are structured to match the expected cash flows from operations to which they relate. The Group’s preference share funding is subject to debt covenants which are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The following are the contractual undiscounted maturities of financial liabilities (including principal and interest payments) presented in Rands: More than More than More than On demand 6 months 1 year 2 years or not but not but not but not exceeding exceeding exceeding exceeding More than R million 6 months 1 year 2 years 5 years 5 years 2014 Term facilities 79 105 508 1 797 316 Minority shareholder loans 362 – – – – V&A loan 25 25 55 195 244 Redeemable preference shares 946 49 76 1 156 – Lease liabilities 20 7 11 24 – Vacation Club members – – – – 81 Short-term banking facilities* 78 2 410 – – – Derivative financial instruments (9) (10) (16) (8) 97 Trade payables 265 – – – – Accrued expenses 741 – – – – Interest payable 8 – – – – Capital creditors 29 – – – – Other payables 93 – – – – Monticello purchase consideration 1 687 – – – – 4 324 2 586 634 3 164 738 2013 Term facilities 457 154 296 907 132 Minority shareholder loans 324 – – – – V&A loan 23 23 50 179 315 Redeemable preference shares 69 69 921 1 191 – Lease liabilities 32 31 20 2 – Vacation Club members – – – – 99 Short-term banking facilities* 95 2 454 – – – Derivative financial instruments 7 8 12 8 – Trade payables 209 – – – – Accrued expenses 699 – – – – Interest payable 10 – – – – Capital creditors 22 – – – – Other payables 79 – – – – 2 026 2 739 1 299 2 287 546 * These are 364 day notice facilities.

Sun International 2014 Report 40 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 26. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Credit risk Credit risk arises from loans and receivables, accounts receivable (excluding prepayments and VAT), and cash and cash equivalents. Trade debtors consist mainly of large tour operators. The granting of credit is controlled by application and account limits. Cash investments are only placed with high quality financial institutions. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of all financial assets determined to be exposed to credit risk, with the exception of financial guarantees granted by the Group for which the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the guarantees are called on (refer to note 28). The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to a widely dispersed customer base. Credit risk with respect to loans and receivables is disclosed in note 14. Market risk Market risk includes foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk. The Group’s exposure to other price risk is limited as the Group does not have material investments which are subject to changes in equity prices. (a) Foreign currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to US Dollar, Sterling, Botswana Pula, Chilean Peso, Nigerian Naira, Zambian Kwacha and Colombian Peso. The Group manages its foreign currency risk by ensuring that the net foreign currency exposure remains within acceptable levels. Companies in the Group use foreign exchange contracts (FECs) and interest rate cross currency swaps to hedge certain of their exposures to foreign currency risk. The Group has one material FEC outstanding at 30 June 2014 (2013: two) with a fair value of R55 million (2013: R32 million). The notional amount of the outstanding FEC at 30 June 2014 was R500 million (2013: R239 million). Refer to paragraph (b) for the interest rate cross currency swaps. Included in the statements of financial position are the following amounts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group (Rand): R million 2014 2013 Financial assets US Dollar 353 366 Sterling 11 28 Botswana Pula 84 80 Chilean Peso 294 246 Nigerian Naira 35 35 Euro – 2 Zambia ZMW 23 30 Colombian Pesos 15 – Financial liabilities US Dollar 400 726 Botswana Pula 13 12 Chilean Peso 645 251 Nigerian Naira 82 74 Zambia ZMW 21 29 Colombian Pesos 4 – Foreign currency risk is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate in Rand due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 41 Sun International 2014 Report 26. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Foreign currency sensitivity A 10% strengthening in the Rand against foreign currencies at 30 June 2014 would decrease profit before tax by the amounts shown below.

R million 2014 2013 US Dollar 29 30 Sterling – (1) A 10% weakening in the Rand against these currencies at 30 June 2014 would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, remain constant. R million 2014 2 013 Profit before tax – (3) A 10% weakening in the Chilean Peso against the US Dollar at 30 June 2013 would have had an equal but opposite effect to the amount shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant. (b) Cash flow interest rate risk The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and variable rate borrowings. The Group is not exposed to fair value interest rate risk as the Group does not have any fixed interest bearing financial instruments carried at fair value. The Group manages interest rate risk by entering into short and long term debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates. It also uses floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate cross currency swaps to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate cash flow risk. At 30 June 2014, the following derivative financial instruments were in place: 2014 2013 SIL interest SFIR rate cross Emfuleni Emfuleni interest rate currency interest rate interest rate cross currency swap swaps swaps swaps Notional amount R500 million R300 million R300 million US$41 million Fixed exchange rate 9.8811 526 – 5912 Swapped notional US$51 million Fixed rate 3.87% 30 September 2015 swap 5.57% 5.57% 29 September 2017 swap 5.97% 5.97% Variable rate 3 month Linked to Linked to Linked to Jibar + 2.05 quarterly quarterly USD Libor NACS Jibar Jibar Fair value liability/(asset) at 30 June R55 million (R4 million) (R4 million) R44 million Transfer of profit from hedging reserve to foreign exchange profits R2 million Net profit on cash flow hedges R1 million R3 million 1 Swapped Rands for US Dollars. 2 3 fixed rate swaps were entered into swapping US Dollars for Chilean Pesos (US$1: CLP 526 – 591). The term over which the cash flows are expected to occur and impact on profit and loss is the same as set out in the derivatives maturity analysis on page 40.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued The interest rate characteristics of new and refinanced debt instruments are restructured according to expected movements in interest rates (refer to note 21).

R million 2014 2013 Profit before tax (58) (34) A 1% decrease in interest rates at 30 June would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant. Capital risk management The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide benefits for its stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust this capital structure, the Group may issue new shares, adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or buy back existing shares. The board of directors monitors the level of capital, which the Group defines as total share capital, share premium, treasury shares and treasury share options. There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Fair value estimation The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Group companies have guaranteed borrowing facilities of certain Group subsidiaries in which the Group has less than 100% shareholding. The Group has therefore effectively underwritten the minorities’ share of these facilities in the amount of R583 million at 30 June 2014 (June 2013: R612 million). Wild Coast Land Claim The land claimants, being the Mgungundlovu Community, are asking the Land Claims Court for relief in the form of declaring the company’s long-term notarial lease over the Wild Coast Sun property invalid; alternatively ordering restitution of ownership of the property from the State to the Community. The latter ground is not an issue. The first ground is being defended in that the loss of the lease would result in the revocation of the Wild Coast Sun’s casino licence due to the absence of tenure to the property, which is a requirement in terms of the Eastern Cape gambling legislation. The trial is scheduled to start in early November 2014. It is difficult to assess the Community’s prospects of success with this ground but at a Group level the exposure is perhaps not significant. 29.

Options lapse if not exercised within ten years of their date of grant. Options under the scheme were granted at prices ruling on the JSE Limited at the date of granting those options. No options were issued during the year. (ii) Conditional share plan CSP awards provide senior executives with the opportunity to receive shares in Sun International Limited by way of a conditional award, which is subject to the fulfilment of predetermined performance conditions on the expiry of a three year performance period. The performance condition is related to the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) over a three year period, relative to the TSR of constituents in the INDI 25 index and gambling/hotels sub-sectors of the travel and leisure sector that have a market capitalisation of greater than R1 billion. No awards vest if the Group’s TSR falls below the median TSR of the comparator group while all the awards vest if the Group’s TSR falls within the upper quartile. Between the median and upper quartile the CSP awards vest linearly as the ranking of the Group’s TSR increases. For awards made in 2011 and 2012, 40% of the award is based on the performance condition related to the Company’s TSR over a 3 year period as described above. In addition two new performance conditions were included as follows: 30% of the award is based on achieving AHEPS threshhold and on-target performance targets. 30% of the award is based on the Group achieving and maintaining a B-BBEE rating level of 4 or better as at December 2013.

Sun International 2014 Report 52 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 33 EMPLOYEE SHARE TRUSTS These trusts have been consolidated in the Group’s financial statements in terms of IFRS10 – Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the trusts are controlled by their trustees. The majority of the trustees are representatives elected by and from the employees who are beneficiaries of the trust. The Company has no beneficial interest in and has no control over the trusts. The Group does not share in any economic benefits of the trusts. Sun International Employee Share Trust The Sun International Employee Share Trust was established to enable eligible employees to share in the success of the Group through share ownership. The share scheme excludes participants of any other Group share incentive scheme. Eligible employees will benefit from income and growth distributions made by the trust. The trust is funded through interest free loans from the participating companies in the Group. These loans have been fair valued and imputed interest at 12% per annum is recognised over the expected loan period. Loans will be repaid through dividend flows and proceeds on the disposal of the underlying investments held by the trust. The economic interest held by the trust in Group companies is set out below: 2014 2013 % % Afrisun Gauteng 3.5% 3.5% Emfuleni Resorts 3.5% 3.5% SunWest 3.3% 3.3% Meropa 3.5% 3.5% Teemane 3.5% 3.5% Afrisun KZN 3.5% 3.5% Mangaung Sun 3.5% 3.5% Worcester 3.5% 3.5% Sun International Limited – direct 2.5% 2.5% – indirect 2.8% 2.8% Sun International Black Executive Management Trust (SIBEMT) As a further commitment to BEE and to assist Sun International in retaining black managerial staff, to attract new black talent and to contribute towards the creation of sustainable black leadership, a trust was formed for the benefit of current and future South African black management of the Group.

TRANSACTIONS WITH NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS 2014 The Group acquired an additional 0.1% and 0.7% in Afrisun Gauteng and Teemane respectively for R3 million each in July 2013. The Group purchased the remaining 23% interest in Afrisun Leisure Investments from WIP Gaming during August 2013 for R120 million. This acquisition resulted in the Group's effective shareholding increasing in the following subsidiaries: SunWest +0.9%; Worcester +2.3%; Afrisun KZN +0.9%; Afrisun Gauteng +1.3%; Afrisun KZN Manco +3.3%; Emfuleni +2.1% and Gauteng Casino Resorts Manco +11.2%.

IGGR sold its shareholding in April 2013. The remaining shareholders took up these shares in proportion to their shareholding which resulted in SIL's effective shareholding increasing to 44.21%.

The Group also adopted IAS 19 (revised 2011), ‘Employee benefits’ on the same date. The accounting policies are applied retrospectively and had the following impact on the financial statements. (a) Consolidation of an entity in which the Group holds less than 50% In terms of IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ Dinokana Proprietary Limited (“Dinokana”) is assessed to be a subsidiary of Sun International. This has resulted in the restatement of the 30 June 2013 results. Dinokana is now consolidated as a subsidiary whereas previously 49% of Dinokana was proportionately consolidated. The effect of the restatement on the 30 June 2013 statement of financial position is as follows: As previously Consolidation R million reported of Dinokana Restated Non current borrowings 6 670 249 6 919 Treasury shares (1 594) (187) (1 781) Minorities interest 1 693 (61) 1 632 Cash and cash equivalents 1 023 1 1 024 The effect of the restatement on the 30 June 2013 statement of comprehensive income is as follows: Interest expense (486) (19) (505) Profit for the year attributable to minorities 314 (19) 295 The effect of the restatement on the 30 June 2013 statement of cash flows is as follows: Cash and cash equivalents at end of year 1 023 1 1 024 The consolidation of Dinokana has also resulted in a further 3 427 077 Sun International shares being recognised as treasury shares. (b) Remeasurement of post employment benefit obligations In terms of IAS 19R, ‘Employee Benefits’, remeasurements of post employment benefit obligations should be included in other comprehensive income and no longer in profit and loss. The effect of the change on the 30 June 2013 statement of comprehensive income is as follows: As previously reported/As Effective R million restated above change Restated Employee benefits (2 256) (16) (2 272) Tax (477) 4 (473) Profit for the year attributable to minorities (as stated above in section (a)) 295 (2) 293 The effect of the above changes led to an increase in basic earnings per share of 17 cents. 55 Sun International 2014 Report 36. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The following events have taken place since 30 June 2014: (i) During April 2014 public hearings were held in relation to the Group’s application to amend its Morula licence to allow the relocation of the licence to Menlyn Maine on the east side of Pretoria. On the 31st of July 2014, the Gauteng Gambling Board (“GGB”) announced that the Group’s application had been approved thereby permitting the relocation of the casino from Mabopane to Menlyn. The approval is subject to conditions that are reflective of the commitments made in the application. Detailed planning of the R3 billion development will now commence in conjunction with further engagement with the GGB to conclude detailed agreements for the amendment of the Morula licence conditions. The development is part of an R8 billion, 315 000 m2 precinct of which R825 million is either already built or under construction. Sun International will provide the entertainment node which includes a 110 room five star hotel, 8 000 seat entertainment arena, convention and exhibition facility and a casino with 2 000 slot machines and 60 tables. Notification has been received of certain legal objections to the proposed relocation and development and these are being addressed. Once the amendments to the Morula licence are issued by the GGB and in the absence of any legal impediment the detailed planning and construction of the casino will commence and is anticipated to take approximately 36 months. (ii) As announced on SENS on 18 August 2014 Sun International has entered into agreements with Minor International Pcl (“Minor”), a large global company with investments in hotels, restaurants and lifestyle brands, whereby Sun International will dispose of a significant portion of its African portfolio to Minor. The interests Sun International will dispose of and its shareholding pre and post the transaction are set out in the table below: Effective ownership Pre the Post the transaction % disposed transaction Gaborone Sun 80% 80% 16% Kalahari Sands 100% 80% 20% Lesotho Sun and Maseru Sun 47% 80% 9% Royal Swazi and Ezulwini Sun 51% 80% 10% Royal Livingstone and Zambezi Sun 100% 50% 50% On conclusion of the transaction the Royal Livingstone and Zambezi Sun will be accounted for as a joint venture, Gaborone Sun and Kalahari Sands as associates and Lesotho Sun, Maseru Sun, Royal Swazi and Ezulwini Sun as available-for-sale assets. The collective purchase consideration amounts to R664 million plus the face value of any shareholder loans. Sun International will continue to manage the casino operations situated at each of the assets and Minor will assume day-to-day management responsibility for the hotel operations other than the Royal Livingstone and Zambezi Sun, which will be jointly managed under a joint venture arrangement. The agreements reached cater for a sharing of management fees, the marketing of the properties, and the provision by Sun International of support services. Starting with the existing African assets it is the intention of the alliance to explore other hotel and gaming opportunities in particular those that may arise in Africa and Asia. The proposed transaction is subject to various regulatory approvals and the relevant submissions have been made. (iii) The Group’s application for a casino licence in Cartagena, Colombia was approved by the Colombian gaming regulator on 28 July 2014. This paves the way for the Group’s proposed casino, which forms part of a mixed use development in Cartagena. The casino, which will be developed at a cost of US$30 million, will have 310 slots machines and 16 tables. The Group will lease the casino component of the development which includes a 284 room, five star InterContinental hotel, convention centre, shops, theatres, apartments and offices. Whilst relatively small, this opportunity is viewed as a low risk entry into the very attractive Colombian market. We are starting to mobilise the construction company and expect the casino to open in 2015. Sun International 2014 Report 56 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 36. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS continued (iv) It was announced on 13 May 2014 that the Group has concluded a transaction which will see Grand Parade Investments Limited (“GPI”) exit its investments in SunWest and Worcester. Tsogo Sun Holdings Limited (“Tsogo”) will acquire a 40% shareholding in both properties including the acquisition from Sun International of a 14.9% interest in each of SunWest and Worcester for a combined cash consideration of R635 million. GPI has, since inception, been the primary BEE stakeholder in SunWest and Worcester and wishes to monetise its stake in these assets in order to pursue other interests. Tsogo has limited exposure to the Western Cape metropolitan markets and wishes to enhance its presence in this market. Sun International and GPI are of the considered view that Tsogo is the only party that can provide similar BEE ownership credentials to that of GPI and furthermore Tsogo has the financial capability to implement a transaction of this magnitude. Tsogo will have representation on the board of directors of SunWest and Worcester however it will have no operational responsibility or interaction as all operations will continue to be managed by Sun International Management Limited under each of its existing management contracts. The proposed transaction is subject to competition commission and gambling board approval and the relevant submissions have been made. Shareholders voted in favour of the transaction at the annual general meeting held on 22 August 2014. (v) As announced on SENS on 13 May 2014, Sun International will acquire up to a 70% interest in GPI Slots. GPI Slots is the holding company of GPI’s limited payout (“LPM”) gaming operations that own and operate LPMs. Given the fast growing nature of the LPM and EBT industry in South Africa and the negative impact thereof on the Group’s traditional casino business, a strategic decision was taken to look for opportunities to enter this space. The acquisition will be made in three tranches with an initial acquisition of a 25.1% interest in GPI Slots for a cash consideration of R225 million plus 25.1% of the face value of shareholder loans. The Group has options to acquire a further 25% interest in one year’s time and an additional 20% one year thereafter. The relevant submissions to the Competition Commission and gambling boards have been made. While the regulatory process may still take some time we expect all approvals to be received by November 2014. Shareholders voted in favour of the transaction at the general meeting held on 22 August 2014. 57 Sun International 2014 Report Company statements of comprehensive income for the year ended 30 June R million Notes 2014 2013 Revenue 719 824 Operational costs (17) (9) Operating profit 1 702 815 Foreign exchange profit 10 35 Interest income 2 61 46 Interest expense 3 (77) (80) Profit before tax 696 816 Tax 4 (3) (25) Profit for the year 693 791 Other comprehensive income – – Total comprensive income for the year 693 791 58 Sun International 2014 Report Company statements of financial position as at 30 June R million Notes 2014 2013 ASSETS Non current assets Investments in subsidiaries 6 3 864 3 755 Loans and receivables 7 280 294 Deferred tax 8 9 – 4 153 4 049 Current assets Loans and receivables 7 1 783 1 071 Cash and cash equivalents 57 14 Tax – – 1 840 1 085 Total assets 5 993 5 134 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Capital and reserves Ordinary shareholders’ equity 4 653 4 162 4 653 4 162 Non current liabilities Deferred tax 8 – 4 Borrowings 10 974 681 Other non current liability 11 80 30 1 054 715 Current liabilities Accounts payable and accruals 12 276 247 Borrowings 10 2 9 Tax 8 1 286 257 Total liabilities 1 340 972 Total equity and liabilities 5 993 5 134 Sun International 2014 Report 59 Company statements of cash flows for the year ended 30 June R million Notes 2014 2013 Cash flows from operating activities Cash generated by operations 13.1 72 58 Tax paid 13.2 (9) (16) Net cash inflow from operating activities 63 42 Cash flows from investing activities Increase in investment in SFIR (56) – Investment income 13.3 784 871 Other non current investments and loans (made)/realised 13.4 (702) 123 Net cash inflow from investing activities 26 994 Cash flows from financing activities Increase/(decrease) in borrowings 13.5 295 (714) Interest paid 13.6 (86) (86) Dividends paid 5 (255) (268) Increase in share capital – 32 Net cash outflow from financing activities (46) (1 036) Net cash and cash equivalents movement for the year 43 – Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 14 14 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year 57 14 60 Sun International 2014 Report Company statements of changes in equity for the year ended 30 June Share based Share Share payment Retained R million Note capital premium reserve earnings Total equity Balance at 30 June 2012 9 268 129 3 155 3 561 Share issue 32 32 Employee share based payments 46 46 Release of share based payment reserve (32) 32 Total comprehensive income for the year 791 791 Dividends paid 5 (268) (268) Balance at 30 June 2013 9 300 143 3 710 4 162 Employee share based payments 53 53 Release of share based payment reserve (14) 14 Total comprehensive income for the year 693 693 Dividends paid 5 (255) (255) Balance at 30 June 2014 9 300 182 4 162 4 653 Sun International 2014 Report 61 Notes to the Company financial statements for the year ended 30 June R million 2014 2013 1.

Reason and effect for special resolution 1.1 At the time of constituting the social and ethics committee in 2011, the fees for this committee were aligned to that of the nomination committee. The social and ethics committee fees have since increased by the same salary increment as the Group. The nature of the committee’s work has grown more expansive and intensive and accordingly the fees have been aligned with the scope of the committee’s mandate and in accordance with their statutory obligations. It is proposed that the social and ethics fees be increased in order to reflect the extent of the committee’s duties. 1.2 Approval of THE investment committee fees To consider and, if deemed fit, to pass, with or without modification, the following special resolution: Resolved that in terms of section 66(9) of the Companies Act, the fees payable to the Chairperson and members of the investment committee for meetings in person as set out below: Proposed for the 2014/2015** financial year Proposed base fee Proposed attendance fee Investment Committee – Chairperson 42 600 24 500 Investment Committee – Members 21 300 12 300 ** Based on 4 meetings per year.

The investment committee period for which this resolution remains valid unless revoked will now be convening quarterly committee meetings in person before the expiry of the two year period. and as a result the investment committee meeting fees are proposed as set out above. Reason and effect for special resolution 2 As the approval for director fees is valid for a period of two Quorum for special resolutions 1.1 and 1.2 years, it is recommended that shareholders approve a 10% In order for these resolutions to be adopted, the support of more increase for each of the two forthcoming years unless an than 75% of the voting rights exercised on the resolution by alternative proposal is tabled at any general or annual general shareholders present or represented by proxy at the annual meeting before the expiry of two years. An increase of no more general meeting and entitled to exercise voting rights on the than 10% each year is not considered excessive and the resolutions are required.

Sun International 2014 Report 2 REPORTS TRANSFORMATION REPORT continued Employment equity Although employment equity (EE) is included in the dti B-BBEE codes, the Company is also required to comply with the standalone Employment Equity Act. As per the Act, the Company is required to submit an EE plan with EE targets to the Department of Labour (DoL). Our current plan expired at the end of July 2014 and we are required to submit another plan for the next three years. As a result of the section 189A restructure of our workforce, the Company engaged with the DoL and has now submitted a one-year plan for 2014/15 year. After the completion of the restructure, a three-year plan will be submitted. This makes it difficult to set realistic targets as it is unclear what the racial demographic split of the workforce will look like after the section 189A process is completed. The Group views employment equity as a critical component of business strategy, being integral to both employee relations and talent management initiatives.
