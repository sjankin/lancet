Signature Position CEO Karl Krug We have chosen to list all of the 10 principles in our COP even though some of them may never require significant updating. The complete list will be a good reminder of where we’ve been, and where we’re going. We ensures the principles are maintained in our own operations to the extent that they are relevant (for example, we have never had an issue with human rights abuses, child labor, forced or compulsory labor, corruption, etc.). On the other hand, we have found room for improvement in the environmental category and are creating several procedures for improving our environmental impacts.

A brief description of our Processes or Systems Recycle system and Electronic Document Repository Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year • We have continued our “go-green” initiative with both internal (MTI & Global Partner Network) and external clients & vendors. • We implemented a recycle procedure in all our operations in 2012, and continue to support all recycling efforts. • Implementation of vendor electronic invoicing. Electronic invoice copies are retained online for reference, and effectively improves the environmental impact by reduced printed materials, and the handling and resources taken to mail the invoice. • Implementation of a pilot program to move from multi-copy pre-printed forms that created a large amount of waste, to a print as you need laser format. This not only reduced cost in materials, but energy output in the elimination of an additional designated printer, less paper waste, and furthers the option for additional employees to work from home.

PRINCIPLE 9 BUSINESS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES Our Commitment or Policy The MTI Worldwide Logistics provides help to existing & start-up companies which are attempting to develop environmentally friendly technologies. Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year We offer recyclable cardboard pallets to targeted customers in order to replace the wooden pallets which account for almost 30% of all the trees cut each year in the USA alone. Measurable Results or Outcomes Cheap wooden pallets (and a strong political lobby..) during a recession are a major hurdle for companies resisting change to a more environmentally friendly cardboard pallet. However we are starting to see positive momentum in the willingness of companies to entertain eco-friendly pallet alternatives.
