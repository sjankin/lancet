Successful GHG-Energy Target Management Investment on Climate Change Adaptation R&D Initiatives EWP is one of the companies that are given their target energy goals in accordance with the Energy Target Management In preparation for the increasing pressure of the international society to reduce GHG according to IPCC, EWP will invest System, where the government sets the limitations on the GHG emission and energy consumption of target companies, and regularly on the R&D related to cope with climate change. Through such investment, EWP will continue to secure the high then monitors and manages the progress and status. EWP has actively participated in this regulatory practice, while forming its technology for the reduction of GHG. Especially, in cooperation with other power generation companies, EWP has own response system to minimize the impacts that may occur upon the enforcement of emission trading schemes. To comply concentrated its capabilities in a collaborative carbon capture and storage(CCS) R&D projects, and carried out its own R&D with the Energy Target Management rules, EWP has prepared fact sheets on the company‚Äô s energy consumption from 2007 to projects on NCCU(Non-capture carbon utilization).
