Boliden’s production however, was good, taking into account the large scale, planned maintenance shutdowns that we carried out. We have focused heavily on the expansion projects and on process stability and safety work – all areas that will continue to be of major importance for us in 2014.” Lennart Evrell, President and CEO SEK m 34 ,409 (40 ,001) Important events Revenues • Aitik’s ore production corresponded to an annual rate of 37 million tonnes at the SEK m 2,271 (4 ,042) turn of the year and the goal of 36 million Operating proﬁt excluding retonnes per year was consequently valuation of process inventory achieved one year ahead of schedule.

BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2013 3 INTRODUCTION | BOLIDEN IN BRIEF Boliden in brief Boliden is an integrated producer of important base metals such as zinc, copper and lead for industrial customers throughout Europe. The production of precious metals, such as gold and silver, forms an increasingly important part of Boliden’s operations. Almost 90 years’ experience Boliden’s history stretches all the way back Boliden’s stakeholders in the day-to-day operations to the 1920s, since when the company has established a competitive position in the fields of exploration, mining operations, concentration, smelting and recycling operations.

Boliden’s most important metals have the following applications: BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2013 5 INTRODUCTION | PRESIDENT’S STATEMENT President’s Statement Demand for Boliden’s metals was relatively strong in 2013, but concerns about the global economy and increased global supplies resulted in a fall in metal prices. Production levels during the year were good, particularly at Aitik, which reached the production goal for 2014 one year ahead of plan. The smelter production was limited by the biggest planned maintenance shutdowns ever. Investments in the Garpenberg zinc/silver mine and the project to extract silver from silver-containing zinc concentrate at Kokkola both entered their most intensive phases during the year and proceeded according to plan. The focus on costs and increased productivity during 2013 helped keep costs largely unchanged. Work with cost control and productivity will continue in 2014. Global demand for metals has continued to increase for a number on the part of all employees during the year. Our New Boliden Way of years in succession, driven by rapid economic development in work is never-ending: it is a process of improvement in which densely populated countries that have begun to lift themselves each new level will be challenged and new improvements will out of poverty and political turbulence. The level of inequalities be developed. between the different countries of the world has consequently Boliden’s two ongoing expansion projects – the Garpenberg shrunk and the number of poor countries is dropping rapidly. zinc/silver mine and the silver extraction project at the Kokkola China’s position as the engine that drives the world’s metals markets smelter – were launched in 2012 and the projects are now ready is expected to start retreating in around 2020 and the question to go live in 2014.

During my meetings with personnel in various functions across Boliden, it is apparent that leadership and attitudes towards safety, the environment and equal opportunities have improved in recent years. The consensus that has been achieved with regard to crucial change requirements is hugely important in terms of Boliden’s development. One area which, despite a strong focus, has not developed as well is our safety work. Boliden does have a lower accident frequency than companies in many other sectors, but it is also clear that the best companies are better than Boliden in this respect and it is vital that we continue to improve our safety culture if we are to achieve our ambitious goals. Boliden’s environmental performance during the year was good and our reduced emission and discharge goals have been met with a good margin in most areas. Boliden is a signatory to the UN’s Global Compact and our efforts to implement and promote its 10 principles continue. Our work towards increasing equality of opportunity was rewarded with the 2013 Swedish Industry Equality prize, and our work to increase understanding of Boliden’s operations was ranked fifth of over 400 companies in the Annual Report of Annual Reports 2013. It is 90 years since the discovery of the gold deposit in Fågelmyra outside Skellefteå that led to the creation of Boliden, both as a community and as a company. A number of unique areas of expertise within mining, smelting and leaching processes and exploration have been developed over the long years since then, and even when times have sometimes been hard, Boliden has continuously honed its expertise in critical areas and built up its own project resources. 2013 ended well at most units and we are approaching the dates when the new facilities at Garpenberg and Kokkola will go live. 2014 will be an exciting year! year, despite certain disruptions in conjunction with the ongoing Stockholm, February 2014 expansion project during the year. The Tara zinc mine in Ireland continued the cost reduction programme launched in 2012 within the framework of the New Boliden Way, with strong commitment from all employees. The smelters’ major maintenance shutdowns in the spring were conducted largely according to plan and resulted in production levels falling in comparison with the previous year. Harjavalta improved its process stability, was able to extract valuable metals Lennart Evrell from intermediate stocks, and reported an extremely good result. President & CEO The trend at Rönnskär was, to some extent, the opposite with poorer quality raw materials leading to deteriorations in yields and lower production. An action programme has been implemented in order to rectify these problems. Odda continued to reduce costs and Kokkola reported a stable year. The most recent compilations of the world’s mines and smelters show that Boliden’s competitiveness has increased, the strong Swedish krona notwithstanding. This is partially due to the ongoing fine tuning of new projects, but is largely due to the work on the BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2013 7 INTRODUCTION | THE BOLIDEN SHARE The Boliden share The Boliden share is listed on the NASDAQ OMX Nordic Stockholm Exchange (NASDAQ OMX) in the Large Cap segment.

STRATEGY | MARKET AND PRICING TRENDS Market and pricing trends Global demand for metals is driven by the population growth and urbanisation that goes hand in hand with economic growth and increasing prosperity in more and more parts of the world. The rapid urbanisation process in emerging economies is leading to a growing need for investments in housing and infrastructure, resulting in increased demand. The trend in treatment and reﬁning charges for both copper and zinc was positive in 2013, while the average base metal prices were down from levels in 2012. Interest in precious metals waned and prices fell. There are a number of factors to indicate that the demand for metals Treatment charges − zinc will continue to increase. One important indicator is that the demand Smelters’ production increased during the year, while global mined for metals grows most rapidly when GDP per capita grows from production remained virtually unchanged. This resulted in a surplus USD 5,000 to USD 15,000. Around 37 per cent of the world’s in mined concentrate in 2013, albeit a smaller one than in 2012.

Mines’ competitiveness depends both on the level of operating costs Smelters’ competitiveness depends on their capacity to extract and on the scale of the income received from subsidiary metals. metals from raw materials, on their income from other metals, and Mines with weak competitiveness often have little or no income on their cost efficiency.

The concentrates are processed to separate out the impurities from the metals with the aid of high temperature reactions. Different processes are used to reﬁne the concentrates at the zinc and copper smelters, respectively. Zinc smelters The zinc process comprises ﬁve general stages including roasting/leaching, as well as puriﬁcation and electrowinning, before the ﬁnished zinc is smelted and cast. Zinc production is more energy-intensive than copper production. 99.995 per cent Metal concentrate Roasting Leaching Puriﬁcation Electrowinning Casting Metal concentrate The concentrate is The calcine is The zinc sulphate The zinc is separated The zinc cathodes from mines usually roasted in a furnace in leached with sulphsolution is puriﬁed out of the solution are smelted in eleccomprises approxiorder to remove the suluric acid in order in three stages to using electrical trical furnaces and mately 50 per cent phur dioxide.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2013 35 Mines Boliden Mines comprises eight mines in four mining areas: Aitik, the Boliden Area and Garpenberg in Sweden, and the Tara mine in Ireland. The Business Area also includes responsibility for exploration, technological development, the environment/reclamation, and sales of mined concentrates. Boliden has developed and reﬁned its mine design, extraction methods and concentration processes over the years. Our in-house expertise in these areas, coupled with a high degree of technology development, means that several of Boliden’s mines have achieved world-class productivity. “Our focus this year has been on our major expansion projects work. The ﬁne-tuning of Aitik’s facilities in order to boost production has gone better than planned and we achieved the 36 Mtonnes of ore produced per year goal one year ahead of plan. The Garpenberg project is proceeding according to plan and is, so far, both on time and within the approved investment sum.” Jan Moström, President, Boliden Mines OPERATIONS | MINES Revenues and operating proﬁt Mines’ operating costs before depreciation fell by 2 per cent to The majority of Mines’ sales are made to the Group’s smelters, SEK 4,924 million (SEK 5,008 m), with a 2 per cent fall in costs with a smaller percentage sold to external smelters.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2013 39 OPERATIONS | MINES Four mining areas and exploration Boliden’s mines mainly extract complex polymetallic ores that contain several different metals, and which consequently impose stricter demands on both mining techniques and the concentration process. Zinc and copper are the most important metals, but the ore also contains gold, silver, lead and tellurium in payable quantities.

The operations are based on a high level of process technology expertise and on the ability to produce high quality metals from complex mined concentrates and recycled raw materials. “Metal production fell during the year, mainly due to the extensive maintenance shutdowns and to process instability at Rönnskär.

The operations have an impact on the surrounding environment and many processes are associated with work environment and safety risks. Boliden works unceasingly to reduce these risks, e.g. through active scenario planning based on a range of different market ﬂuctuations. Operational risks Operational risks are managed by the operating units in accordance with the guidelines and instructions adopted by Boliden at both Business Area and Group level.

The number of accidents resulting in lost time (LTI) in 2013 and involving Boliden’s own personnel increased year on year between 2012 and 2013 and totalled 7.0 (6.6) at the end of the year. The number of accidents including contractors fell slightly to 8.9 (9.1).

The treasury function is tasked with supporting the management and operating units at Parent Company and Group level. This structure ensures good internal risk monitoring and offers both financial and administrative economies of scale. The treasury function is responsible for identifying and efficiently limiting the Group’s financial risks in line with the financial policy adopted by the Board of Directors.

Boliden works actively to risk its payment undertakings due to ensure satisfactory current liquidity by making appropriate use of unutilised credit insufﬁcient liquidity. facilities with marketand operations-adjusted loan durations. The reﬁnancing requirement is reviewed regularly by Boliden’s treasury function. The reﬁnancing requirement is dependent, ﬁrst and foremost, on market trends and investment plans. The loan agreements carry loan covenants which oblige Boliden to comply with certain deﬁned key ratio conditions in order to avoid early repayment. A deterioration in the global economic climate may entail increased risks in respect of proﬁt performance and ﬁnancial position, including the risk of Boliden coming into conﬂict with loan terms and conditions. Boliden has complied with all loan covenants in 2013. The average term of total loan facilities is 2.6 years (3.5 yrs.), which is in accordance with established Group policy. On 31st December 2013, Boliden’s payment capacity totalled SEK 6,356 million (SEK 9,150 m) in liquid assets and unutilised binding credit facilities with a term in excess of one year, less deductions for utilised loans that mature within the space of one year. Boliden has established a cash pool structure that enables it to maintain a central overview of liquidity ﬂows and ensures efﬁcient management of the Group’s overall liquidity. 52 BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2013 | DIRECTORS’ REPORT OPERATIONS | RISK MANAGEMENT Risk Description of risk Management Credit and Credit risks in ﬁnancial operations In order to limit credit and counterparty risk, only highly creditworthy counterparties counterparty The term, credit and counterparty are accepted and, wherever possible, the commitment per counterparty is limited. risk risk, refers to the risk that a counterThese restrictions are laid down in Boliden’s ﬁnancial policy in the form of a lowest party in a transaction may fail to fulﬁl acceptable Standard & Poor’s credit rating of A when the transaction is entered into their obligation, thus causing the and a maximum investment of liquid assets per counterparty.

On 31st December 2013, the credit risk in derivative instruments corresponded to a market value of SEK 500 million (SEK 322 m), which relates to Boliden’s receivables from external counterparties. Offsetting of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities is regulated under ISDA agreements (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) which handles both offsetting between contracted counterparties during day-to-day operations and in conjunction with special circumstances, such as failure to pay. Boliden, during the course of its day-to-day operations, offsets market values in the same currency with a single counterparty that mature at the same time and the excess sum is paid by the party with the biggest liability. In the event of a breach of contract, all outstanding obligations covered by ISDA agreements are terminated in a sum that is paid by the counterparty with the biggest liability.

Control functions exist both reporting operational reporting locally, in individual units, and within Business Areas and at the Head Ofﬁce. All of the functions work within a Group-wide internal control framework for ﬁnancial reporting that is based on COSO. The framework’s controls are tested annually, both internally and by external auditors. The internal tests have also resulted in the transfer of knowledge and experience between departments and units. The operational reporting is followed up and controlled by the Group’s Controller function, which works closely with the local units and Business Areas.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2013 53 Sustainable development Boliden’s mines and smelters create job opportunities and enable society’s development. The minerals and metals that Boliden sells are indispensable components of a modern society. At the same time, the manufacturing processes have an impact on the surrounding environment and many of the stages of these processes are associated with work environment and safety risks. Sustainable development is, therefore, fundamentally a question of process stability for Boliden. Stable processes are vital to productivity and proﬁtability, but they are also key in ensuring the minimum possible impact on people and the environment. Boliden sees no conﬂict between proﬁtability and sustainability: quite the reverse. Boliden’s ambition is to be a respected company in the industry and to exploit the opportunities for growth entailed thereby.
