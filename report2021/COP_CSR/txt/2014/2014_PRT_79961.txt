“Dear Shareholder”, In 2013, EDP´s performance was characterized by a decisive ability to execute, enabling the consolidation of the differentiation strategy pursued in recent years, making it possible to achieve the defined goals. Given the current environment, in which the European energy sector has been impacted by several exogenous factors, including at macroeconomic and fiscal level, it was essential the determination of all of those who dedicate themselves to the success of the Company, such as employees, shareholders, partners and other stakeholders. A challenging and changing sector Since 2008, the year that marked the beginning of a severe economic worldwide crisis, the European energy sector is undergoing a substantial transformation due to imbalances of different origins. These imbalances have altered the foundations of the sector, now perceived to be more instable. This view over the sector has had clear consequences, with the loss of about half of market capitalization of this sector between 2008 and 2013, almost half a trillion euros. In 2013, macroeconomic imbalances continued to have a strong impact on electricity demand, which, despite a slight increase in the 2nd half of the year, remained negative in annual terms in the Iberian Peninsula. This reality has contributed to the increase of the excess capacity in the region, where reserve margins are approximately 40%, thus lowering prices and profit margins. There were also imbalances arising from tax and energy policies set by governments and European authorities, specifically due to the implementation of discretionary taxation, as seen in Portugal and Spain, with the announcement of a special levy applied to the energy sector and various regulatory packages, punitive to the profitability of power companies. Regarding technological imbalances, it is important to mention the fast development of Shale Gas in the United States, the persistence of the impacts of the Fukushima accident and the bets made by some European countries in immature renewable technologies, thus creating the impression that all renewable energies contribute to higher energy prices, something that does not coincide with reality. In order to address the imbalances that exist in the sector, it is necessary a new vision and approach for the future, one that should be implement in the short term. At the European level, the new approach should consider the rebalancing of the carbon market, thereby strengthening the price signal. Likewise, it is important to define a clear and stable framework for 2030 renewable targets. In addition it should take into account that the energy sector is experiencing a new reality, one in which fixed costs are increasingly important, given that a higher proportion of the investment is channeled to renewable energy, where the marginal cost of operating is close to zero. For this reason, the current key factor of competitiveness in the sector is the cost of capital, where less risk means lower cost of capital and where stable and long-term contracting is crucial. This is why we advocate mechanisms of feed-in-tariff and exante auctions as adopted in the UK and Brazil to remunerate renewable capacity. Similarly, we believe in capacity remuneration mechanisms, something that founds resonance in Germany, France and Italy, where such mechanism is used to provide visibility to long term remuneration. Given the above, throughout 2014 we will foster the discussion about the current imbalances strongly impacting the industry and the new market design that should be adopted, in which the investor should not be forced to take more risks than those it controls. A distinctive profile complemented with execution ability In 2013, taking into account the context of major challenges looming, it was essential to have a clear definition of the strategic priorities of the Company, framed within the pillars set in 2006, namely, controlled risk, greater efficiency and focused growth. Thus, three priority areas of action for 2013 were defined: (i) stability of financial results; (ii) reduction of EDP´s Group net debt and (iii) operating costs control. To that extent, it is fair to acknowledge that EDP Group has consistently performed its priorities, anticipating and executing all that was in its power, but not ignoring the external environment and the impact it has had on noncontrollable variables. The EDP Group achieved a gross operating profit of €3.617M, stable compared to 2012, and a net profit of €1.005M (-1 % vs. 2012). Gross operating income for the year was negatively impacted by the Iberian operations (-3%), due to the aforementioned deterioration of demand and margins, regulatory cuts and closure of the Setúbal Plant. These effects were partially offset by an increase in liberalized market activities (+19 %), in particular through the increased hydro production and good energy management. In Portugal, we highlight the success of the market liberalization for residential electricity and gas consumers and the efficient performance of EDP Comercial, which ended the year with approximately 2 million electricity customers and over 200 thousand in gas, representing a leadership position in both markets. It should be noted the positive contribution of EDP Brazil (+24%), despite the negative impact caused by the depreciation of the Brazilian Real, an exogenous factor weighing approximately €100M at EBITDA level and EDP Renewables whose gross operating income grew 1% to €947M, boosted by an increase in installed capacity of 500MW. Additionally, focus on operating costs control allowed to successfully anticipate to 2013 the targets of OPEX III, initially set to 2014, representing a saving of €115M and the maintenance of the OPEX/Gross Margin ratio at 28%. In what regards the evolution of net debt, this year there was a fall of €800M supported by the financial closing of the sale of 49% of EDPR Portugal to CTG agreed in 2012 -, the sale of gas transmission assets in Spain and the sale of over €1.000M of tariff deficit in Portugal, taking advantage of the positive trajectory that international financial markets showed throughout the year. In terms of investment it should be noted that it stood at approximately €1.978M (-2% vs 2012), of which 47 % was in Portugal, given the undergoing construction of five hydro plants. Regarding the financing strategy, 2013 was characterized by a renewed interest in peripheral markets, which coupled with the better risk perception of the Portuguese Republic allowed EDP to obtain financing in the amount of approximately €3.5 billion, covering the financing needs of the company until the end of the first half of 2015. But we were able to achieve even more. Throughout 2013 we managed to create growth options that allow us to look confidently to the future. On one hand, we signed a partnership for the development of the hydro project of São Manoel (700MW), in Brazil, in partnership with our strategic partner China Three Gorges and the Brazilian power company Furnas. EDP was the winner of the last two Brazilian hydro tenders with projects Cachoeira Caldeirão and São Manoel, thus demonstrating its ability to execute in this market. On the other hand, we signed with China Three Gorges the sale of a 50% stake in Brazilian hydro projects Jari and Cachoeira Caldeirão, and a memorandum of understanding for the acquisition by China Three Gorges, in 2015, of a stake in ENEOP. These agreements grant EDP the necessary ability to ensure a balance between growth and deleverage. Also noteworthy, is the fact that EDPR was able to sign long-term contracts for new projects in the U.S. totaling more than 1000 MW – making it the 2nd company with higher growth in that geography in 2013 – thus ensuring a steady growth in the coming years. Preserving a unique and sustained vision… EDP has a clear vision of its role in the society and the relationship with its stakeholders. According to the Principles of Sustainable Development of EDP, we believe in the interconnection of seemingly distinct areas such as economy, culture, art, education, science and social innovation, and it is with the combination of these realities that we maximize our contribution to the society. By organizing two roadshows – in Sao Paulo and Beijing – involving about 60 Portuguese companies and 40 foreign companies, we believe that we are promoting the internationalization of our suppliers and our economy. We should also emphasize the role of EDP Foundation, and the impact of its programs. In 2013 EDP Solidária program supported more than 50 projects, and Parte de Nós Saúde allowed for an investment of approximately €0.9M in the recovery of 4 health centers. We kept our active role in culture, where we displayed 11 exhibitions that have been visited by more than 70 thousand people. We believe that the Center for Arts and Technology, whose construction began in 2013, will be one of the most significant and ambitious cultural initiatives recently developed, particular as a center for innovation and shaping the evolution of Portugal. This is not an act of retribution for the local community but a commitment by the EDP Group in creating better conditions for the future of the community and, consequently, for the future of the company. We believe in the rehabilitation of urban spaces and, within our possibilities, we act towards their development. This is confirmed by the construction of the new Group headquarters in Lisbon, a building that allows the correction of inefficiencies in terms of space and provides unique conditions for work, while lying in a rehabilitation area. Our association to the Global Compact, a United Nations initiative, is yet another commitment where we undertake the development of our business within the framework of 10 principles on human rights, good labor practices, environmental and social practices, and in terms of fighting corruption. Because we have a unique vision and consistently demonstrate the ability to perform, we were voted in 2013 world leaders in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, in the sector of Utilities, a recognition that rewards EDP in several areas excellence in risk management, human capital development, among others. We believe in our integrated approach, differentiation capacity and strong resolve. We are prepared to remain at the forefront of the global energy sector. … As a step to design a successful future In 2013 EDP once again demonstrated its distinctive capabilities, which allowed delivering positive results and providing our shareholders a return rate of 25%, above our European counterparts (17 %). We combine our vision, strategy and execution ability to a commitment for sustainability. We assume before our shareholders a responsible dividend policy distribution, hence the proposal to be presented at the General Shareholders Meeting of €18.5 cents per share, in line with previous years and within the policy defined. Also, it places EDP on the top of the 600 largest companies in Europe, in terms of dividend yield. EDP is the largest Portuguese Group, the largest investor in Portugal and the Portuguese largest foreign investor. We are a group of 12,000 employees of 29 nationalities, present on 4 continents and in 13 countries. We are a success story and we are proud of what we have achieved. We are recognized in many fields such as engineering, finance, ethics, human capital management, environment, communication and social commitment. The stakes are high but we continue to seek more and better results. Only with the support, commitment and dedication of all employees it becomes possible to target the success we want. For this reason, we express our thanks to all. We would also like to take this opportunity to thank to all those that relate to our Company, such as shareholders, customers, suppliers, government agencies, regulators and statutory bodies, particularly the General and Supervisory Board for their support and confidence provided to the team. The year 2014 will be a year marked by more challenges. But acting firmly we are confident that EDP will continue its path of differentiation and leadership.

The strengthening of the monetary policy accommodation’s degree in the main central banks was crucial to achieve that stability, since it reduced the high levels of uncertainty mainly associated with the euro disintegration risk and the destabilisation in the international financial markets. The quieter environment favoured the progressive improvement in the economic activity indicators and the financial assets’ performance in the industrialised economies. This evolution contrasted with the higher debility in the emerging markets. The world GDP has grown at a similar pace as 2012’s (3.0%). Excluding any disruptive event in the financial markets, 2014 may be a year of consolidation of the recovery signs inherited from 2013. This is the leading scenario by most of the observers, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which predicts the rate of global economic growth to rise to 3.7%. Nonetheless, there are risks. The global growth challenges stand largely in the potential adverse effects of the expected phased reduction in the USA Federal Reserve (FED) asset’s purchase program. Moreover, the deceleration anticipated for the Chinese economy, if reinforced, may lead to a downward pressure on global demand. The partial dissipation of the uncertainty, which has been blocking the return to historical growth patterns in the more developed countries since the outbreak of the international financial crisis, was crucial to establish a sustained growth base in these economies during 2013. Indeed, developments such as the end of the US housing market correction, the apparent eradication of the Japanese deflation and the restore of the international Economic Activity community’s confidence in the European currency are suggestive (real GDP) indications of a new cycle of business expansion and employment.

This environment more conducive to risk assets was due to the globally accommodative monetary policies that prevailed and reflected in the appreciation of the major North American, European and Nipponese stock indexes. In opposition, some of the most important indexes in emerging markets had weak or negative performances, because of lower investors’ appetite for such assets. As a side effect, strong currency devaluation emerged in these economies, mainly affecting those with external deficit.

However, the economy’s contraction proved to be more moderated than in 2012. After a sharp drop in the GDP during the first quarter, the following Portugal months delineated a path of recovery for the Portuguese economy, (Real GDP, inflation and unemployment rate) supported by the domestic demand stabilisation and the external 2 0 demand acceleration. Regarding the domestic demand, the 1 evolution is due to the attenuation of the decline in private 0 -1 10 consumption (following the inversion in the downward trend in the -2 -3 family’s disposable income) and by the less unfavourable -4 -5 20 investment performance, particularly the investment in 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q construction, which begins to stabilise after the strong adjustment 2012 2012 2012 2012 2013 2013 2013 2013 framed in the reorientation of productive structure from the nonReal GDP (YoY % change) tradable sector to the tradable sector. Likewise, the shift to Source: Bloomberg Unemployment rate (%) Inflation rate (%) tradable goods and services has been reflected in the export activity’s performance, which accelerated throughout 2013. The progresses achieved in the adjustment process should continue to be favourably reflected on the GDP, which is projected to grow in 2014, for the first time since 2010. The perspectives for recovery of the Portuguese economy, along with favourable conditions in the international financial markets, have contributed to an expressive reduction in the risk premium associated with the Portuguese assets. However, the optimistic scenario in motion is subject to certain risk factors. Domestically, the risks on demand, inherent in the private and public unleveraged route, in addition to the uncertainty about how the Government will fund itself after the end of the Adjustment program, expected to May. In the external environment, the risks are mainly related to a possible deterioration in the financial market conditions and to the slowdown in external demand. In 2014, the consumer price index should raise very moderately, reflecting a framework of low inflationary pressures, both internally due to the structural adjustment program and externally, given the perspectives that the world GDP will grow below its potential. Throughout 2013, the evolution of the Spanish economic situation was constrained again by the need for correction of severe macroeconomic imbalances, accumulated over the last years. Under the financial assistance program for the recapitalisation of the banking sector, several measures aiming the toughening of the credit institutions’ balance sheets were implemented and the process of Spain fiscal adjustment and structural reform carried on. However, (Real GDP, inflation and unemployment rate) despite the progress made, the unemployment rate remained 0 0 above 25% and the degree of restrictive access to credit also -1 10 remained high.

Source: European Comission Concerning the aggregated prices’ evolution, in 2014, it is expected a lower inflation level, as a result of the dissipation of the impact of measures to increase the direct and indirect taxation, the wage moderation framework and vulnerability of domestic demand. After a year of weak growth, the Brazilian economy showed signs of greater dynamism, with a growth of more than 2% in 2013. Although still beneath the historical average of about 3%, the activity’s acceleration was due to the resilience of private consumption, which was supported by the credit and the robust labour market, as well as the performance of the investment, mainly in infrastructures intended to enable the expansion of critical productive sectors, including energy. Although the exports have benefited from the global economy’s stabilisation and the depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the dollar, the strong increase in imports, due to increased domestic demand, particularly investment, together with the fall in commodity prices, resulted in worsening the trade deficit in 2013. Brazil The inflationary pressures arising from the hastening of wages, (Real GDP, inflation and unemployment rate) the credit growth and the rising prices of imported goods within 4 8 a framework of expansionary fiscal policy led the Brazilian Central Bank to dramatically reverse the cycle of reference 3 6 rates’ reduction, which persisted until 2012. 2 4 1 2 The Brazilian financial assets’ performance was largely set by 0 0 the raise of risk aversion in the emerging markets.

In 2014, the IMF predicts that the GDP growth will stabilise below 3%, conditioned by the persistence of structural constraints and by the insufficient external competitiveness of tradable goods. Still, the evolution of business should benefit from the World Cup and the acceleration of the US economy. The expected loss of dynamism in the labour market and the maintenance of a restrictive monetary policy should favour the moderation in inflationary pressures. The upward risk for inflation focuses mainly on the possible depreciation of the Brazilian Real in the event of a higher risk aversion scenario, eventually caused by the reduction in monetary stimulus FED program. In 2013, the US economy has slowed down when compared to the previous year, in a context where the strong tensions on the federal fiscal policy caused a deterioration of the general levels of economic confidence. Nevertheless, the economy activity was sustained by the private consumption’s performance, which benefited from a recovery in labour market, as well as the appreciation in the housing market, while the mortgage interest remained low due to the FED’s accommodative monetary policy. The investment was probably the more dynamic spending component, stimulated by the sustained increase in the load factor, along with the acceleration in the demand addressed to North-American exports. During 2013, despite the FED’s advances and retreats regarding USA the intention to reduce its government securities purchase (Real GDP, inflation and unemployment rate) program, the behaviour of the US financial markets was 4 10 characterised by lower volatility levels and a greater propensity for 8 3 cyclical assets such as stocks.

The main risk to this recovery scenario is in the reaction of the real estate market to the expected gradually reduction of the FED’s assets purchase program, announced in December 2013, which will likely result in rising the interest rates on mortgages. The energy sector is witnessing a deep transformation due to shifting supply and demand patterns. The energy map is redesigned, with demand moving to South/East in emerging countries and supply growing in the West, particularly in the Americas. Despite this transformation requires structural changes at the global energy mix, with relevant impact on the traditional business models, it also encompasses relevant growth opportunities. Additionally, growing environmental concerns will pose significant challenges to ensure sustainability in the years to come. Overcoming these challenges will require a new energy paradigm with high levels of investment supported by a strong technological development and innovation. Demand evolution Supply evolution +70% +75% 2035 +50% vs. 2011 +30% Primary Electricity Natural Renewables Energy Gas Global demand for energy has been consistently increasing, being expected this trend to continue in the medium/long term as a result of economic and population growth. In particular, world’s primary energy demand is estimated to grow by 30%, up to 2035. Regarding final energy demand, electricity is the energy form that should register the highest growth, about 70% up to 2035, as result of increasing urbanization and electricity penetration in new sectors, such as transports. However, this strong growth is not predicted to come from the traditional historical markets but from the developing countries. In this sense, emerging economies are estimated to capture over 90% of the net growth in energy demand until 2035. Demand is expected keep almost constant in OECD countries, given energy efficiency developments will offset the organic growth consumptions. This high demand growth will lead to strong environmental concerns. Being responsible for two-thirds of global Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG), the energy sector will be key to achieve climate change goals. As to mitigate irreversible impacts of climate change, GHG emissions should be reduced, by 2050, to 50% of 1990 levels, strong challenges will arise in ensuring environmental sustainability, something the optimistic scenarios do not ensure. Although the supply of all energy forms is expected to grow in the medium / long term, only renewables and natural gas will grow all over the world. With similar growth in absolute terms, natural gas is expected to increase by 50%, while 75% for renewables, up to 2035. Oil and coal should reduce their weight in the primary energy mix (from 60% to 50%), therefore keeping the highest share. Natural gas consumption increase is the result of strong global energy market dynamics, explained by the recent shale gas technological developments and growing international trade of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). These developments should contribute to an increase of natural gas relative competitiveness, leading to fuel shifting dynamics from traditional fuels to natural gas in the industrial, transport and power sectors. Regarding renewables, growth should be divided between traditional bioenergy and hydro + “new renewables” (wind and solar). Despite strong bioenergy growth, as a result of increasing population in developing countries, its share in the renewables mix is expected to decline from 75% to 60%, up to 2035. Hydro growth should also occur also focused on the developing countries, where there is still significant hydro potential to be explored. In this sense, up to 2035, the “new renewables” are the ones expected to increase their weight in the renewables energy mix, surpassing even the hydro, due to the recent technological revolution with a strong impact on the costs of these technologies. In particular, it is estimated the United States, China and Europe to lead renewables growth, up to 2035. Electricity demand growth will be sustained primarily by two factors: (1) Access to Electricity and (2) Fuel shifting from traditional fuels to electricity. On the supply side, there is an increasing technological innovation across all the value chain – generation, networks and retail. Currently, still about 1.2 billion are without access to electricity (mainly in Africa and Southeast Asia). This is a key issue to be answered in the coming years, through new technology solutions and new business models, to be met by increasingly affordable small scale solar-based solutions. Electricity’s growing consumption vs. traditional fuels is explained by demographic and technological factors. The expected massive urbanisation for developing countries should contribute significantly to change consumption patterns towards an increased use of electricity. Additionally, more substantial use of heat pumps (with higher levels of efficiency) as well as new mobility solutions, based on electrical technologies, should contribute to a growing electrification in developed countries. Technological innovations at the electricity production level are already changing the electricity generation’s mix. In particular, renewables are expected to increase ~6x, up to 2035. Huge technology costs’ decrease is a key driver of renewable growth, which might even change the traditional centralized generation model to new distributed models. In this paradigm each consumer is also generator, and networks operate as batteries for backup and energy flows management. Also at the networks level, information technologies and energy combination is outlining a new world of smartgrids, disruptive compared to traditional systems, where information flows in all directions and energy control is increasingly effective. From the retail side topics such as demand response, energy management, real-time pricing, customer relationship management, will enable better energy systems management. According to the International Energy Agency, the “Global investment in the power sector amounts to $17 trillion through 2035, with over 40% in transmission and distribution networks”. From the consumption side, we have been witnessing strong demand destruction, as a result of the economic crisis, followed by a slow recovery due to energy efficiency. In particular, the new Energy Efficiency Directive, with effect from mid-2014, re-enforce energy savings development, with binding obligations for the Member States. In this sense, some European countries have announced energy efficiency obligation schemes. From the supply side, renewables are continuing their sustainable growth despite some regulatory uncertainties. Reduced demand along with renewables increase has been reducing space for thermal generation, with strong impacts on thermal power load factors. Additionally, low CO2 prices have been promoting electricity generation from coal versus natural gas, reversing European Union’s (EU) decarbonisation path. In December 2013, the European Commission (EC) launched two documents to public consultation, regarding the State Aid Modernization process: “Environmental and energy aid guidelines for 2014-2020” (EEAG) and “General Block Exemption Regulation”. The main topics covered and the more relevant to EDP are the guidelines concerning renewable energy support mechanisms (EC supports market instruments – feed-in-premium or green certificates – and does not consider the feed-in-tariffs to be an adequate tool) and guidelines on capacity mechanisms (seen by the EC as a last resort instrument to ensure the coverage of supply). The consultation closed in February and the documents’ final version is expected to be released in mid-2014. In parallel, the EC opened two detailed investigations on the State Aid, about the payment exemption of renewables’ overcost to the German energy intensive industries and the contract for differences established with EDF to build a nuclear power plant in the UK. Regarding the latter point, this investigation will be an opportunity to demonstrate that the market reform in the UK (EMR: Electricity Market Reform) is essential to attract the investment needed in low-carbon generation at fair prices to consumers. In January 2014, the EC presented the communication “A policy framework for climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030” whose final version should gather consensus among the Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council to be adopted (the negotiating process will last 1-2 years). The EC package of proposals for 2030 contains (1) a European objective of reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions of 40% in 2030, compared to 1990, (2) a goal of a greater share of renewable energy in the EU of at least 27%. (not binding at the member-states level, unlike the 2020’s targets), (3) an eventual objective of energy efficiency defined according to the review of the Energy Efficiency Directive to be concluded later in 2014. The EC also proposes an ETS reform (establishing a reserve mechanism of market stability from 2021) and a new governance system to achieve the energy policies, based on national plans designed by the member-states. A preliminary analysis at these proposals indicates overall positive impacts, although there are still many uncertainties, namely with the renewable energy support mechanisms and with the achievement of the renewables goal, given the inexistence of binding national targets. The European Union’s objectives for 2030 materialise the economic decabornisation strategic goal, which will inevitably have implications in the electricity market design. In this sense, the Aid State directives, currently under review, should give the necessary latitude for the market design to evolve, not crystallizing in energy-only models suitable for the 90s liberalization. Since the management of renewables intermittency is achieved through storage, interconnections and underutilisation of backup thermal plants and the investments in low-carbon technologies is CAPEX intensive (i.e. renewables and nuclear), an evolution to a low-carbon economy leads to a sector increasingly based on fixed costs. Tha current energy-only market models do not allow investments in backup technologies, since it is structurally impossible to recover the fixed costs in marginalist markets. Additionally, several markets have explicit maximum prices (i.e. MIBEL), which prevents spikes in energy prices that are critical to the fixed costs’ recapture. Even when there are not explicit price caps, in practical terms, these very high prices are not politically acceptable (missing money problem). In this context, the current market models require capacity remuneration mechanisms. In an increasingly CAPEX-only world, the key competitive factor is the cost of capital, which may be reduced through risk mitigation mechanisms. However, in the existing scenario, the investor carries a large quantity of risks (regulatory, price, political, economic cycle, etc.) far beyond the ones manageable (construction, operations, funding). Thus, the market design should evolve for long-term stable contracting. Additionally, the increased penetration of high fixed cost technologies further depresses the marginalist price, which ultimately does not remunerate any technology. This effect is already felt nowadays. Recognising this, many European countries complemented their energy markets with payment capacity mechanisms and/or fixed remunerations (such as tariffs). Although some European markets do not require additional capacity in the short-term, particularly in Iberia, it is critical to ensure a positive encouraging environment to boost the medium-term investment and prevent the closure of power plants unprofitable but necessary to guarantee the supply. As a clear evidence of the need for stability to ensure the investment, the new EDF’s nuclear plant in the UK will have a Contract for Differences for 35 years (~£90/MWh). To this effect, it is critical to re-design the current European markets towards a total costs’ market (ex-ante versus ex-post competition). Internationally, the different fuel prices showed distinct dynamics in 2013: x Stabilisation of the oil price (Brent, European index), keeping historical records around USD 110/bbl for three consecutive years x Drop in coal price (APi#2, European index) with the futures market pointing to a fall in price by 2020, largely explained by the excess stock of coal in international markets. This excess of coal is the result of displacement of coal consumption for shale gas in the USA. x Slight increase of natural gas prices (Zeebrugge, European index) maintaining the high prices defferential between Europe and USA (Henry Hub, North-American index). Regarding the CO2, the prices maintained its downward trend, which can be explained by structural oversupply due to demand decrease as a consequence of the economic crisis.

In line with the most European markets, the electricity demand in Iberia also decreased in 2013: +0.2% : smooth increase in Portugal -2.2% : signs of recovery in Spain The high levels of hydro generation index (1.17 in Portugal and Spain) and wind generation index (1.18 in Spain) in 2013 contributed to a significant increase in renewable generation, leading to a sharp reduction in the residual thermal demand and, consequently, in operating coal and natural gas power plants. The low CO2 prices along with the increased competitiveness of coal vs. natural gas promoted the significant increase of coal electricity production instead of natural gas. Reflecting in the fuel and CO2 price evolution, the European wholesale electricity prices have mostly dropped vs 2012. Particularly in the Iberian market (MIBEL), the prices decreased to €44/MWh. The price differential between Portugal and Spain, remained low (-€0.6/MWh), revealing a tight integration already existing between the two markets. The decrease in MIBEL’s electricity price is essentially due to the combination of three factors: (1) decrease in consumption compared to 2012 (-1.8% in Iberia) as a result of the economic downturn and the efficiency measures, (2) decrease of Residual Thermal Demand (about 30%) through the higher hydrological and wind index versus 2012 and (3) the boost of coal generation, during a year with low marginal cost due to the fuel and CO2 cost decline.

Prices for Ic step (annual consumption between 500 and 2.000 MWh) – excludes recoverable taxes. The loss of competitiveness of natural gas led to a drop in natural gas demand in Iberia: -4.9% : continued decline in consumption in Portugal -8,2% : continued decline in consumption in Spain The decrease in the demand was a result of the sharp drop in consumption in the power sector, which represented less than 16% of the total consumption (-17% in Spain and -7% in Portugal). This demand decrease brought the need to deviate high amounts of contractualised natural gas to the international markets, demonstrating a strong flexibility to manage demand distortions. The significant weight of LNG1 in the natural gas supply in Iberia has allowed a great diversification of sources, highlighting Algeria, Nigeria, Qatar, France, Peru and Trinidad & Tobago. The economic crisis has continued to induce a strong pressure from the European Governments to tax the energetic sector through fiscal policies that tend to be discriminatory and distort the regulatory framework. Under the financial adjustment program that Portugal has been subject, the Portuguese Government has launched a series of regulatory packages affecting the energy sector. As a result of the measures approved until the 7th Troika evaluation, the first regulatory package, with effects since 2012, has an estimated impact of approximately two billion euros between 2012 and 2020. In 2013, following the measures determined on the 8th and 9th evaluations, a second regulatory package and an additional tax targeting the Portuguese energy sector were announced. The first, with an expected impact of €1 billion to €1.4 billion from 2014 to 2026 and the second is forecasted to have an impact of about one hundred fifty million euros in 2014. It is estimated that all the regulatory incursions since Troika’s intervention will have an aggregated impact of about €3 billion to €3.5 billion. The second package announced in 2013 includes the following regulatory measures: (1) elimination of market distortion caused by tax measures introduced in Spain through the payment of electricity injected into the grid (€3/MWh at peak and €2/MWh off-peak), (2) incentives for cost efficiency in the tariff harmonization mechanism applicable to the autonomous regions, (3) revision in hydro land remuneration, (4) correction of distortions in the ancillary services market as well as (5) the contribution on coal power plants to the National Electric System. The extraordinary contribution of the energy sector is translated in a 0.85% tax on the electricity, oil and natural gas sectors’ fixed tangible and intangible assets. Exceptions are applied to CCGTs with less than 2,000 hours/year of use, hydro plants with capacity lower than 20MW, wind plants, as well as power plants with licenses awarded through competitive tender procedures or consultation. Throughout 2013, the Spanish Government also announced several regulatory restructurings aiming to reduce the tariff deficit. These measures aim to reduce the deficit, which was created by the Spanish Government energy policies, the electric sector agents, the customers and the State. Major regulatory measures in this package, applicable to the sector’s companies are: (1) reducing the transmission and distribution assets rate of return from around 8% to 6.5%, (2) cut in the investment incentive from €26thousand/MW/year to €10thousand/MW/year, (doubling the remaining incentive period), (3) change in Special Regime Generation remuneration to pool plus a complement to guarantee a 7.5% fixed return (before tax) and (4) subsidized tariff for vulnerable customers, to be supported by the companies. Additionally, the customers had an increase of 6.5% in the access tariff (+3.2% of total energy tariff), while the State contributed to the extra-peninsular overcost. 1 LNG: Liquified Natural Gas In 2013, according to the Global Wind Energy Council (“GWEC”) 35.5GW of new wind capacity were installed. China remains the main driver of global growth by adding 16.5GW, nearly half of the total global new wind capacity, and reached 91GW of installed capacity. According to the European Wind Energy Association (“EWEA”), 11.1GW were installed in the European Union during 2013, bringing the total installed capacity in the region to 121GW, while based on the American Wind Energy Association (“AWEA”) only 1.1GW were installed in the US reaching a total installed capacity of 61GW. In the European Union the total wind capacity by the end of 2013 amounted to 117.3GW and the electricity generated covered 8% of electricity demand. The year was marked by an increase in offshore technologies. An annual addition of 11.1GW, according to EWEA, represents a year over year decrease of 8%. The lower growth rate is a reflection of the regulatory and political uncertainty in some European markets. However, despite the slowdown in yearly additions, wind power was the technology which installed the most, accounting for 32% of the new additions. The new installations were mainly concentrated in two countries, Germany (3.2GW) and the UK (1.9GW), with an increasing presence in offshore wind. Germany continues to lead the European market in terms of installed capacity. Rounding out the top 5 are Poland (894MW), Sweden (724MW) and Romania (695MW). EDPR is well positioned in several of these top markets. Traditional large markets of Spain, Italy and France saw their rate of new wind projects decrease in 2013, by 84%, 65% and 24% respectively, where regulatory changes in Spain drove the significant decline. The offshore market in Europe had a record year in terms of new installation by adding an additional 1.6GW, representing a 34% increase from 2012. For the year, Europe reach 6.6GW of offshore wind installed capacity spread through 11 countries with UK alone adding 733MW, strengthening its worldwide offshore leadership, followed by Denmark (350MW), Germany (240MW), Belgium (192MW) and Sweden (48MW). Uncertainty regarding the extension of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) led to a dramatic 92% decrease in installed capacity to 1.1GW in the United States. However, once the extensions were received, a flurry of construction activity ensued resulting in a record 12GW of new projects under construction by year end, according to AWEA. 2014 will be a solid year for growth as these projects come online. For the rest of the region, Canada installed 1.6GW of wind additions, including EDPR’s first project with 30MW, while in Mexico 623MW were added. Latin America was strongly represented by Brazil, another EDPR market, as it installed 948MW, followed by Chile (130MW), and Argentina (76MW). The renewable energy market is a growing and increasingly competitive arena which should continue to do well as investment costs decline and regulatory and general support is achieved. Brazil is one of the world’s largest markets, with a GDP of about USD 2.5 trillions 2 in 2012 and a population of 196 million inhabitants, 84% concentrated in the northeast, southeast and south regions. A significant private and public investment growth has been occurring in the last years and it is estimated to carry on through the next years. The preparation for the major sports events, as the World Cup (2014) and the Olympics (2016), as well as the potential for oil exploitation in the Brazilian shore (pre-salt), the expansion and qualification of the logistic infrastructure have provided and will continue to provide high investments and diversified development opportunities. The growth context in the Brazilian market ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE GRID (TWh) contributed to the energy consumption behavior in 2013. In Brazil, the total energy +3.9% 448 464 consumption3 reached 463,740GWh, 3.5% 433 416 above the previous year. Emphasis on the 377 388 384 344 356 performance of the residential and 330 commercial classes, with an increase of 6.1% and 5.7% in 2013, respectively, compared to 2012. Over the last 10 years, the average growth of electricity consumption was 3.9% per year. 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Source: EPE 2 Source: WMF, MME 3 Source: EPE The electricity power generation in Brazil in 2013 corresponded to 129GW, with a generation mix consisting of 69% hydro, 15% thermal, 14% other renewables and 2% nuclear sources. This energy generated incorporates the National Interconnected System (SIN), which covers 98% of the Brazilian market and is essentially characterised by the existence of large reservoirs, hydroelectric projects and long transmission lines. According to the Ten Year Energy Expansion Plan 2022 (PDE 2022), the electricity demand will grow 4% per year in the next 20 years, reaching more than 93GW of demand in 2023. To meet this growing demand, it will be necessary a 52GW expansion in the installed capacity until 2022. To achieve that goal, it is planned an auction for more than 26GW in generation infrastructures during the next years, 13GW of renewable sources and small hydroelectric power plants, 10GW of hydroelectric power plants and 3GW of gas power plants. ANNUAL INSTALLED CAPACITY INCREASE BY SOURCE (MW) Contracted Expansion Planned Expansion 12,000 12,000 10,000 10,000 36,756MW 26,605MW 8,000 8,000 6,000 6,000 4,000 4,000 2,000 2,000 0 0 -2,000 -2,000 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Diesel Oil Fuel Oil Mineral Coal Natural Gas Uranium Other Renewables Hydro Source: PDE 2022 From the planned expansion in the chart above, there should be subtracted the hydro plant São Manoel, already auctioned in 2013, and added to the expansion contracted, thus reaching 37,456MW. With the growth in new generation assets, it is simultaneously predicted the transmission grid expansion in about 48.3 thousands km, which represents around 45% of network extension, comparing with the infrastructure existent in 2013. According to the PDE 2022, the energy efficiency and the penetration of distributed generation by the final consumers will contribute to reduce the need for expansion of centralised generation in SIN. The self-generation and the solar energy distributed will enable to discharge around 117TWh of energy requested to the grid in 2022. It is estimated that 98% of this energy will be generated in large systems, installed in industries such as steel generation, pulp and paper, chemical, refining, sugar production and alcohol, among others, and the commercial sector. The remaining amount of 1.9TWh (equivalent to 219MWa) in 2022 is due to the integration of solar photovoltaic generation systems in the residential and commercial classes. The year 2013 was characterised by significant changes in the Brazilian electricity sectors’ regulatory scenario. In September 11, 2012, the Federal Government introduced the Provisional Measure n. 579/2012, which establishes measures to reduce about 20% of the electric energy tariff in all the Brazilian regions. The measures adopted to achieve this reduction comprised the anticipated renewal of generation and transmission concessions maturing between 2015 and 2017 (many electricity producers did not adhere to the concessions’ extension) and the reduction or extension of sectorial fees – the fuel Consumption Account and the Global Reversion Reserve were extinguished and the Energy Development Account (CDE) was reduced by 75%. The consequence of these measures and the marked frustration in 2013’s auctions (A-1 Auction and Adjusts Auction) led to decontracting the distributors and, consequently, to the involuntary exposure to short-term energy market. This scenario was complemented by the adverse climate conditions, with low rainfalls in the country, which contributed to increase the Settlement Price of Differences (PLD) and to the dispatch of thermal power plants outside the order of merit. Cumulatively, these facts generated a reduction in corporate cash amounts, which created the need for an extraordinary contribution from the CDE and the Treasury. EDP has strengthened its management structures, focusing on stakeholder relations and strengthening internal procedures through the implementation of cross-company methods such as ComPro – the communication of projects to local stakeholders. The EDP Executive Board of Directors approved a Stakeholder Segmentation Model in 2013, which is intended to standardise the identification and management of EDP’s stakeholders. This Model considers four segments: x Value Chain x Market x Democracy x Social and Territorial Environment This model maps EDP’s key stakeholders. The mapping criteria considers: nature (public, private, and social/non-government); territorial (local, regional, national and supranational); and segmentation (generation and distribution chain, value chain, markets, public policy and to the regulation). Finally, it also considers organisation, influence and decisionmaking of Stakeholders in the EDP´s corporate model. EDP believes that the engagement of stakeholders in the governance model is more than just good business practice – it creates and distributes value to all stakeholders, and therefore contributes to a more cohesive society, and comprises a lever of competitiveness impacting on the performance of the company itself. EDP joined the Reprisk platform in 2013. This sustainability rating agency specialises in the identification, description and valuation of the reputational risks of each company in terms of environmental, social and management impact. Reprisk collects and analyses news, events, criticism and controversy about companies, their products, activities and projects, using the information conveyed by the media as the staring point. The platform had under observation at year’s end 38,840 companies, 9,240 projects, 6,294 NGOs and 5,362 governmental structures. The ratings established by Reprisk allow EDP access to key information for assessing its exposure to risk in terms of countries, markets, sectors and companies. The platform also allows EDP to conduct a comprehensive benchmark with other utilities. http://www.reprisk.com This principle underlies the approval by the EDP Executive Board of Directors of a Stakeholder Relations policy in 2013, based on four guiding commitments: Understand, Communicate, Trust and Collaborate. We dynamically and systematically identify the stakeholders that influence and are influenced by the Company, and we analyse and try to understand their expectations and interests in the decisions that directly impact them. We are committed to promoting two-way dialogue with Stakeholders through informational and consultation initiatives. We listen, inform and respond to stakeholders in a consistent, clear, accurate and transparent manner, aiming to build close, strong and long-lasting relationships. We believe that fostering a climate of trust with our stakeholders is crucial to establishing stable and long term relations. Our relations with stakeholders are based on values such as transparency, integrity and mutual respect. It is our ambition to collaborate with Stakeholders to build strategic partnerships that bring together and share knowledge, skills and tools, thus promoting the creation of shared value in a differentiating manner. Several initiatives were undertaken by EDP with relevant stakeholders during 2013, namely: Corporate Initiatives: x Round of Conversations with Stakeholders This initiative began last year and was continued this year. Its aim is to promote discussion between the macrostructure of EDP and external guests on materially significant issues. Two rounds were held in 2013: with the National Association of Portuguese Municipalities and with Professor Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. x Conference by António Mexia at Lisbon Technical University (IST) – The CEO took part in this initiative of IST, aimed at students and professors, as part of the conference series in Portuguese universities. The debate focused on the strategic vision in the energy sector in Portugal. x Visit by the Economic and Public Works Committee to Alqueva – The aim was to discover more about this hydro project of EDP and promote open and ongoing dialogue with this relevant stakeholder. x Consultation with External Stakeholders– An annual process involving various groups of stakeholders, including Local Government, Universities, Business Associations, Suppliers, Members of Parliament and of the European Parliament, in order to discover their expectations, relevant issues and opinions on relations with EDP and its performance. x Consultation with Internal Stakeholders Systematic update of mapping of stakeholders, relevant and critical topics of the EDP Group. x Meetings of the Stakeholders’ Management CommitteeInitiative intended to promote reflection and debate on the key challenges in relations with EDP’s stakeholders and to subsequently establish a plan of action. Throughout this report several operational initiatives are described, highlighting the relationship with the different segments of stakeholders. For further information: www.edp.pt> sustainability> stakeholdersEDP promotes stakeholder engagement through continuous participation processes, using various communication channels depending on the specific nature of the target audiences. This ongoing dialogue with EDP’s most significant stakeholders (through meetings, discussion rounds with the company macrostructure, questionnaires, consultations in-person, partnerships and other interactions) identifies the most relevant topics for the different segments mentioned above. The conclusions of consultations organised by EDP with its stakeholders in 2013 are: x Value Chain segment: tends to focus on the following topics as critical issues: tariffs and energy Prices, composition of the electricity bill, climate change (namely promoting energy efficiency in consumption), and innovation (specifically concerning smart grids). x Market Segment: Critical issues are deemed to be financial sustainability issues (such as debt, the macroeconomic context, and the EDP Group strategy) and the regulatory framework. x Democracy segment: identifies the most relevant topics as: Demand side management, investment in renewable energy, tariffs and energy price (namely the tariff deficit). x Territorial and Social Organisation: places particular emphasis on topics such as public lighting, demand side management, investment in renewable energy, and tariffs and energy prices (in particular the tariff deficit). 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP MATERIALITY MATRIX ('3JLYHQWKHLPSRUWDQFHRILGHQWLI\LQJPDWHULDOLVVXHVGXHWRWKHLQIOXHQFHWKH\KDYHRQWKHGHFLVLRQV DFWLYLWLHVDQGSHUIRUPDQFHRIDQRUJDQLVDWLRQDQGLWVVWDNHKROGHUVDQQXDOO\XSGDWHVWKHVHLVVXHVDQGSULRULWLVHV WKHPDFFRUGLQJWRUHOHYDQFHDQGPHDQLQJ 7KH('3*URXSPDWHULDOLW\PDWUL[LQFOXGHVWKHLVVXHVFRQVLGHUHGWREHUHOHYDQWIRUVRFLHW\DQGIRUWKHEXVLQHVV DFFRUGLQJWRWKH$FFRXOWDELOLW\¶VVWDQGDUGV 7KH³UHOHYDQWIRUVRFLHW\´DUPLQFRUSRUDWHVWKHIROORZLQJDQDO\VLVUHJXODWLRQEHQFKPDUNLQWHUQDWLRQDOVWXGLHV (6* HQYLURQPHQWDOVRFLDODQGJRYHUQDQFH LQYHVWRUVXUYH\VDQGDVFHUWDLQLQJWKHH[SHFWDWLRQVRIWKHGLIIHUHQW ('3VWDNHKROGHUVWKH³UHOHYDQWIRUEXVLQHVV´DUPZDVHYDOXDWHGEDVHGRQLQWHUYLHZVZLWKPDQDJHUVDQG VXSHUYLVLQJRIILFHUVRIGLIIHUHQWDUHDVRI('3 38 NEVERENDING ENERGY  7KLVPDWUL[VXSSRUWVWKHSUHSDUDWLRQRIWKHDQQXDOUHSRUWERWKLQWKHGHILQLWLRQRILWVLQGH[DQGWKHVHOHFWLRQRI WKHFRQWHQW6LPXOWDQHRXVO\LVXVHGWRVXSSRUW('3¶VDJHQGDIRUVXVWDLQDELOLW\)XUWKHULQIRUPDWLRQRQWKH SURFHVVFDQEHIRXQGLQWKHDQQH[ SDJH   At the Investors Day held in May 2012, EDP presented its strategic agenda for 2012-2015, marked by the beginning of a new cycle, which will focus on cash-flow generation and on the creation of new growth opportunities. In this event, EDP highlighted the appropriateness of the 2006 defined strategy and presented the following priorities for the period of 2012-2015: Controlled Risk: x Proactive management of the legal/regulatory agenda, keeping EDP’s unique low risk business profile; x Competitive refinancing and accelerated deleveraging ensuring the increase of cash-flow generation; Superior Efficiency: x Focus on opex and capex efficiency creating sustained long-term growth opportunities; Focused Growth: x Growth oriented to value creation, ensuring a stable and attractive shareholders’ return. Transversely to its strategy, the successful execution of the strategic partnership established at the end of 2011 with China Three Gorges (CTG), the biggest Chinese clean energy group, was also defined as a priority to EDP. Under this partnership, not only CTG will invest €2 billion until 2015 in stakes in renewable energy projects but it also has a strong funding commitment by a Chinese financial institution with EDP, at a corporate level, by an amount of up to €2 billion.

In Iberia, the focus has been in the measures proposed by regulators on both sides of the borders to fight the tariff deficit and in the fiscal changes in Portugal. EDP has assumed a proactive position, contributing to solutions that aim the system’s sustainability. In Brazil, EDP has followed attentively the search for regulatory solutions that allow the regular electricity distribution activity’s development, in a context of high purchase prices as a result of the unfavourable hydrological regime in the last two years. The regulatory impacts, the energy purchase price volatility in Brazil and the Brazilian Real depreciation in the last two years have been penalizing the earnings’ growth, which stand below the goals defined on May 2012. Nevertheless, EDP maintains a clearly distinctive low risk profile, expressed both in the weight of 90% of regulated activities in 2013, higher than the Business Plan target (85%) and in the 69% of renewable installed capacity, close to the 2015’s target of 70%. The low risk profile has enabled EDP to mitigate the previous negative impacts. In the competitive refinancing and accelerated deleveraging some decisive steps were taken during 2013. Although the target of Adjusted Net Debt/EBITDA of 3.0x is now more difficult to achieve mainly due to the regulatory and fiscal impacts, by the end of 2013 were concluded asset sales amounting to €1.5 billion, including agreements with CTG and other minority interest sales in wind farms. Also during 2013, EDP management announced the 2014 and 2015 investment target reduction from €2 billion/year to €1.7 billion in 2014 and €1.5 billion euro in 2015 and sold more than one billion euros of tariff deficit in Portugal. Regarding funding, EDP issued about €3 billion of new debt during 2013, which allowed to lengthen the maturity profile and cover most of the funding needs until the end of 2015. In a period of great uncertainty, the focus on the Opex and Capex efficiency has been a constant, attested by the successfully anticipation of OPEX III efficiency program results. The €120 million of savings in 2013, allowed not only to achieve the year’s goal but also to anticipate the €115 million of savings for 2014. Regarding the Capex, there was a significant effort to reduce the value invested in relation to EBITDA, explicitly with a ratio of about 55% in the last two years and converging with the defined goal to the 2012-2015 average of 50%. The savings verified by the centralised procurement had also a decisive contribution (€207M in 2013). In terms of growth oriented to value creation, after entry into service of Alqueva’s repowering in 2012, there are 5 new hydroelectric power plants in construction in Portugal Baixo Sabor, Foz Tua, Ribeiradio/Ermida, Venda Nova III and Salamonde IIwith a total capacity of more than 1,400MW to be installed until 2016. Also during 2013, about 500MW of wind capacity were installed by EDP Renováveis. In Brazil, continued the construction of Jarí hydroelectric power plant (373MW) and started the construction works in Cachoeira Caldeirão hydroelectric power plant (219MW), backing a 68% investment in renewables in 2013, above the 60% goal defined in the Business Plan period. In achieving the goal of creating growth opportunities, during 2013, EDP signed long-term energy sale contracts matching 1,200MW in wind projects in the USA and 409.5MW for hydroelectric power plant São Manoel in Brazil, with start of operation scheduled to 2018 in a partnership with Companhia Furnas Centrais Eléctricas. EDP has complied with its dividend distribution policy (payout ratio between 55% and 65%, with a minimum value of €18.5c per share), since the unitary dividend distributed in the last two years was €18.5c . The execution of the partnership with CTG has also been a strategic management priority, with emphasis on the following facts: x The sale of a 49% stake in EDP Renováveis Portugal was concluded in June 2013 with a final global price of €368 million; x The agreement to sell a 50% stake in Cachoeira Caldeirão hydroelectric power plant to CTG for a price equivalent to the costs incurred by EDP Brasil and assuming a future co-investment commitment with and estimated value of BRL 294 million; x The agreement to sell a 50% stake in Jarí hydroelectric power plant to CTG for BRL 490 million and assuming a future co-investment commitment with an estimated value of BRL 81 million; x The agreement to sell to CTG 49% of the ENEOP consortium in 2015; x Finally, in 2014, the agreement to sell to CTG a 33.3% stake of the company owning the development rights for São Manoel hydroelectric power plant. These operations symbolize a significant progress in the strategic partnership, in particular by providing perceptibility to the target of one billion euros in CTG investments until the end of 2013. Along the defined strategy, EDP develops a corporate culture of continuous consolidation of employees’ ethical values and of sustainability performance excellence, maintaining five lines of action for the period 2012-2015: x Improve attractiveness and talent retention as well as ensure employee’s motivation, on a phase of high renewal of employees; x Strengthen the safety management mechanisms and promote the well-being of employees and service providers; x Improve listening with stakeholders by collecting expectations and taking into account its consideration towards the company’s strategy; x Extend to the several stakeholders the application of tools that gather expectations, optimizing this way its consideration towards the company’s strategy; x Promote a proper management of long-term challenges to where the company will be exposed, by investing in R&D and Innovation. The following chapter summarizes the status of EDP commitments, and specifies the objectives and future goals associated to the achievement of the strategic agenda and aligned with the Principles of Sustainable Development of the Group, demonstrating this way the company’s commitment to meet its challenges. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP 42 NEVERENDING ENERGY EDP has been progressively consolidating its ethics “It is my belief that the success of EDP is performance management system in order to ensure: based on relationships of trust which we have learned to establish with all our x A high degree of individual ethical awareness; stakeholders, over time. These x Minimising the risk of bad ethical practices; and relationships are certainly an important part of our heritage, today.” x Maintaining a culture that generates transparency, trust and responsibility for the consequences of decisions and acts. António Mexia Significant developments occurred during 2013, which are summarised in this report and detailed in the published CEO Annual Report of the Ethics Ombudsman (www.edp.pt> edp> corporate governance> ethics) EDP Code of Ethics sets out the ethical principles and limits of EDP operations anywhere in the world as well as the commitments it makes to stakeholders. The EDP Code of Ethics was revised in 2013. It had last been revised in 2005. The aim of the revision was to clarify these principles and commitments, detail certain topics that have, in the meantime, acquired special relevance for the business and standardise them in the context of the Group’s various business units’ operation. This revision was approved by the General and Supervisory Board in the last quarter of 2013. Its extensive disclosure among internal and external stakeholders will occur during 2014. The topic of business ethics was included, as planned, in the induction training provided to new employees admitted in 2013. A specific training/awareness raising module was developed with the active participation of the Ethics Ombudsman. The preparation of the training/awareness raising of suppliers underwent a change of schedule, and its implementation is envisaged during 2014. EDP continued to support the AESE/EDP Ethics in business and society” chair, forming part of the advanced courses and Master’s degree courses organised by different educational institutions. This chair allows EDP to share its knowledge and experience in the field of business ethics. EDP actively participated in the gestão transparente.org” [transparent management.org] initiative in 2013, which is now available in english to strengthen its dissemination along the supply chain. The Practical Guide to Managing the Risk of Corruption aims to build the capacity of businesses and organisations to assess the risks of corruption in business contexts and promote best practices for transparency. The external assessment and benchmarking of the maturity of EDP’s ethical performance management system gave the maximum score for Prevention of bribery on the FTSE4Good index, while maintaining a position of note in the Codes of Conduct/Compliance/Corruption and bribery criteria of the Dow Jones Sustainability indices. A Cooperation Protocol was concluded with the Applied Economics and Management Studies Centre of the Portuguese Catholic University, with the aim of supporting the improvement of EDP’s ethical performance management system and to report on and disseminate good practices in business ethics. This protocol has a medium-term perspective (2013-2015) and it reinforces articulation between the Company and the University in an area of great importance for both corporate management and also for higher education teaching. EDP was included on the list of the World’s Most Ethical Companies” in 2013, for the second consecutive year, following the assessment conducted by the Ethisphere Institute of the USA. In the comparative analysis with the previous year, the indicator of the maturity of EDP’s ethical performance management system calculated by this institution shows an increase of about 15%, which is significantly higher than the average for listed companies in the same period. EDP Brasil has also maintained the Ethical Seal awarded by the General Comptroller’s Office, since 2011. It will undergo renewal assessment in 2014. EDP published the Annual Ethics Ombudsman’s Report for the first time in 2013. This report seeks to make a significant contribution to increasing transparency as regards the integrity and ethical quality of the management decisions and actions of Group employees and, ultimately, to raise the confidence deposited in the company by different stakeholders (further information at www.edp.pt> about edp> corporate governance> ethics> ethics ombudsman). EDP established a Corporate Ethical Performance Index (Ethicis) in 2013, as set out in the Rules of the Code of Ethics. The value for 2013 will provide the benchmark for assessing progress and planning improvements in this field. More information on the Ethicis Index is available at www.edp.pt> about edp> corporate governance> ethics COMPLAINS SUBMITTED TO ETHICAL COMMITTEE, BY 185 complaints were recorded in 2013 in the ORIGIN (No.) Group’s different ethics complaints 13 communication channels (a decrease of 11% 10 from 2012). 60% of all recorded complaints 8 originated in Portugal, with 7% originating in 7 Spain and 33% in Brazil. 5 5 5 4 3 Only 35 of these complaints gave rise to 2 proceedings submitted to the Ethics Committee of EDP, in accordance with the regulations Costumer Citizen Employee Supplier Anonymous (standard proceedings). All the other 2012 2013 complaints were expeditiously processed by the business units involved as they were not COMPLAINS SUBMITTED TO ETHICAL COMMITTEE, BY ISSUE considered to be of significant ethical (No.) dimension. 15 The number of standard proceedings opened in 2013 increased by about 30% from the 11 11 10 previous year. An analysis of the source of these proceedings 5 4 shows that Customers are the most significant 3 source (37%) closely followed by employees 1 1 1 0 0 (23%). This result is a reversal of the order of Equity of Negligence or Transparency Use of Environment Fraud, the previous year, possibly due to the solutions disrespect information or and corruption and acceleration of the energy market liberalisation heritage responsibility bribery towards society process in Portugal. 2012 2013 ACTION SET BY THE ETHICAL COMMITTEE As regards the classification of the complaint subjects, the categories equity of solutions (about 43%) and negligence or disregard (31%) are still the most significant of all complaints submitted to the Ethics Committee. 27 complaint proceedings were terminated in 2013, resulting in the following decisions of the Ethics Committee: 18 were considered upheld (67%); 7 were unfounded (26%); and 2 were inconclusive (7%). 29% 47% The action taken following the appraisal of these proceedings is primarily addressed at the review and improvement of procedures and the training/capacity building of employees or suppliers. A significant number of actions classified as other are also recorded. This “other” category 15% includes: monitoring the performance of processes, assessing the effectiveness of initiatives, reporting to criminal investigation authority, etc. 6% It is expected that the implementation of the action defined by the Ethics Committee and the initiatives planned for the communication of the new 3% EDP Code of Ethics and the training/awareness raising addressed at Revisions/improvements of proceedures employees and suppliers that will occur in 2014 may contribute to the Compensation for damages improvement of the Group’s ethical performance, in accordance with the Disciplinary action Disqualification ou contract penalties application management objectives established for this area.

In terms of mitigation, the stand-out fact in 2013 on the supply side is the increase in the installed capacity of hydroelectric, wind and solar energy power stations (more 435 MW).EDP has also been promoting initiatives to improve energy efficiency and enhance the provision of energy services on the demand side. SPECIFIC CO2 EMISSIONS (tCO2/MWh) AND REDUCTION TARGETS In terms of adaptation, EDP has been increasing the resilience of processes and assets to extreme weather conditions 0.60 0.48 0.46 The market factors that limited the energy sector 0.39 0.36 0.32 0.29 performance in 2013 (see page 29), combined with 0.24 0.28 favorable weather conditions for the operation of 0.12 hydroelectric and wind energy power stations, particularly on the Iberian Peninsula, led to the overall 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 improvement of the energy and environmental Target 2020 performance of supply of the EDP Group compared to Real Corrected with IPH=1 2012: strong increase in generation from renewable sources and reduction of absolute and specific CO2 emissions. The allocation of emissions allowances for the 2013-2020 period began to be partially made in auction, in accordance with Directive 2009/29/EC, which regulates the 3rd phase of the EU ETS European Emission Trading System. In the case of the EDP Group, the power stations covered by the EU ETS produced 16.6 Mton of CO2 in 2013, which is an 8% decrease compared to 2012. Overall specific emissions fell from 0.323 tCO2/MWh in 2012 to 0.276 tCO2/MWh in 2013, due to the strong increase in generation from renewable origin. EDP continued with the same strategy of CO2 portfolio management as that adopted in previous years for coverage of exposure through the use of allowances and also carbon credits acquired in both the primary market and secondary market, minimising its exposure to market risk. Moreover, EDP has been promoting voluntary CDM projects (Clean Development Mechanism), particularly in Brazil. The Carbon Disclosure Project is a project that has become a global benchmark in business reporting of direct and indirect CO2eq emissions. EDP scored 97/100 in 2013 in terms of reporting and a B grade in performance, achieving the best score for reporting in Portugal and the fourth best in the universe of world electricity utilities. The document is annually published in November in www.cdp.net and can be consulted afterwards on www.edp.pt> sustainability> environment> climate change> carbon disclosure project. The table shows the direct (scope 1) and indirect (scope 2 and 3) emissions, broken down by categories and calculated according to the methodology defined in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. The EDP Group calculated scope 3 emissions for the first time in 2013, through the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard of the Protocol, which defines a methodology for evaluating indirect emissions caused by the activity of the company upstream and downstream. The application of this new methodology resulted in a substantial increase in the value of scope 3 emissions reported in 2012, from 1.4 MtCO2eq to 24.9 MtCO2eq, due to the inclusion of all materially relevant categories under this Protocol (see table). Scope 3 emissions in 2013 decreased to 17.8 MtCO2eq, mainly due to the lower acquisition of power to other companies for distribution. CO2 eq.

It added approximately 435 MW of renewable energy production to its portfolio in 2013, which totalled 15,716 MW from renewable sources at the end of the year. The fact that 2013 was particularly favourable on the Iberian Peninsula in terms of hydrological and wind values also contributed to a strong increase in electricity generation from renewable sources: 41.7 TWh in 2013, compared to 33.1 TWh in 2012. The use of renewable energy sources for electricity generation in the EDP Group has the environmental benefit of avoiding the use of fossil fuels to produce the same energy and hence reduce Green House Gases emissions. The strategy of investing in renewable sources in recent years has led to a progressive increase in CO2 emissions avoided, defined as emissions that would have occurred if the electricity of renewable origin had been produced in conventional thermoelectric power stations. Around 31.7 million tons of CO2 were avoided in 2013, 44% up on 2012 (more information in page 25). The above-stated circumstances would also lead to a Certification of the Energy Management significant improvement of the electricity generated /primary System energy ratio, compared with 2012 and despite the increased EDP Espanha obtained the certification of the use of coal-fired power stations compared to natural gas integrated Energy Management System and combined cycle power stations. This improvement of the ratio Environmental Management System, increased the overall efficiency of the EDP Group power according to ISO 50.001 standard in the stations. head office at Oviedo.

ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENTS AND EXPENSES 1% 2% 40% Environmental expenditure and investment amounted to EUR 101,481,000, 19% up 26% compared to 2012. The increased investment is mainly focused on the generation activity and in particular environmental minimisation and offsetting measures arising from new hydroelectric projects in Portugal. A detailed breakdown by environmental item is provided in section 52, page 285. The company also incurred costs with fines and other penalties for noncompliance with environmental law in 2009, about EUR 236,000, in part explained by a failure to meet air pollution limits and effluent quality at the Sines power station and mainly due to compensations for spills that 38% occurred in 2012 in Aboño powerplant.

EDP has defined a Biodiversity Policy since 2007, which sets out its management practices aimed at achieving an overall positive balance between the negative impacts associated with its operations and the measures it fosters and implements to minimise, offset and support the development of scientific knowledge. It annually publishes a biodiversity report, highlighting a number of ongoing initiatives. This report is available at www.edp.pt> sustainability> environment> biodiversity. Biodiversity is generally addressed in business operations in the certified environmental management systems. In the design and/or construction of new generation centres, in particular hydroelectric plants in Portugal and in Brazil, the focus is on minimising and offsetting the impact on biodiversity. The impacts mainly arise from the areas to be flooded, the physical barriers to be built and the substantial alteration from flowing water to standing water, creating changes and new ecosystem equilibriums. The construction of new wind farms is also closely monitored, especially the impact on birdlife and bat populations and the disturbance of habitats that have previously been those most protected by Mankind. In Brazil, the hydroelectric power plants are located in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest and Scrublands biomes, which are considered biodiversity hot spots due to their ecological sensitivity, additional effort in close monitoring is required given the high degree of endemism and danger of extinction of species. We highlight, in 2013, the hydroelectric power plants that follows: This plant, located on the Special Protection Site and Zone of the Rivers Sabor and Maçãs Natura 2000 Network – was the focus of a wide range of mitigation, offsetting and long-term monitoring measures. Most of the actions defined in those measures were implemented in 2013 and are at an advanced state of conclusion. EDP was able to rely on the independent technical and scientific consultancy of CIBIO Biodiversity and Genetic Resources Study Centre, Porto University, to ensure the ecological effectiveness of the measures to be implemented. CIBIO monitored the advance of the construction work (see highlighted box). The following initiatives are to be highlighted in this year: Technical-Scientific Consultancy Agreement x Flora and habitat: planting and increasing the density of local species (holm oak/zimbral and riparian EDP established a scientific and technical vegetation) over about 270 ha, and specific interventions in consultancy agreement with CIBIO -UP surrounding areas with priority habitats to protect them and (Biodiversity and Genetic Resources Study reduce fire hazards, over an area of approximately 600 ha.

The aim is to x Fauna: creation and improvement of shelters for enhance the effectiveness of the biodiversity important species of bats; improving the habitat of the conservation measures on the regional scale in Iberian wolf through the promotion of natural prey, reducing the context of sustainable environmental and human disturbance and reducing conflict with local socio-economic development for the local populations; improving the habitat of rupiculous birdlife, and populations.

Rare or endangered of extinction species. EDP also contributes 3.0% of the average annual net generation value to the Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Fund (a public fund).The creation of the Vale do Tua Regional Nature Park in 2013 guarantees that a significant part of those funds is directly invested in the region, upon the Protocol signed, in 2012, between the Regional Agency of Vale do Tua and EDPs Biodiversity Fund for the concession/exploration period. No significant negative impact is envisaged for the Vouga Site, so the planned measures comprise the reconversion of the habitat downstream of the future dam, which are in the design/establishment phase: removal of Sernada weir; building a passage way for ichthyofauna at Carvoeiro weir; plan for collecting fish downstream of Grela weir, subsequent transport and release into tributaries downstream and upstream of the dam. The environmental impacts are of much less significance due to the nature of the projects. However, several significant environmental factors are evaluated and undergo minimisation, offsetting and monitoring action. The Integrated Plan for the Control of mimosa. (an invasive specie) with the common name of mimosa) and the restoration of habitats are of note at Salamonde II. These were initiated during the construction stage and will extend to the operating stage, covering a total area of 60,000 m2 over the two stages. In addition to this Plan there is a pilot project to minimize and control the erosive effects on the zones of the banks of the Salamonde and Caniçada reservoirs between high and low water levels. Santo António do Jari and Cachoeira Caldeirão Both plants are located in Brazil, in the state of Amapá, and are currently under construction. They jointly cover an area of 87 km² in zones of high biodiversity, 42 km² and 33.5 km² respectively, since they are located in the Amazon region, which is considered the world's most biodiverse region. Moreover, Cachoeira Caldeirão also contains 14.5 km² in protected areas: 3 km² in the Amapá State Forest (FLOTA) and 11.5 km² in the Private Seringal Triunfo Nature Reserve. One highlight at Santo António do Jari, besides the monitoring and rescue of fauna, is the development of the programme to save germoplasms and reforestation with native species, a measure related to relocations, where EDP pledged to rebuild the new environment that will be like that of the original community. The offsetting and monitoring of the impact arising from the construction and operation of wind farms is implemented through partnerships established with environmental NGO’s and focus mostly on birds and bats. However, many of the initiatives directly benefit other groups of local fauna. The partnership with the Castilla y León Natural Heritage Foundation (Spain), for example, has some notable projects for the protection and restoration of habitats: x Creation of a wetland system that provides shelter and food for migratory birds crossing the Iberian Peninsula, which also benefits many amphibians and reptiles; x The restoration of several natural ponds at Carcedo de Burgos; x The building of an environmental interpretation centre at Aliseda de Tormes; x The adaptation of the trails at Lagunas glaciares de Neila Nature Park and signage with rules for public use; x Monitoring the Dupont’s Lark in the area of Medinaceli (Spain) and the monitoring, conservation and improvement of habitats of the Black Stork, Black Vulture, Spanish Imperial Eagle, and other birds of prey in the province of Ávila (Spain) In Portugal, continuity was given to the 2013 Environmental Promotion Programme, which among other environmental projects, included the PENAS Project Specific National Programme for Wild Birds. In 2013, with an overall budget of EUR 609,000 and which included: x The correction of potentially dangerous power lines; 38.8 km of power lines of a planned total of 68.8 km were corrected; x White stork nests; work was carried out on 166 nests; x Assessment of the working life of the anti-electrocution equipment installed in 2012; x Review of the risk maps for the targeted species: imperial eagle, black vulture, Bonelli's eagle and osprey; and x Conclusion of the great bustard collision charter that will be available as a first version during the first quarter of 2014. The completion of the construction work of the substations of North Gijón and Rojales is to be highlighted in Spain, both with environmental monitoring and improvement projects for the Genestoso-Leitariegos and BeleñoCamporriondi distribution lines. The latter are included in areas where brown bears are potentially present. The brown bear is an endangered species, and the works had to be suspended as replanning was required. The Fundación HC Energía undertakes general projects for the rehabilitation of protected natural areas, which include planting trees, fish restocking in Asturian rivers and collaboration with the Brown Bear Foundation. The new Environmental Impact Assessment law in Spain (Ley 21/2013, 9/12) means that new projects shall provide for the implementation of compensatory measures when located within the Rede Natura 2000 network. This law establishes the creation of Nature Conservation Banks to generate credits to which project developers may voluntarily contribute as a mechanism of compensation, repair or restoration of the net loss of natural assets, in accordance with regulations. One of the most significant environmental aspects of EDP Group business activities is air emissions arising from combustion to generate electricity by thermal means. These aspects are continuously and/or periodically monitored in order to verify compliance with the values established in legislation. The reduction of SO2 and particles emissions occurred due to market factors, which influenced the performance of the energy sector, and an increase in the renewable energy generation. The details of air emissions by facility can be consulted at www.edp.pt> about edp> business units> electricity generation.

The total waste sent to final disposal reduced significantly due to less thermal generation. EDP’s generation activities produce large quantities of fly ash and slag from the burning of coal and also gypsum from the desulphurisation of air emissions, also at coal-fired power stations. The byproducts sold during the year increased significantly due to the new markets found. Equipment contaminated with PCBs at concentrations below 500 ppm may remain in operation until the end of its useful life, under existing legislation. However, EDP is bringing forward its disposal, giving priority to this type of equipment in equipment replacement plans. 95 tons of waste containing PCBs were sent for final disposal in 2013. EDP has procedures for the identification and handling of near misses. This operates as a preventive process, aiming to prevent and minimise potential negative impacts. All facilities also have emergency plans, which identify the risks that can occur, how to act and the human and material resources available on-site. They ensure that employees or contractors are aware of these practices. The facilities test their emergency plans through regular drills (additional information in page 62).

Meetings with social partners and trade unions representing about 61% of employees were and continue to be held in order to negotiate the new Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) for EDP in Portugal. During 2013, there was a flick of pressure on labour relations within the negotiation process of revising the Agreement of HC Energía, a process which was concluded with no incidents. In the remaing geographies there was no kind of labour dispute for internal reasons of the company. The collective legal instruments in place in the countries where EDP operates do not include a specific clause to set the deadline for communicating operational changes to company employees that may impact on them. Nevertheless, EDP announces organisational changes that impact on employees, which go beyond the requirements of national labour law in some countries. Communications are sent to unions, workers’ committees and employees in Portugal at least 30 days beforehand. The communication of organisational changes in Brazil is initially made by the unions, followed by communication by EDP of the changes relative to each phase of the negotiations and a deadline is set for the clarification of doubts and inquiries. The minimum period in other locations is defined in national law. EDP has promoted the development of some practices and consolidated its relationship with institutions which are its main sources of recruitment. It has also established partnerships with various national and international associations and communities, including Best Board of European Students of Technology and CEMS Community of European Management School. The following attraction programmes developed in 2013 are of note: x IST Management Challenge, a strategy and management competition, supported by EDP and organised by SDG – Simuladores e Modelos de Gestão, in partnership with the Instituto Superior Técnico, of the Lisbon Technical University.

In the 2013 edition, about 500 teams took part and EDP supported 20 of them, one of which won the National Final of the competition and will represent Portugal in the International Final of the 2013 edition, to be held in Sochi, Russia; x PowerTrade Universidades, a game that simulates the electricity market in a competitive environment, directed at final year students of Engineering, Management and Economics Master’s Degrees. The qualifying teams will present a business case of one of the Group companies at the simulation stage, which is then presented to an EDP jury. The members of the winning team of the 2013 competition, from Instituto Superior Técnico, were awarded work placements in EDP. Work placements were also awarded to other participants who stood out for their performance, given the potential identified in the 2013 competition; x FabLab Challenge, a competition aimed at final year students of renowned secondary school or vocational technical courses. The students are challenged to create a renewable and/or energy efficiency project, developing a prototype of it in EDP’s FabLab. The winning team of the 2013 competition, from the electrical systems technical course of Rio Maior Vocational School, was awarded apprenticeships; x Workshop “Promover o Saber”, Workshop, an initiative designed by EDP with the aim of contributing to the development of skills among students of technical courses, secondary schools or renowned vocational schools, specifically in preparation for entering the labour market. 5 sessions were held during 2013 involving about 80 students from various schools in Portugal; x EDP University Challenge, a college annual contest that encourages interaction between universities and companies through the allocation of scholarships. In 2013, eight students were awarded, three in Portugal and five in Spain; x Partnership with CEMS Community of European Management Schools, under which are annually offered internships in different geographies for the students of the Master of International Management. Over the past two years, this partnership has resulted in the hiring of 1 employee. EDP considers in the recruitment and selection process not only the specific skills defined for the role but also behavioural skills, on the basis of organisational culture. The implementation of this process has been based on the development of practices, the highlights of which in 2013 were: x Programa ON TOP EDP Recruitment Program aims Technical Academy of the Energy Sector to attract and capture young people with potential, making EDP known to students and promoting the With the aim of encouraging the knowcompany’s proximity with the school community.

The 205 new employees who joined the company in 2013 in Portugal have undertaken a number of activities included in the Induction and Integration Programme over their 1st year, aimed at imparting knowledge about the business, the assimilation of the values and culture and promoting networking that enhances synergies. These activities of a corporate nature are complemented by specific initiatives in each business area where the employee is located. EDP conducts annual recruitment and selection processes to award work placements, enhancing the identification of future employees with growth potential, who may contribute to the development of the business. 969 work placements were organised in 2013. 680 of those were school/curricular placements, 239 were vocational work placement and 50 were summer work placements. An integrated career management model was launched in 2013 in order to identify, describe and publicise the set of functional profiles/families existing in the company, aligning them with the value chain of the business. This model also aims to create a framework to support decisions on the development and mobility of staff, allowing people to adapt to business needs and serving as input for other human resource management processes. It began in Portugal and it is planned to extend its scope to other geographical areas during 2014. Internal Mobility is considered by EDP to be strategic, as it allows culture and knowledge to be strengthened while promoting interaction between employees with different backgrounds and experiences, valuing the employee by enhancing their skills and preparing them to take on new challenges and responsibilities. Globally, in EDP, 823 cases of mobility (of which 67% intra-company, inter-company 31% and same geography and geographies between 2%), corresponding to 7% of all employees were registered.

In 2013, the assessment was extended 270º to all senior managers and operating technical managers, reinforcing the importance of feedback from various stakeholders. This model went on to have an e-learning course available to all employees in 2013, allowing in a quick and affordable way to train supervisors and employees regarding the process and its implementation. The succession plan of the company was created in 2009. It identifies potential successors for the senior management roles of the EDP Group and it constitutes a management and decision support tool that is annually updated on a multi-company and multi-country philosophy and with the active involvement of the Executive Board of Directors. EDP has consistently invested in training and support for the exercise of leadership. The EDP Leader Guide was updated in 2013 in the light of current practices. It is a manual that gathers information about the EDP Leader profile and key Human Resources processes. The Lead Now Programme was also designed and implemented. This programme is aimed at leaders recently appointed to senior positions and it aims to support the transition, raising awareness and adjustment to a new role in the team. 795 employees left EDP in 2013, with an average age of 49 years and an average seniority of 23 years. 2,873 and 5,136 employees of the current total of 12,179 are eligible for retirement in the next 5 and 10 years, respectively.

In relation to disabled persons, the EDP Group currently has 197 employees with some level of disability; a measure was launched for the identification of vacancies for external recruitment that can be occupied by such persons. Another measure developed in 2013 was the introduction of the theme of diversity in the training courses on organisational culture aimed at managers. In parallel, a question related to Diversity and Gender Equality was included in the Organisational Climate questionnaire, with 84% of employees agreeing or totally agreeing that People of any age, sex, race, colour, sexual orientation/religion/politics are treated with the same fairness and respect in EDP”. EDP is a responsible company and accordingly it promotes balance between the professional and personal life of its employees, aware that the professional, personal and family pillars all have great importance in people's lives. EDP has developed the Conciliar Programme since 2007, in accordance with this commitment. This is an initiative that involves the gradual implementation of a set of policies and measures. As a result of the work undertaken and the diversity and quality of the implemented measures, EDP is certified as a company promoting work-family balance and equality, by Fundación Más Familia. EDP Portugal, where 57.3% of Group employees work, obtained this certification on 18 January 2013. HC Energía, Naturgás and EDP Renováveis renewed the certification obtained between 2011 and 2012. A fundamental pillar of EDP’s Conciliar Programme, the Volunteering Programme mobilised the participation of 1,869 employees in EDP volunteering initiatives in 2013, corresponding to 13,506 hours of volunteer service during working hours. The Volunteering Programme contributes to strengthening team spirit, fostering a culture of social responsibility and corporate citizenship and it is a way of deepening the relationship between the company and communities.

EDP has built a culture of prevention and safety to ensure compliance with this commitment and it has adopted an occupational health and safety management system, based on the OSHAS 18001 standard, following the guidelines of the International Labour Organization and cemented in internal regulations. The Corporate Safety Management System (CSMS) of EDP reflects its Safety Policy and reinforces the principle that occupational health and safety issues are managed according to common and harmonised criteria in the group companies and extended to service providers’ employees. Each business unit locally adopts the Corporate Management System directly or takes it as a reference to develop its own safety management system, which is stand-alone or integrated with the environment and/or quality fields, taking into account the business activity. The themes of prevention, safety, health and the wellbeing of employees are covered in the agreements concluded with trade unions. Employees are involved in the management of occupational health and safety through representation on safety committees and sub-committees. During 2013, 540 meetings were held, with worker representativeness of 91%. Further details of the most relevant activities and commitments made by the company can be found at www.edp.pt> sustainability> occupational health and safety. EDP provides occupational and non-occupational health care under its commitment to the well-being, health and safety of Occupational Stress Management employees. The medical assistance benefit is provided in all Programme existing companies/countries for reasons related to A study of the determining factors of employment contracts, general agreements and other psychosocial risks began in 2012, to act preapplicable legislation, in particular fiscal and para-fiscal law. emptively in reducing health risks and with How this benefit is provided and its scale differs between the aim of launching an occupational stress companies.

The implementation of the company’s annual occupational health and safety programme was based on a set of actions aimed at preventing the occurrence of occupational accidents. The annual programme led to a reduction in the frequency rates and severity of accidents and occupational diseases, and it included the education and training of the employees of EDP and service providers, the constant evaluation and control of occupational hazards and the implementation of an internal and external audit and inspection plan vis-à-vis the premises and construction projects of EDP. Unfortunately, we mourn the occurrence of 4 fatal accidents involving EDP employees as a result of aeronautical, electrical, trapped and road accidents. Regarding service providers, there were the occurrence of eight fatalities, of which five in Portugal, two of electrical nature, one by falling from height, one from an object fall and one from an object impact. Three occurred in Brazil, one of electrical nature, one by falling from height and one fall from a tree.There were 42 occupational accidents involving EDP employees (4 more than in 2012), there were 224 occupational accidents involving one or more days of absence among the group of service providers employees. 197 cases of near misses were reported. These numbers are associated with construction works of big hydroelectric power plants and with the high turnover of service provider’s employees. 7 fatal accidents of electrical origin were recorded on EDP premises or equipment, involving persons unconnected to the company’s business activity, which are related to situations of civil works in the proximity of power lines in tension (5) and intrusion (2). The analysis of registered performance reflects, on the one hand, the results of actions and initiatives taken during the year in strengthening preventive action among services providers, particularly in the fields of training and awareness, assessment and control of risks and the increase of audits programme and inspections and, secondly, the need for priority actions for continued realization of thematic workshops on prevention and safety with the participation of service providers. EDP is committed to ensuring that employees and service providers have adequate conditions for sustainable development in terms of occupational safety. In harmony with this commitment, EDP employees and the employees of contractors and subcontractors are provided the necessary training for carrying out their tasks in safe conditions.The employees of EDP and of contractors and subcontractors, in addition to these training courses, take part in activities that promote safe behaviour and prevent the specific risks of certain activities or facilities. 489 first aid training courses were held for the employees of EDP and contractors and subcontractors. Moreover, 708 information courses were held, in collaboration with firefighting services, vocational and secondary schools, employers’ associations and trade unions, on procedures to follow when fighting fires in electrical installations, in gas networks and systems or locations in their vicinity, as well as the precautions to take when handling electrical equipment. Various initiatives were organised to inform and raise the awareness of civil society on the generation and distribution of electricity and the care to take when in the vicinity of electrical infrastructure. 241 simulation exercises concerning the management of emergency situations (41 in Portugal, 107 in Spain, 31 in Brazil, 37 in the USA and 25 in other countries) were performed in various industrial and administrative facilities and active construction sites. The aim of these drills was to test the effectiveness of the respective emergency plans. External entities were also involved in these drills, such as civil defence forces, fire services and the police and public safety authorities. The performance of suppliers is essential to the success of the EDP Group. The relationship based on trust, collaboration and the creation of values shared with suppliers results in the joint capacity to innovate, strengthen Corporate Social Responsibility policy and improve the quality of service provided to customers. This significantly contributes to EDP keeping the leadership in its areas of operation and it is a factor inducing competitiveness in the markets in which it operates. The EDP Group's overall procurement activity in 2013 totalled EUR 2,661 million. Negotiation savings exceeded EUR 200 million. These figures do not include the purchase of fuel for energy production or the purchase of electricity in the market.

Due to the size, nature and recurrence of many of the EDP Group's acquisitions, there is a very positive influence on the local economy by promoting the quality and competitiveness of economic agents in the regions where it is present. The distribution of this activity follows the Group's business in the countries where it operates. The volume of purchases from local suppliers accounted for approximately 92% of total procurement in 2013.

In 2013, about 60% of suppliers delivering over EUR 75,000 in goods and services were registered on the Suppliers Registration System. Of these, 55% have quality management systems that have been certified by independent parties. For environmental management and safety systems, 31% and 45% of companies are certified, respectively. In 2013, EDP purchased EUR 1,069 million in natural gas to operate in the spanish market and 266 million for the Portuguese market. Purchases of LPG amounted to EUR 1.66 million exclusively for the portuguese market. In respect to coal, the acquisition in Spain amounted to EUR 66 million and Portugal to EUR 202 million. EDP joined Bettercoal, an international initiative to promote best practices and the In the past year, EDP maintained its strategy of sourcing coal integration of sustainability principles in the primarily through long-term contracts, and buying on the spot coal supply chain. market to ensure coverage of specific needs. This sourcing was undertaken with the best practices of the market as Bettercoal is a non-profit association created benchmarks, such as SCoTA (Standard Coal Trading in 2012 by a group of companies of the Agreement) for coal. In order to minimise risks, EDP has also electricity sector.

The practices and performance of the mining companies will be audited in order to ensure compliance with the code and, if necessary, corrective and improvement plans will be 79% established. The members of Bettercoal are currently, Colombia and besides EDP, Dong, DRAX, EDF, Enel, USA Russia, Norway and South Africa E.ON, Gas Natural Fenosa GDF Suez, RWE and also Vattenfall. The qualification of counterparties is undertaken before the contracting phase. This involves an economic, financial, logistics, environmental and social evaluation. In relation to coal, the counterparties are primarily headquartered or have representation in the UK, Ireland and Switzerland, although 79% of the coal purchased by EDP in 2013 originated from Colombia (67% in 2012). Moreover, only 52% of the coal was purchased directly from producers. The rest was acquired on the market from various types of intermediaries. Accordingly, counterparties are assessed through a combination of procedures, including the identification of producers with OHSAS and ISO certification and Sustainability Reports, and traders with advanced CSR policies, those listed on the 2013 DJSI electricity and form part of the Bettercoal initiative. EDP also joined Bettercoal in November 2013, aiming to promote progress in the implementation of mining best practices by strengthening local audits and the widespread standardisation of assessment criteria. (see highlight box). EDP has an Integrated Supplier Management System using Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) tools. The adopted model is based on five different phases: Registration, Selection, Evaluation, Management and Development. This relationship solution fosters proximity with the different partners, permitting the sharing of methodologies and promoting closer relations between both parties. The suppliers’ familiarity with the company's business fosters better purchase terms and optimises the entire supply process. EDP is implementing in this area a risk analysis method for strategic suppliers that allows it to identify critical situations or supply disruptions in time and ensure the continuity of contracted supplies. The system for finding, selecting and segmenting suppliers of the EDP Group – the Supplier Registration System (SRF), enables it to take clear, transparent, efficient action, fostering win-win partnerships. The SRF is based on a philosophy of centralisation and sharing of available information in the suppliers’ database, which is centrally checked, managed and maintained and is made available to the members of the community – Achilles. In 2013, this database reached 23,059 registered companies, more 13% than in 2012. Registered companies also enjoy a number of advantages, such as: x Equal opportunities for equivalent/separate business areas; x Increased business opportunities; x Guarantee that their customers have quick and reliable access to the information; x Single registration visible to several companies; x No need to present various kinds of documentation when applying for contracts or pre-tender qualification. For registered suppliers, SRF has a questionnaire on Corporate Social Responsibility, which aims to evaluate suppliers practices in these matters and support procurement management teams in operational decisions. 47% of the registered suppliers in this system and with contracts with EDP, submitted their answers on the questionnaire. Sinergie Supply Integration for Energy (www.sinergie.edp.pt) is a corporate-wide web platform fully developed by the EDP Group procurement team. It aims to streamline the relationship between the procurement areas of the Group and the market in a simple and secure manner. In the events of EDP Group Electronic Queries, suppliers may submit their proposals online in a simple and direct manner that optimises time through Sinergie. Electronic queries are only available to suppliers registered in the Suppliers’ Registration System of the EDP Group. Electronic trading allows the EDP Group's suppliers to assess their performance against the market in real time, and take part in web-based trading from anywhere in the world. Electronic trading also allows suppliers to achieve, in a swift manner, an increase in their sales to the EDP Group. The EDP has developed formal mechanisms for assessing their supply chain: o Sistema de Avaliação de Fornecedores (SAF), in Europe, e o Índice de Desempenho de Fornecedores (IDF), in Brazil. These systems aim to mitigate risks and improve performance in the supply chain. Consequently, the evaluation systems optimize the selection of suppliers and encourage their commitment to the best international practices and procedures. Thus , both the SAF as the IDF , although with particular variants, allow the evaluation of the supplier performance in the areas of Certification , Innovation , Logistics , Sustainability and Quality through specific forms, with the appropriate criteria, on services (enforcement, prevention and safety, environment and compliance) and on materials supply (receiving, inspection, complaints and behavior of the product) . Fundamental part of the suppliers assessment lies in conducting assessments with the consequent identification of improvement programs, involvement of the entities and monitoring progress. In 2013, in the Iberian Peninsula, EDP ensured the review of 458 suppliers and 456 audits. For 107 of these suppliers were identified the need of improvements. One year after the creation of the EDPartners Awards (www.edpartners.edp.pt), which gave accolades to the top domestic suppliers in various categories, the EDP Group decided to promote two roadshows believing that business opportunities in the near future will be concentrated in the Asian and Latin American markets. This initiative aimed to promote the internationalisation of suppliers by ensuring special contacts that promote new business in emerging markets, whether through the export of goods and services or in the establishment of joint ventures. The event in São Paulo, with the support of EDP Brasil, attracted about 40 Portuguese and 42 Brazilian companies operating in various areas of the power sector. Presentations and discussions focused on the Brazilian market occurred over the three days of the event. More than 150 networking meetings were registered. In Beijing, China, where EDP’s relations with the market and Chinese companies are strengthened through its main shareholder, China Three Gorges, the event was accompanied at the highest level by representatives of the Chinese state and the Portuguese State. 45 Portuguese and 49 Chinese companies attended the event, operating in various sectors ranging from the financial industry to the metalworking and engineering sector, from information technology to marketing. Companies had the opportunity to present their business, create a network of contacts and develop business and partnership opportunities, during the two-day event. 127 networking meetings between Portuguese companies and their Chinese counterparts were registered. The second phase of the roadshow is to monitor the results of these meetings to discover the success stories and assess the possibility of similar initiatives in the future. The EDP Group supplies electricity to end consumers in three countries DISTRIBUTION OF CLIENTS BY Portugal, Spain and Brazil. It ended 2013 with 9.880.899 electricity TYPE OF USE customers and 1.171.184 gas customers. 1% 3% In Portugal, there is an ongoing process of extinction of transitional regulated tariffs for electricity and natural gas (in regulated markets), which 1% should be completed by the end of 2015. There is the expectation that all 8% customers will have exercised their right of choice by the end of this period regarding the suppliers operating in the liberalised electricity and gas markets. EDP retained the leadership in the liberalised electricity market at the end of 2013, both in terms of number of customers and also consumption. On the other hand, concerning natural gas free market, EDP won the lead of costumers. In Spain, EDP continued its organic growth process, which included starting 87% operations in Barcelona. It ended the year with approximately 1.118.056 electricity customers and 796.196 natural gas customers. EDP is present in the electricity supply segment of the liberalised and Residential Industrial regulated markets in Brazil (through the Bandeirante and Escelsa suppliers). Comercial Agricultural Others The liberalised market has an insignificant number of customers (around 500).

EDP has a special programme in Portugal to promote energy efficiency with, in particular, an exclusive web page for this theme www.eco.edp.pt where consumers can find, for example: x Information and advice on energy efficiency; x Energy efficiency and CO2 emissions simulators; x Practical guide for an efficient home. The EDP Group's participation in the Plan for Promoting the Efficient Electricity Consumption (PPEC) promoted by the Energy Services Regulatory Authority (ERSE) is also of note. A new tender programme was launched in 2013 (PPEC 2013-2014). EDP had 16 measures approved, as part of its commitment to supporting families and businesses in saving energy, which corresponds to 40% of all approved measures. It is estimated, considering the lifetime of these measures, that their implementation will allow savings of about 508 GWh of energy and a reduction of 28,131 tons of carbon dioxide, a global benefit of about EUR 161 million. For more information about these measures, visit www.erse.pt/pt/planodepromocaodaeficiencianoconsumoppec/ppec1314/Paginas/default.aspx Additionally, EDP also offers a free online service Full Management that enables customers to manage energy consumptions in https://energia.edp.pt/particulares/servicos/gestao-total.aspx. EDP also has a programme to support the implementation of energy efficiency projects in Portuguese firms Save to Compete (www.savetocompete.com/pt). Since its launch in Portugal, 164 applications were registered, 85 of which were completed and validated, and executed contracts in the amount of EUR 7.2 million. It is estimated that the programme will have prevented the emission of 7,300 tons of carbon dioxide by the end of 2013, to obtain a saving of 12 GWh in energy consumption and approximately EUR 2 million. These results are accounted online and can be found on the Save to Compete website. The success achieved in Portugal with this programme led to its launch in Spain, in Astúrias, in November 2013. It received 10 applications and 7 of those have been completed and validated. In Spain, EDP also has a programme to promote energy efficiency, which can be consulted on the website: www.educacionedp.es/eficiencia. EDP continued to implement projects concerning public procurement in Spain. Of these, we highlight: x Competition Mayor of Noja Municipal Council conversion of diesel boilers in natural gas boilers, energy supply and maintenance of systems in public schools and sports halls; x Open the Port Authority of Gijón (APG): Electrical service management of buildings located in the Port of Gijón, which will last until May 2014; x Competition HEI Valladolid: implementation of energy efficiency measures, namely the transformation of premises diesel to natural gas, and improvements in lighting public buildings belonging to the autonomous community of Castile and León. The investment in Brazil in electricity efficiency programmes in 2013 was EUR 8.5 million, with estimated energy savings of about 36GWh and 16MW less demand at peak periods. These demand management programmes include residential, commercial, institutional and industrial initiatives, which consist of demonstrating the importance to society and the economic feasibility of initiatives to combat the waste of energy and to improve the energy efficiency of equipment, processes and end uses of energy (www.edp.com.br/inovacaosustentabilidade/programa-de-eficiencia-energetica). The highlights are: x Good energy in the community: Conservation initiatives aimed at low income populations, through the donation of efficient equipment; x Good solar energy: Conservation initiatives of conventional residential and low income populations, promoting the replacement of the traditional electric shower for solar heating systems with smart electric showers; x Good energy in schools: Initiatives to train teachers to serve as multipliers of the concepts of energy conservation and the rational use of energy, among students of basic primary public education. In order to improve equitable distribution and relieve pressure at times of peak consumption, EDP created some projects that help manage the everyday demand for energy. In Portugal and Spain, part of the management of this demand is done by the existence of tariffs discriminated on the basis of demand: dual tarrif and triple tariff plans. These tariffs have different prices per kWh depending on usage in peak, off-peak and super off-peak periods. EDP also continues to focus on the extension of the InovGrid project, currently being implemented in Portugal, Spain and Brazil (see additional information on page 74). EDP has allocated part of its investment in maintenance over the years to the universal contribution to access to energy and for upgrading grid infrastructure and the incorporation of technologies that enable higher supply quality. The electrification of the areas where EDP operates in Portugal and Spain is almost completed, so EDP focuses on ensuring a quality service to all consumers. In Brazil, where the distribution grid is less developed, EDP has been leading projects with the goal of mitigating the energy exclusion of communities in the country still without access to an electricity distribution grid. The Portable Light Project continued in 2013, coordinated by Instituto EDP Energias do Brasil in partnership with the Ideas NGO and funding from IDB. The project donated photovoltaic panels to isolated communities living in the Tapajós – Arapiuns Reserve in Pará. The Dark Island Project was also implemented, which aims to take energy to 2 communities of São José dos Campos, with 15 homes. An analysis was done of those homes and they were altered internally in order to receive the photovoltaic and solar heating system. The equipment was all donated, including efficient appliances such as refrigerators. In addition to the homes, 3 solar street lighting posts were also installed in the common area of this community. Also to be highlighted this year are the activities of the Cabiri Solar Village, in Angola. This project consists of the implementation of sustainable energy solutions with the objective of meeting the basic needs of local populations approximately 3,000 people, while respecting their social, environmental and cultural situation and promoting economic and social development. This project is a partnership between Fundação EDP and the Angolan company EIH Energia Inovação Holding. The construction phase has already been completed, with 505 solar photovoltaic systems installed in 500 family houses and social facilities (school, health centre, training centre, community space and technical building) and 83 solar street lighting posts. Inauguration is expected during 2014. In the supply activity in the countries where EDP operates there are social support plans for economically vulnerable customers. Portugal has three distinct, but cumulative social supports: social tariffs for natural gas and electricity and the Extraordinary Social Support for the Energy Consumer (ASECE). The Ministry of Industry has created a special rate for customers in Spain with installed capacity below 3 kVA and who are classified as socioeconomically deprived (the retired, unemployed and large families). The social electricity tariff in Brazil is applied to low income families. These tariffs allow discounts that vary according to the conventional rate established for each company.

During 2013, EDP Group paid 553 million euros of fines relating to treatment of customer data and privacy, the value corresponding to procedures already reported in previous years. EDP has changed the procedures on the framework of the relationship with commercial agents and Customers, strengthening the guarantee of confidentiality and data protection. EDP places great importance on the service provided, intending to ensure maximum customer satisfaction. Accordingly, EDP listens to its customers, conducting customer voice studies, in partnership with certified external entities. These studies are primarily aimed at hearing what customers think in terms of the quality of the services provided by EDP as well as the experience of customers during the services. Customer Experience is translated into a set of macro-indicators, which include overall satisfaction, satisfaction with energy supply (electricity and/or gas) and satisfaction with the service.

EDP improved the layout and design of costumers reserved area, in Portugal, and also made video tutorials available with explanations of the key themes, such as reading the bill or how to take the meter reading. In Spain, new features were included such as the online delivery of meter readings, payments made in instalments, change of address and banking entity, as well as specific requests and queries about the Funciona service. The TIEPI (Equivalent Interruption Time of Installed Capacity) for the distribution activity in Portugal was 84 minutes and 38 minutes in Spain. Both underwent increases from 2012 due to extreme weather conditions, particularly in January and December 2013. The 2013 figures are, however, an improvement on 2011. SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index) registered 2.01 disruptions in both domestic customers and small businesses (low voltage) and 2.00 for business customers (medium voltage) in Portugal. Technical service quality indicators in GENERAL INDICATORS OF SERVICE QUALITY EDP Brazil are classified in two levels: DEC DISTRIBUIÇÃO (%), PORTUGAL Budget of low voltage gas (Equivalent Duration of Interruption per trunks (up to 20 working Standard (%) Consumer) and FEC (Equivalent days) 2012 (%) 100 100100 Frequency of Interruption per Consumer 2013 (%) Customers with restoration Unit). In 2013, EDP Bandeirante service up to 4 hours 95 Implementation of gas 95 trunks obtained a DEC result of 8 hours and FEC (following accidental 9599 97 99 (up to 20 working days) interruptions of supply) 90 of 5.51 hours, which corresponds 95 90 respectively to reductions of 15% and 85 9% from 2012. EDP Escelsa achieved a 80 90 DEC of 9.67 hours, i.e. 2% less than the Written information requests 94 90 95 99 Low voltage grid 96 85 connections previous year; and a FEC of 5.78 hours, (up to 15 working days) (up to 2 working days) 90 which is 9% less than the previous year. 93 91 96 Public attention at the Central call center (up to 60 97 centers seconds wait) (up to 20 minutes wait) The quality of service provided to customers in 2013 by the operator of the distribution grid in Portugal were slightly lower than the previous year. In terms of service in call centres there was an improvement of 2%, from 91% to 93%. The telephone answering and budgets for line extension services for residential customers remained at the same level of service quality. Overall, EDP remains above the standard values in terms of the quality of service provided. In Brazil, 69% of cases (average of the two distribution operators), the cuts due to non-payment were rewired in less than 24 hours. Detailed information can be found in the Annual Report of EDP in Brazil. In Spain, the percentage of compliance with the reconnections in less than 24 hours was 98%. The Customer Ombudsman was created in 2008. It is an external and independent entity, with the mission of building confidence in relations between the EDP Group companies and their customers. The main activity of this entity is to assess requests from customers that are not satisfied with the reply to their complaints. The opinions of the Ombudsman are based on transparent principles guided by criteria of fairness and the guiding frameworks adopted in the European Union. Customers may appeal directly to the Ombudsman via the website www.provedordocliente.edp.pt, and its powers can be found on page 124. The Ombudsman received 2,261 requests for appraisal in 2013, 85% of which ORIENTATION OF OMBUDSMAN ANSWER were complaints regarding electricity. Most requests (74%) concerned issues 0.2% related to Supply and Meter readings/Invoicing/Bill Payments. By the end of 2013, 2,199 requests had been answered, with the Ombudsman concordant in 52.4% of cases. 22.7% Improvements have been made to the Ombudsman process and to the website to raise levels of overall customer satisfaction. Consequently, the customer response time was decreased by 5 working days which represents a 6.5% 52.4% reply time improvement of over 15%. 18.2% According to the satisfaction indicators and the number of incidents received by the Ombudsman, EDP developed programmes and initiatives in 2013 with an effective impact on increasing customer satisfaction. Concordant Discordant Partial concordant Resolved issue Additional information Continuous innovation is a core characteristic of the EDP Group. This positioning allows the Company to anticipate trends and customer needs and act quickly. The EDP Group reorganised its area of innovation in 2013, creating four groups that embody the most relevant innovation themes for the Company and which promote greater proximity between the innovation areas and business units, namely: x Clean and Flexible Generation x Smart grids x Customer Focused Solutions x Innovative IT and data management The EDP Group’s expenses on R&D+i in 2013 was around EUR 31 million. This amount represents an estimate of EUR 24 million in Portugal for the development of ongoing projects in the previous year. It was calculated based on the estimated variation in responses to the National Technological and Scientific Potential Survey of the group companies. It should be noted that the calculation of the final figure for 2013 according to the methodology that has been followed since 2006, will be completed a few months after closing the company accounts. The referred amount includes the cost of R&D undertaken in Brazil and Spain, totalling approximately EUR 7 million. EDP continued to invest in technology development for offshore wind power, which continues to grow and position itself as a possible path for expansion in the renewable generation field. The most relevant initiative is the WindFloat project, which started in 2010 and is led by EDP in consortium with other companies (Principle Power, A. Silva Matos, InovCapital, Vestas and Repsol). This project is in the final demonstration phase. The reliability and performance of the implemented innovative technology has been proven 2 MW wind turbine installed on a floating platform off the coast of Póvoa de Varzim. The machine had generated over 8 GWh by the end of 2013. Also noteworthy is the beginning of development of the precommercial stage, which will consist of the creation of a small wind farm with 3-5 WindFloats equipped with turbines each with a capacity of 5 to 8 MW. EDP is also carrying out a project in the area of advanced maintenance of wind turbines, in partnership with the Fibersensing and Critical Materials companies.It comprises the application of optical sensors for the identification of problems in the blades of the wind turbines and their preventive maintenance. Several initiatives have been developed in the area of solar energy, to support decision-making and optimisation of conventional photovoltaic technologies, and to create technological options in this sector: x SunLab Project:photovoltaic module testing in different climate conditions and different orientations, collecting data at the four mini-testing centres located in Portugal and beginning of internal analysis and dissemination of results. x Completion of the first phase of a photovoltaic thin film demonstration project called Crystalsol, in partnership with the National Energy and Geology Laboratory (Portugal). Another project is also underway in Brazil to evaluate similar technology; x Development of the technological component of EDP’s offer for Access to Energy solutions based on decentralised PV solar power (further information on chap.Customers); x In Brazil we developed a system of mini-grids powered by PV solar panels to supply isolated areas. A cycle of projects was developed from 2006 to 2013 focusing on the issue of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), given the importance of this issue for thermoelectric generation. These projects focused on the study of solutions that might combine the continued use of fossil fuels in electricity generation, such as coal and natural gas, with a drastic reduction of the carbon dioxide emissions that result from burning those fuels. Those activities arise from taking part in the following international projects of the European Union’s 7 th R&D Framework Programme, concluded in 2013: x DECARBit (http://decarbit.com/); x FLEXI BURN CFB (www.vtt.fi/sites/flexiburncfb/); x COMET (http://comet.lneg.pt/). The following projects in the area of flexible generation and high energy availability, developed in 2013 and continued in 2014, deserve note outside the context of CCS: x Pregas2013 Predicting and optimisingblast furnace gas consumption at the Sidergás cogeneration power plant; x Carbiotor2014 –Testing the combustion of torrefied biomass at thermoelectric power stations. x Teca2014 -Diagnosis and predict faults in combined cycle boilers x SAFEnergia, in partnership with Instituto Soldadura e Qualidade to develop diagnostic and nonintrusive inspection technologies for use in thermoelectric power stations. x Online smart system to assess the loss of service life of components of hydro-generators due to fatigue and changes in the generation system x System for power transformers diagnosis with maintenance techniques based on condition and computational intelligence x Smart geo-referenced supervision system for dam reservoirs through autonomous vehicle; x Non-invasive and innovative geophysical method, to be incorporated in software for processing, analysis and modelling of artificial seismic vibrations to determine the physical parameters of dams; The following projects should be highlighted in the area ofimproving eco-efficiency: x Multiyesos2015 Demonstrate new desulphurisationgypsum applications x AirQ2014 Detail air qualitypollution sources x Ashfoam2014 Use thermoelectric power station ash as an additive for the production of aluminium composites and foams x Adequate methodologies for the prediction and rehabilitation of erosion phenomena, aimed at improving the performance of reservoirs for power generation; x Risk analysis system for the sustainable handling of cyanobacteria in hydroelectric power station reservoirs; x Artificial neural network for predicting siltation in hydroelectric reservoirs from hydro-sedimentology and bank erosion data; InovGrid is EDP’s smart grid project. The dual focus of the project on energy efficiency and facilitating the integration of renewable technology positions smart grids as the industry’s response to the global challenge of sustainability. Évora municipality in Portugal hosted the first field implementation of the InovGrid project which involved building the entire infrastructure that supports InovCity, allowing the population to have special access to a number of technological innovations. The infrastructure covers the entire municipality, which is about 32,000 electricity customers with an approximate annual consumption of 270 GWh. There are also around 140 medium voltage customers, with an annual consumption of 110 GWh. The Evora InovCity’s infrastructure covers the automatic collection of meter readings, the monitoring and automation of transformer stations, integration of consumer information in the central systems as well as the sharing of information with the customer. The data collected in the second year of the project confirm a potential increase in energy efficiency of about 4%. The InovGrid project is currently being extended to six new municipalities in Portugal in order to test different communication technologies, replicating the concept in areas with different socioeconomic conditions and specific grid characteristics, with the aim of increasing the integration of smart grids in the normal business processes. In Spain, the municipality of Pola de Siero (Asturias) was selected as the InovGrid pilot project, the first village of the distribution network of HC Energía to have 100% of smart meters, for customers with installed power up to 15kW. The low-voltage network of the municipality has been adapted to enable the use of these meters functionalities. In Brazil, the InovCity project started in 2010 in the municipality of São Paulo and is being replicated in two new municipalities of Espírito Santo state. Moreover, a wide range of R&D projects have been supported aimed at better grid management and quality of service in various countries: x The PREDIS project Distributed Forecast of Real Time Consumption, for predicting low voltage loads, intends to visualise and predict consumption in real time, allowing optimised grid management; x The Synapse Project allows us to anticipate supply or quality of service problems, allowing the faster restoration of electricity supply. x Pilot project for assessing consumer reaction to the prepayment system and the different low voltage rates in the smart grids environment; x Development of new smart grid technologies to tackle new climate challenges; x Electronic metering for electricity smart grids; x Intelligent automated system for identifying and locating faults in electricity distribution; x New paradigm for planning and managing the maintenance of distribution systems based on continuity indicators; x Development of an intelligent electronic multi-function metering module, with measurement and management of energy quality parameters features. x RedOx2015 –Development of a redox flow battery (35kW) with Spanish technology x Localiza2013 –Development of an algorithm for locating short circuits in medium voltage grids x Libatt2014 –Testing the functionalities of Lithium-ion batteries for low voltage customers EDP, continuing its leadership in promoting energy efficiency in Portugal, has made a significant investment in the preparation of the PPEC 2013-2014 tender, with 16 measures approved, including leading position in the domestic segment (86%), commerce and services (88%) and industry and agriculture (43%). EDP has carried out studies to support the phase-out of high pressure mercury lamps for street lighting and their replacement by LED lamps, at competitive prices, with huge energy savings and better performance. It has developed prototypes of luminaires for this purpose. EDP continued to develop several projects in the energy efficiency area, namely: x EnRiMa decision support system for managers of public buildings with poly-generation, in Spain; x Agrega2015 Dynamic modelling system for low voltage consumption clusters in Spain; x Home Energy Management service platform for home energy management. A campaign of preapplication was launched at the end of 2013, in Portugal, aimed at installing the platform in a limited number of customers from the first quarter of 2014; x Product line for the optimisation and control of residential energy use in Brazil: Smart TUG plug used to control residential appliances; Smart Meter plug associated with low cost meter, for measuring active energy; Home Display Multi-functional display which will be the interface of the consumer with the supplier; x Intelligent device for reducing demand at peak hours in white goods equipment, in Brazil; x Computational method and electronic device for collecting data to aid in the detection of street lighting energy losses, in Brazil; x Elenna2015 – Creation of new energy advice techniques using plain language messages, in Spain. The pilot phase of the electric mobility programme in Portugal (MOBI.E) continued in 2013, allowing to assess the adhesion of users to electric mobility and the equipment and systems developed for the project. SGORME – Sociedade Gestora de Operações da Rede de Mobilidade Eléctrica continued to manage the public charging network, in collaboration with all operators of electric charging infrastructure. The Opencharge project will be concluded in March 2014, having developed a complete, ready for preproduction series of a robust pole loading and much lesser cost than all other solutions in the market. Two units have been installed in São Paulo, Brazil and 10 more are scheduled to be installed. The Wallbox Opencharge was also developed in order to support the EDP electrical mobility range of products, particularly in the residential market. In Brazil, we proceeded to the evaluation of possible scenarios, experimentation and measuring the impacts of electric vehicles on the EDP distribution systems. Moreover, EDP participated in working groups in this field, in particular the FOREVE forum in Spain. One of the four priority areas for innovation arising from the new operational framework is based on new developments in Information and Communication Technologies and how these can contribute in a profound and cross-cutting manner to meeting the challenges facing the energy sector. Some technologies and market trends were identified in this field: x Big Data enhances agility in the marketplace, operational optimisation and the creation of new products and services; x Searching – leads to greater simplification and speed in internal and external access to information; x Cloud Computing enables flexible management of the IT infrastructure, speeding up the allocation of technical resources and reduce investments. These trends allowed a number of initiatives to be launched during 2013, the most notable being: x PREDIS – Distributed Forecast of Real Time Consumption (already mentioned in the smart grids section); x Big Data – development of skills, which aims to indigenise EDP knowledge in relation to approaches, processes, technologies and architectures that allow the mass processing of large data volumes; x Get to know customers and the market better, based on the development and incorporation of automatic processing solutions for unstructured data, based on external and internal sources. x SearchBox – Optimise information searching in the Group, with the aim of providing the Group with advanced and smart information search engines using a common platform – Intranet.Searching – that leads to greater simplification and speed in accessing information, internally and externally. EDP Ventures had already invested, by the end of 2013, more than EUR 16 million in innovative companies and funds in the cleantech area, particularly in Arquiled and Principle Power. It has also committed to an additional investment of around EUR 4 million in 2014. In parallel, EDP has continued to develop a set of activities with a significant impact both internally and in relations with different partners. The following are some of the main initiatives developed in 2013: x EDP Starter With the aim of moving EDP closer to entrepreneurs and researchers, EDP created this innovative concept to support entrepreneurship at all stages of the value chain, from the idea to investment. EDP Starter is an incubator structure for accelerating great innovative ideas of small businesses. In 2013, EDP Starter supported the development of 12 new start-ups in the energy area, generating new jobs and contributing to the growth of the Portuguese business fabric and the implementation of national technology in international markets (http://www.edpstarter.com/); x Technological Observatory – it aims to monitor and publicise technological development in the energy sector, focusing on clean energy”. The InovNotes website was developed for this purpose, for the publication of some of the studies conducted, e.g. Potential of residential load management”, in 2013 (inovnotes.edpinovacao.com); x EDP Inovação Prize – Annual competition in Portugal and Brazil that encourages the development of innovative business projects in clean energy technology or other sustainable areas (e.g. smart cities).The team of the winning project receives a cash prize (BRL 100,000 in Brazil and EUR 50,000 in Portugal) to establish the company and implement the project (www.edpbr.com.br/premio and www.premioedpinovacao.edp.pt). EDP promotes and supports cultural and social initiatives with the aim of contributing to the sustainable development of societies, based on citizenship shared by all, and continuously strengthening its reputation. EDP, to achieve this, socially invests in communities and explains the results it intends to achieve, evaluating the projects it engages in. It has adopted and actively participates in the development of the LBG methodology London Benchmarking Group, for this purpose (www.lbg-online.net). Total voluntary Social Investment of the EDP Group in 2013 was EUR 27 million (see table) and involved more than two million people and 1,816 institutions. The collaboration with EDP helped, in many cases, leverage support of around EUR 1.2 million for third parties. The three EDP foundations absorbed a major part of the Fundación EDP was created on 5 November funds and projects, within the scope of their with the aim of coordinating and enhancing responsibilities, developing innovative community the patronage activity and socio-cultural engagement policies and ensuring the expansion of the activities of the business units of the EDP LBG methodology to all group countries.

EDP promotes the development and well-being of its employees and teams by encouraging volunteering, which also fosters a culture of social responsibility and corporate citizenship (additional information on page 60). Moreover, EDP volunteering is a means of building the capabilities of institutions of the Third Sector when it involves volunteering employees' skills. Lastly, the volunteering policy is an instrument for bringing EDP closer to the Communities and fostering links. In the EDP Group as a whole, 255,644 people directly benefited from the activities of EDP Volunteering in 2013, and 15,519 people were indirectly benefited. A total of 1,763 EDP volunteers participated in these initiatives (3% higher EDP joined GCVC/IAVE in 2013, with the than in 2012). They were joined by 3,636 volunteers who are aim of sharing its experience and identifying not employed by EDP. This mobilisation generated 13,506 the best practices for developing hours of voluntary work during working hours (29% higher meritorious volunteering programmes. The than in 2012), which equates to an investment of EUR International Association for Volunteer Effort 410,636 by EDP in terms of company working hours. (IAVE) was founded in 1970 by a group of volunteers from different areas. The Since its inception in 2011, the EDP Volunteering Programme organisation grew and became a global has mobilised 11,229 interventions, granting 31,406 hours of volunteering network present in 70 volunteer work during working hours, which equates to EUR countries that seeks to promote, strengthen 866,000. and enhance the development of The results of the EDP Volunteering Programme earned the volunteering worldwide. IAVE subsequently company three awards in 2013. On a nationwide scale, EDP created a council, the Global Corporate won a Junior Achievement Portugal award, which is an Volunteering Council (GCVC), which association of companies that promotes entrepreneurship encompasses the large companies with culture among students through corporate volunteering, and volunteering programmes that share the an award from the Meios e Publicidade magazine.

In 2013, EDP recorded 37 signed partnership agreements, by setting targets directly linked to the Volunteering Programme as a means of ensuring the expansion of the model, the improvement of the processes and effectiveness of the results. This result meant the 2015 goal was achieved ahead of schedule. At the organisational level, the EDP business units consolidated strategies and reporting, validating processes, maximising resources and prioritising actions increasingly focused on volunteer skills, through cooperation between the Foundations and Human Resources departments. An example of this strategy is the creation of an Electrician Volunteers Pool, together with EDP Distribuição. Launched as a pilot scheme in June 2013 with Santa Casa da Misericordia de Lisboa, EDP Distribuição expanded the pool to the entire country. It now has 22 volunteers and covers 10 locations. The creation of an Energy Auditor Volunteers Pool is planned for 2014, following the first pro bono energy audit of the Red Cross building in Porto. Similarly, after the successful startup of the Lean volunteering of EDP Produção in 2012, which has taken the LEAN methodologies to schools, involving teachers, students, parents and school administrators, it is now underway in all the schools of the Abrigada schools group, involving about 70 teachers, 40 staff, 800 students and parents. The method is now starting up in two other school groups, in Constância and Figueira da Foz. EDP aims to contribute to the development of the local communities territorially linked to generation centres. It promotes the strengthening of continuous and lasting relationships. A specific example of this volunteering policy for sharing with communities is the 101 projects supported by EDP as part of the agreement with the National Association of Portuguese Municipalities in the municipalities where ordinary status hydroelectric plants are sited. The funds for this programme totalled EUR 5 million in 2013. Another patent example is the EDP Solidária Barragens programme, designed to support social projects. It supported 10 projects in 2013, selected from 60 applications by regional welfare institutions, in a total of EUR 200,000. EDP contributes, besides Voluntary Social Investment, with socio-environmental measures associated with the construction of new energy harnessing plants, which are not limited by but arise from binding commitments. In this context, EDP ensures the involvement of local communities in a process of continuous dialogue and it seeks to integrate their expectations in the definition of the measures, (www.a-nossa-energia.edp.pt). EDP focuses on programmes targeting local development priorities, aiming to maximise the results. The local development programmes of the Sabor and Tua regions are an example of this, which enabled the creation of 85 new companies and more than 100 new jobs in 2013.Furthermore, about 30% of the workers/subcontracted services for the construction projects were of local origin, in the same period. Support was also provided to an entrepreneurship training project that encompassed 123 students, with the purpose of fostering the economic development of the region. In another field, the “Novos Povoadores” project attracted two families to settle in Alijó. In parallel, an organisation of producers was created in connection with the Sustentabilidade Rural project and another one is in the process of establishment, aimed at the production and marketing of stone fruit and vegetables. An initiative to regularly supply households with baskets of countryside produce for general consumption and Easter and The Christmas campaign was launched in Christmas hampers was also implemented.

In addition to the referred initiatives, various environmental impacts shall be monitored during the construction, particularly those impacting on local populations. If any unusual situations are recorded, strict environmental monitoring of the project is imposed. Lastly, it should be noted that most operating generation centres have Environmental Management Systems (EMS) certified by the ISO 14001 standard and registered under EMAS regulations. These systems also include the management of local communities. EDP seeks to achieve the lowest possible social and environmental impact through its operations. To achieve this objective, the company uses methods of assessing impacts and to find out about the expectations of the people involved, and establishes programmes to mitigate the negative effects. Distribution lines and hydroelectric plants construction projects in 2013 entailed the development of plans for the relocation of families, involving the affected communities, municipalities and EDP. Examples of this are: x The Itapeti São José Overhead Distribution Line, Brazil, entailed the relocation of 18 families. In partnership with the Mogi das Cruzes municipal council, which built the new housing development, EDP provided the electricity infrastructure (construction of the secondary network and branch lines to the distribution poles) for the new homes; x The new Jari hydroelectric plant in the municipality of Santo Antônio do Jari, Brazil, involves the construction of a new village to provide homes to the 34 families of the village of Iratapuru. The new village will be provided with basic sanitation, power and health, security and leisure facilities; x The Cachoeira Caldeirão hydroelectric development at Amapá, Brazil, will flood about 2,600 hectares of land. The relocation of 244 families is forecast, 102 to the rural area and 142 to the urban area of Porto Grande. This comprises a significant relocation programme. In 2013, the EDP Group’s net profit attributable to EDP Shareholders reached EUR 1,005 million, compared with EUR 1,012 million in 2012. Net profit decreased 1%, supported by a 3% decrease in EBIT.

EBITDA resilience was grounded on: (i) operations in Brazil (+EUR 47 million), deepened by significant recovery of past tariff deviations in distribution, (ii) wind operations (+EUR 81 million excluding the EUR 71 million hit from regulatory changes), backed by capacity additions and higher average load factors; and (iii) liberalised activities, on strong hydro resources and higher revenues obtained from energy management. Also, Forex had a negative impact of EUR 97 million backed by 13% depreciation of the Brazilian real and by 3% depreciation of US dollar, both versus the Euro. EBITDA adjusted for Forex impact would have grown by 2%.

EDP Group’s net operating costs increase by 7% year-on-year, to EUR 1,934 million in 2013. EDP Group’s controllable operating costs (supply and services, personnel costs and costs with social benefits) fell by 2% yearon-year, to EUR 1,573 million in 2013, backed by the successful execution of our corporate efficiency program OPEX III. Other net operating costs rose by EUR 161m year-on-year, to EUR 361 million in 2013, mainly including: i) new taxes, namely in Spain (EUR 121 million); ii) EUR 43 million of penalties at Pecém I; iii) a EUR 56 million gain on the sale of gas assets in Spain and iv) EUR 13 million year-on-year from higher gains with the sale of real estate in Brazil. Net depreciation and amortisation (net of compensation from depreciation and amortisation of subsidised assets) increased by 1% to EUR 1,477 million in 2013, reflecting: i) +EUR 26 million at EDP Brasil driven by both Pecém I coal plant commissioning and an impact from the accelerated depreciation of some distribution assets; ii) new hydro capacity in Portugal; and iii) a EUR 31 million impairment at most of our co-generation and waste facilities in Spain, following the announced regulatory cuts; which were mostly compensated by iii) -EUR 15 million at EDP Renováveis on the back of lower impairments (EUR 53 million in 2012 versus EUR 20 million in 2013); and iv) the combined effects of the decommissioning of our Setubal fuel-oil power plant in Portugal, the sale of our Soporgen cogeneration facility in Portugal, fewer working hours at our coal plants in Spain and a 10 years extension (from 25 to 35 years) of the useful life of our CCTGs. Financial results, EUR 32m lower year-on-year at -EUR 737million in 2013, reflect a EUR 0.2 billion increase in the average net debt and a 40bp year-on-year rise in average cost of debt (to 4.4% in 2013). Non-controlling interests went up 11% year-on-year to EUR 189 million in 2013, driven by higher net profit at the level of EDP Renováveis and by EDP Renováveis sale of minority stakes in wind farms to Borealis (Vento II), China Three Gorges (EDP Renováveis Portugal) and Fiera Axium (Wheat Field). Consolidated capex decreased 2% year-on-year to EUR 1,978 million in 2013. Note that in January 2013, EDP Renováveis cashed-in a EUR 91 million cash-grant in the United States of America related to Marble River wind farm installed in the fourth quarter of 2012). Excluding this impact, consolidated capex went up 3% year-on-year to EUR 2,069 million, driven by a 7% increase in expansion capex, translating the on-going construction of new hydro and wind capacity. Maintenance capex fell 5% year-on-year to EUR 656 million in 2013, reflecting lower needs for both investments at our Iberian regulated networks and maintenance works at our Spanish thermal plants.

It is expected that Baixo Sabor and Ribeiradio-Ermida enter into operation in the fourth quarter of 2014, Venda Nova III and Salamonde in the second quarter of 2015 and Foz Tua in the second quarter of 2016. Capex in new wind and solar capacity, at EDP Renováveis level, totalled EUR 536 million, or EUR 627 million excluding the EUR 91 million cash-grant received in January 2013. This capex was allocated to capacity additions in 2013 (+50MW of solar in Romania and +387MW of wind, from which 357MW were installed in Europe and 30MW regard to EDP Renováveis’s first wind project in Canada) and to the 224MW of capacity under construction, most of which in the United States of America (200MW). In Brazil, capex totalled EUR 426 million in 2013, the bulk of which (71%) devoted to new generation capacity: EUR 44 million invested in Pecém I, our 360MW coal plant which was commissioned in the second quarter of 2013; and EUR 257 million invested in new hydro plants, namely Jari (373MW due in January 2015) and Cachoeira Caldeirão (219MW due in January 2017). EDP Group’s consolidated net debt at the December 2013 amounted to EUR 17,451 million, resulting from a gross nominal debt of EUR 19,792 million deducted mainly by an amount of cash and equivalents of EUR 2,180 million, which was held, mainly, at EDP S.A., EDP Finance BV and other (EUR 1,624 million), Group’s Brazilian subsidiaries (EUR 291 million), and EDP Renováveis (EUR 265 million), and collateral deposits in the amount of (EUR 449 million). When compared to December 2012, the Group’s net debt was nearly EUR 782 million lower, mostly due to securitization of electricity tariff deficit and the reclassification of Cachoeira Caldeirão and Jari as assets for sale and consequent deconsolidation of its debt (BRL 1,057 million). In terms of maturity, EDP Group’s consolidated debt breaks down into 19% in short-term and 81% in medium and long-term, with an average maturity of 4 years. EDP maintained in 2013 its policy of centralizing funding at EDP S.A., EDP Finance BV and EDP Sucursal, which represented 88% of the Group’s consolidated debt. The remainder consists of debt contracted by the Brazilian holdings (7%) and project finance debt (mainly from the subsidiaries of the EDP Renewables Group – 4%, and EDP Produção Group 1%). Regarding the loan markets, in January 2013, EDP Finance B.V. entered into a new Term Loan Facility, in the amount of EUR 1,600 million with a tenor of 5 years and involving a syndicate of 16 banks. The facility was fully drawn during the year mostly to refinance two facilities that had been raised in 2006 and 2008 and matured in April and November. In the second semester of 2013, EDP Finance BV issued in September a 7 year bond in the amount of EUR 750 million and in November a long 7 year in the amount of EUR 600 million bond. These issues allowed EDP to reach different markets and investors and to strengthen its liquidity position. During 2013 the Group received EUR 487 million from the FADE, the Spanish Electricity Deficit Amortisation Fund, through its subsidiary Hidroeléctrica Del Cantábrico S.A. for the securitization of the Spanish Tariff Deficit. In Portugal, EDP sold a portion of approximately EUR 440.5 million, and the respective interest, of the 2012 tariff deficit and EUR 149.8 million of the 2011 tariff deficit and has entered into an agreement for the assignment, by means of a true sale without recourse to Tagus – Sociedade de Titularização de Créditos, S.A., of a portion of the 2012 Tariff Deficit, and respective interest, for an amount of EUR 450 million. In January 2013, the Group contracted a project finance for Romania in the total amount of EUR 50 million, with maturity of 14 years and contracted a project finance for Poland in the total amount of PLN 136 million, with maturity of 15 years. Maintaining a prudent financial management policy, by December 2013 EDP had access to EUR 2,159 million of available credit lines and EUR 100 million of commercial paper with underwriting commitment, fully available. It is the Group’s policy to diversify its liquidity sources through high credit standing banks. Additionally the Group has a EUR 1,000 million Euro Commercial Paper programme (ECP) at EDP SA level and a EUR 500 million “Pagarés” programme at HC Energia. Both programmes are not committed, being used for the Group short term treasury management. As at 31 December, the total amount issued of ECP and “Pagarés” amounted to EUR 107.5 million. In 2013, the average cost of debt of the EDP Group was 4.4% per year and approximately 47% of its debt and borrowings had a fixed rate. In terms of currencies, Euro continues to be the main funding currency of EDP at 75%. The USD financing contracted to fund the capex of the Group’s US subsidiary justifies the exposure to USD of 17%. In March 2013, following the revision of the sovereign rating, Standard & Poor's (“S&P”) affirmed EDP’s rating at “BB+” revising its outlook from negative to stable. In September, S&P placed its ‘‘BB+’’ long-term corporate credit and issue ratings on EDP on CreditWatch with negative implications. At the same time, S&P affirmed shortterm corporate credit debt ratings on EDP at ‘‘B’’. The negative CreditWatch placement mirrors that on the Republic of Portugal, on 18 September, since by S&P’s rating criteria, sovereign risk is a key factor that influences utilities’ credit strength. After year end, in January 2014, S&P affirmed its 'BB+' long-term and ‘B’ short-term corporate credit ratings on EDP and removed the long-term ratings from CreditWatch with negative implications. The outlook is stable. The affirmation and removal from CreditWatch follows S&P’s similar action on Portugal, on January 17th, 2014. A lowering of S&P’s long-term rating on Portugal by up to two notches would leave the rating on EDP unchanged, all else remaining equal. In June and again in November 2013 Moody's Investors Service Limited (“Moody’s”) affirmed EDP’s rating at “Ba1” with negative Outlook. In July 2013, Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) placed all utilities with sizeable exposure to Spain, including EDP, on Rating Watch Negative, following the Spanish Government’s announcement, on July 12th, of proposed new regulatory measures to permanently resolve the excess cost or tariff deficit generated by the Spanish electricity system. In January 2014, Fitch has maintained EDP on Rating Watch Negative. EDP’s credit rating stands as of December 2013 two notches above the Republic of Portugal by Moody’s and one notch by Standard and Poor’s and by Fitch. EBITDA from long-term contracted generation was 9% lower year-on-year at EUR 726 million in 2013 as higher mini-hydro output stemming from rainy weather in 2013 (+EUR 32 million in 2013), was offset by the end of Setúbal fuel oil plant PPA in Dec-12 (EBITDA: EUR 98 million in 2012); and the sale of Soporgen’s cogeneration plant (EBITDA: EUR 12 million in 2012). Gross profit from PPA/CMEC dropped by EUR 131 million in 2013 to EUR 769 million, following the end of Setúbal PPA (EUR 113 million in 2012). The annual deviation between market gross profit under CMECs assumptions and gross profit under current market conditions (‘revisibility’) amounted EUR 129 million in 2013: EUR 116 million in the first half of 2013 and EUR 13 million in the second half of 2013, mainly driven by low spot prices. Deviation at hydro plants totalled EUR 37 million as the impact from a production 14% above CMEC’s reference was overwhelmed by an average realised price 22% below CMEC’s reference. In turn, market gross profit at our Sines coal plant stood EUR 92 million below the CMEC’s reference, due to shorter volumes and average clean dark spread below the CMEC’s reference, by 15% and 14%, respectively. Gross profit from production under the special regime rose by EUR 25 million, to EUR 113 million in 2013, propelled by a 131% surge in mini-hydro’s output which more than compensated the sale of Soporgen’s 67MW cogeneration plant in January 2013 (EUR 14 million gross profit in 2012). EBITDA from liberalised activities in Iberia rose by 11% in 2013, to EUR 349 million. Despite the adverse regulatory and market environment, EBITDA growth was prompted by: i) doubling hydro output, propelled by rainy weather in 2013 versus 2012, which justified a 16% drop in the average generation cost; ii) 3% fall in average cost of electricity purchases in the wholesale market due to adequate management of volatility in the energy markets and iii) higher volumes and average selling prices to final clients: +5% and +3%, respectively. In terms of regulation, EBITDA was hit by EUR 78 million of new generation taxes in Spain in 2013, no capacity payments in Portugal in 2013 versus EUR 7 million in 2012 and by a EUR 9 million reduction in capacity payment in Spain. In the electricity business, gross profit in the electricity business went up 11%, to EUR 825m in 2013, driven by a higher average unit margin which rose from EUR 11.4/MWh in 2012 to EUR 13.4/MWh in 2013. Volumes sold rose by 3% to 45TWh in 2013, reflecting a 5% increase in volumes sold to retail and 1% increase in volumes sold in wholesale market. Average sourcing cost fell by 6% year-on-year following the combined impact from lower generation costs (-16%) on higher hydro volumes and cheaper electricity purchases (-3%). Average selling price was 1% lower in 2013, as higher average selling prices to retail clients offset the 9% fall in the average selling price in wholesale markets. In the liberalised generation activity in the Iberian market, output from our generation plants (unadjusted for hydro pumping) was 1% higher in 2013, at 13.3TWh, since the surge in hydro output (+2.2TWh) offset the fall in CCGT (-1.7TWh) and coal (-0.3TWh). Average production cost dropped by 18%, to EUR 32/MWh in 2013, reflecting an increase in the contribution from hydro (cheaper technology). As from 1-January-2013, there are no CO2 free allowances for the power sector and all emission allowances are to be bought in the market. Output from our coal plants fell 5% in 2013, backed by strong hydro and wind resources in Iberia during the year. Average load factor was 2pp lower, at 50% in 2013. Generation from Spanish domestic coal amounted to 648GWh in 2013 versus 1,044GWh in 2012. Average production cost rose by 9%, to EUR 40/MWh due to higher CO2 costs following the end of free allowances. Output from our CCGTs retreated by 54% in 2013, driven by lower demand for thermal production and low competitiveness of gas versus coal, implying a 5pp decline in average load factor, to 4% in 2013. Average production cost rose to EUR 106/MWh in 2013, mostly driven by a lower dilution of gas procurement fixed costs. Output from our Hydro generation doubled in 2013, propelled by both rainy weather conditions and additional capacity (Alqueva II). Despite higher volumes of pumping (840GWh in 2013 versus 626GWh in 2012), the average cost of hydro production fell 56% to EUR 4.2/MWh, reflecting stronger hydro resources. Pumping activity was concentrated at Alqueva plant. Regarding regulation, in Portugal, CCGT’s capacity payments were interrupted as from 1-June-2012 (EUR 7 million in 2012) and are due to be replaced by lower incentives as from the year after the end of Portugal’s bailout program. In Spain, the government approved in December 2012 several taxes aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the electricity sector, including a 7% tax on revenues and different taxes on gas/coal consumption, water use and nuclear waste. Following the RDL9/2013, the government submitted to the Spanish Regulator a set of Royal Decrees drafts which define namely: i) changes in the remuneration rules for ancillary services; ii) cut in the capacity payment from EUR 26/kW to EUR 10/kW although doubling the remaining payment period; and iii) change in the availability incentive mechanism. In the electricity supply business in Spain, electricity volume supplied to our clients in the free market fell by 9% in 2013, to 17.8TWh, despite a 12% increase in the number of clients supplied, following EDP’s strategy to focus on the most attractive customer segments. Market share was 2pp lower year-on-year, at 10% in 2013. In the electricity supply business in Portugal, electricity volume supplied to EDP clients in the free market in Portugal increased by 33% year-on-year, to 13.1TWh in 2013, propelled by a 124% expansion of our client base. EDP’s market share in the free market rose from 40% in 2012 to 44% in 2013, in line with EDP’s strategy to focus on the more attractive residential/SMEs segments. Our gas sourcing activity in 2013 was based on an annual 4.2bcm portfolio of long term contracts, whose flexibility has been enhanced through several contract renegotiations including changes in take or pay levels. Moreover, rather than using volumes available solely for electricity generation and for the sale to clients in the free market, EDP has chosen to divert part of its take-or-pay gas volumes to wholesale markets, where prices are significantly higher. As a result, our gas consumption declined 12% to 39TWh (3.3bcm) in 2013 supported by a 51% drop in consumption by our gas fired power plants which more than offset the 6% increase in volumes sold to clients. Volumes of gas supplied to our clients in the liberalised market in Spain rose by 4%, to 28.6TWh in 2013, following the 3% expansion in the client portfolio. Market share decline 1pp to 5% in 2013. Volumes of gas supplied to our clients in the liberalised market in Portugal was 13% lower in 2013, at 5.3TWh, reflecting weaker volume in the industrial segment, stemming from the loss of one large client (cogeneration plant) in the third quarter of 2013. This was partially compensated by the volume increase in the residential segment following the gas market liberalisation. The strong pace of gas supply liberalisation, along with our successful dual offer (electricity + gas) to residential clients, prompted a jump in the number of clients from 56,000 in December 2012 to 224,000 in December 2013. In accordance with the rules and calendar defined for the liberalisation of electricity supply in Portugal, the electricity last resort supplier (EDP Serviço Universal) can no longer accept new customers (with the exception of those entitled to the social tariff). Additionally, all remaining consumers under the regulated tariff will have to move to the free market until the end of the on-going transitory period: until December 2014 for clients with contracted power above 10.35 kVA and until December 2015 for clients with contracted power below 10.35 kVA. During the transitory period, the regulator may update the transitory tariff every quarter to promote the switch to the free market. In this context, the switching of electricity consumers to the free market during the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2013 was very strong. During 2013, the numbers of consumers in the free market doubled, to 2.3 million and as of December 2013 84% of B2B clients and 37% of residential consumers were already in the liberalised market, corresponding to 73% of total consumption. Regulated networks activity in Iberia includes our activities of distribution of electricity and gas in Portugal and Spain and our activity of transport of gas in Spain. EBITDA from regulated networks in Iberia was 3% lower year-on-year (-EUR 34 million), at EUR 1,023 million in 2013, mainly driven by: i) lower regulated revenues, namely in the electricity distribution in Portugal based on a lower regulated rate of return on assets (-EUR 44 million, stemming from a return on RAB of 8.56% in 2013 versus 10.05% in 2012); ii) application of Law 9/2013 in Spain in the second half of 2013 resulted in a EUR 9 million negative impact in EBITDA for electricity distribution in Spain; iii) -EUR 5 million in gas distribution on no inflation indexing in 2013; which was partially compensated by tight cost control focused on OPEX efficiency. Regulatory receivables in Iberia include tariff adjustment in electricity and gas in Portugal and Spain and the revisibility component associated to CMEC. Regulatory receivables in Iberia from regulated activity increased by EUR 65 million in 2013, from EUR 2,621 million in December 2012 to EUR 2,686 million in December 2013, driven by a EUR 225 million increase in Portugal and a EUR 160 million decrease in Spain. EBITDA from electricity distribution and last resort supply activities in Portugal fell 5% year-on-year (-EUR 32 million) to EUR 619 million in 2013, mainly impacted by a decline in the regulated rate of return on assets from 10.05% in 2012 to 8.56% in 2013. This decline, derived from the decline of Portuguese Republic 5-year CDS, resulted in a EUR 44 million erosion in gross profit. Last resort supplier regulated revenues decreased by 12% (-EUR 11 million), to EUR 82 million in 2013, reflecting the fast consumers’ switching to the free market. As part of the rules and calendar defined for the phasing out of regulated tariffs in Portugal, EDP Serviço Universal can no longer accept new clients as from 1 January 2013, while the regulator can apply quarterly tariff increases in order to encourage clients’ transfer to a liberalised supplier. The volume of electricity supplied by last resort supplier fell 29% year-on-year, to 14.0TWh in 2013 due to clients’ migration to the liberalised market. Total clients supplied declined 1,224 thousands yearon-year to 3,807 thousands in December 2013. On 15 December 2013, ERSE published a final version of tariffs and regulated revenues for 2014 for our electricity distribution and last resort supply activities in Portugal setting a 2.8% average annual increase for electricity tariffs in Portugal. EBITDA from our electricity distribution activity in Spain was 9% lower year-on-year, at EUR 118 million in 2013, reflecting flat regulated revenues (in the wake of different regulatory initiatives throughout 2013) and a lower impact from the application of IFRIC18 (-EUR 16 million year-on-year, largely due to EUR 15 million income in the third quarter of 2012 following the commissioning of the substation in Gijón (Asturias)). Electricity distributed by EDP España, mostly in the region of Asturias, increased by 2% to 9.1TWh in 2013. EBITDA from regulated gas distribution in Spain amounted to EUR 237 million in 2013 (+EUR 22 million year-onyear), supported by: (i) a EUR 56 million gain stemming from the sale of our transmission gas assets to Enagas in the first quarter of 2013; (ii) -EUR 27 million derived from the de-consolidation of gas transmission assets; and (iii) regulated revenues in the distribution business 1% lower year-on-year. Regulated revenues declined by 14% (-EUR 32 million) to EUR 203 million, mainly due to the disposal of gas transmission assets (-EUR 31 million) and lack of inflation indexing (-EUR 5 million). The volume of gas distributed was 8% lower year-on-year, at 52TWh, dragged by lower activity by some industrial clients. EBITDA from gas distribution in Portugal was 19% lower year-on-year (-EUR 12 million), at EUR 50 million, essentially due to a EUR 13 million positive impact from the agreement for the economic and financial balance of the concession (July 2012). Notwithstanding the 6% growth in the number of supply points prompted by the continuing effort of new client connection in the region operated by EDP, volume distributed fell by 5% year-on-year, driven by the loss of one large client to the very high pressure grid. On 14 June 2013, ERSE published the new regulatory framework defined for the regulatory period from July 2013 to June 2016. ERSE set: (i) a 3.9% increase in the average last resort supply tariff as from 1 July 13 until 30 June 2014; (ii) rate of return on assets of 9% (on a preliminary basis); (iii) regulated revenues of EUR 65 million for the first regulatory year. It should be noted that for the new regulatory period, ERSE indexed the regulated rate of return on assets to the average of Portuguese Republic 5-year bond yield between 1-October and 30September prior to the beginning of each regulatory year, with a floor at 7.83% and cap at 11%. EDP Renováveis owns and operates EDP Group wind and solar power assets and develops projects for new renewable capacity. The two main markets in which EDP Renováveis operates are the United States of America (35% of EDP Renováveis’ EBITDA in 2013) and Spain (33%). Other markets include Portugal (14%), France, Poland, Romania, Belgium, Italy and Brazil (the latter 6 representing 18% of EDP Renováveis' EBITDA in 2013). EDP Renováveis’ EBITDA rose 1% year-on-year (+EUR 9 million) to EUR 947 million in 2013 driven by strong load factor in Iberia in 2013, negative regulatory developments in Spain and higher installed capacity but lower prices in Poland and Romania. EBITDA in 2013 includes the negative cumulative impact of EUR 71 million related to all 2013 Spanish regulatory changes. Forex impact on EBITDA totaled -EUR 13 million due to a 3% depreciation of US dollar and Brazilian real versus Euro. In the United States, installed capacity totaled 3.6 GW as of December 2013, stable year-on-year. Electricity output increased by 2% year-on-year, reaching 10.1 TWh as higher average installed capacity in operation during the period offset the lower load factor year-on-year. Average selling price (excluding revenues from PTCs) for energy sold through PPA/hedged increased 1% year-on-year to USD53/MWh resulting from the contracted price escalators and the contribution of new PPAs in the period. Average selling price for merchant wind farms improved 2% year-on-year to USD32/MWh, following an increase in wholesale electricity prices. Overall, average selling price in the United States increased 3% year-on-year to USD49/MWh in 2013. Gross profit (including revenues from PTCs) increased by 4% to USD 648 million, while EBITDA rose USD 42 million year-on-year to USD 450 million in 2013 including the USD 18 million one off impact from the restructuring of the off-taking volumes of a long-term PPA for 200MW (from 100% to 80%). It should be noted that in the fourth quarter of 2013, EDP Renováveis concluded the sale of a 49% equity stake in a 97MW wind farms’ portfolio to Fiera Axium. In Spain, in the first half of 2013, all the wind energy produced in Spain was remunerated according to the Feedin Tariff of the RD661/2007. In July 2013, the Spanish Government announced the RDL 9/2013, setting changes for renewable assets’ remuneration scheme. The proposal for a new mechanism is available for consultation but its entry into force is still pending. In Spain, EDP Renováveis’ EBITDA decreased by 8% to EUR 320 million year-on-year in 2013 negatively impacted by EUR 32 million from the 7% tax over sales in Spain introduced in January 2013 and EUR 17 million related to changes in remuneration framework for renewable assets, introduced in July 2013 and pending for approval. Average load factor improved 3pp year-on-year to 29% in 2013, while electricity generated went up by 14% year-on-year to 5.8TWh in 2013 on the back of stronger wind resource. Average selling price reached €80/MWh, down 7% year-on-year driven by the end of the transitory regime and changes in regulation (all capacity in fixed tariff option) and cumulative changes in regulation during the year. In Portugal, EDP Renováveis’ EBITDA increased by 9% year-on-year to EUR 129 million in 2013, up EUR 11 million year-on-year. Wind production increased 10% year-on-year to 1,593GWh following an increase of average load factor by 3pp to 29%. Average tariff decreased by 3% year-on-year to EUR 99/MWh due to negative correlation between prices and annual working hours. Still in Portugal, EDP Renováveis holds an equity stake in ENEOP consortium (equity consolidated), licensed to build 1,335MW of wind capacity (535MW attributable to EDP Renováveis). In June 2013, EDP Renováveis completed the sale of a 49% equity stake, and a 25% of the shareholders loans in EDP Renováveis Portugal (excluding ENEOP) to China Three Gorges, for EUR 368 million. As of December 2013, ENEOP had an installed capacity of 1,138MW (455MW attributable to EDP Renováveis). In December 2013, EDP Renováveis signed a Memorandum of Understanding with CTG for the sale of 49% in EDP Renováveis’ 40% share in ENEOP consortium whose conclusion is expected in 2015. In European markets out of Iberia, gross profit increased 19% to EUR 217 million due to a 23% year-on-year increase of output to 2,132GWh in 2013 following a 42% or 403MW increase of installed capacity over the last 12 months. However, EBITDA decreased by 6% year-on-year (-EUR 11 million) to EUR 161 million in 2013 due to a gain related to the allocation of purchase price allocation to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities, the bulk of it in Italy and Romania booked in 2012. In France, EDP Renováveis has 322MW of capacity (+8MW year-on-year). Wind power in France is sold through fixed tariffs indexed to inflation for 15 years. In 2013, average tariff was EUR 90/MWh (+1% year-on-year). In Oct-13, EDP Renováveis sold 49% equity shareholding and outstanding shareholders loans in a wind farm portfolio of 100MW located in France to Axpo Group, which is still pending approval. As of December 2013, EDP Renováveis had 12MW under construction in France. In Belgium, EDP Renováveis has 71MW of capacity (+14MW year-on-year), which sell its power through PPA at a fixed selling price of EUR 112/MWh. In Italy, EDP Renováveis has 70MW (+30MW year-on-year) of capacity installed in December 2013. Average selling tariff was EUR 138/MWh in 2013. For capacity installed in 2013 and onwards, wind farms will be remunerated under a feed-in tariff scheme defined by tenders. In Poland, EDP Renováveis has 370MW of capacity (+180MW in 2013): i) 120MW from Margonin wind farm, which power is sold in the wholesale market and for whose EDP Renováveis has a 15 years long term contract for the sale of Green Certificates; ii) 70MW from Korsze wind farm, which output is sold through a 10 year PPA and iii) the remaining 180W, whose output is sold at “regulated electricity price + Green Certificates” (regulated price for 2013 is PLN201.4/MWh). In 2013, average selling price decreased by 6% year-on-year to PLN401/MWh. As of December 2013, EDP Renováveis had 10MW under construction in Poland. In Romania, EDP Renováveis has 521MW of capacity (+172MW in 2013), of which 50MW are solar PV (+12MW in 2013). Wind production is sold at ‘market price plus Green Certificates’, whose value is subject to a floor and a cap set in Euros (for 2013, floor was set at EUR 28.9/MWh and the cap at EUR 58.8/MWh). In 2013, average selling price decreased by 19% year-on-year to RON490/MWh, impacted by lower green certificate prices driven by the uncertainty created through the approval by the Romania Government of the Emergency Government Ordinance 57/2013 . In Brazil, EDP Renováveis has 84MW in operation remunerated through long term contracts (20 years). EDP Renováveis has currently 236MW under development in Brazil awarded at the energy A-5 auctions with PPA’s for a period of 20-years from which 120 MW will start in January 2016 with a price set at BRL97/MWh, indexed to the Brazilian inflation rate and 116MW will start in January 2018 with price set at BRL109/MWh, indexed to the Brazilian inflation rate. EDP Brasil's contribution to consolidated EBITDA advanced by 9% (+EUR 47 million), to EUR 582 million in 2013, driven by 24% increase in local currency, to BRL 1,670m, and an unfavourable Forex impac of -EUR 83 million stemming from a 13% depreciation of the Brazilian real versus the Euro. EBITDA from distribution rose by 41% year-on-year (+BRL 243 million), benefiting from the recovery in 2013 of significant past tariff deviations, through CDE contributions. EBITDA from generation and supply rose by 14% year-on-year (+BRL 115 million), mainly reflecting a positive evolution of Pecém I coal plant versus 2012 (positive contribution in the second half of 2013). EBITDA from our electricity distribution activity in Brazil went up 41% year-on-year (+BRL 243 million) to BRL 832 million in 2013, reflecting a strong increase in negative tariff deviations (+BRL 331 million), with 2013 deviations being nearly compensated by CDE (“Conta de desenvolvimento energético”) contributions (+BRL 595 million), positive tariff readjustments at our distribution companies and market growth. Volumes of electricity sold went up 2% year-on-year in 2013, reflecting a 5% increase in the ‘residential, commercial and other’ segments, justified by a wider client base and higher consumption per capita. Volumes sold in the regulated market to the industrial segment fell 4% year-on-year, due to the migration of clients to the free market. At the same time, volumes distributed to industrial clients in the free market advanced 6% year-on-year, backed by growing activity in auto and metallurgy sectors, which supported a 4% year-on-year increase of electricity distributed. In January 2013, ANEEL approved an 18% decrease in tariffs for residential customers and up to a 32% decrease for industrials, on the back of a cut in electricity costs achieved through Provisory Act No. 579, then converted into Law 12.783/13, which translated into a drop in electricity sector charges, and lower generation costs, following the concessions’ renewal contracts which matured between 2015 and 2017. The subsequent mismatch between the energy procurement contracts and supply obligations led to involuntary short contracting positions at our distribution companies. In March 2013, through DL 7.945/13, the Brazilian Government approved the transfer of funds, from an electricity sector account called CDE, to compensate distribution companies facing higher costs, derived from the strong thermal dispatch and the subsequent hike in spot prices, as well as from the short contracting position, as distribution companies had to satisfy demand through electricity purchases at high spot prices. EBITDA from our electricity generation activities in Brazil went up 13% year-on-year (+BRL 96 million) to BRL 855 million in 2013, partly reflecting lower negative contributions from Pecém I coal plant (-BRL 104 million in 2012 and -BRL 53 million in 2013). Excluding the impact from Pecém I, EBITDA went up 5% year-on-year (+BRL 45 million) to BRL 908 million in 2013, reflecting higher average selling prices and improved hydro conditions in the fourth quarter of 2013, with generators not having to purchase energy at market prices to meet their PPA obligations, contrarily to what happened in the fourth quarter of 2012, due to the strongly adverse hydro conditions that shaped the end of 2012. Electricity volumes sold rose 15% year-on-year to 11TWh in 2013 on the back of Pecém I contribution. Excluding this impact, volumes sold stood relatively flat at 8.2TWh in 2013. Average selling price went up 10% year-onyear, following: i) PPA prices inflation updates, as most of the capacity is contracted under long term PPAs; ii) the termination, in December 2012, of some contracts with a selling price well below average; and iii) short-term contracts for 2013 closed at higher prices as part of the seasonality strategy. In December 2013, within the scope of EDP’s strategic partnership with China Three Gorges, EDP Brasil signed a Memorandum of Understanding with CWE Investment Corporation, a fully owned subsidiary of China Three Gorges, for the joint development of renewable projects, including the disposal by EDP Brasil of a 50% stake in Jari and a 50% stake in Cachoeira Caldeirão. The trading and supply activity in Brazil is carried out by our EDP Comercializadora subsidiary in the free market essentially through a service of energy sourcing to large industrial clients without incurring in material energy market risk. In 2013, electricity supply gross profit rose BRL 56 million year-on-year to BRL 76 million in 2013, reflecting a favorable long position and higher volumes supplied to clients, benefiting from higher spot prices. Note that in 2012, EBITDA includes a BRL 21 million gain related to the reversal of impairment losses on an energy contract, following an agreement reached with Ampla. The creation of shareholder value is sustained in the ability of the company to increase its net income, dividends and share prices, ie, is supported by the sum of strategic decisions affecting the sustainability of the Group's business activities assuming strategic importance the low risk profile assumed by EDP. As opposed to the previous year, 2013 was marked by the recovery of the European utilities sector increasing 9.2%. However the sector was still one of the lowest performing sectors in Europe (fifth lower performance from the twenty European super-sectors). The sector benefited by a better macro outlook pointing to the end of recession in Europe, which compensated additional regulatory pressures, namely in Spain with the announcement of further measures to reduce the tariff deficit impacting Iberian utilities. In this context, EDP stock closed the year with a return of 16.6%. Based on the payment of dividends to shareholders held on May 23, 2013 (€ 0.185 per share) which implied a dividend yield of 6.9% (based on December 31th closing price), generating a total shareholder return for 2013 of 24.7%. EDP has followed a sustained policy of dividend distribution that seeks to reconcile strict compliance with the relevant provisions of the law and Articles of Association and division among all its shareholders of a significant portion of the value created by the Group, in keeping with the specific conditions of the company and market. This policy is designed to enable shareholders to obtain an adequate return on their investment without compromising the company's value. Pursuant to these rules, the table below shows the dividends distributed by EDP in the last two terms of office of the corporate bodies: Year Approval Date Payment Date Gross Dividend 2006 4/12/2007 5/4/2007 € 0.110 2007 4/10/2008 5/8/2008 € 0.125 2008 4/15/2009 5/14/2009 € 0.140 2009 4/16/2010 5/13/2010 € 0.155 2010 4/14/2011 5/13/2011 € 0.170 2011 5/16/2012 5/11/2012 € 0.185 2012 5/23/2013 5/20/2013 € 0.185 For the 2012 financial year, the Executive Board of Directors of EDP submitted to the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders of 6 May 2013 a proposal for the appropriation of the net profit of 832.7 million euros, 676.5 million euros of which was for distribution to shareholders in the form of dividends. The proposal was approved by a majority of votes (99.9998%) at the General Meeting and a gross dividend of 0.185 euros per share was paid on 23 May 2013. EDP believes that a transparent relationship with investors and the market involves the definition of clear criteria and reasonable objectives for the dividend distribution policy, as the growing demands of the investor community, faced with the instability of the capital markets in recent years, have made clear. On the latest Investor Day held on 23 May 2012 with Portuguese and foreign investors and analysts, the goal of proposing to the General Meeting of Shareholders an annual payout of 55%-65% of the recurring net profit was reinforced, with a minimum of the dividend per share paid in 2011 (€0.185 per share). In the year of 2013 the markets assisted to an improvement of the major indexed versus the previous year. The European index Stoxx Europe 600 rose 17% with peripheral economies leading the gains as economies started to rebound (the Spanish index advancing 21% and the Athens index rising 28%). The major US indexes performed positively during the year as well, with changes varying between 27% and 38% (the S&P 500 index marked its best year since 1997). As for the Asian markets, the Nikkei followed the occidental markets trend going up by 57% on the back of an aggressive economic stimulus, while the Shanghai index reduced 7%. Emerging markets fared poorly on concerns that the Fed's move to scale backs its stimulus programme will choke off capital flows into their economies. The movement in the European markets was quite erratic this year. By March European shares shriveled as fears concerning Cyprus bailout program (that included a contribution by depositors) flooded investor’s confidence in European markets. The second quarter on the other hand was characterized by a surveillance of European and American monetary policy guidelines. Poorer macroeconomic data in Europe increased expectations of a cut in interest rates, being afterwards offset by concerns regarding FED (Federal Reserve) suspension of economic stimulus, Greek’s political tension and concerns regarding Chinese credit crunch, closing the first half of the year at minimums. The pressures from FED’s tapering were only clarified in December with the announcement of a tempered reduction of bond buying program. During the second half of the year, markets followed a more positive trend. The series of good company results pushed global indices to maximums (European markets reached five year maximums) despite the US government shutdown, consequence of the divergence regarding debt ceiling, which bucked the markets movements. The year of 2013 was also marked by a political crisis, which committed the improvement on investor’s confidence implying a deterioration of Portuguese yields and consequently the PSI20 index contracted 5.6% in that day. In the start of the third quarter, Standard & Poor’s placed Portugal’s “BB” rating under negative watch, after a positive revision in the beginning of the year, as a consequence of potential failure in achieving the established targets. On the other hand Moody’s revised the outlook to stable given better fiscal consolidation and growth perspectives, but still rated below investment grade (“Ba3”). Following these actions, in September Standard & Poor’s placed EDP’s “BB+” rating under negative credit watch as well while Moody’s maintained its “Ba1” rating with negative outlook. In July, the credit agency Fitch placed several utilities with significant exposure to Spain under negative watch given the announced regulatory measures to resolve the tariff deficit generated by the Spanish electricity system. This included EDP’s “BBB-“ rating. Despite the negative outlook revisions and rating below investment grade, EDP was able to refinance its funding needs over the year. In January EDP has signed a five year credit facility of 1,600 million euros through a club deal with 16 domestic and international banks. On September, the company issued a Eurobond in the Irish market. The issue amounted 750 million euros, maturing at September 2020. This was not the only issue in this market as latter one, in November it issued an additional 600 million euros bond maturing at 2021 being able to extend its average debt maturity. The company was able to successfully launch several securitization programs during the year. Regarding the Portuguese tariff deficit, the company was capable to securitize a total of 1,040 million euros, 973 million euros regarding the tariff deficit originated in 2012 and the remaining concerning the annual adjustment of the compensation due to the early termination of the PPAs (power purchase agreements). In Spain, FADE (Fondo de Amortización del Deficit Elétrico), entity responsible for the securitization of the Spanish electric system tariff deficits, was able to securitize some tranches of the tariff deficit, through private placements or public issues, in the amount of 8,010 million euros, of which 6.08% (or 487 million euros) belong to EDP Group through its subsidiary Hidrocantábrico. During the year, the transactions announced referring to the sale from EDP Renováveis of its 49% stake in EDP Renováveis Portugal and 25% shareholder loans to China Three Gorges (CTG) and of the sale to Enagás of the Spanish gas transmission business were concluded. There were also further developments regarding the strategic partnership established with CTG in 2011. At December 6th, two transactions were announced giving visibility to the 1 billion euros target investment by CTG. The announced transactions included the sale of 50% of the participation in Cachoeira Caldeirão and 50% participation in Jari for a total value of R$865 million (including future co-investment commitments), and the sale of 49% stake in Eólicas de Portugal (ENEOP) to CTG under similar terms to the previous deal announced in December 2012. As foreign exchange rate is concerned, the euro appreciated against the American dollar during the year on average by 3%, having a negative impact in the operating results for that country. Considering year end quotes the euro gained 4% to the American dollar softening the dollar denominated debt price, used to finance EDP’s investments in US wind-farm assets. As for the Brazilian real, the euro appreciated on average 14% resulting in a reduction of the operating income of Brazilian assets. At year end, the euro closed appreciating 20% versus the Brazilian real. Within the scope of the Brazilian A-5 auction carried in December, EDP Group was awarded, through EDP Brasil, the concession of São Manoel hydro plant with an installed capacity of 700 MW and under a PPA agreement for 30 years. In the same auction EDP Renováveis Brasil secured a 20 year PPA to sell electricity in the regulated market. 2013 was also a year of important regulatory changes within the electric sector, namely in Portugal, Spain and Brazil. In Portugal, it was proposed in the state budget for 2014 an extraordinary contribution by the energy sector of around 150 million euros, from which 50 million euros will be allocated to the tariff deficit. At the same time it was also announced a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 25% to 23%. In July, the Spanish government announced some measures to improve the sustainability of the Spanish electricity system and resolve the tariff deficit problem permanently. Under these measures, the contributions from Iberian electricity companies included: a reduction in regulated networks remuneration, new regulatory method for renewable energy and cut in capacity payments. In Brazil, the new regulatory methodology was applied to Escelsa since August, and included the downward revision of the rate of return on regulated asset base to 7.5% real pre-tax. Regarding changes in the shareholder structure it is to highlight, the reduction of Portuguese State stake in EDP to 0%, through the sale by Parpública of its 4.14% participation in EDP’s share capital on February 22 nd. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP 90 NEVERENDING ENERGY EDP's share capital to the amount of EUR 3,656,537,715.00 is represented by 3,656,537,715 shares. There are no limitations on the transferability of ordinary (or Category A) shares as, pursuant to the Securities Code, shares traded on a market are freely transferrable, although EDP's Articles of Association contain rules limiting the exercise of voting rights, which apply to both ordinary shares (or Category A) shares and Category B shares. Although the Articles of Association still refer to Category B shares, on 14 February 2013 Parpública – Participações Públicas (SGPS), S.A. used accelerated bookbuilding to sell the 151,517,000 Category B shares with a face value of 1 euro each, equivalent to 4.14% of EDP's share capital, that it still owned. As a result of the settlement of this operation, on 19 February 2013, Parpública – Participações Públicas (SGPS), S.A. has decreased to 0% of EDP's share capital. As mentioned in Article 4 (5) of EDP's Articles of Association, Category B shares only continue to be in this category if they are owned by public bodies. Their transfer to non-public bodies results in their conversion into Category A shares. Therefore, as a result of the transfer of the shares owned by Parpública – Participações Públicas (SGPS), S.A. and their automatic conversion into Category A shares, there are no Category B shares. EDP's share capital is therefore represented exclusively by 3,656,537,715 Category A shares, which are ordinary and have a face value of 1 euro each. The geographical and investor type breakdown of the EDP shareholder structure on 31 December 2013 was as follows: BREAKDOWN OF SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE BREAKDOWN OF SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE BY GEOGRAPHIC BY INVESTOR TYPE 9% 18% 32% 15% 12% 91% 23% PORTUGAL SPAIN EUROPE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA INSTITUCIONAL PRIVATE PERSONS REST OF WORLD In statutory terms (article 4(4)), category B shares are the shares to be re-privatised, which have restrictions on their ownership they may only be held by public bodies. However, this rule was no longer applicable following the extinction of category B shares described in the previous paragraph. There are no restrictions on the transferability of Category A shares, which currently represent the entire share capital. As at 31 December 2013, EDP owned 27,597,268 treasury stock shares, corresponding to 0.75% of the share capital and 0.75% of the voting rights. As far as the Executive Board of Directors knows, EDP is not a party to any significant agreements that come into effect, are amended or cease in the event of a change of company control following a takeover bid (except normal market practice in terms of debt issue). EDP has not taken any measures to prevent takeover bids that would put the interests of the company and its shareholders at risk. On this subject, it is important to note that, pursuant to Article 14 (3) of EDP's current Articles of Association, votes cast by a shareholder on his own behalf or representing another will not be considered if they exceed 25% (twenty-five percent) of all the votes corresponding to the share capital. Although EDP's Articles of Association impose this limitation on the exercise of voting rights, under which votes cast by a shareholder on his own behalf or representing another will not be considered if they exceed 25% (twenty-five percent) of all the votes corresponding to the share capital (pursuant to the allocation of voting rights set out in Article 20 (1) of the Securities Code), this limitation is not a measure to prevent successful takeover bids. In fact, the inability of the limitation on voting rights to prevent the success of a takeover bid is the result of EDP's current capital structure, in which the largest shareholding is 21.35%, and of the compliance of the deliberative quorum of two-thirds of the votes cast, which is set out in EDP's Articles of Association for an amendment to the company agreement on this matter with Article 182 (2) of the Securities Code. No defensive measures have been taken aimed at or resulting in serious erosion of EDP's assets in the event of transfer of control of the company or a change in the composition of the Executive Board of Directors, thereby prejudicing the free transferability of the shares and free appraisal by the shareholders of the performance of the members of the Executive Board of Directors. Pursuant to Article 7 of EDP's Articles of Association, shareholder agreements regarding the company must be communicated in full to the Executive Board of Directors and the General and Supervisory Board by the shareholders that have signed them in the 30 (thirty) days following their conclusion. According to information provided to the company by the shareholders, the Executive Board of Directors is aware of the existence of a single shareholder agreement, which was entered into on 11 April 2007 by Parpública Participações Públicas (SGPS), S.A. ( (Parpública ), Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. ( CGD ) and Société Nationale pour la Recherche, la Production, le Transport, la Transformation et la Commercialisation des Hydrocarbures ( (Sonatrach ). Under the terms of this shareholder agreement, which were announced publically, Parpública and CGD made the following commitments: x To support the continued membership of Sonatrach (or of a person indicated by it) in EDP’s General and Supervisory Board, provided that Sonatrach maintains a shareholding of at least 2% (two percent) of EDP's share capital and the strategic partnership remains in effect; and x To refrain from promoting, supporting and/or voting in favour of any change in EDP's Articles of Association that prevents the continued membership of Sonatrach (or of a person indicated by it) in EDP's General and Supervisory Board. Although Parpública has sold its shareholdings in EDP's share capital and CGD does not own a qualifying shareholding in EDP's share capital, according to information at EDP's disposal this does not represent automatic cessation of the effects of the shareholder agreement. EDP has not been informed of any agreement to revoke or amend the said shareholder agreement. In March 2013 Liberbank, S.A. and Masaveu S.L. informed EDP of the conclusion of an irrevocable agreement under which (i) 183,257,512 shares representing 5.01% of EDP's share capital and voting rights, 1.5% were owned by Liberbank and 3.51% by Cantábrica de Inversiones de Cartera, S.L. (a Liberbank subsidiary) had been transferred to Oppidum Capital, S.L. and (ii) 42,789,104 shares representing 1.17% of EDP's share capital and voting rights owned by Masaveu S.L. had also been transferred to Oppidum Capital, S.L. Following this agreement, Oppidum Capital S.L. now held 226,046,616 shares representing 6.18% of EDP's share capital and voting rights. As at 31 December 2013, the company owned 263,046,616 shares representing 7.19% EDP's share capital and voting rights. Pursuant to Article 8 (1) (b) of CMVM Regulation 5/2008, we are providing the following information on qualifying holdings owned by EDP shareholders as at 31 December 2013 and their voting rights in accordance with Article 20 (1) of the Securities Code.

Regarding approval of decisions on share capital increases, the Executive Board of Directors has the power to approve one or more share capital increases up to an aggregate limit of 10% of the current share capital in the amount of EUR 3,656,537,715.00, via the issue of Category A shares to be subscribed by new entries in cash, in accordance with the issue terms and conditions that it defines. The draft decision must be submitted to the General and Supervisory Board subject to a majority of two-thirds of votes of the respective members (Article 4 (3) of EDP's Articles of Association). The General Meeting of Shareholders held on 17 April 2012 decided to approve the renewal for five years of the Executive Board of Directors' authorisation pursuant to Article 4 (3) of the Articles of Association. The Executive Board of Directors has not yet used this renewed power to increase EDP's share capital. The Executive Board of Directors also has the power to submit proposals to the General Meeting for approval of increases in share capital after receiving a favourable opinion from the General and Supervisory Board. In these case, the General Meeting is responsible for approving the decision to increase the share capital (Article 17 (2) (g) and 11 (2) (c) of EDP's Articles of Association). In the course of its activity and irrespective of their relevance, EDP concludes deals and performs operations under normal market conditions for similar operations with different entities, particularly with financial institutions, including owners of qualifying holdings in EDP's share capital and companies related to them. On 11 May 2012, after the strategic partnership agreement concluded with China Three Gorges Corporation (“CTG”) came into effect in December 2011, this company (and three other group companies) took a place on EDP's General and Supervisory Board. Under the strategic partnership with China Three Gorges Corporation, on 28 June, 2013, EDP Renováveis, S.A. sold for a total final price global of EUR 368 million to a CTG Group company (CITIC CWEI Renewables S.C.A.,) a 49% shareholding in EDP Renováveis Portugal and 25% of the loan capital and supplementary capital contributions paid to this company and additional contributions under the rules of additional contributions to this company. Also under this partnership, on 6 December, 2013, EDP Brasil signed a memorandum of understanding with CWE Investment Corporation (CWEI), a subsidiary owned 100% by China Three Gorges (CTG), setting out the main guidelines of the partnership with a view to future joint investments between EDP Brasil and which governs the parties' participation in joint projects in Brazil. These investments by CWEI Brasil will be considered for purposes of fulfilment of the strategic partnership agreement in relation to the total investment of EUR 2 billion to be made by CTG by 2015 (including joint operating investment financing) in ready-to-build operational renewable energy generation projects. During 2013, and in addition to financial intermediation services rendered by BCP, were sell to this Bank: i) credits in the nominal value of EUR 149,587,500, related to 2012 tariff deficit; ii) credits in the nominal value of EUR 149,824,737, associated to the right of recovering annual adjustment value, referent to 2011, of the compensation due for the anticipated term of energy acquisition contracts (tariff adjustments to CMEC). To Sonatrach, in 2013, was acquired natural gas within the scope of the long-term supply contracts to EDP Group and to the Soto 4 combined cycle plant, in the amount of USD 325,778,484.73. At last, it was acquired to Liberbank a participation of 3% of Hidroeléctrica del Cantábrico, SA share capital, in the amount of EUR 106 million, subsequently to the exercise of a put option agreed with the referred Spanish institution in 2004. Regarding the applicable governance guiding lines, it shall be noted that this theme was further analyzed in 2008 and the General and Supervisory Board approved objective, transparent rules for identifying, preventing and resolving relevant corporate conflicts of interest entitled Framework for Handling conflicts of Interest, which were revised in late 2009. Following a decision made by the General and Supervisory Board, on 17 May 2010 the Executive Board of Directors approved the rules on identification, in-house reporting and procedure in the event of conflicts of interest applicable to all EDP Group employees who play a decisive role in transactions with related parties. These rules are also available on EDP's website (www.edp.pt). As part of its improvement of governance practices, on 29 July 2010, the General Supervisory and Board approved EDP's rules on conflicts of interest and transactions between related parties, which are available on EDP's website (www.edp.pt), which replace the Framework for Handling conflicts of Interest. These rules for identifying, preventing and resolving potential relevant corporate conflicts of interest have a higher level of exigency than those in the CMVM Corporate Governance Code. The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee is responsible for supervising enforcement of the aforementioned rules and reports on its work to the General and Supervisory Board. The General and Supervisory Board noted in relation to 2013, in view of the cases analysed and the information provided by the Executive Board of Directors, that no evidence was found that the potential conflicts of interest underlying the transactions made by EDP may have been settled contrary to the interests of the Company. For more information on the matter, see Point 3.5.1. of the Annual Report of the General and Supervisory Board. Pursuant to Article 12 of EDP’s Articles of Association, the officers of the General Meeting are a Chairman, a ViceChairman and the Company Secretary, who is appointed by the Executive Board of Directors. At the Annual General Meeting of 17 April 2012 the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the General Meeting were elected to office for 2012-2014. The Company Secretary was appointed on 22 February 2012 (likewise for the term from 2012 to 2014). Board of the General Meeting Chairman Rui Eduardo Ferreira Rodrigues Pena Vice-Chairman Rui Pedro C osta Melo Medeiros Company Secretary Maria Teresa Isabel Pereira The Chairman of the General Meeting is automatically a member of the General and Supervisory Board, pursuant to Article 21 (2) of EDP’s Articles of Association. The Chairman of the General Meeting has the in-house human and logistic resources appropriate to his/her needs, including the support of the General Secretariat and Legal Department, the Investor Relations Office and the Brand and Communication Department, plus external support from a specialised entity hired by EDP to collect, process and count the votes. The logistic and administrative resources for the General Meeting are provided by the Company and the organisation is supervised by the Chairman of the General Meeting. Pursuant to Article 14 (2) of EDP's Articles of Association, each share corresponds to one vote. The holders of rights representing shares under ADR (American Depositary Receipt) programmes are subject to the same provisions of the law and Articles of Association pursuant to 9 do Article 14 (9) of the Articles of Association. EDP's shareholders can only participate and vote at the General Meeting, personally or through a representative, if on the date of registration, 00:00 hours (GMT) of the fifth day of trading prior to that of the General Meeting, they own at least one share (Article 14 (10) of the Articles of Association). Proof of ownership of the shares is provided by sending the Chairman of the General Meeting, by the fifth day of trading prior to that of the General Meeting, a statement issued, certified and sent by the financial intermediary responsible for registering the shares, indicating the number of shares registered and the date of registration. It may be sent by email (Article 14 (13) of EDP's Articles of Association). Participation in the General Meeting also requires the shareholder to express this intention to the Chairman of the General Meeting and the financial intermediary at which the individual registration account has been opened, by the end of the sixth day of trading prior to that of the General Meeting. The communication may be sent by email (Article 14 (11) of EDP's Articles of Association). Shareholders who have expressed their intention to participate in a General Meeting pursuant to the Articles of Association and have transferred ownership of the shares between the fifth day of trading prior to that of the General Meeting and the end thereof, must inform the Chairman of the General Meeting and the CMVM immediately (Article 14 (11) of EDP's Articles of Association). EDP's shareholders can submit a postal vote on each of the items on the agenda in a letter addressed to the Chairman of the General Meeting, as set out in Article 14 (6) of the Articles of Association. Pursuant to Article 14 (7) of EDP's Articles of Association, voting rights may also be exercised electronically, in accordance with the requirements necessary to ensure their authenticity, which must be defined by the Chairman of the General Meeting in the invitation to the meeting. Shareholders can find the necessary forms for postal or electronic votes on EDP's website (www.edp.pt). EDP has taken measures to encourage shareholders to exercise their voting rights, such as elimination of financial obstacles that may affect their exercise. These measures include: x General circulation of the notice of meeting of the General Meeting with an express indication of the channels available for the exercise of voting rights and in publications on the CMVM website (on www.cmvm.pt) and EDP website (on www.edp.pt), on the NYSE Euronext Lisbon newsletter and in mailings to shareholders; x Payment of the costs of issuing declarations of ownership of shares for all shareholders who participate in the General Meeting (directly or by post); x Payment of the costs involved in remote voting, including postal voting. Since 20 February 2012 votes cast by a shareholder in his own name or as a representative of another exceeding 25% (twenty-five percent) of all the votes representing the share capital are not considered. This limitation applies to all decisions of the General Meeting, including those for which the law or EDP's Articles of Association provide for a qualified majority of the company's share capital. Pursuant to Article 14 (4) of EDP’s Articles of Association, votes for which, under Article 20 (1) of the Securities Code or any legal rule that amends or replaces it, he is responsible will be considered cast by the same shareholder. EDP's shareholders are obliged to provide the Executive Board of Directors, in writing and in a complete, objective, clear, truthful form, and in a manner acceptable to the board, all information that it requests from them on facts concerning them and related to Article 20 (1) of the Securities Code. Noncompliance with this obligation shall result in prevention of the exercise of voting rights pertaining to the shares owned by the shareholder in question (Article 15 (2) and (3) of the Articles of Association). If the limitation on the counting of votes affects a number of shareholders, it will operate in proportion to the ordinary shares owned by each one (Article 14 (5) of the Articles of Association). Furthermore, pursuant to Article 20 (1) of the Securities Code, or any legal rule that amends or replaces it, shareholders who become owners of a shareholding of 5% (five percent) or more of the voting rights or share capital, must inform the Executive Board of Directors thereof within five business days of the date on which ownership occurred. They cannot exercise their voting rights until they have made this communication (Article 15 (1) of EDP's Articles of Association). See Point 12 Decisions by the General Meeting are taken by a majority of votes cast, unless the law or the Articles of Association require a qualified majority (Article 11 (3) of the Articles of Association). EDP’s Articles of Association do not define any constitutive quorum for the General Meeting and have adopted the rule set out in the Portuguese Company Code. Where a deliberative quorum is concerned, pursuant to EDP's Articles of Association, the General Meeting of Shareholders may decide at the first or second call however many shareholders are present or represented, including decisions on amendment of the Articles of Association, merger, split or conversion of the company (Article 11 (4) of the Articles of Association). On these matters, the deliberative quorum is actually lower than that set out in the Company Code (see Article 383 (1) of the Company Code), which requires the presence or representation of shareholders owning shares representing at least one third of the share capital. In all other cases, the deliberative quorum set out in Article 383 (2) of the Company Code applies. EDP's governance structure is based on the dual model and consists of the General Meeting, Executive Board of Directors, General and Supervisory Board and the Statutory Auditor. According to Article 11 (2) (b) of the Articles of association, it is the responsibility of the General Meeting of EDP to elect and dismiss the members of the Executive Board of Directors and the General and Supervisory Board, as well as their Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen, if any, and the Statutory Auditors, based on a proposal by the General and Supervisory Board (or by delegation to the Financial Matters Committee / Audit Committee). The General Meeting also appoints the members of the Environment and Sustainability Board, on proposal of the Executive Board of Directors, and Remuneration Committee of the General Meeting, which is responsible for setting the remuneration of the members of the corporate bodies (except the Executive Board of Directors, whose remuneration is set by the Remuneration Committee appointed by the General and Supervisory Board). The separation of management and supervision roles is embodied in an Executive Board of Directors, which is responsible for the management of the company’s business, and a General and Supervisory Board, the highest supervisory body. Considering this structure, we can say that the dual model of corporate governance in place in EDP has allowed effective separation of the company’s supervision and management in pursuit of the goals and interests of EDP and its shareholders, employees and other stakeholders, thereby contributing to achieving the degree of trust and transparency necessary for its adequate functioning and optimisation. Furthermore, this model has proved appropriate to the company's shareholder structure as it allows supervision by key shareholders on the General and Supervisory Board. For a better understanding of EDP's corporate governance, EDP's website (www.edp.pt) allows shareholders and the general public to view the up-to-date Articles of Association in Portuguese and English, the Internal Regulations of the Executive Board of Directors, General and Supervisory Board and its committees. Moreover, the General and Supervisory Board and Executive Board of Directors have approved the Corporate Governance Manual which is also available to shareholders and the general public on the EDP website (www.edp.pt). The primary objective of this manual is to record and share an understanding of the two corporate bodies in terms of the recommendations of good corporate governance practices applying to EDP and appropriate guidelines to comply with them. EDP sought to go beyond the legal requirements and regulations for this area, particularly concerning information reporting, given EDP's meticulousness and goals as regards the quality of its corporate governance practices. The Corporate Governance Manual therefore sought to serve the following purposes in order to achieve this basic goal: x To reflect critically on recommendations on best practices set out in the CMVM Corporate Governance Code in order to contribute actively in optimising EDP's practices; x To select the recommendations deemed most appropriate to EDP’s governance model, focusing on measures taken and indicating potential measures for full adoption of good practices; x To identify recommendations that are not appropriate to EDP’s interests and give reasons for this position and indicate other ways of achieving the goals set out in the CMVM Corporate Governance Code; x To help targets of the recommendations to reflect on the best governance practices to be followed at EDP; x To draft a formal document that will help compliance with reporting obligations on corporate governance practices, such as the annual report required by law; x Describe EDP’s governance practices that are not set out in the Corporate Governance Code but achieve the goal shared by the General and Supervisory Board and the Executive Board of Directors to develop and increase the quality of EDP’s governance processes. It is the role of the General Meeting to elect and remove members of the Executive Board of Directors and the General and Supervisory Board, including their chairmen. In the event of permanent or temporary absence of any of the members of the Executive Board of Directors, the General and Supervisory Board arranges for his/her replacement and the appointment must be ratified by the next General Meeting. In the event of permanent absence of any of the members of the General and Supervisory Board, the substitutes on the list submitted to the General Meeting must be summoned by the Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board to replace him/her, following the order on the list. Pursuant to Article 21 (5) of EDP's Articles of Association, the substitutes on the list must all be independent. If there are no substitutes, they will be elected by the General Meeting. The shareholders elected the members of the General and Supervisory Board and the Executive Board of Directors at the General Meeting of 20 February 2012, for the three-year period from 2012 to 2014. The term of office of these members of the corporate bodies therefore ends on 31 December 2014, though they may remain in office until a new appointment. In the exercise of its duties – see Article 441 of the Company Code and Article 22 of EDP’s Articles of Association the main mission of the General and Supervisory Board is to constantly advise, monitor and supervise the management activities of EDP, cooperating with the Executive Board of Directors and the various other corporate bodies in pursuit of the company’s interests, pursuant to the Company Code and the company’s Articles of Association. It is elected by the shareholders at the General Meeting. Pursuant to Article 21 (1) of the Articles of Association, the General and Supervisory Board consists of no fewer than nine effective members, but always more than the number of members of the Executive Board of Directors. The majority of the elected members of the General and Supervisory Board must be independent, pursuant to Article 21 (4) of the Articles of Association. At the Annual General Meeting of 6 May 2013, two new members were elected, namely Augusto Carlos Serra Ventura Mateus and Nuno Manuel da Silva Amado, following the resignations submitted by Parpública – Participações Públicas (SGPS), S.A. and Carlos Jorge Ramalho dos Santos Ferreira on 18 March and 12 April 2013, respectively The members of the General and Supervisory Board are currently as follows: Independent First appointment General and Supervisory Board Members date Chairman Eduardo de Almeida C atroga Independent 30/03/2006 Vice-Chairman Dingming Zhang (em representação da C hina Three Gorges C orporation) 20/02/2012 Guojun Lu (as representative of C hina International Water & Electric C orp.) 20/02/2012 Ya Yang (as representative of C hina Three Gorges New Energy C o.

The Executive Board of Directors is responsible for managing the company's activities and representing the company, pursuant to Article 431 of the Company Code and Article 17 of the Articles of Association and is elected by the shareholders at a General Meeting. The Executive Board of Directors is currently made up of seven members. Pursuant to Article 16 (2) of the Articles of Association, the Executive Board of Directors must have a minimum of five and a maximum of seven members. The members of the Executive Board of Directors are as follows: First appointment Executive Board of Directors date Chairman António Luís Guerra Nunes Mexia 30/03/2006 Nuno Maria Pestana de Almeida Alves 30/03/2006 João Manuel Manso Neto 30/03/2006 António Manuel Barreto Pita de Abreu 30/03/2006 António Fernando Melo Martins da C osta 30/03/2006 João Manuel Veríssimo Marques da C ruz 20/02/2012 Miguel Stilwell de Andrade 20/02/2012 M embers elected at the General M eeting o f M arch 30, 2006 to ho ld o ffice fro m June 30, 2006, date o f entry into fo rce o f new A rticles o f A sso ciatio n and the two -tier co rpo rate go vernance mo del. EDP's Articles of Association (Article 9 (1) Article 11 (2) (d), Article 21 (4), Article 22 (1) (a), Article 23 and Article 27) and the Internal Regulations of the General and Supervisory Board (Article 7)), both available on its website (www.edp.pt), lay down the rules on independence and incompatibilities for members of any of the company's corporate bodies. The criteria of independence set out in EDP's Articles of Association are in line with those laid down in 414 (5) of the Company Code and determine that independence means an absence of direct or indirect relations with the company or one of its bodies and an absence of any circumstances that might affect impartiality of analyses or decisions, e.g. because the people in question own or are acting on behalf of owners of a qualifying shareholding of 2% (two percent) or more of the share capital of EDP or have been re-elected for more than two terms of office continuously or intermittently. Pursuant to Article 9 (1) of EDP's Articles of Association, independence is “absence of direct or indirect relations with the company or one of its bodies and an absence of any circumstances that might affect impartiality of analyses or decisions, e.g. because the people in question own or are acting on behalf of owners of a qualifying shareholding of 2% (two percent) or more of the share capital of EDP or have been re-elected for more than two terms of office continuously or intermittently . In view of the need to clarify the aforementioned Article 414 (5) of the Company Code, as there are diverging legal opinions, Associação de Emitentes de Valores Cotados em Mercado (“AEM”) requested an opinion from the CMVM , whose opinion was that the capacity as independent is only lost if, “on the basis of the criterion of number of terms of office, in a situation likely to affect his/her impartiality in analyses or decisions if the members of the supervisory bodies of public limited companies, having been elected for a first term of office and re-elected continuously or intermittently for a second and third term, are re-elected (for the third time, therefore) for a fourth term of office.” Pursuant to its Internal Regulations, the General and Supervisory Board has in place a specific procedure regarding compliance with a large number of rules on incompatibilities and independence applicable to positions on this board (Articles 6 and 7 of the General and Supervisory Board Internal Regulations). This procedure includes the following aspects: x Acceptance of a position as member of the General and Supervisory Board is subject to a written statement setting out specifically (i) the inexistence of any incompatibility under the law or Articles of Association; (ii) compliance with the independence requirements set out in its Internal Regulations, if the person has been elected as an independent member; (iii) the members' obligation to report to the Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board or, for the Chairman, directly to the board any subsequent event that might generate incompatibility or loss of independence; x Every year, the members of the General and Supervisory Board must renew their statements as to the inexistence of incompatibility and compliance with the independence requirements, if applicable; Also every year, the General and Supervisory Board conducts a general assessment of compliance with the rules of incompatibility and independence by its members. At the same time, the Internal Regulations of the General and Supervisory Board has broadened the independence criteria applicable to its members, going beyond the provisions of Article 414 (5) of the Company Code and Article 9 of EDP's Articles of Association, and so people who directly or through their spouse or relative or similar in a straight line and to the collateral third degree, inclusive, are in one of the following situations cannot have independent status: x Being holder, director, having contractual ties or acting on behalf or on the account of owners of a qualifying shareholding of 2% (two percent) or more of the share capital or voting rights in EDP or the same percentage in a company of which it is a subsidiary; x Being a holder, director, having contractual ties or acting on behalf or on the account of owners of a qualifying shareholding of 2% (two percent) or more of the share capital or voting rights in a company that is a competitor of EDP; and x Having been re-elected for more than two consecutive or non-consecutive terms of office. The rules of independence covering members of the General and Supervisory Board are particularly important regarding the following requirements: x The board must consist of a majority of independent members (Article 434 (4) of the Company Code and Article 21 (4) of EDP's Articles of Association); x The Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board must comprise a majority of independent members (Article 444 (6) of the Company Code Article 27 (1) (a) and (b) of the General and Supervisory Board's Internal Regulations). In compliance with the above procedure, at the start of their terms of office, the members of the General and Supervisory Board stated that they were not in any of the situations of incompatibility set out in the Company Code (Article 414-A (1) (a) to (e) and (h) (ex vi Article 434 (4) and Article 437 (1)) or under the Articles of Association and, where applicable, that they complied with the independence requirements of the Internal Regulations of the General and Supervisory Board. In early 2013, the members of the outgoing General and Supervisory Board renewed their statements on incompatibilities and independence. On 28 February, 2014, the General and Supervisory Board assessed compliance with the rules on incompatibilities and independence of the elected members at the General Meeting of 20 February, 2012 and members elected at the General Meeting of 6 May, 2013. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting made similar statements of compliance with the criteria of independence and incompatibility for their positions, as set out in Article 414 (5) and Article 414-A (1) of the Company Code and in Articles 9 and 10 of EDP's Articles of Association. The above statements are available to the public on EDP's website, www.edp.pt. The independent members of the General and Supervisory Board are shown in the table in Point 17 above. See page 304 and following from the Management Report.

Under the corporate governance model in place at EDP, the General and Supervisory Board also has a power of particular importance. Although it does not have management powers, pursuant to Article 442 (1) of the Company Code, Article 17 (2) of the Articles of Association lays down that the approval of EDP's strategic plan and performance of the operations indicated below by EDP or its subsidiaries are subject to a prior favourable opinion from this board (see also Article 13 of the Internal Regulations of the General and Supervisory Board): x Acquisitions and sales of assets, rights or shareholdings of significant economic value; x Financing operations of significant value; x Opening and closure of establishments, or important parts thereof, and substantial extensions or limitations of company activity; x Other transactions or operations of significant economic or strategic value; x Formation or termination of strategic partnerships or other forms of lasting cooperation; x Plans for splits, mergers or conversions; x Amendments to the Articles of Association, including changes of registered office and share capital increases when on the Executive Board of Directors' initiative; x Approval of the draft decision of the Executive Board of Directors to increase the share capital by means of one or more share capital increases, up to the aggregate limit of 10% of the current share capital by issuing Category A shares to be subscribed by new inputs of cash; x Formation or termination of strategic partnerships or other forms of lasting cooperation. The Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board is granted particular powers, and, pursuant to Article 18 of the Rules of Procedure of the General and Supervisory Board, is responsible for: x Convening and presiding over meetings of the General and Supervisory Board; x Representing the General and Supervisory Board institutionally; x Coordinating the work of the General and Supervisory Board and ensuring the correct operation of its committees, being entitled to attend any meeting and being kept informed of their activities; x Proposing to the plenary General and Supervisory Board the members, the Chairman and, when appropriate, the Vice-Chairman of each committee; x Ensuring that the members of the General and Supervisory Board punctually receive the information they need for their duties; x Requesting from the Executive Board of Directors relevant information for the General and Supervisory Board and its committees to perform their duties and ensuring that the members of the General and Supervisory Board receive it in good time; x Taking the necessary measures to ensure that the General and Supervisory Board adequately monitors the activity of EDP and the Executive Board of Directors in particular; x Monitoring implementation of the General and Supervisory Board’s budget and managing the material and human resources assigned to it; x Ensuring correct implementation of General and Supervisory Board decisions. The Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board or, in his/her absence or incapacity, a member delegated by the board for that purpose, may attend meetings of the Executive Board of Directors whenever s/he sees fit and take part in the discussion of matters to be submitted to the General and Supervisory Board, without having any voting rights pursuant to Article 21 (10) of EDP's Articles of Association. The members of the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee have a duty to attend the meetings of the Executive Board of Directors when the accounts are appraised, (see Article 4 (3) (e) of the Rules of Procedure of the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee. With the assistance of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, the General and Supervisory Board annually performs: x A self-assessment of its activity and performance and those of its committees, the conclusions of which are set out in its annual report (see Article 10 of the General and Supervisory Board Internal Regulations); x An independent assessment of the activity and performance of the Executive Board of Directors, the conclusions of which are submitted to the General Meeting and are presented in an annex to the annual report of the General and Supervisory Board. EDP, on the initiative of the General and Supervisory Board, continues to be one of the few listed companies in Portugal and abroad that has voluntarily established a formal, impartial process to assess the activity of this board and of the Executive Board of Directors. Experience of recent years has allowed the General and Supervisory Board to make some changes in the process to make it more effective and efficient. The method used comprises the following stages: x After the year’s end, the Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board sends assessment questionnaires to the members of its Board. The questionnaires are answered individually and are confidential. x The General and Supervisory Board Support Office statistically processes the data received and prepares the information for consideration at a General and Supervisory Board meeting; x The General and Supervisory Board issues its assessment opinions and they are included in this board's annual report; x At the General Meeting, the Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board presents the board's opinion in the item of the agenda for assessment of the Executive Board of Directors. The Executive Board of Directors is a collegial body. Individual directors in office are only allowed to represent one absent director at each meeting. All directors have equal voting rights and the Chairman has the casting vote. The powers of the Executive Board of Directors, in accordance with the Article 17 (1) of the Articles of Association, include: x Setting the goals and management policies of EDP and the EDP Group; x Drawing up the annual business and financial plans; x Managing corporate business and undertaking all actions and operations associated with the corporate object that do not fall within the responsibilities of other company bodies; x Representing the company in and out of court, actively and passively, with the power to waive, transact and admit guilt in any legal proceedings and make arbitration agreements; x Buying, selling or by any other means disposing or encumbering rights or immovable assets; x Setting up companies and subscribing, purchasing, encumbering and selling shareholdings; x Deciding on the issue of bonds and other securities in accordance with the law and the Articles of Association, in compliance with the annual quantitative limits set by the General and Supervisory Board; x Establishing the technical and administrative organisation of EDP and the rules of procedure, particularly in relation to personnel and their remuneration; x Appointing proxies with such powers as it sees fit, including the power to delegate; x Appointing the Company Secretary and alternate; x Hiring and dismissing the External Auditor on recommendation of the General and Supervisory Board; x Exercising any other powers that may be granted to it by law or by the General Meeting; x Establishing its own internal rules. Proposals to amend EDP's Articles of Association regarding share capital increases submitted by the Executive Board of Directors require a prior opinion from the General and Supervisory Board, pursuant to Article 17 (2) (g) of the Articles of Association. The Chairman of the Executive Board of Directors sends the Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board the notices of meetings, support documents and minutes of the meetings and, on request, provides appropriate, timely information, which is accessible to all the members of the General and Supervisory Board and of the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee. When so requested by other members of the corporate bodies, the Executive Board of Directors also provides all the required information in a timely and appropriate fashion. There is an information sharing portal for the Executive Board of Directors and General and Supervisory Board, which is accessible to all their members. The Chairman of the Executive Board of Directors is granted particular powers by Article 18 of the Articles of Association. These powers are: x Representing the Executive Board of Directors; x Coordinating the work of the Executive Board of Directors and convening and presiding over its meetings; x Ensuring proper execution of the decisions of the Executive Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Executive Board of Directors is entitled to attend the meetings of the General and Supervisory Board, whenever considered appropriate, except when these concern decisions on the supervision of the work of the Executive Board of Directors and, in general, any situations that may involve a conflict of interest, pursuant to Article 18 (2) of the Articles of Association. In the Executive Board of Directors there is a functional division of management areas to each of its members. The college of directors is responsible for making decisions on all matters within its remit. Delegated powers are not granted to directors individually, because of the board's particular nature. The activity and performance of the Executive Board of Directors are assessed continuously and independently by the General and Supervisory Board on an annual basis. The organisation of the Executive Board of Directors is based on the following management areas and corporate matters: The Executive Board of Directors is responsible for defining the EDP Group's organisational model and dividing duties among the different business units, the service company EDP Valor Gestão Integrada de Serviços, S.A. (EDP Valor) and central structure. This structure consists of a Corporate Centre that provides assistance to the Executive Board of Directors in defining and monitoring the execution of strategies, policies and goals. The Corporate Centre is divided into departments and business units, allowing for optimisation and greater efficiency of the organisational structure. The Executive Board of Directors is also assisted by specialised committees, which ensure more effective monitoring of matters and contribute to the decision-making process. The central support structure for decision-making processes in 2013 was as follows: OFFICES SUPPORT TO GOVERNANCE AREA General Secretariat and Legal office Maria Teresa Pereira Office of the C hairman of the Executive Board of Directors Martim Martorell Salgado Audit Department Azucena Viñuela Hernández Office of the Ethics Ombudsman José Figueiredo Soares STRATEGIC AREA Energy Planning Department Pedro Neves Ferreira Business Analysis Department Duarte C astro Bello (1) Risk Management Department José Allen Lima Regulation and C ompetition Department Maria Joana Simões Sustainability Department António Neves de C arvalho FINANCIAL AREA Financial Management Department Paula C ristina Guerra C onsolidation, IFRS Report and Tax Department Miguel Ribeiro Ferreira Management Planning and C ontrol Department Nuno Miguel C hung Investor Relations Department Miguel Henriques Viana RESOURCES AREA Organisational Development Department José Filipe Santos Information Systems Department Vergílio Rocha Human Resources Department Paula Maria C arneiro (2) C oordination Office for Labor Relations Eugénio C arvalho University of EDP Vasco C oucello MARKETING AND COMMUNICATION AREA Brand and C ommunication Department Paulo C ampos C osta C ustomer and Marketing Department Inês Lima Stakeholder Relations Department Miguel C outinho BUSINESS UNITS Energy Management Business Unit C arlos Mata 1) The po sitio n started to be exercised by P edro Neves Ferreira fro m 07.01.2014 2) Designated o n 03.09.2013 The current departments and their duties are as follows: The General and Legal Office provides administrative and logistical assistance to the Executive Board of Directors and legal advice to EDP companies with their head offices in Portugal, in order to ensure the effective operation of the Corporate Centre, compliance with applicable legislation and harmonisation of corporate governance policies in the Group.

(representado por Luís Eduardo Brito Freixial de Goes ) Álvaro João Duarte Pinto C orreia EDP's two-tier model of corporate governance has made possible an effective separation between supervision and management of the company. The General and Supervisory Board is the highest supervisory body. The duties of the Financial Matters Committee /Audit Committee are described in Point 29 of the corporate governance report. The Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee is made up of five independent members with the appropriate qualifications and experience, including at least one member with a degree in the area of the committee’s duties and specific knowledge of auditing and accounting, as confirmed by the Curriculum Vitae of the Vice-Chairman, which can be viewed in the chapter on corporate bodies. This committee's membership is as follows: First appointment Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee date Chairman Eduardo de Almeida C atroga 21/02/2012 Vice-Chairman Vítor Fernando da C onceição Gonçalves 13/07/2006 António Sarmento Gomes Mota 07/05/2009 Manuel Fernando de Macedo Alves Monteiro 13/07/2006 Maria C eleste Ferreira Lopes C ardona 18/04/2012 See Points 17 and 18. See page 304 and following of the Management Report. The Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee's work is governed by Internal Regulations, available on EDP's website at www.edp.pt. In 2013, the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee met thirteen times and minutes of its meetings were kept. Information on the attendance rate of the committee's members is given in Annex IV of this report. See Annex III. The proposal for hiring additional services of the External Auditor and Statutory Auditor is made by the Executive Board of Directors to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee and any contracting requires the prior authorisation of that Committee. Rules of procedure on the Provision of Services by the Statutory Auditor and External Auditor of EDP are in force, in this regard, and the implications on the hiring of additional services are described in point 46. There are other rules of procedure adopted by the Executive Board of Directors that ensure all EDP Group companies comply with the rules contained in the referred rules of procedure. The duties of the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee, delegated to it by the General and Supervisory Board pursuant to the Articles of Association and the Internal Regulations of the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee are described in Point 29. KPMG & Associados Sociedade de Revisores Oficiais de Contas, S.A. (KPMG), represented by Vítor Manuel da Cunha Ribeirinho, was elected EDP's Statutory Auditor for 2012-2014 at the General Meeting of 17 April, 2012. The Statutory Auditor has been working with the company for ten years. The Statutory Auditor is the company body responsible for the examination of the accounting documents. It is elected by the General Meeting for three year terms, pursuant to Article 25 of EDP’s Articles of Association and Article 446 of the Portuguese Company Code. According to the Company Code and the company’s Articles of Association, the Statutory Auditor is responsible for checking (see Article 446 (3) of the Company Code): x The regularity of the company’s books, accounting records and their supporting documents; x The cash and all assets or securities belonging to the company or received by it as guarantees, deposits or for any other purpose, whenever and however it sees fit; x The accuracy of the accounting documents; x Whether the company's accounting policies and valuation criteria result in an accurate assessment of its assets and results. EDP's External Auditor is KPMG and Vítor Manuel da Cunha Ribeirinho, manager of auditing at KPMG, is the partner in charge of overseeing and performing audits of the EDP Group's accounts. KPMG is registered with the CMVM under number 9093. The external auditor performs the necessary audit work to ensure the reliability of the financial reporting and credibility of the accounting documents. The external auditor's duties include checking compliance with remuneration policies and systems, the efficacy of internal control mechanisms and reporting of any deficiencies to the General and Supervisory Board. EDP takes measures specifically aimed at ensuring the independence of the external auditor, in view of the scope of services provided by audit firms. EDP's external auditor has been KPMG since December 2004 and Vítor Manuel da Cunha Ribeirinho has been the certified auditor partner since 2012. The policy on rotation of the external auditor and certified auditor partner representing it depends on the strict assessment by the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee of the independence and quality of the work done and consideration of the independence of the statutory auditor and external auditor and the advantages and costs of replacing them. The General and Supervisory Board decided, under its duties of selecting and replacing the external auditor, to hold a tendering procedure at the start the fourth quarter of 2011 to select the external auditor of EDP for a three-year term. It follows that the third and fourth quarters of 2011 were marked by the 8th privatisation process of EDP, with significant impact on the EDP shareholder structure. Therefore, the composition of the governing bodies for the 2012-2014 term was postponed to a later date, to take into account the conclusion of that process. The General and Supervisory Board delegated in the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee the monitoring of this issue during 2012, and this Committee presented a proposal to keep the current Statutory Auditor/External Auditor of EDP until the end of 2013. That proposal was approved by the General and Supervisory Board Subsequently, the work for selecting the external auditor for the 2014-2016 period was resumed still in 2013, and the General and Supervisory Board delegated in the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee the monitoring and structuring of this matter. Accordingly, the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee launched a consultative process, inviting 4 audit firms of international repute to submit bids for the provision of statutory audit and external audit services to EDP for the 2014-2016 period. Two committees were set up for the development of the consultation process, one for monitoring the process and analysing the bids and preparing a summary of their findings and the other had the mission of assessing the results produced by the first committee and preparing a proposal for the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee. KPMG was the company that gained the highest scores in the assessment of the submitted bids, which also weighed up the audit performance conditions, including the costs and benefits of its replacement. In this process, the Audit Committees of the EDP Group subsidiaries, Hidroeléctrica del Cantábrico, EDP Renováveis and EDP Energias do Brasil approved KPMG as the statutory auditor and external auditor for the three-year period from 2014 to 2016 even though KPMG can only be appointed as external auditor of the EDP Energias do Brasil group from 2015. The many items valued and highlighted in relation to KPMG included, for example, the fact that KPMG is the bidder with the most specific knowledge of the business and culture of the EDP group, that changing the service provider would require additional effort from EDP’s internal resources to ensure the transition, which is particularly sensitive in the context of the varied internal transformation projects underway and planned through to 2017, and that maintaining the current external auditor gives greater security in settling issues of high accounting complexity that are already being accompanied by the current auditor. Given the above, the Assessment Committee informed the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee that it considered KPMG to be the entity offering the most advantageous conditions for the provision of external audit services to the EDP Group. The Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee analysed the results of the assessment and decided on 23 October, 2013 to propose to the General and Supervisory Board the selection of KPMG for the provision of such services in the 2014-2016 period. At its meeting of 31 October, 2013, the General and Supervisory Board decided to approve the award the bid submitted by KPMG for the provision of external audit services in the 2014-2016 three-year period. The Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee presents annually to the General and Supervisory Board a proposal for the assessment of the independence of the external auditor, which is published in the report of the General and Supervisory Board as well as the result of the appreciation of the proposal. Proposals to hire additional services from the external auditor and statutory auditor are made by the Executive Board of Directors to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee and their hiring requires prior authorisation from this committee. The Regulations on Services Provided by EDP's Statutory Auditor and External Auditor, available on the EDP website, (www.edp.pt), on hiring of additional services, requires the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee to deny authorisation of additional services if: x The additional service is prohibited; x In accordance with the standard of an objective, reasonable informed third party, the service involves a possible threat to the independence of the statutory auditor or the external auditor, i.e. not allowing selfaudit or personal interest. In order to implement this CMVM recommendation, the Regulations on Services Provided by EDP's Statutory Auditor and External Auditor define the services in the following categories: a) Necessary services (including internal control procedures required as part of audits) for the issue of the external auditor’s annual or interim reports on the accounts. b) Services required for compliance with local legislation (including internal control procedures required as part of audits) for the issue of legal certifications of accounts. c) Other services related to the above, with a specific or limited purpose or scope, such as: x Opinion on the internal control system on financial reporting; x Opinion on the Consumption Efficiency Plan; x Opinion on the Environmental Development Plan; x Opinion on regulated accounts; x Statements of compliance under contractual agreements; x Reports on specified accounts, accounting elements or items in an EDP financial statement; x Comfort letters in the issue of securities. a) Other services for guaranteeing reliability – services that take the form of a commitment, on the basis of appropriate, duly identified criteria, to evaluate or quantify a certain element for which a third party is responsible or to express an opinion providing a certain degree of certainty on this element. b) Tax consultancy – advisory and support services on tax matters. c) Other non-audit related services – covering all other services not included in the other additional service categories. The following additional services were hired from the External Auditor in 2013: x Tax consultancy x Studies on the impact of regulatory changes in Portugal and Spain x Service verification, compliance and fulfilment of tax obligations The reasons for hiring these services were essentially i) better understanding of the Group's business and tax issues associated with its business activity, ensuring appropriate knowledge of the relevant information, which favours greater agility and efficiency in providing solutions and ii) it was considered that the hiring of said services were not considered a threat to the independence of the External Auditor and did not foster any situation of personal interest in relation to the guarantee of independence given by the External Auditor. Additional services provided in 2013 account for around 10% of the total value of services rendered to the EDP Group by these entities. KPMG is responsible for conducting an independent external audit of all the EDP Group companies in Portugal, Spain, Brazil (EDP Renováveis), USA and other countries in which the Group operates. In the subgroup of EDP Brasil independent external auditing is conducted by Price Waterhouse Coopers. In 2013, the recognised, specialised costs of the fees of KPMG and Price Waterhouse Coopers for auditing, guarantee and reliability services, tax consultancy and services other than auditing for Portugal, Spain, Brazil, USA and other countries were as follows: United States Other Type of Services Portugal Spain Brazil Total of Amercia Countries Audit and Statutory Audit of Accounts 2,496,200 (1) 1,726,258 117,674 861,470 694,456 5,896,058 Other Audit Services (2) 772,000 390,231 27,479 39,850 44,305 1,273,864 Total of Audit Services 3,268,200 2,116,489 145,153 901,319 738,761 7,169,922 90% Tax C onsultancy Service 454,640 18,000 0 11,960 0 484,600 Other Additional Services 42,400 249,565 0 0 57,490 349,455 Total of Other Services 497,040 267,565 0 11,960 57,490 834,055 10% Total 3,765,240 47% 2,384,054 30% 145,153 2% 913,279 11% 796,251 10% 8,003,977 100% (1) Includes the remuneration of the Statutory Auditors of EDP amounting 180,000 euros.

EDP's Articles of Association may also be amended under the powers of the Executive Board of Directors to move EDP's registered office (Article 2 (1) of EDP's Articles of Association) and increase EDP's share capital (Article 4 (3) of EDP's Articles of Association). Pursuant to the general rule set out in Article 410 (7) of the Company Code, by reference to Article 433 of this code, these decisions by the Executive Board of Directors must be passed by a majority of the votes of the directors present or represented. The EDP Group has consistently implemented measures to ensure the good governance of its companies, including the prevention of incorrect practices, particularly in the areas of accounting and finance. EDP provides Group employees with a channel that enables them to report any alleged unlawful practice or accounting or financial irregularity in their company directly and in confidence to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee of the General and Supervisory Board. With the creation of this channel for reporting irregular accounting and financial practices, EDP aims at: x Ensuring that any employee can freely communicate his/her concerns in these fields to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee; x Facilitating the early detection of irregular situations that, if they occurred, might cause serious damage to the EDP Group, its employees, customers and shareholders. The Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee can be contacted by email, fax and post and access to information received in this regard is restricted. The members of this committee are authorised to receive these reports. All complaints sent to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee are treated in strict confidence and the complainant remains anonymous, unless this prevents investigation of the complaint. Pursuant to the regulations, EDP guarantees that whistleblowing employees will not suffer any reprisals or disciplinary action for exercising their right to report irregularities, provide information or assist in an investigation. On 27 October 2011, the General and Supervisory Board approved new regulations, which were submitted for registration with the National Data Protection Authority. The application was approved on 6 July 2012. In February, 2014, the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee informed the General and Supervisory Board of its work as part of the whistleblowing mechanism in 2013. The conclusion was that none of the 35 reports received contained complaints with an impact on accounting, finance, internal control or audit matters. The Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee closed 33 after analysing the responses from the competent EDP departments and the remaining two in the closing phase. Internal control matters are the responsibility of the Corporate Centre, which plays a structural role in assisting the Executive Board of Directors in defining and overseeing implementation of strategies, policies and goals. The most important of the Corporate Centre departments and offices in terms of internal control are the Internal Audit Department and the Risk Management Department. The former performs internal audits or ensures that they are performed in the Group. It is also responsible for the financial reporting internal control system (SCIRF) in the Group, with a view to an independent assessment of the internal control system and implementation of measures to make it more effective by optimising and aligning processes and systems. The Risk Management Department's main responsibility is to coordinate the Group's risk assessment studies in order to assist the Executive Board of Directors in controlling and mitigating them and provide integrated riskreturn analyses. Under the law, the General and Supervisory Board permanently oversees and evaluates internal accounting and auditing procedures, the efficacy of the risk management system, the internal control system and the internal auditing system, including the way in which complaints and queries from employees and others are handled. This duty has been assigned to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee, which, among other tasks, permanently monitors and supervises: (i) EDP’s financial affairs; (ii) Internal auditing procedures, the company's accounting practices and the internal control system for financial information and financial reporting, in coordination with the Internal Audit Department; (iii) Matters relating to the risk management process, particularly taxation, legal and financial aspects. The Internal Audit Department belongs to the Corporate Centre and although it is answerable to the CEO, it reports in practice to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee. The department's work is supervised by the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee, which approves the annual internal audit plan before it is sent to the Executive Board of Directors and monitors its systematic implementation. The Executive Board of Directors decides the degree of exposure to risk to be adopted by the EDP Group in its different activities and, without prejudice to delegation of duties and responsibilities, defines overall risk limits and ensures that risk policies and procedures are followed. This is preceded by the definition of the Group’s appetite for risk resulting from its long established business structure and criteria agreed upon by the Executive Board of Directors and the General and Supervisory Board. The business units manage their own risks within the established criteria and delegations. There is an alignment of policies and strategies between the risk areas of its subsidiaries and the Risk Department of the Corporate Centre, ensuring coherent performance, reporting and control practices. The Risk Management Department is one of the Corporate Centre's strategic departments. In addition to its control and methodological activities, this department conducts its own studies, thereby providing business intelligence for assessing important highly topical R2R – Return to Risk for the Group. The main risks to which the company is exposed and which affect all the responsibility units are as follows: Electricity price risk: Income from generation can be influenced by changes in the price of electricity on the wholesale markets. The Group's exposure is limited to the power stations operating in the free market (Spain, Ribatejo Power Station, Lares Power Station and new hydroelectric plants in Portugal), as most of them are subject to the CMEC – costs for maintenance of contractual equilibrium adjustment mechanism (power stations that had power purchase agreements with REN but began operating in the market on 1 July 2007). There is also exposure to the market (OMEL price) of EDP Renováveis wind farms (and also in the United States, Poland and Romania). Furthermore, the Group proactively seeks to protect the margin, with integrated action in energy and supply management. In the MIBEL, the UNGE acts in the wholesale market with a view to optimising the generation supply in the OMEL spot market and taking advantage of the forward market, OMPI, OTC and arbitration in the Spain-France interconnection. The UNGE simulates the performance of the Iberian system and uses the Unified Risk Model for periodic calculation of the margin at risk. At EDP Brasil, the market risk in electricity generation is low, as most of the installed capacity is under long-term contract. Fuel price and CO2 risk: This risk is most important for power stations on the free market and it is managed by UNGE, which is responsible for coal purchases, operational management of gas procurement contracts for electricity generation and CO2 emissions rights and hedging solutions for fuel prices and exchange of the dollar (the last in coordination with the Financial Management Department). UNGE manages negotiation of new gas procurement contracts and also manages temporary positions of surplus or shortage between Group companies and abroad. The MUR is also used in risk assessment, making use of its capacity for assessing trends in fuel and CO2 prices. Operating risk of power stations and wind farms: Conventional power stations and wind farms have breakdowns and other incidents that can entail a loss of revenue due to the resulting outage or downtime. This risk is mitigated by conduction and maintenance methods and safety procedures of the highest standard. The most important insurable risks are associated with generation, which is covered by insurance. They are managed by the Insurable risks Office at EDP Valor. Environmental risk: Generation resources are the most vulnerable to this type of risk, because of their use of natural resources, the emissions and waste that thermal generation produces and the impact on biodiversity caused by wind generation and other technologies. The Group has a very strict environment policy that fits into an environmental management system aimed at abiding in full by licensing parameters for facilities and taking additional measures to improve performance and mitigate any liabilities in this area. EDP has environment liability insurance to meet new European requirements. For more information on the company's environmental performance, see the contribution section of the environmental performance chapter in the EDP Sustainability Report. Credit risk: This risk in the organised market is not significant and for operations in the OTC market and purchase of fuel UNGE minimises it by setting exposure limits. These limits are approved internally in accordance with counterparty ratings (defined by an external entity or in-house if the information is not available). Liquidity risk: This risk occurs mainly in hedging operations in organised markets. Almost the entire counterparty risk is mitigated in operations in organised markets but if margin accounts or other guarantees are necessary in these contracts, with periodic calculation of their market value, there may be a need for liquidity while these instruments are in effect. This management is performed by UNGE and the Financial Management Department by contracting dedicated lines of credit. Electricity price risk: This risk is managed by UNGE. Internal prices are defined after determining sales volumes to end users by EDP Comercial – Comercialização de Energia, S.A. and HC ENERGÍA, unless it is possible to enter into contracts indexed to the market price. Volume risk: The volume of energy for sale to end users is always uncertain, due to weather and economic conditions, as a result of customer migration from the regulated-tariff public service to the free market or migration between free suppliers. In principle, this risk is taken by suppliers, as they will have to make adjustments for surpluses or shortages at market prices. Nonetheless, MIBEL's current transition phase, which is causing considerable uncertainty as to the share of consumption on the free market with more or less attractive public tariffs and competitive dynamics, requires dynamic management of this risk by means of periodic, integrated intervention via the Price and Volumes Committee set up for the purpose. Operational supply quality risk: In the free market, the criteria for quality of supply service are the full responsibility of the Group, which has focused on its good management. Credit risk: Where sales are concerned, this risk is managed first by the contractual criteria and second by EDP Soluções Comerciais S.A. “EDP Soluções Comerciais”), which is responsible for meter reading, billing and collection (HC Energía and Naturgas in Spain). As required by law, consumers that receive energy at a regulated tariff are customers of EDP Serviço Universal, the supplier of last resort. In Portugal, as of 1 January 2011, this unit only covers domestic and non-domestic consumers that have not yet moved to the regulated market and that have been subject to a transition tariff since 1 January 2013. On 1 January 2013, regulated energy sales tariffs to domestic end users were abolished and so new customers have to choose a free market operator. Customers still paying a regulated tariff have a transition period to change to the liberalised market and their consumption is charged at a transition tariff fixed by the ERSE and subject to periodic review. Regulatory risk: This activity is low risk, though deviations in forecasts of energy purchase costs made by the regulator – Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços Energéticos – and the resulting creation of high deficits or surpluses, cause concern as to the fair remuneration of this volatility. We hope that the ongoing progressive abolition of regulated tariffs for the sale of electricity will make it possible to step up the competitive balance mechanisms and monitor more closely the performance of international costs of raw materials for electricity generation. Operational supply quality risk: Irrespective of the regulated criteria for quality of supply service (e.g. average response time in providing customer service, percentage of low voltage meter readings), the Group has put considerable effort into managing this risk, as their impacts on management of the brand erosion risk. Credit risk: Management of this risk has been delegated to EDP Soluções Comerciais and is carried out in accordance with the regulations defined for public service customers (power cuts when bills are not settled within payment deadlines). Regulatory risk The changes in the rules on remuneration of this activity can affect income of EDP Distribuição – Energia, S.A. and HC Energia. In addition to fair defence of valuation criteria, the Group follows best practices in planning, construction, operation and maintenance of grids and seeks to achieve and, if possible, exceed gains in efficiency set out in regulatory goals. Operational risk of quality of technical service and losses: Regardless of the criteria on quality of technical service (e.g. duration and number of interruptions and service restoration times) and incentives for reducing physical losses from the grid, the Group has placed considerable emphasis on managing this risk, as their impacts are substantial on management of the risk of erosion of the brand and efficient energy management policy. Grid operational risk: The existence of infrastructures in the public domain (e.g. lines, cables and transformer stations) may increase the impact of outages and incidents. This risk is mitigated by conduction methods, maintenance and safety procedures in line with the highest international standards. Nonetheless, extreme, unusual weather conditions have resulted in power cuts and substantial damage and media coverage. Our response to this type of crisis has improved significantly. Insurable risks are insured. Environmental risk: Although less than in electricity generation, there is the problem of overhead lines and birdlife, surrounding areas and even their visual impact. Careful attention is paid to all these aspects of a project. The layout is designed to minimise these effects and the structure of the pylons is made compatible with the birds that use them as perches or nesting places. The lines in migratory corridors are flagged to prevent collisions. For more information on EDP's performance in this area, see the Sustainability Committee section in Chapter II.3. Although the market and regulatory conditions may be different, the above principles and methods apply to the gas distribution and supply business units, Energias do Brasil and EDP Renováveis. EDP Renováveis has been the main source of growth in the Group and of geographical diversity of investments. It has confirmed the change in the Group's generation profile to a portfolio that is less dependent on CO2 emissions and therefore to low exposure to the risks of greenhouse gas emissions. The current size requires careful management of the pipeline of projects, flexible hiring of wind turbines and operation and maintenance conditions in order to avoid the operational risks of not launching projects or not finishing them on time and not achieving the best standards of operating efficiency. The nature of this type of generation means that the results of investments are highly dependent on each country's energy and regulatory policies. This aspect is carefully weighed within the criteria of acceptable minimum return. Exposure to the electricity market price is mitigated considerably by remuneration of generation with fixed tariffs, long-term PPAs (power purchase agreements) and effective hedging strategies. In addition to the sale of energy, in some regions remuneration also consists of green certificates whose value usually carries a market risk. This risk is also considerably mitigated with longterm contracts (only for green certificates or sometimes included in the energy sales contract). Risk mitigation options depend on the remuneration structure in each country. Investment-associated risks: Investment assessment and decisions standardise criteria for defining discount rates to be used to assess expected cash flows and create scenarios (which include different sensitivities, such as price risk, energy volume risk and regulatory risk). These criteria help to mark out limits in the Group’s appetite for risk, with the capital cost of each business unit/region being reviewed on a regular basis. The investment committees at the business unit and corporate level allow for effective implementation of these mechanisms in the assessment phase and for the monitoring of the execution of the investments, monitoring operational risks in these phases and their potential impact on the expected value. Financial risk: The Group's financial risks are mainly managed by the Financial Management Department, which manages the Group's cash in the Iberian Peninsula and its debt portfolio and interest rate and exchange rate risks with market financial instruments. In Brazil, Energias do Brasil abides by similar principles and methods in coordination. The liquidity risk continued to warrant particular attention. EDP's credit profile in this difficult context for Portugal is higher than that of Portugal and it has issued bonds necessary for the usual rollover of debt and to finance the Group's activity. Financial deleveraging is a strong strategic commitment in the EDP Group and its goal is therefore of improving its net debt / EBITDA ratio in upcoming years. The purchase of minority stakes in EDP Renováveis to a total of EUR 2 billion by China Three Gorges by 2015 is fundamental in achieving this financial deleveraging goal (acquisition of 49% of EDP Renováveis Portugal, S.A. agreed in 2012 and signing of memorandums of understanding in December 2013 for the acquisition of 50% of the Cachoeira Caldeirão Hydroelectric Power Station, 50% of the Jari Hydroelectric Power Station and 49% of the holding of EDP Renováveis in ENEOP – Eólicas de Portugal). In terms of liquidity, in December 2013, cash and lines of credit available totalled EUR 4.439 million, of which EUR 2,180 million billion were cash and cash equivalents and EUR 2,259 million lines of credit. The liquidity risk has therefore been mitigated thanks to our debt management policy, the contracting of new financing and the availability of lines of credit obtained (underwritten) but not used. Thanks to the Group's financial policies, its market risk is very low and the counterparty risk is diversified and involves credible financial entities. Liabilities resulting from the EDP Group Defined Benefit Pensions Fund and health care benefits in Portugal are fully covered by the Pension Fund assets and specific provisions included in the EDP balance sheet. An independent actuary calculates these liabilities every year based on IFRS-IAS assumptions, taking account of aspects such as the fund's performance, demographics, economic variables and applicable requirements. Operational risk: This involves potential losses resulting from incidents caused by faulty or inadequate procedures, staff, equipment or systems or resulting from external incidents (including the risk of failure to comply with legislation and ethical standards; operating losses including economic and non-economic effects and loss of reputation). The most significant risks that are transferable to the insurance market have to do with industrial facilities. For these and the risks resulting from complaints by third parties regarding material or personal losses and their consequences that may result from the activity of Group companies, the Insurable Risk Office at EDP Valor has been following the approved Strategic Insurance Plan based on joint programmes for all Group companies in Portugal and Spain, direct contracts with the insurance market and a more prominent role for the Group's captive insurance company, Energia RE. This joint policy has made it possible to optimise insurance costs and improve control thereof. The Group does not expect any substantial negative repercussions in terms of legal risks, i.e. litigation related to operations, licensing of new facilities and necessary compliance with tax and accounting obligations. The Group's diversity of lines of business continued to ensure a low degree of intrinsic risk, mainly due to: (i) the high relative weight of businesses not exposed to market risks, (ii) growth in low-risk activities, such as wind generation with low exposure to electricity market prices (iii) appropriate hedging policies for mitigating financial and fuel price risks and the risk of the price and volume of electricity placed or bought on the market and (iv) greater geographical diversification of risk due to the lower weight of the Iberian Peninsula. This geographical diversification has been vital in mitigating the company's risks, especially those associated with the European sovereign debt crisis and regulated risks in specific markets. The Group's risk organisation and processes have received the highest scores in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, with an invitation to step up integrated R2R methods and include them in the normal management of the business units and Corporate Centre. This process is based on the following components: x Identification de riscos – Risk Assessment. Steps have been taken to ensure that this process is included in the usual cycle of preparing the business plan and budget, at least for the most important risks from a top management viewpoint. These include a risk portal for the Risk Management Department to use to record work done and consolidate the most important risks and for the business units to use as needed. This portal was developed in-house and consistently gathers information on each relevant risk, with a qualitative and, as far as possible, quantitative assessment of the overall, expected, minimum and maximum impact, probability, level of control and preparation of priority matrices for action or control. It enables us to answer the following questions: What are the most important risks for each business unit and how great are they? x Risk officer This is how we clarify responsibilities in risk management, coherence in delegation of duties and contracting of supplies and services from internal or external outsourcers. For each of the priority risks, we endeavour to identify key measures than can be used to prevent or mitigate a risk or decide on the transfer of risk to another entity (e.g. insurance, hedging). This instrument answers the following questions: Who is responsible for managing a certain risk? What are the risks which it is to EDP's advantage to manage and which should it transfer to other entities? x Appetite for risk Considering that we assess how the Group plans to grow (business areas, regions, acquisitions or in-house), how it will be financed for the purpose (and the commitment to pay dividends) what ratings it wishes to maintain or achieve, this last one is the basic operating condition, by satisfying appropriate ratios: Net debt/EBITDA; FFO/net debt, among others Although ratings depend on a broader set of indicators, some of which are subjective, and also on the sovereign rating itself, which some rating agencies claim constitutes the limit for a country's companies' ratings (e.g. it is hard for a company's rating to be one or two levels higher than sovereign ratings), the former are the most important indicators and are part of the established controls. From a strategic point of view, the Group's Annual Report and Accounts defines the overall limits of its activity – vision – and the commitments that it makes, which delimit risk areas in which it operates (i.e. the risk of a multi-utility type strategy outside energy is not considered). It enables us to answer the following questions: Does the company have the share capital necessary for its risks? Is it overexposed or underinsured? How much risk would it like to take? x Integrated risk assessment This aspect of risk control is designed to use bottom up methods to assess the values at risk of EBITDA, cash flow and other financial indicators relevant to the most important business units and of consolidated values within the Business Plan timeline. Top down methods are also used to calculate values at risk and make comparisons with competitors on the basis of the market performance of EDP's shares and public financial information. The aim is also to extrapolate for longer timelines the effects on our risk profile of expected changes in businesses and different strategic options for the composition of our business portfolio. This instrument answers the following question: Do the most important business decisions take account of the impact on EDP's aggregate risk? x Governance and risk management This component of the risk management process is based on the Corporate Policy on Business Risk Management defined by the Executive Board of Directors and the purposebuilt structure. This instrument answers the following questions: Are there risk management and control processes? Are they effective? Some of most important aspects of activity in 2013 were as follows: x Six-monthly report Top 5 Risks/ Uncertainties of the EDP Group, which analyses the five uncertainties of the company's activity that, due to their potential for rapid growth or significant impact on the EDP Group, warrant special attention from the corporate structure. x Aggregate top down risk analysis and comparison with rival companies, which continued to show a lower level of aggregate risk for EDP Group's business than its peers. x Detailed bottom up risk analysis of EDP Renováveis and the main risks in the company's different regions. x Analysis of the market, counterparty and liquidity risk of the EDP Group's debt x Analysis of the optimal share capital structure and appropriate liquidity for the EDP Group. x Active collaboration in EDP's implementation of new European rules on the energy sector (REMIT) and financial markets (EMIR). x Analysis of practices and methods in credit risk management in the companies supplying energy in the Iberian Peninsula. x Drafting of a periodic report on current risks in the European energy markets. x Study of the impact of climate change in Portugal and Spain in average rainfall levels and wind levels in hydroelectric and wind generation. Correlations between regions, systems and long-term trends. Quantification of economic impact. x Active contribution to Focus Group Enterprise Risk Management and Task Force Risk Analysis and Recommendations on Eurelectric’s Power Choices Study”. x Organisation of the fourth meeting of the EDP Group's risk Officers, where employees from the different business units and Corporate Centre presented risk issues of relevance to the company and shared experiences.. x Organisation of an EDP Group conference on risk management, where relevant, topical matters were introduced and discussed, such as the expected future performance of its risk profile. x Assistance to EDP Serviço Universal and EDP Soluções Comerciais in developing and implementing crisis and business continuity management processes. The EDP Group's management includes an internal control system in the form of its Internal Control System for Financial Reporting (SCIRF), which was designed on the basis of the best international practices and the COSO and COBIT models. In order to ensure that there are control mechanisms and procedures for mitigating the risk of fraud and materially relevant errors in its financial statements, EDP has set up a cycle of maintenance and assessment to define the activities, processes and controls and a responsibility model that sets out the duties and managers participating at corporate level and in corporate units and business units (CUs and BUs). In 2013, as part of the maintenance of the cycle, work was done at corporate level and in subgroups and companies. The work performed at corporate level was as follows: x Annual planning and monitoring of the cycle, maintenance and review of reference models, methodological and conceptual support for the CUs and BUs; x Identification of the scope of SCIRF 2013 using the model on the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2012, based on criteria of materiality and top down (Corporate Internal Audit Department) and bottom up (CUs/BUs), which identified the companies and departments at the Corporate Centre. The SCIRF covered most of the companies in Portugal, Spain and Brazil separately and the units making up EDP Renováveis, S.A., EDP Renewables Europe, S.L. and EDP Renewables North America, LLC aggregately; x The scope model identified new subjects for documentation and implementation of controls by local managers and the redesign of processes resulting from organisational, structural, legislative and operational changes; x We identified the computer programmes used in the processes covered by the result of use of the scope model and pinpointed the associated service organisations. An ISAE 3402 report or an independent assessment was required on the control environment used in services provided to the EDP Group; x The assessment cycles identified some relevant issues and recommendations that have received specific monitoring by the businesses and technical support and supervision from the Corporate Internal Audit Department. Highly significant progress was made, thereby stepping up the SCIRF's quality and solidity. x Nonconformities identified in the assessment cycles were analysed and corrective action was identified and implemented by local managers, with oversight, support and monitoring from the IAD. The percentage of corrections was substantial; x The self-certification process in which the SCIRF managers perform a self-assessment of their remit, starting from the processes, their controls and process groups and ending at company level, was completed successfully. The chain certificates issued in an upward sequence in the hierarchy of control in each CU/BU are explicit recognition of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the process (appropriate and up to date), control activities (with sufficient evidence), resolution of nonconformities and application of the code of ethics (knowledge and compliance); x In partnership with the Training, Recruitment and Documentation Department at EDP Valor, new training was given to SCIRF managers in Portugal and in-house training of auditors, to further their knowledge of control concepts and practices; x In the analysis of matrixes of incompatibilities of duties (IT and business) a comparison was made between real and theoretic incompatibilities. The ratio of real incompatibilities was lower than 1%. In addition, a schedule of access and segregation of duties was developed for supervisors to manage incompatibilities and validations of transactions performed by their teams in order to mitigate risks and step up control; x An assessment was made of control design to confirm that its structure was appropriate for the timely prevention of materially relevant errors and/or improper appropriation of Group resources; and x Assessment of the operational effectiveness of controls to confirm their compliance with the design and implementation of this execution by qualified practitioners. The work performed in subgroups and companies was as follows: x Analysis of result of application of scope model to the individual financial statements and inclusion of new subjects, such as estimates, valuations and assessments subject to professional judgements identified as high risk in a bottom-up analysis; x The subgroup EDP Renováveis, HC Energia/Naturgas and EDP Brasil also identified their standalone scope with a significance and risk profile suited to their size. Independent reports on the SCIRF by external auditors were published in their annual reports and accounts, in line with the publication in the consolidated reports and accounts; x The EDP Brasil SCIRF was assessed by PricewaterhouseCoopers Brazil, the new external auditor in Brazil in coordination with KPMG Portugal, for the Group's independent report; x Identification, review and appointment of SCIRF managers based on the result of the model and revision and/or updates resulting from organisational, structural, legislative and operational changes in the business units; x Documentation of new processes and controls and redesign of processes and controls documented in previous cycles; x Necessary action to resolve nonconformities identified in the assessment tests; and x Self-assessment in which the SCIRF managers assess the sufficiency and update status of documentation and maintenance of evidence in control activities at different levels of each hierarchy. The SCIRF 2013 was performed by the Group's External Auditor in accordance with ISAE 3000 – International Standard on Assurance Engagements in all the regions covered by the scope model, with the assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers for EDP Brasil. The Group's procedures in the maintenance, assessment and monitoring of the SCIRF show a reasonable degree of certainty as to the reliability of the financial information provided to the market, ensuring quality and solidity in line with the best practices and international standards. No material deficiencies were detected. The External Auditor issued an independent report on the Group's Internal Control System for the financial statements as at 31 December 2013, as described in Annex “External Checks”. The essential role of the Investor Relations Department is to act as the interlocutor between EDP's Executive Board of Directors and investors and the financial markets in general. It is responsible for all the information provided by the EDP Group, in terms of disclosure of privileged information and other market communications and publication of periodic financial statements. In carrying out its duties, the department is in constant contact with investors and financial analysts, providing all the information that they request, while observing the applicable legal and regulatory provisions. EDP's Investor Relations Department comprises six people and is coordinated by Miguel Viana. It is located at the company’s head office: Praça Marquês de Pombal, n.º 12, 3º Piso 1250-162 Lisboa Telephone: +351 21 001 2834 Fax + 351 21 001 2899 E-mail: ir@edp.pt Website: www.edp.pt The table following shows the communication channels through which EDP provides its shareholders with information on each type of documentation. 2 IR Phone Number www.cmvm.pt www.edp.pt 1 CHANNELS In Person 3 E-mail By Mail 4 Elements required by law or regulation Notice of meeting √ √ √ √ √ √ Board of Directors' proposals √ √ √ √ √ Amendment of the Articles of Association √ √ √ √ √ Other proposals √ √ √ √ Annual Report √ √ √ √ Management and supervisory positions held in other Group companies by company officers √ √ √ √ Elementos adicionais disponibilizados pela EDP Ballots for voting by proxy √ √ √ √ √ Ballots for voting by mail √ √ √ √ √ Ballots for voting by e-mail √ √ √ √ √ C larification of any issues √ √ √ √ √ EDP Articles of Association and Regulations √ √ √ √ √ √ 1) At EDP' s headquarters 2) IR phone number +351 21 001 2834; 3) Written notice from the C haiman of the Executive Board of Directors regarding Annual General Meetings 4) Art. 289 of C ompanies C ode ang Regulation of C MVM 5/2008 The representative for market relations is Nuno Maria Pestana de Almeida Alves, member of the Executive Board of Directors. EDP's goal is for communication with the market to consist of objective, transparent information that is understandable to all stakeholders and financial market agents. This is only possible with a financial reporting policy based on transparent, consistent information provided to investors and analysts, as the company has been doing. The company has therefore made a systematic effort to meet the needs of investors and analysts, which is not an easy task due to the complexity of the sector, always with a view to fostering relationships of trust with financial agents and markets. In 2013 research reports were written by 21 institutions and at the end of the year, there were six recommendations to buy, nine to hold and six to sell. In 2013, EDP participated in events with analysts and investors to inform the market of the company's strategy and operational and financial performance. These included roadshows, presentations to analysts and investors, meetings and conference calls. 184 market communications were made in 2013. The Investor Relations Department received 498 requests for information and had 642 meetings with analysts and investors. The average response time to queries was less than 24 hours and no requests were held over into 2014. The company's efforts have been rewarded at a number of events. At the “IR Magazine Europe Awards 2013”, EDP was considered the best European utility company and best Portuguese company and came 14th overall. EDP also won first place in the best sustainability practices category. In addition, EDP was recognised by the “IR Global Rankings 2013” as the best company in terms of financial reporting for analysts and investors, out of more than 300 listed companies worldwide that underwent scrutiny by IR Global Rankings analysts. EDP's website (www.edp.pt) provides comprehensive legal or corporate governance information, updates on the Group's activity and complete financial and operational data in order to facilitate searches and access to information by shareholders, financial analysts and others.

When establishing the remuneration of the members of the General and Supervisory Board and Statutory Auditor, the Remuneration Committee of the General Meeting takes account of its fixed nature and the imperative rules on its determination, in particular Article 440 (2) of the Company Code, which sets out the criteria for setting the remuneration of the General and Supervisory Board, Article 374-A of the Company Code on the remuneration of members of the officers of the General Meeting and Article 60 of Decree-Law 224/2008 of 20 November on the remuneration of the Statutory Auditor. The membership of the Remuneration Committee of the General Meeting and the Remuneration Committee appointed by the General and Supervisory Board is set out in Point 29. No natural or legal persons were hired to assist the Remuneration Committee in its duties in 2013. Therefore, no-one who provides or has provided in the last three years services to any body answering to the Executive Board of Directors or the Executive Board of Directors itself or who is currently a company consultant was hired. This statement covers any natural or legal persons that are related to them by an employment or service agreement. The Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board is composed of members of the General and Supervisory Board with qualifications and experience in remuneration policy. Remuneration policy for the members of the managing body is set by the Remuneration Committee appointed by the General and Supervisory Board. This committee defined the remuneration of the directors, intending for it to reflect the performance of each member of the Executive Board of Directors in each year of their term of office (annual variable remuneration) and their performance during their term by fixing a variable component that is consistent with maximisation of EDP's long-term performance (variable multi-annual remuneration). The recommendation uses an undetermined concept whose satisfaction depends on the concrete circumstances of the issuing company and especially on its shareholders' understanding of what is reasonable in these circumstances. Interpretation of the reasonability of the relative weight of the variable remuneration against the fixed remuneration must take account of the other elements in the recommendation, particularly of orientation towards alignment of the remuneration structure with the shareholders' long-term interests. One of the natural consequences of this principle is an increase in the weight of the variable component in order to create appropriate incentives for the company's executive directors to foster sustainable growth. The relative weight of the variable remuneration against the fixed remuneration take account particularly of orientation towards alignment of the remuneration structure with the shareholders' long-term interests. As a result the weight of the variable component is higher to create appropriate incentives for the company's executive directors to foster its sustainable growth. The remuneration policy statement, as approved by the shareholders, lays down that the total variable component can reach twice the fixed component during a term of office, thereby placing a maximum limit of twothirds of the remuneration depending on fulfilment of strict company performance goals. Variable remuneration depends on whether the executive directors achieve a performance of 90% of the business plan. Only if they achieve 110% fulfilment will they receive the maximum amounts allowed by the company's remuneration policy. Variable remuneration is divided into annual, which may only reach 80% of fixed remuneration, and multiannual, which may reach 120% of the fixed remuneration. Variable multi-annual remuneration is only paid if the goals have been met and is paid three years after the financial year in question. If the remuneration goals are fully met in a term of office, 60% of the directors' variable remuneration is deferred for no less than three years. If we compare this percentage with that set out for credit institutions and financial companies, pursuant to Directive 2010/76/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November, as it is a paradigm that was widely analysed and discussed in Europe, we find that EDP's policy on variable remuneration is equivalent to the strictest used by these entities. In accordance with the remuneration policy of the members of the Executive Board of Directors proposed by the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board “a significant part of the variable remuneration” corresponding to the variable multi-annual remuneration may be a maximum of 120% of gross annual remuneration and it will be paid three years after the financial year in question. The remuneration policy statement approved by the General Meeting on 6 May, 2013 for 2012/2014 sets out the following: x Fixed remuneration – EUR 600,000 annual gross for the CEO and 80% of this sum for the remaining members of the Executive Board of Directors. Maintenance of directors' retirement savings plans during their term of office, at a net amount of 10% of their fixed Annual remuneration. The characteristics of these retirement savings plans are set out in current legislation applicable to these financial products; x Annual variable remuneration– for each member of the Executive Board of Directors it may vary between 0% and 80% of their gross annual fixed remuneration. The amount is determined on the basis of the following indicators for each year in office: performance of the EDP Group's total shareholder return against Eurostoxx Utilities and PSI-20, ROIC/WACC, growth in gross margin, growth in net profit, performance of EBITDA and free cash flow. The weighted average of these indicators is given an overall weight of 80% for all members of the Executive Board of Directors, when determining their performance bonus. The other 20% is based on an individual assessment by the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board. x Multi-annual variable remuneration– also for each member of the Executive Board of Directors, this component may be between 0% and 120% of their gross annual remuneration based on an annual accumulated assessment of the directors' performance in achieving economic sustainability for the EDP Group. The award of this multi-annual remuneration, although calculated on an annual basis, only takes effect if, at the end of the term of office, at least 90% of the strategic objectives have been achieved. These will be assessed on the basis of performance and comparison with defined strategic benchmarks. This payment component is fixed on the basis of the following factors: performance of the EDP Group's EBITDA in the term of office, ROIC/WACC, relative performance of total return for the Group's shareholders against Eurostoxx Utilities and PSI-20 in the term of office, performance of the sustainability index applied to the EDP Group (DJSI method) and relative performance of free cash flow in the term of office. The weighted average of these indicators is given an overall weight of 68% for all members of the Executive Board of Directors, when determining their performance bonus. As for annual indicators, 32% of the remuneration that is determined by internal assessment of the Executive Board of Directors by the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board is reserved. The remuneration of the members of the General and Supervisory Board is fixed, in view of their duties. The remuneration of the Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board was fixed on the basis of the full-time performance of his duties, unlike the rest of the members. At the Annual General Meeting on 6 May, 2013, the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee of the General Meeting submitted an appreciation of the remuneration policy for the corporate bodies, with the exception of the Executive Board of Directors, for the current three-year period, as follows: x A simple, clear, transparent policy in line with EDP's culture so that remuneration practices can be based on uniform, consistent, fair, balanced criteria. x A policy consistent with effective risk management and control in order to avoid excessive exposure to risk and conflicts of interest and achieve coherence with the company's long-term goals and values. x Assessment and encouragement of meticulous action in which merit is properly rewarded, while ensuring levels of homogeneity compatible with the necessary cohesion of the General and Supervisory Board but still taking account of the economic and financial situation of the company and the country. x Alignment of remuneration of the members of corporate bodies in companies with the highest market capitalisation and especially Iberian counterparts. x The latest recommendations of the European Union and CMVM. x Consideration of the effects of the serious economic crisis and current financial constraints, in order to meet requirements of great social justice in the country and in the company's different remuneration schemes. Based on these criteria the committee decided that: a) The remuneration of the members of the General and Supervisory Board, including its Chairman, must be lower than those of the members of the Executive Board of Directors and there will be no variable component or any other remunerative supplement. b) The difficulties that the country is experiencing as a result of the worldwide economic, financial and social crisis require containment of remuneration, though account should always be taken of the merits and the complexity of the work of the members of each body in order not to jeopardise the company's cohesion, stability and development. c) The progressive increase in work and responsibility of the Audit Committee members must be taken into consideration in order to differentiate them from the other members of the General and Supervisory Board. d) It is also important to distinguish other specific positions in the General and Supervisory Board, such as the coordination work of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman. The shareholders approved the statement of remuneration policy. As set out in the remuneration policy described in Point 69, remuneration is structured to allow alignment of the interests of the members of the Executive Board of Directors with the company's long-term interests. The time period considered for determining the multi-annual variable component of remuneration (paid three years after the financial year in question), the use of qualitative criteria aimed at a strategic medium-term perspective in the company's development, existence of a cap on variable remuneration and the relative weight of this component in total remuneration are decisive elements in fostering company management that is not focused only on short-term goals but also includes the medium and long-term interests of the company and its shareholders. The members of the managing body have not concluded any agreements with the company or third parties that have the effect of mitigating the risk of variability of their remuneration fixed by the Remuneration Committee. As described above in point 69, remuneration policy in effect for 2012/2014 involves three main components: i) fixed remuneration, ii) annual variable remuneration and iii) multi-annual variable remuneration. The indicators used to assess the performance of the Executive Board of Directors in order to determine annual and multi-annual variable remuneration are as follows: 1) Quantitative component and its weight Total shareholder return vs. Eurostoxx utilities and PSI20: 19% ROIC/WACC: 19% Growth in gross profit: 14% Growth in net profit: 14% Performance of EBITDA: 7% Performance do Free Cash-Flow: 7% The 80% resulting from the weighted sum of these indicators reflects a performance common to all the members of the Executive Board of Directors. 2) Qualitative component The other 20% is based on an individual assessment by the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board, based on the individual performance of each member of the Executive Board of Directors. The resulting amount of the quantitative and qualitative component is then weighted, as mentioned above, by a coefficient of 80% of the annual fixed remuneration. 1) Quantitative component and its weight Total shareholder return vs. Eurostoxx utilities and PSI20: 17% ROIC/WACC: 17% Performance of EBITDA: 8.5% Performance do Free Cash-Flow: 8.5% Sustainability performance Indicator: 17% The 68% resulting from the weighted sum of these indicators reflects a performance common to all the members of the Executive Board of Directors. 2) Qualitative component The other 32% is based on an individual assessment by the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board, based on the individual performance of each member of the Executive Board of Directors. The resulting amount of the quantitative and qualitative component is then weighted, as mentioned above, by a coefficient of 120% of the annual fixed remuneration. The multi-annual variable remuneration is calculated every year and only becomes effective at the end of the term of office if at least 90% of the strategic goals have been achieved, as assessed on the basis of company performance and its comparison with the strategic benchmarks and the individual contribution of each member of the Executive Board of Directors. All multi-annual eventual variable remuneration are paid three years after the financial year in question. The members of the Executive Board of Directors do not own company shares under variable remuneration schemes. EDP has no variable remuneration option schemes. Company directors do not receive any significant remuneration in the form of non-monetary benefits. EDP has no specific benefits system in place for its directors. The remuneration fixed by the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board provides for a retirement savings plan-type standard financial product for the members of the Executive Board of Directors, who contribute 10% (ten percent) of their net fixed annual remuneration. It was granted by decision of the General Meeting of 6 May, 2013 as part of the remuneration policy statement. This financial product does not entail any cost to EDP in the future, as it is merely a subscription to a financial product while the members of the managing body hold their positions and is not covered by Article 402 (1) of the Company Code. The total gross amount paid by EDP to the members of the Executive Board of Directors in 2013 was 5,270,329.58 euros The table below shows the gross amounts of remuneration paid individually to the members of the Executive Board of Directors .

The amounts paid by EDP subsidiaries refer solely to their period of residence abroad.

Remunerations paid by companies majority held by EDP Euros Fixed Variable (2012) João Manuel Veríssimo Marques da C ruz 240,000.00 EDP has no schemes in place for payment of remuneration in the form of profit-sharing and/or payment of bonuses. There are no agreements between the company and members of the managing and supervisory bodies providing for compensation in the event of termination, as proven by the remuneration policy statement in effect for 2013. As a result no compensation for termination was paid or is owed to former directors. It should also be noted that there are no contracts for severance payment in force, nor does the remuneration policy provide for such, in the event of dismissal or termination by agreement from the post of director. In particular, the company does not assign compensation beyond the legally required in case of dismissal from the post of director founded in inadequate performance neither was any payments made in this context during the year 2013. The total gross amount paid by EDP to the members of the General and Supervisory Board in 2013 was 1,739,354.14 euros.

The Vice-Chairman of the General Meeting is paid an amount of EUR 2,000 a year, plus EUR 2,000 for each meeting over which s/he presides. In accordance with the remuneration policy statement in effect for 2013, EDP has no existing contracts providing for payments in the event of dismissal or termination by mutual agreement of directors. Considering Article 248-B (3) of the Securities Code, EDP has no directors other than the members of the corporate bodies. In addition to the members of these bodies, there are no managers who have regular access to privileged information and participate in decisions on the company's management and business strategy. Furthermore, we reiterate that, in accordance with the remuneration policy statement approved at a General Meeting and in effect for 2013, EDP has no existing agreements providing for payments in the event of dismissal or termination by mutual agreement of directors. The only stock option plan currently in effect is that for the managing body in 2003/2005. As a part of the variable remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the members of the Executive Committee who held positions from 2003 to 2005, the Remuneration Committee at the time allocated options for each year, based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment of each financial year. Under this plan, each call option can be exercised up to a maximum of 1/3 on each first anniversary of the date of award. Options not exercised become null and void at the end of eight years from the date of allocation. In 2013, 416,511 options were exercised, as shown in the table below, which also details all allocations for 2003 to 2005.

The company has no such control mechanisms. The General and Supervisory Board approved objective, transparent rules on the identification, prevention and resolution of relevant corporative conflicts of interest called Framework on Handling of Conflicts of Interest, which was revised in late 2009. Following a decision made by the General and Supervisory Board, on 17 May, 2010 the Executive Board of Directors approved the rules on identification, in-house reporting and procedure in the event of conflicts of interest applicable to all EDP Group employees who play a decisive role in transactions with related parties. These rules are also available on EDP's website. As part of its improvement of governance practices, on 30 July, 2010, the General Supervisory and Board approved EDP's rules on conflicts of interest and transactions between related parties, which are available on EDP's website (www.edp.pt), which replace the Framework for Handling conflicts of Interest. This set of rules on the prevention, identification and resolution of potential corporate conflicts of interest has a wider scope of application than that set out in CMVM Regulation 4/2013. The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee is responsible for supervising enforcement of the aforementioned rules and reports on its work to the General and Supervisory Board. For further information on this matter, see Point 3.5.1. of the annual report of the General and Supervisory Board. The General and Supervisory Board noted that, on the basis of the cases analysed and information provided by the Executive Board of Directors for 2013, there was no evidence that the potential conflicts of interest in EDP's operations were resolved contrary to the company's interests. The current rules on the issue and waiving of a prior opinion from the General and Supervisory Board were approved on 7 May, 2009, along with the procedures for communication and clarifications between it and the Executive Board of Directors. Pursuant to EDP's Articles of Association, the General and Supervisory Board fixes the parameters for measuring the economic or strategic value of operations submitted to it for an opinion and sets up speedy mechanisms for issuing an opinion in urgent cases or when the nature of the subject so warrants and the situations in which this opinion can be waived (Article 21 (7)). The mechanism for waiving a prior opinion from the General and Supervisory Board may only be used in cases of exceptional urgency or if the nature of the subject so warrants, as set out in EDP's Articles of Association and the regulations of the General and Supervisory Board in effect in 2011 (current Article 13 (5)). There are therefore very few situations in which only three members of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee can be consulted All matters in which a prior opinion is waived are later appraised at meetings of the General and Supervisory Board, which has the power to eliminate any deficiencies or irregularities. Furthermore, the General and Supervisory Board has set out strict rules on transactions between related parties in order to prevent conflicts of interest. In 2013, 13 operations with an average value of EUR 308 million and a maximum value of EUR 740 million were submitted to the General and Supervisory Board for a prior opinion. Eleven operations with an average value of EUR 247 million and a maximum value of EUR 600 million were submitted to the General and Supervisory Board after waiving of a prior opinion. Information on transactions with related parties, pursuant to IAS 24, is set out in Note 46 of the consolidated and individual financial statements EDP – Energias de Portugal, S.A. (EDP) is a listed company whose securities are admitted to trading on the NYSE Euronext Lisbon stock market. Pursuant to Article 2 (1) of CMVM Regulation 4/2013 on governance of companies issuing shares admitted to trading in a regulated market located or operating in Portugal, EDP abides by the recommendations set out in the Corporate Governance Code, as approved by the CMVM in July 2013, available on www.cmvm.pt. It has not opted to follow any other code of recommendations in this matter. This report is structured in compliance with Article 1 (4) of CMVM Regulation 4/2013, and therefore abides by the model in its Annex I, not including the sections not applicable to EDP's corporate governance model. The following table lists the CMVM recommendations on corporate governance established in the refered Corporate Governance Code and indicating whether or not they ewre adopted y EDP, as well as where more detailed information can be found in this report on the adoption of each specific recommendation.

The momentum of shareholders of the Company has thus proven to be perfectly in tune with the sense advocated in the Recommendation and sufficiently apt for pursuing its goals, avoiding rigid formulas for this review set down in the Articles of Association, which has also fostered the particularly intense scrutiny of this clause by shareholders.

Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 1. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OF EDP GROUP The Group’s parent company, EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. (EDP, S.A.), was incorporated in 1976 as a result of the nationalisation and merger of the major Portuguese companies in the electricity sector operating in mainland Portugal. EDP S.A.'s head office is located in Lisbon at Praça Marquês de Pombal, 12. During 1994, as established by Decree-laws 7/91 and 131/94, the EDP Group (EDP Group or Group) was set up following the split of EDP, S.A., which led to a number of directly or indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries of EDP, S.A. The Group’s businesses are currently focused on the generation, distribution and supply of electricity and distribution and supply of gas. Although complementary, the Group also operates in related areas such as engineering, laboratory tests, vocational training, energy services and property management. The EDP Group operates essentially in the European (Portugal, Spain, France, Poland and Romania) and American (Brazil and the United States of America) energy sectors. Activity in the energy sector in Portugal Electricity Portugal The National Electricity System (SEN) basis of organization and operation, as well as the general basis applicable to the production, transportation, distribution and supply activities of electricity, and to the market organization, are established by the Decree-Law (DL) 29/2006 of 15 February, this DL was developed by the DL 172/2006 of 23 August. The DL 29/2006 was updated by DL 104/2010 of 29 September, by DL 78/2011 of 20 June, by the DL 75/2012 of 26 March and by the DL 215-A/2012 and B/2012 of 8 October, incorporating essentially the principles of the European Parliament and Council’s Directive 2009/72/CE of 13 July, establishing common rules for the electricity internal market. The National Electricity System includes the activities of generation and supply of electricity under free market competition conditions, through licensing, and the activities of transmission and distribution provided through exclusive public service concessions. The transmission, distribution and supply of last resort activities are subject to regulation by Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços Energéticos ERSE (Energy Sector Regulator), which is responsible for the preparation, issuance and enforcement of regulations and for establishing the tariffs and prices related to network usage -access tariffs and electricity supply for clients in the regulated market electricity tariffs charged by the Supplier of Last Resort. 187 For transmission, distribution and supply of last resort activities, the law establishes a remuneration right fixed by ERSE, under the tariff NEVERENDING ENERGY regulations, to ensure economic and financial balance under an efficient management. Electricity transmission is ensured by the National Transportation Network (RNT) and is carried out under public service concessions, exclusively by REN Redes Energéticas Nacionais, SGPS, S.A., for a period of 50 years. Generation The generation of electricity covers generation under ordinary and special regimes. Under the ordinary regime, where EDP Group is represented by EDP Gestão da Produção, S.A., electricity is generated and sold under free market conditions, in organised markets or through bilateral agreements, being subject only to licensing. The special regime (PRE) allows producers to deliver electricity to the network, through bilateral agreements with the Supplier of Last Resort (CUR), being subject to specific legislation, namely to promote the use of endogenous renewable resources, cogeneration or micro generation. The EDP Group is present in this segment through its subsidiaries EDP Gestão da Produção, S.A. and EDP Renováveis Portugal, S.A., among others. Following the publication of Decree-Law 240/2004 of 27 December, which established the creation of a compensation mechanism to maintain the contractual balance (CMEC), in January 2005 the EDP Group signed the early termination of contracts for the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) related to the binding electricity production plants of the EDP Group, effective as of 1 July 2007, date of the launch of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). On 16 February 2007 the Portuguese Government confirmed its decision to early terminate the PPAs and implement the CMEC mechanism and defined the rules to calculate the compensations due to the power generators for such early termination, which essentially consisted in an adjustment of the reference market price of electricity used to calculate the CMEC initial compensation amount. On 15 June 2007, EDP and REN agreed on the early termination of the PPAs, effective as of 1 July 2007. The new CMEC regulation sets the compensation due at 833,467 thousands of Euros, which in accordance with the legislation can be subject to securitisation. In June 2007, Decree-Law 226-A/2007 of 31 May, which approves the new legal regime for using hydric resources under the terms of the new Water Law (Lei da Água), came into force. This Decree-Law extends the period on which the companies, holders of hydroelectric plants relating to the various dams, can operate the public hydric resources. The extension of the operating period, and the consequent extension of the useful life of the related hydraulic fixed assets, implied a payment by the holders of the hydroelectric plants for economic and financial compensation. On that basis, the Government (INAG), REN and EDP Gestão da Produção de Energia signed on 8 March 2008, several service concession arrangements for which EDP Gestão da Produção de Energia paid approximately 759 millions of Euros (corresponding to the contractual compensation following the Dispatch 16982/07) for the extension of the period to operate the public hydric domain for an additional average period of 26 years. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 On 20 August 2012, the Administrative Order 251/2012 was published. This regulation replaces the previous mechanisms and establishes a new incentive scheme to energy generators. Capacity payments should contribute decisively and rationally to maintain the production capacity of electricity (availability incentive) and to perform future investment in new production capacity (investment incentive), and therefore, to ensure security supply levels that are not guaranteed by the operation of the normal market mechanisms. The availability incentive is applicable to thermoelectric power plants until the end of the operating license, beginning in the calendar year following the date of termination of the PAF ( Programa de Apoio Financeiro ). This incentive corresponds to an annual compensation of 6,000 Euro/MW/year. Investment incentive is applicable to new hydroelectric power plants and power enhancement projects, during the first 10 years after the formal recognition of their eligibility to receive the incentive. On 27 February, the Administrative Order 85-A/2013 was published, approving the nominal tariff applicable to the tariff repercussion of the yearly fixed amount of the costs for maintenance of the Contractual Stability Compensation (CMEC), setting the rate at 4.72%. This rate is applicable between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2027 and reflects a costs reduction for the system of approximately 13 millions of Euros per year, which corresponds to a present value of 120 millions of Euros. This adjustment results from the application of the calculating mechanism of the interest rate related with the fixed portion set out in Decree-Law 240/2004, of 27 December, amended by Decree-Law 32/2013, of 26 February (point iv) of paragraph b) n. 4 of article 5. º). Following the publication of Law 74/2013 of 4 June, which established a regulatory scheme in order to ensure the balance of competition in the wholesale electricity market, determining that the costs of general economic interest (CIEG) of the UGS tariff should also be supported by the producers under the ordinary regime and other producers not included in the guaranteed return system, the Dispatch 12955-A/2013, of 10 October fixed the payment per MWh injected into the network, for each one of the power plants covered, in 3€ for on-peak hours and 2€ for off-peak, during the period from 11 October to 31 December 2013. Directive 26/2013 of 27 December, established the terms and conditions of the business relationship between those electricity producers covered by Decree-Law 74/2013 Distribution Electricity distribution is carried out through the National Distribution Network (RND) and consists of a medium and high-tension network and a low-tension distribution network, exclusively under public service concessions. The distribution of electricity in medium and high-tension has been licensed to EDP Distribuição by the Portuguese Government for a period of 35 years, from 25 February 2009. 188 In accordance with specific legislation (Decree-law 344-B/82, with the amendments set out in Decree-law 297/86 of 19 September, Decree-law 341/90 of 30 October and Decree-law 17/92 of 5 February), the right to distribute low-tension electricity in Portugal is NEVERENDING ENERGY attributed to the municipalities (local authorities). However, Service Concession Arrangements were celebrated generally with a 20 year term between each of mainland Portugal municipalities and EDP Distribuição. These concessions are in return for payment of a rent to the respective municipalities, determined in accordance with Decree-Law 230/2008 of 27 November. Supply The Electricity supply market is open to competition, subject only to a licensing regime. Suppliers have the right of access to the national transmission and distribution networks upon payment of the access charges set by ERSE. The activity of free supply is developed by EDP Comercial, S.A. The activity of supply of last resort (CUR), including universal public service obligations, is guaranteed by EDP Serviço Universal, S.A., a company wholly owned by EDP Distribuição S.A. Electric Energy Price Regime In the non-regulated market, electricity tariffs are defined by an agreement between each supplier and its customers. In the regulated market the tariffs charged by the Supplier of Last Resort are defined by ERSE. The Decree-Law 104/2010 of 29 September, establishes the end of regulated tariffs for very high, high, medium and low-tension customers from 1 January 2011. For the low-voltage segment, the Decree-Law 75/2012 of 26 March, establishes the extinction of the regulated tariffs for sale to final customers from 1 July 2012 for customers with contracted power higher or equal to 10.35 kVA, and from 1 January 2013, for customers with contracted power less than 10.35 kVA. This law also establishes a system of transitional rates set by ERSE, as well as for economically vulnerable customers the right to join the contract on the open market or choose to keep the supply by the supplier of last resort, benefiting, in any case from discounts in the price of access provided by law. Public Domain Assets In Portugal some fixed assets relating to electricity generation and distribution in the regulated market are subject to the public domain regime. These assets are directly related with the Group's activity, which can freely manage them, but cannot dispose of them for private commercial purposes while they are related with the public domain regime. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Gas Portugal The National Natural Gas System (SNGN) basis of organization and operation, was established by the Decree-law 30/2006 of 15 February. This DL was developed by the DL 140/2006 of 26 July, that established the general basis applicable to the SNGN activities. The DL 231/2012 of 26 October, proceeds to the third amendment to the DL 140/2006, changed by the DL 65/2008 of 9 April and by the DL 66/2010 of 11 June, incorporating essentially the principles of the European Parliament and Council’s Directive 2009/73/CE of 13 July, establishing common rules for the natural gas internal market. In the distribution activity for natural gas, EDP Group develops its activity in Portugal through its subsidiary Portgás, S.A. EDP Group is present in the commercialization of natural gas, both in the regulated market (EDP Gás Serviço Universal) and the free market (EDP Gás.com and EDP Comercial). EDP Gás.com and EDP Comercial, with a trading license in the free market since 2008 and 2010, respectively, have operated in the market since the start of 2009. Additionally, the Group develops the supply business of propane gas, through EDP Gás GPL,S.A. Since 1 January 2013 the retail rates published by ERSE have a transitory character, being susceptible to quarterly reviews, according to DL 74/2012 of 26 March. This transitional period ends: (i) at 30 June 2014, for customers with annual consumption over 10,000 m3; (ii) 31 December 2014, for customers with annual consumption over 500 m3 and less than or equal to 10,000 m3; and (iii) 31 December 2015 for customers with annual consumption of less than or equal to 500 m3. On 15 June 2013, the tariffs set by ERSE were published for the years 2013-2014 as well as the parameters for the regulatory period 2013-2016. The income allowed for Portgás S.A. include the initial revaluation of its assets (with reference to 31 December 2007), approved by the Finance Ministry. On 20 December, ERSE published the directives 29/2013 and 30/2013 that approve the transitional sale tariffs for customers with annual consumption of less than or over to 10,000 m3 effective in the first quarter of 2014. Activity in the energy sector in Spain Electricity Spain In Spain, Hidroeléctrica del Cantábrico (HC Energia) is the parent company of an industrial group that operates in the electricity and gas sectors. In the electricity sector, HC Energia generates, distributes and supplies electricity. Production is based essentially on traditional coal thermal power plants and, on a smaller scale, on hydroelectric and nuclear power plants. 189 Electric Sector Regulation NEVERENDING ENERGY On 27 November 1997 the Electric Sector's Law 54/1997 was approved, which (i) implements the principles included in the Protocol signed on 11 December 1996 between the Ministry of Industry and Energy and the major electric power companies regarding greater liberalization and competition in the electricity sector and (ii) incorporates into Spanish law the provisions contained in Directive 96/92/EC on common rules for the internal electricity market. Additionally, on 6 July 2007 the Law 17/2007 of 4 July came into force, amending the Law 54/1997, to adapt it to the Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Council and Parliament of 26 June 2003 on common rules for the internal market of electricity. Law 54/1997 was updated by the Royal Decree 13/2012 of 30 March, incorporating the principles of the European Parliament and Council’s Directive 2009/72/CE of 13 July that revokes the Directive 2003/54/CE. On 27 December, was published in the Official State Gazette the Law 24/2013 which replaces Law 54/1997 maintaining the principles established in previous legislation but with particular emphasis on economic and financial sustainability of the electricity sector. The referred Law 24/2013, provides, among others, the following basic principles defined in the previous legislation: Generation Since 1 January 1998 electricity generation operates on a free market competition basis, which covers the purchase and sale of energy and other services related to the supply of electricity. The market structure for electricity generation has been widened by Law 17/2007 of 4 July, in order to include the forward market and the intraday market, as well as technical issues, complementary services, deviations management and non-organised markets. The organisation and regulation of the market for electric power generation is defined by Royal Decree 2019/1997 of 26 December, and its implementing standards. Electric energy is paid at the system's marginal price plus a component for the adjustment services necessary to ensure an adequate supply. Additionally, the Order ITC/2794/2007 of September 27, which revised the electricity tariffs from 1 October 2007, replaced the concept of power availability remuneration of electricity generation by the concept of capacity payments stated in article 16 of the Law 54/1997 (amended by Law 17/2007), which sets a remuneration of the availability service for the procurement of capacity in the medium term develop on the Order ITC/3127/2011 and the incentive to invest in long-term capacity. The installation of new generation units is liberalised, subject to obtaining the necessary permits. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Producers have the right to use primary energy sources in their generation units as deemed most appropriate, with the applicable environmental restrictions. As at 1 October 2010, the Royal Decree Law 1221/2010 was approved (which changed the Royal Decree Law 134/2010 of 12 February) that establishes the procedure for supply restrictions, as a protective measure to promote the consumption of local coal. As at 23 December of the same year entered into force the Royal Decree Law 14/2010, which obliges the producers to pay for the use of the transmission and distribution networks. On 27 January 2012 the promulgation of the Law 1/2012, temporarily suspended the new facilities' right to benefit from the specific remuneration regime of the facilities which use renewable energy sources, waste or cogeneration (applicable to the facilities that, since 28 January 2012, do not fulfill the administrative requirements referred in this standard). From 1 January 2013, the amounts of the premiums applicable to the remuneration of all facilities of the special regime were also eliminated, leaving only the tariff option or market price (Royal Decree-Law 2/2013). On 12 July 2013, the Spanish Government approved, the Royal Decree-Law 9/2013, which changes the remuneration scheme for facilities that use cogeneration, renewable energy sources and waste based on standard costs (investment and operation costs) by type of facility. The rate of return on assets will considerer the rate of the Spanish Government ten-year bonds yield, plus 300 b.p. The economic effect of this measure depends on the assumptions for each technology, as well as the number of operation years of each facility. This Royal Decree provides a reduction for the investment incentive in long-term capacity in combined cycle plants for 10,000€ /MW/year against 26,000€ /MW/year previously allocated, besides the extension of tthe applicable period to the double. Transmission Red Eléctrica de España, S.A. performs the activities of Transmission Manager and System Operator, being responsible for its technical management, to ensure the continuity of supply and efficient management of the generation and transmission systems. The responsibility for the economic management of the system is guaranteed by OMI Polo Español, S.A. The entities and qualified consumers have free access to the transmission and supply networks, setting out a system of tariffs for traffic. The remuneration for the transmission and distribution activities is set by the regulatory entity. The Royal Decree 325/2008 of 29 February, established a new fee regime applicable to electricity transportation facilities, that entered into service from 1 January 2009. However, since the adoption of the Royal Decree 9/2013, the retribution will be calculated based on the Spanish Government ten year bond yield, plus 200 basis points. 190 According to the Law 24/2013 the transmission activity is performed by a single entity. There is also a distinction made between the primary transmission system (facilities> 380 kV with international networks and with extra-peninsular and insular systems) and the secondary transmission system (facilities <220 kV other than primary transmission systems and less but fulfilling the functions of NEVERENDING ENERGY transmission). Distribution Law 54/1997 established that the remuneration for each company must respect criteria based on the costs needed to develop the activity, taking into account a model of characterization of distribution areas and other parameters. On 19 March 2008, the Royal Decree 222/2008 of 15 February entered into force, establishing a new system of remuneration for the electricity distribution activity and modified the system of Acometidas (system that regulates the installation, that connects the distribution network to the point of delivery of energy to the customers). This remuneration system is based on investments and increased demand of each distributor. On 1 April 2012, came into force the Royal Decree 13/2012, amending the remuneration criteria of the distribution activity related to the assets in use that are not amortised, taking as basis for their financial retribution and their net amount. Additionally, the return on assets in use in the year t shall be initiated at 1 January t+2. However, since the adoption of the Royal Decree 9/2013, the distribution activity renumeration will be calculated based on the Spanish Government ten-year bonds yield, plus 100 b.p. during the second quarter of 2013 and 200 b.p. from 2014 forward. These principles were embodied in the new Law 24/2013. Supply Law 54/1997 established a progressive liberalisation of electricity supply and the introduction of supply activities to enable customers to progressively choose their suppliers and liberalising the supply market from 1 January 2003. Additionally, since 1 July 2009, distributors can no longer act as suppliers (sell electricity) acting strictly as network operators. Law 24/2013 determines that certain consumers are entitled to be provided with tarrifs for small consumers and last resort tarrifs for reference traders. Electricity Tariffs Regime The activities for the energy supply are paid by consumers, through fees and charges and by specific items of the state budget (Law 15/2012 and Royal Decree-Law 9/2013) and by other items to be determined. Fees, exclusive in Spain, must be determined with the methodologies determined by the National Markets and Competence Commission (CNMC) considering the costs of the system as defined in the Law 24/2013. Charges applicable to consumers and producers are determined by calculation methods adopted by the Government and CNMC that will serve to cover certain costs of the system, without prejudice of what is in force for transport and distribution. Transitionally, and while these methods are not approved, fees and charges are defined by the Ministry of Industry and Tourism. On the other hand, on 1 July 2009 the system of electricity tariffs became extinct and all consumers were transferred to the free market. However, the Royal Decree 485/2009 of 3 April, provides that the consumers of low-tension, with contract capacity not exceeding 10 kW, are eligible for voluntary prices for the small consumer, which determines the maximum price of supply. These tariffs will be applicable by the suppliers of last resort, where EDP Comercializadora Último Recurso, S.A. is included. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Vulnerable Consumers The Royal Decree 13/2012 defined vulnerable consumers as individuals who meet certain social characteristics of consumption and consumer purchasing power determined by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade. Until then, these customers applied the criteria defined by Royal Decree 6/2009 of 30 April on the social allowance, which is a subsidy covering the difference between the value of the Tariff of Last Resort (TUR) and the reference value. The Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 establishes that social allowance will be financed by vertically integrated companies that perform simultaneously the activities of production, distribution and sale of electricity. Law 54/2013 maintains the established by Royal DecreeLaw 9/2013 and determines that the social allowance will cover the difference between the voluntary price for small consumer and a baseline, called tariff of last resort and will be applied by the correspondent reference supplier in the invoices of the covered consumers. Gas Spain NG Energia, a subsidiary of HC Energia Group which operates in the natural gas distribution and supply, owns all the EDP Group's gas assets in Spain. The transport and distribution of natural gas in Spain is a regulated activity. Law 34/1998, approved on 7 October 1998, amended by Law 12/2007 of 2 July 2007, transposed to Spanish legislation the provisions of Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 26 June 2003 related with common rules for the natural gas internal market. Law 34/1998 was updated by the Royal Decree 13/2012 of 30 March, incorporating the principles set by the European Parliament and Council’s Directive 2009/72/CE of 13 July which came to revoked the Directive 2003/55/CE. The aforementioned legislation identifies the following operators in the context of the supply of natural gas by pipeline: § Gas transport companies, owners of facilities for regasification of liquefied natural gas, transport or storage of natural gas. After the publication of Royal Decree 13/2012, companies that hold the equipment from the main network of transport must operate and manage their own networks or hand over their management to an independent operator, in the cases referred by legislation; § Distribution companies, owners of distribution facilities, whose function is to distribute natural gas by pipeline, as well as build, maintain and operate such facilities in order to bring natural gas to the consumption points; 191 § Suppliers, companies that hold access to the facilities owned by third parties, purchase natural gas for sale to consumers or other suppliers for the purpose of international exchanges; NEVERENDING ENERGY § Final consumers, who purchase natural gas for own consumption and direct consumers in the market, who have direct access to third party facilities. The Royal Decree 6/2000 of 23 June, also creates the figure of Technical Manager of the System, which is responsible for the technical management of the basic gas network and secondary transmission network, attributed to ENAGÁS, S.A. The system of provisioning and supplying based on tariffs for natural gas distribution companies expired on 1 July 2008. Since then, new last resort tariffs have been set, that can benefit consumers who are covered by the regulation (from July 2009 defined as those consuming less than 50,000 kWh / year), and which will be implemented by the suppliers, that in accordance with Article 82 of Law 34/1998 have an obligation as suppliers of last resort. EDP Comercializadora Último Recurso, S.A. is one of the trading companies designated by the Ministry. For suppliers of last resort, the Royal Decree 485/2009 makes it possible for groups of companies that have the obligation to provide lastresort electricity and gas, to aggregate in a single company both obligations (EDP Comercializadora de Último Recurso, S.A. currently covers suppliers obligations of last resort for gas and electricity). The Royal Decree 104/2010 of 5 February, regulates the supplier of last resort in the natural gas sector and establishes that the last resort tariff (TUR) became the only tariff from 1 January 2010, denying to suppliers of last resort the application of discounts over customers with TUR. Law 15/2012, of 27 December, of Fiscal measures for the Energetic Sustainability, modifies the type of taxes applied to hydrocarbons of natural gas that until this date was 0% with the exception of vehicles gas, establishes three types of taxes depending of the natural gas use, and the tax payer becomes the supplier rather than the distributor. The Ministerial Order IET/2812/2012, establishes the tariffs and the revenues related with the access to the gas sector installations by third parties, eliminating the revenues updates for the transport and distribution activities, as it defines as zero the efficiency factor applied to these infrastructures. The Ministerial Order IET/2446/2013, of 27 December, establishes the tariffs and the revenues related with the access to the gas sector installations by third parties and the remuneration of regulated activities for the year 2014. Among other measures, it restores the revenue updates mechanism for the distribution and transport activities that had been eliminated in the previous year. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Activity in the energy sector in Brazil Electricity Brazil In Brazil, the EDP Group generates, distributes and supplies electric energy through its subsidiary EDP Energias do Brasil, S.A. (EDP Energias do Brasil). In early 90s, the Brazilian electricity sector has undergone major structural and institutional changes, having migrated from a monopoly run by the State to a market model, involving private capital. This market model includes the existence of two distinct systems, the regulated system and the liberalised system. Regulated System The Regulated Contracting Environment is for the sale of electricity between generators, energy importers or retailers, selling energy to distributors who in turn, acquire energy to ensure supply to consumers. Since 2004, the main form of contracting by a distributor concessionaire is through the realization of public auctions regulated by ANEEL. The rules of these auctions are designed so that the winner is the one with the lowest price. The distribution companies must estimate the amount of electricity to contract in auctions and they are obliged to purchase 100% of their needs respecting the condition that, market increases must be met by energy from new ventures, contracted 3 years (Auction A-3) or 5 years (Auction A-5) in advance. Failure to comply with the supply of energy to its markets may result in severe fines. Liberalised system In the liberalised market, electricity is traded among production concessionaires, independent power producers, auto-producers, agents and free consumers. In this market, the contractual conditions, such as price, duration and amount of the contract are traded freely and negotiated between the parties (Decree No. 5.163/04). Free consumers can return to the regulated system under certain conditions. The Federal Government has defined changes in the electric sector through Provisional Measures. The Provisional Measure 577, published 192 on 31 August 2012, adresses the termination of public service concessions of electricity and the temporary service, and the intervention for the suitability of the public service of electricity. NEVERENDING ENERGY Regulatory changes Several significant changes in regulation regarding the electric sector occurred during 2012, such as the Provisional Measure 579/2012, in which the Federal Government presented measures to reduce electric energy bill to the consumer. The expected average reduction for Brasil amounted to 20.2% due to government actions: Concession Renewals (13%) and changes of Sector charges (7%). This measure results in the Law 12,783 of 11 January 2013. Regarding concessions renewal, the generation concessionaires in which contracts expire between 2015 and 2017 may renew their concessions and shall make available their physical energy guarantee for the quotas system to be distributed proportionally to the market share of each distributor, affecting the energy acquisition contracts. The transmission concessionaires in which contracts expire between 2015 and 2017 may renew their concessions and, considering that the assets bounded to the electricity transmission service are totally depreciated, only the operation and maintance costs will be considered for the annual allowed revenues calculation. On 23 January 2013, was published the Provisional Measure 605, which objective was to increase the scope of application of the resources of the CDE (Energy Development Account), which began promoting resources to cover the discounts applied to the tariffs and involuntary exposure of distributors resulting from the non-adherence to the extension of part of the generation concessions, this measure amended tthe Law 10,438/2002 which establishes the application of CDE resources. The Decree 7,891 of 23 January 2013, establishes more options for the implementation of CDE resources, which can be used to compensate the discount on the electricity tariffs established by law, such as the social tariff of low income, rural, water, sewage and sanitation, among others. Thus, the difference the revenue due to the discounts will no longer be reimbursed through the tariffs of other consumers. This decree was amended on 7 March 2013, by the Decree 9,745, which increased the costs that can be incurred with funds from the Energy Development Account CDE. Eletrobrás, the managing company of the sector funds, among them the CDE, is responsible for monthly transfering to the distribution utilities of the costs related to: generation allocated under the Energy Relocation Mechanism ERM (Hydrological Risk Quotas); replacement amount not covered by quotas (Involuntary Exposure) and the additional cost of the thermal power plants activation outside the order of merit (ESS Energy Security), occurred from January to December 2013 and the annual amounts approved by ANEEL to cover, entirely or partially, the positive balances in Conta de Compensação de Variação de Valores de Itens da Parcela A CVA , arising from the cost of purchasing electricity and System Services Charge ESS. Following the tariff readjustment process of EDP Escelsa, which occured on 30 July 2013, Resolution 1,576/13 approved the amount of 90,670 thousands of Reais, for EDP Bandeirante this process occurred on 23 October 2013 and Resolution 1,641/13 approved the amount of 237,874 thousands of Reais. These values were transferred by Eletrobrás, as a lump sum to cover the positive balances of CVAs corresponding to the acquisition of electricity and the ESS, as established in Decree 7,891, with redaction of the Decree 7,945. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 On 24 January 2013, ANEEL approved the Extraordinary Tariff Review ETR specific for the adjustment of energy costs, transmission costs, and sectorial charges, from all distributors. Thus, the unmanageable costs and supply tariffs will be reduced, with no impact in the distributors margin. These effects will be noticeable by consumers, from the end of January 2013. The hydropower concessions held by EDP Group Energias do Brasil have been granted after February 1995, corresponding to the date of the entry into force of Law 8,987, thus they are not covered by the regulatory changes introduced. Still, these changes will influence the rules that will be applied on the renewal of these concessions in the future, according to the following conditions: § Each hydroelectric plant should be remunerated by a tariff calculated by the ANELL; § Power selling (Physic guarantees) defined through production quotas dedicated exclusively to the regulated sector, that is to the distributors; and § Compliance with the quality service standards determined by ANEEL. Generation The generation market is based predominantly on the existence of Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) between generators and distributors, with tenders to supply long-term demand, the adjustment of medium and short term and daily market for deviations, or spot market. Electricity generation in Brazil relies mostly on hydroelectric technology. Power generation plants are the object of concession, permit or registration, according to the type of plant, the power capacity to be installed and the destination of the energy. Depending on the destination of energy, power generation plants can be classified as: § Generation companies, producing electricity for public service distribution; § Independent producers ( which assume the risk of the sale of electricity with distributors or directly with free consumers); § Auto-producers (energy generation for own consumption, the excess of which can be sold through an authorization). 193 Transmission NEVERENDING ENERGY The Brazilian transmission system, with a capacity equal or above 230 kV, is divided into transmission and sub-transmission networks, depending on the disaggregation level of the consumers market. The primary network is responsible for the transmission of electricity to large consumers and the supply of energy to any consumer of high dimension. The secondary network is basically an extension of the primary network with the objective of delivering electricity to small consumers and providing energy to large industrial customers. In December 2012, ANEEL published the Authorization Resolution No. 3,788, authorizing the transfer of the corporate direct control of Evrecy Participações Ltda., owned by EDP Energias do Brasil S.A., to the Companhia de Transmissão de Energia Elétrica Paulista CTEEP. Distribution The public service concession arrangements for electricity distribution are allocated by tender and establish rules regarding price, regularity, continuity, safety, timeliness and quality of services and supplies provided to consumers and users. These arrangements also define penalties for possible irregularities. In most states, mainly in the North and Northeast, the concession area corresponds to the state boundaries. However, mainly in São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, the concessions for distribution may cover smaller areas than the state itself. In some cases, the concession area is extended beyond the geographical limits of the state where the distribution company is located. The distribution activity operates in a regulated environment, with tariffs determined in the context of incentive regulation ( price cap ) with a remuneration on the basis of the assets used in the distribution energy service (BRR). The tariff also includes a portion to cover the operating costs established from a standard company, the reference company (with costs that would be charged by an efficient operator at the concession area). The regulatory EBITDA has two parts: (i) regulatory depreciation of BRR assets and (ii) return on capital prudently invested multiplied by the regulatory WACC, i.e. by the rate of weighted average cost of capital of sector companies. Finally, the tariffs also consider the costs of acquiring energy, hiring the use of transmission and sector-based charges as costs to be included in the tariff. The tariff portion that includes the regulatory remuneration, the depreciation charge and the value of the operating costs is called portion B. The costs of buying energy, hiring of basic network and charges, set up the portion A of the tariffs as set out in the concession contracts for distribution companies. Tariffs are adjusted annually based on changes in portion A costs and in the monetary correction of portion B costs, by the index of variation of Market prices index (IGPM), discounted of productivity gains (factor X). The adjustment index is calculated in such a way to pass the non-controlling cost variations of the portion A and the corrected portion B. Periodically (on average every 4 years), a Periodic Tariff Review occurs, generating the recalculation of all costs, the definition of a new BRR and a new reference company, capturing productivity gains occurred in the period between revisions. At the beginning of 2010 an addendum to the concession contracts of distribution companies was signed to ensure the neutrality of sector costs. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Supply The electricity suppliers that do not own electric assets, are authorised to act exclusively in the free market (ACL), selling or buying energy in quantity, conditions and prices freely negotiated. The commercialization of energy with a distributor is only possible through participation in the Auction set by the distributors , with the negotiation of contracts, for a maximum of two years, and commencement of energy delivery within a period not exceeding two years. Public Domain Assets In Brazil, fixed assets used in the distribution and the supply activities are binded to these services and cannot be removed, sold, transferred or mortgaged without the prior and express consent of the regulator (ANEEL). Activity in the Renewable Energies Sector In December 2007 the EDP Group incorporated EDP Renováveis, S.L. in Spain so as to concentrate the Group's subsidiaries in the renewable energies sector. On 18 March 2008, EDP Renováveis was converted into a public limited company. On 4 June 2008, a share capital increase of EDP Renováveis was made through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of 196,024,306 shares. This share capital increase was not subscribed by the EDP Group, resulting in a dilution of the interest held in EDP Renováveis from 100% to 77.53%. The share capital increase amounted to 1,566,726 thousands of Euros, of which 980,121 thousands of Euros relates to the capital increase and 586,605 thousands of Euros relates to the share premium. Electricity Renewable Generation In December 2013, EDP Renováveis, the subsidiary of EDP Group for the renewable energies sector, holds the share capital of EDP Renewables Europe, S.L. (EDPR EU, previous designated as Nuevas Energias del Ocidente, S.L), EDP Renewables North America , L.L.C. (EDPR NA, previous designated as Horizon Wind Energy, L.L.C. ) and EDP Renováveis Brasil, S.A., operating respectively in Europe, in the United States of America and in Brazil. 194 EDP Renewables Europe operates through its subsidiaries located in Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Poland, Romania, Italy and United Kingdom. EDPR EU's main subsidiaries are: EDP Renováveis Portugal, EDP Renewables España, EDP Renewables France, Greenwind NEVERENDING ENERGY (Belgium), EDP Renewables Polska, EDP Renewables Romania and EDP Renewables Italia. As at 31 December 2012, Spain and Portugal are the most relevant geographical markets where EDPR EU operates. In July 2007 the EDP Group acquired from Goldman Sachs, 100% of the share capital of EDPR NA, which develops, manages and operates wind farms in the United States of America. EDPR NA holds a series of wind farms in operation and a pipeline of projects under development for the construction of wind farms. Regulatory framework for the activities in Spain The Electrical Sector in Spain is regulated by Law 54 of 27 November 1997 and the subsequent amendments to legislation. In May 2007, the Spanish Government approved the Royal Decree (RD 661/2007) which implemented the new regulatory framework for wind energy installations to be built from 2008 to 2012, which will be applicable for all operating assets from 31 December 2012. According to RD 661/2007 of 25 May 2007, published in 26 May 2007, wind farms are entitled to choose between two remuneration schemes: (i) Fixed tariff and (ii) market plus premium: wind farms receive for each hour the pool price plus a variable premium. Once the decision between the two schemes has been made for a specific wind farm, it is binding for, at least, one year. Wind farms installed before January 2008 are ruled by the transitory regime, established by Decree 436/2004. Under this transitory regime, that ended in December 2012, wind farms could choose between a fixed tariff and a market option receiving market price plus a fixed premium. In July 2010, the Ministry of Industry established an agreement with two major associations of renewable energy (Spanish Wind Energy Association and Protermosolar) to change the existing regulation. This agreement resulted in the approval of Royal Decree 1,614/2010, of December 7, which defines (i) for the years 2011 and 2012 a reduction of 35% in the income applicable to wind generation defined by Royal Decree 661/2007, (ii) an addendum to article 44,3 of Royal Decree 661/2007 clarifying that future revisions of the income for energy production through renewable sources will only be applied to the installed capacity from 2012 and (iii) the definition of a limit of 2,589 hours of operation for the installed capacity. On 28 January 2012 the Spanish Government enacted Royal-Decree Law 1/2012 that approves a temporary suspension of the remuneration for renewable energy capacity not included in the pre-assignation registry. In December 2012, through the Law 15/2012 of 27 December, the Spanish Government approved a 7% across-the-board tax on electricity generation. The tax will be applied from 1 January 2013 onwards. On 4 February 2013, the Spanish Government published in the Official State Gazette the Royal Decree-Law 2/2013 that includes a set of regulatory modifications applicable to the Spanish electricity sector and affecting the wind energy assets. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 The main regulatory modifications that Royal Decree-Law 2/2013 presents towards the Royal Decree-Law 661/2007 with impact in EDP Renováveis S.A. (EDPR) effective from 1 January 2013 onwards, are as follows: § Every energy production facilities operating under the special regime are to be remunerated according to current feed-in tariff schemes for the remaining useful life of the asset; § Energy production facilities operating under the special regime currently remunerated according to the market option were able to chose, until 15 February 2013 and for the remaining useful life of the asset, a remuneration based on the electricity wholesale market price with no renewable energy premium, and neither cap nor floor prices; § The index used to annually update all the regulated activities in the electricity sector is the annual inflation excluding energy products and food prices, and any impact of tax changes. The Spanish government disclosed the Energy Market Reform, which aims to end with the Spanish tariff deficit. The government claims that the reform may eliminate 4.5 billions of Euros/year of the structural deficit by: (i) 2.7 billons of Euros reduction in regulated costs of utilities and renewable energy source companies, and (ii) 0.9 billions of Euros contribution from the Spanish Treasury which will pay throught the Budget 50% of the extra costs of generation in the non-mainland territories. However, and only with effect in 2013, the Government removed 3.6 billons of Euros of State Budget contributions which caused a tariff deficit that was not initially forecasted. The complete regulatory package will consist of: (i) a Royal Decree-Law (RD-L 9/2013, published in the Diário Oficial da União on 13 July), (ii) eight Decrees and Administrative Orders and (iii) the submission in the Parliament of the Project of Law (“Anteproyecto de Ley”). Until now, RD-L 9/2013 is the only rule approved and published: it outlines the principles that will govern the renewable energy source energy sector but it does not disclose the details of the new remuneration. According to this RD-L, renewable energy source plants will be subject to a new legal and economic framework: previous RD 661 framework will disappear and renewable energy source plants will receive the market price plus a payment per installed MW, so that the return on investment will be equivalent to the Spanish Government 10-year bonds yield plus a spread of 300bp. This Royal Decree-Law also suppresses the renewables remuneration for reactive power (2€/MWh). On 26 November 2013, the Government submitted to the CNMC ( Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia ), a draft decree 195 describing the new remuneration policy for renewables facilities. This draft decree did not include the required parameters to calculate the remuneration for the renewables’ sector activities, defining that should be retrospectively applied since 14 July. These parameters were NEVERENDING ENERGY released on 3 February 2014 when the CNMC disclosed the draft Ministerial Order containing the needed parameters to calculate the remuneration for each one of the 1,600 different types of renewable installations defined by the government. According to these parameters, wind farms built in 2004 or earlier are not eligible to receive any incentive while newest farms will receive a flat premium per installed MW untill the end of their regulatory life. The flat premium will be subject of tri-annual modifications due to updates in the forecast of the parameters affecting the profitability of the installations. Overall, the wind sector will receive 1,191 millions of Euros in 2014 which compares to the forecast of 2,000 millions of Euros that would have been received under the old regulation. This cut of approximately 800 millions of Euros in the wind sector represents 45% of the total savings for the whole renewable sector that were estimated at 1,750 millions of Euros in the budget published within the tariff and charges order draft. The spanish government did not make the announced payment of 900 millions of Euros to eliminate part of the Spanish deficit that was securitized by the own Government. The spanish government has cancelled the results of the CESUR (Contratos de Energía para el Suministro de Último Recurso) auctions dated of 19 December 2013, that would have led to a 26% increase in the electricity price to be charged to regulated residential customers in the first quarter of 2014. Instead, there was an increase of 2,8% in the electricity cost and a 0,9% increase in the access tariff. The government has also announced a structural change in the procedure of fix the electricity prices that will be designed and published in the next months. On 26 December 2013, the Spanish government published a new regulation that will govern the electricity sector (Law 24/ 2013) replacing the existing from 1997 (Law 54 /1997). The government defines that the new law´s objective is to guarantee the supply of electricity and adapt to the consumers needs at the lowest possible cost. It refers the need to finish the sector´s structural deficit that has been accumulated during the last decade as the motivation to undertake the reform. Regarding the renewable sector, the development of new installations will be conditioned to market needs, and their retribution will be based on market price with complementary revenues in order to ensure a reasonable return rate. Details on the renewable remuneration will be disclosed in the next months upon approval of the Royal Decree-Law for renewables, namely for wind farms and cogeneration assets. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Regulatory framework for the activities in Portugal The Portuguese Government published on 28 February 2013, the Decree Law 35/2013, that maintains the legal stability of the current contracts (Decree-Law 33-A/2005) and protects the value of the investments made by the wind energy producers in the Portuguese economy. The wind energy producers can voluntarily invest to secure further remuneration stability, through a new tariff scheme to be applied upon the actual 15 years established by law. The total investment will be used to reduce the overall costs of the Portuguese electricity system. In order to maximise the number of wind developers that voluntarily adheres to the extension of the remuneration framework, the Government proposed four alternative tariff schemes to be elected by each of the wind developers, that include the following conditions: (i) alternative cap and floor selling prices; (ii) alternative durations to the new scheme beyond the initial 15 years of the current contracts; and consequently (iii) alternative levels of investment (on a per MW basis) to adhere to the new scheme. EDPR has chosen a 7 year extension of the tariff defined as the average market price of previous twelve months, with a floor of 74€/MWh and a cap of 98€/MWh updated with inflation from 2021 onwards, in exchange for a payment of 5,800€/MW from 2013 to 2020. This decree also includes the possibility for wind farms under the new regime (i.e. ENEOP) to adhere to a similar scheme, still in negotiation. This Decree-Law modifies the remuneration regime applicable to the production of electricity by mini hydro plants (PCH). Establishes that the PCH that were framed by a remuneration regime prior to Decree-Law 33-A/2005, of 16 February, benefit from that remuneration regime for a period of 25 years from the date they were attributed the exploration license or until the expiration date of their water use license, whichever occurs first. After this 25year period and as longer as the above mentioned license remains valid, electricity produced by these plants will be sold at market prices. Regulatory framework for the activities in the United States of America The United States federal government and various state governments have been implementing policies to promote the growth of renewable energy, particularly wind power. The main federal renewable energy incentive program is the Production Tax Credit (PTC), which was created by the U.S. Congress as part of 1992 EPACT. Additionally, several states have passed legislation, mainly in the form of renewable portfolio standards (“RPS”), which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy supply from renewable sources, similar to the Renewable Energy Directive in the EU. On 1 January 2013, the US Congress approved The American Taxpayer Relief Act that includes an extension of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind energy, including the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) instead of the PTC. Congress set 31 196 December 2013 as the new expiration date of these benefits and changed the qualification criteria (projects will only qualify as long as they are under construction by year-end 2013). The legislation also includes a depreciation bonus on new equipment placed in service which allows the depreciation of a higher percentage of the cost of the project (less 50% of the Investment Tax Credit) in the year that it NEVERENDING ENERGY is placed in service. This bonus depreciation was 100% in 2011 and 50% for 2012. 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated and company financial statements of EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. reflect the results of the company's operations and its subsidiaries (EDP Group or Group) and the Group's interest in its associated companies, for the years 31 December 2013 and 2012. EDP S.A.'s Executive Board of Directors approved the consolidated and company financial statements (referred to as financial statements) on 27 February 2014. The financial statements are presented in thousands of Euros, rounded to the nearest thousand. In accordance with Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 of the European Council and Parliament, of 19 July 2002, as transposed into Portuguese legislation through Decree-law 35/2005 of 17 February, the company's financial statements and the Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU). IFRS comprise accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and their predecessor bodies. The EDP Group's consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the E.U. until 31 December 2013. The accounting policies used by the Group in preparing its accompanying consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2013 are consistent with those used in preparing the annual consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2012. However, as described in note 50, the Group adopted in the preparation of consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2013, the accounting standards issued by IASB and IFRIC interpretations effective since 1 January 2013. The accounting policies used by the Group in preparing the consolidated financial statements described in this note were adopted in accordance. The adoption of these new standards and interpretations in 2013 did not have a significant impact on the Group's accounts. The new standards and interpretations recently issued but not yet effective and that the Group has not yet applied on its consolidated financial statements, can also be analysed in note 50. These financial statements also present the fourth quarter income statement of 2013 with comparative figures for forth quarter of previous year. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 The financial statements were prepared under the historical cost convention, modified by the application of the fair value accounting to derivative financial instruments, financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and available-for-sale investments, except those for which fair value is not available. Assets and liabilities that are hedged under hedge accounting are stated at fair value in respect of the hedged risk. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Liabilities for defined benefit plans are recognised at the present value of the obligation net of plan assets fair value. In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, if the initial purchase price allocation of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is identified as provisional, in the subsequent 12 months after the business combination transaction, the legal acquirer should make the final allocation of the purchase price related to the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent acquired. These adjustments with impact on the amount of goodwill determined and booked in previous periods, originates a restatement of the comparative information, which are reflected on the Statement of financial position, with effect from the date of the business combinations transactions liabilities. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the Executive Board of Directors to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The issues involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates are considered to be significant, are presented in note 3 (Critical accounting estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements). In 2013, the Group began to present the segregation of provisions and employee benefits liabilities between current and non-current. Current provisions correspond to reimbursement estimates that will occur within twelve months. Employee benefits current liabilities include the contributions to be made to the pension and health care plans, and the respective payments of employee benefits expected over the next twelve months. In accordance with IAS 1, the Group retrospectively restated the comparative of 2012 having reclassified 42,798 thousands of Euros to current provisions and 182,587 thousands of Euros to current employee benefits (see notes 36 and 37). Accounting policies have been applied consistently by all Group companies and in all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. b) Basis of consolidation 197 The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities and results of EDP, S.A. and its subsidiaries (Group or NEVERENDING ENERGY EDP Group) and the equity and results attributable to the Group, through the investments in associates. As from 1 January 2010 onwards, the EDP Group applied IFRS 3 (revised) for the accounting of business combinations. The changes in accounting policies resulting from the application of IFRS 3 (revised) are applied prospectively. Subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries where the EDP Group has control are fully consolidated from the date the Group assumes control over their financial and operating activities until the moment that control ceases to exist. Control is presumed to exist when the Group owns more than half of the voting rights. Control also exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to manage the financial and operating policies of the entity to obtain benefits from its activities, even if the percentage of shareholding is less than 50%. Until 31 December 2009, when the accumulated losses of a subsidiary attributable to non-controlling interests exceed the non-controlling interests in its equity, the excess was attributed to the Group and charged to the income statement as incurred. Profits subsequently reported by the subsidiary were recognised as profits of the Group until the losses attributable to the non-controlling interests previously recognised by the Group have been recovered. As from 1 January 2010, the due proportion of accumulated losses are attributed to noncontrolling interests, implying that the Group can recognise negative non-controlling interests. As from 1 January 2010, on a step acquisition process resulting in the acquisition of control the revaluation of any investee previously acquired is booked against the income statement when goodwill is calculated. On a partial disposal resulting in loss of control over a subsidiary, any participation retained is revalued at market value on the sale date and the gain or loss resulting from this revaluation is booked against the income statement, as well as any gain or loss resulting from the disposal. Associates Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method from the date the Group acquires significant influence to the date it ceases. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over its financial and operating policies. Generally, when the Group holds more than 20% of the voting rights of the investee it is presumed to have significant influence. If the Group holds, directly or indirectly, less than 20% of the voting rights of the investee, it is presumed not to have significant influence, unless such influence can be clearly demonstrated. The existence of significant influence by the Group is usually evidenced by one or more of the following: Representation on the Executive Board of Directors or equivalent governing body of the investee; Participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends and other distributions; Existence of material transactions between the Group and the investee; Interchange of managerial personnel; Provision of essential technical information. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 The consolidated financial statements include the Group's attributable share of total reserves and profits or losses of associates, accounted for under the equity method. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group's carrying amount is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover such losses on behalf of the associate. Jointly controlled entities Jointly controlled entities, which are consolidated under the proportionate consolidation method, are entities over which the Group has joint control defined by a contractual agreement. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's proportional share of the joint ventures' assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, from the date the joint control begins and until it ceases. Accounting for investments in subsidiaries and associates in the company's financial statements Investments in subsidiaries and associates not classified as held for sale or not included in a disposal group which is classified as held for sale are accounted for at cost in the company's financial statements, and are subject to periodic impairment tests, whenever indication exists that certain financial investment may be impaired. Goodwill Following the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on 1 January 2004 and as permitted under IFRS 1 Firsttime Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the EDP Group decided to maintain the goodwill resulting from business combinations that occurred prior to the transition date, calculated in accordance with the Group's previous accounting policies. Business combinations that occurred after 1 January 2004 are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition cost corresponds to the fair value determined at the acquisition date, of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed including the costs directly attributable to the acquisition, for acquisitions up to 31 December 2009. As from 1 January 2010 onwards, costs directly attributable to the acquisition of a subsidiary are booked directly in the income statement. 198 As from the transition date to IFRS (1 January 2004), positive goodwill arising from acquisitions is recognised as an asset carried at acquisition cost and is not subject to amortisation. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates is defined as the difference between the cost of acquisition and the corresponding share of the fair value of the net assets acquired. NEVERENDING ENERGY As from 1 January 2010 onwards, the EDP Group has the possibility to book non-controlling interests at fair value or at cost, implying that the full amount of goodwill can be booked in the financial statements, including the portion attributable to the non-controlling interests, against non-controlling interests, if the first option is chosen. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates is defined as the difference between the cost of acquisition and the total or corresponding share of the fair value of the net assets acquired, depending on the option taken. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement in the period the business combination occurs. The recoverable amount of the goodwill in subsidiaries is assessed annually, regardless of the existence of any impairment triggers. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is determined based on the value in use of the assets, calculated using valuation methodologies supported by discounted cash flow techniques, considering market conditions, the time value of money and the business risks. Until 31 December 2009, contingent acquisition prices were determined based on the best estimate of probable future payments, being the future changes in the estimate booked against goodwill. As from 1 January 2010, goodwill is no longer adjusted due to changes in the initial estimate of the contingent purchase price and the difference is booked in the income statement. Purchases of non-controlling interests and dilution Until 31 December 2009, in the acquisition of non-controlling interests, the difference between the fair value of the non-controlling interests acquired and the consideration paid, was accounted against goodwill. The acquisitions of non-controlling interests through written put options related with investments in subsidiaries held by non-controlling interests, were recorded as a financial liability for the present value of the best estimate of the amount payable, against non-controlling interests. The difference between the non-controlling interests acquired and the fair value of the liability, was recorded as goodwill. The fair value of the liability was determined based on the contractual price which may be fixed or variable. In case of a variable price, the changes in the liability were recognised as an adjustment to the cost of the business combination against goodwill and the effect of the financial discount of the liability (unwinding) was recognised as a financial expense in the consolidated income statement. This accounting treatment is maintained for all options contracted until 31 December 2009. Until 31 December 2009, when an interest in a subsidiary was disposed, without a loss of control, the difference between the sale price and the book value of the net assets held by the Group, plus the carrying value of goodwill in that subsidiary, was recognised in the income statement of the period as a gain or loss resulting from the disposal. The dilution effect occurs when the percentage of interest in a subsidiary decreases without any sale of interest in that subsidiary, for example, if the Group does not participate proportionally in the share capital increase of that subsidiary. Until 31 December 2009, the Group recognised the gains or losses resulting from a dilution of the interest in a subsidiary following a sale or capital increase, in the income statement. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 As from 1 January 2010 onwards, in an acquisition (dilution) of non-controlling interests not resulting in a loss of control, the difference between the fair value of the non-controlling interests acquired and the consideration paid, is accounted against reserves. The acquisitions of non-controlling interests through written put options related with investments in subsidiaries held by non-controlling interests, are recorded as a financial liability for the present value of the best estimate of the amount payable, against non-controlling interests. The fair value of the liability is determined based on the contractual price which may be fixed or variable. In case of a variable price, the changes in the liability are recognised against the income statement as well as the effect of the financial discount of the liability (unwinding). Investments in foreign operations The financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries and associates of the Group are prepared using their functional currency, defined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate. In the consolidation process, the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Euros at the official exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Regarding the investments in foreign operations that are consolidated using the full consolidation method, proportionate or equity method, the exchange differences between the amount of equity expressed in Euros at the beginning of the period and the amount translated at the official exchange rates at the end of the period, on a consolidated basis, are booked against reserves. Foreign currency goodwill arising on the acquisition of these investments is remeasured at the official exchange rate at the balance sheet date directly against reserves. The income and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Euros at the approximate exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences from the translation into Euros of the net profit for the period, arising from the differences between the rates used in the income statement and those prevailing at the balance sheet date are recognised in reserves. On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the related exchange differences previously recognised in reserves, are accounted for in the income statement. Balances and transactions eliminated on consolidation Inter-company balances and transactions, including any unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies, are 199 eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising on transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in those entities. NEVERENDING ENERGY c) Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into Euros at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. These exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Foreign currency non-monetary assets and liabilities accounted for at historical cost are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency non-monetary assets and liabilities stated at fair value are translated into Euros at the exchange rates at the dates the fair value was determined. d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trade date at fair value. Subsequently, the fair value of derivative financial instruments is remeasured on a regular basis, being the gains or losses on remeasurement recognised directly in the income statement, except for derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Recognition, in the income statement, of the resulting gains and losses on remeasurement of hedging derivatives depends on the hedge model used. The fair value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to their market value, when available, or is determined by external entities using valuation techniques. Hedge accounting The Group uses financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and price risk resulting from its operational and financing activities. Derivatives not qualified for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are accounted for as trading instruments. Hedging derivatives are recorded at fair value, being the gains and losses recognised in accordance with the hedge accounting model applied by the Group. Hedge relationship exist when: (i) At the inception of the hedge there is formal documentation of the hedge; (ii) The hedge is expected to be highly effective; (iii) The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured; (iv) The hedge is revalued on an on-going basis and is considered to be highly effective throughout the reporting period; (v) The forecast transaction being hedged must be highly probable and must be exposed to changes in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities or group of hedged assets and liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk. When the hedging relationship ceases to comply with the requirements for hedge accounting, the accumulated gains or losses concerning the fair value of the risk being hedged are amortised over the residual period to maturity of the hedged item. Cash flow hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives qualified as cash flow hedges are recognised in reserves. The cumulative gains or losses recognised in reserves are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged item affects the income statement. When a hedging relation of a future transaction is discontinued, the changes in the fair value of derivative recognised in reserves remain recognised in reserves until the future hedged transaction occurs. When the future transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses recognised in reserves are recorded immediately in the income statement. Net investment hedge The net investment hedge model is applied on a consolidated basis to investments in subsidiaries in foreign currencies. This model allows that the exchange differences recognised in the exchange differences consolidated reserves to be offset by the foreign exchange differences in foreign currency loans or currency derivatives contracted. The ineffective portion of the hedging relationship is recognised in the income statement. The accumulated foreign exchange gains and losses regarding the net investment and the related hedging instrument recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement when the foreign entity is sold, as part of the gain or loss resulting from the disposal. Effectiveness 200 For an hedge relationship to be classified as such, in accordance with IAS 39, its effectiveness must be demonstrated. Therefore, the Group performs prospective tests at the inception date of the hedge and prospective and retrospective tests in each balance sheet date, NEVERENDING ENERGY to demonstrate its effectiveness, showing that any adjustments to the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are offset by adjustments to the fair value of the hedging instrument. Any ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement when it occurs. e) Other financial assets The Group classifies its other financial assets at acquisition date, considering the underlying purpose, in the following categories: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This category includes: (i) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, acquired for negotiation purposes in the short term, and (ii) other financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception (fair value option). Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale investments are non-derivative financial assets which: (i) the Group intends to hold for an undetermined period of time, or (ii) are designated as available-for-sale on initial recognition. Initial recognition, measurement and derecognition Purchases and sales of: (i) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, and (ii) available-for-sale investments, are recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell these financial assets. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, in which the transaction costs are recognised directly in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when: (i) the contractual rights to receive their future cash flows have expired, (ii) the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership or (iii) although retaining some, but not substantially, the risks and rewards of ownership, the Group has transferred control over the assets. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried out at fair value, being the gains or losses arising from changes in their fair value recorded in the income statement. Available-for-sale investments are also subsequently carried out at fair value, however, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised in fair value reserves until the financial assets are derecognised or impaired, being the cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in fair value reserves recognised in the income statement. Foreign exchange differences relating to these assets are also recognised in fair value reserves if arising from shares, and in the income statement if arising from debt instruments. Interest, calculated using the effective interest rate method, as well as dividends received are recognised in the income statement. The fair value of listed investments in active markets is based on current bid price. The Group determines the fair value of unlisted securities through (i) valuation methodologies, such as the price of similar recent arm’s length transactions and discounted cash flow techniques, and (ii) valuation assumptions based on market information. Financial assets whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, being any impairment loss booked against the income statement. Reclassifications between categories The Group does not transfer financial instruments into or out of the fair value through profit or loss category at the moment of its initial recognition being the variations recognised in the income statement (fair value option). Impairment At each balance sheet date an assessment is performed as to whether there is objective evidence of impairment, namely for those which result in an adverse effect on estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, and when it can be reliably measured. For the financial assets taht present evidence of impairment, the respective recoverable amount is determined, and the impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 201 A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events NEVERENDING ENERGY that occurred after their initial recognition, such as: (i) in the case of listed securities, a significant or prolonged decline in the listed price of the security, and (ii) in the case of unlisted securities, when that event (or events) has an impact on the estimated amount of the future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, that can be reliably estimated. If there is objective evidence of impairment on available-for-sale investments, the cumulative potential loss recognised in fair values reserves, corresponding to the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value at the balance sheet date, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred to the income statement. For debt instruments, if in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed in the income statement up to the amount of the acquisition cost, if the increase is objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For equity instruments, impairment losses can not be reversed and any subsequent event which determines a fair value increase is recognised in equity under fair value reserves. f) Financial liabilities An instrument is classified as a financial liability when there is a contractual obligation for the issuer to liquidate capital and/or interests, through delivering cash or other financial asset, regardless of its legal form. Financial liabilities are recognised (i) initially at fair value less transaction costs and (ii) subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method; or at fair value, whenever the Group chooses, on initial recognition, to designate such instruments as at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option. g) Equity instruments A financial instrument is classified as an equity instrument when there is no contractual obligation at settlement to deliver cash or other financial asset to another entity, regardless of its legal form, and there is a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. Costs directly attributable to the issuance of equity instruments are recognised in equity, as a deduction to the amount issued. Amounts paid or received relating to sales or acquisitions of equity instruments are recognised in equity, net of transaction costs. Distributions related to equity instruments are deducted from equity, as dividends, when declared. Preference shares issued by the Group are considered as an equity instrument when the there is no contractual obligation to redeem the shares and dividends are paid at the discretion of the Group. Preference shares issued by subsidiaries, classified as equity instruments and held by third parties, are recognised as non-controlling interests. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 h) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. On transition to IFRS, on 1 January 2004, the Group decided to consider as deemed cost the revalued amount of Property, plant and equipment in accordance with the Group's previous accounting policy, which was comparable in general terms to the depreciated cost determined in accordance with IFRS. Subsequent costs are recognised as property, plant and equipment only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group. Repair and maintenance costs are charged in the income statement as incurred, according to the accrual principle. The Group carries out impairment tests whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, being any impairment recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is the higher of net sale price and value in use, the latter being calculated by the present value of the estimated future cash flows obtained from continued use of the asset and its sale at the end of its useful life. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of tangible assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Number of years Buildings and other constructions 8 to 50 Plant and machinery: Hydroelectric generation 32 to 75 Thermoelectric generation 25 to 40 Renewable generation 25 Electricity distribution 10 to 40 Other plant and machinery 5 to 10 Transport equipment 4 to 25 Office equipment and tools 4 to 10 202 Other property, plant and equipment 10 to 25 According to IFRS, the estimate of the useful life of assets should be reviewed whenever a change in the expected economic benefits NEVERENDING ENERGY occurs flowing from the assets as well as when the technical use planned for the assets differs from previous estimates. Changes occurring in the depreciation charge for the year are accounted prospectively. Borrowing costs and other directly attributable costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of assets are capitalised as part of the cost of the assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that needs a substantial period of time to be ready for its intended use or sale. The amount of interest costs eligible for capitalisation is determined by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on those assets. The capitalisation rate corresponds to the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the outstanding borrowings during the period. The capitalisation of borrowing costs begins when expenditure for the assets is being incurred, borrowing costs have been incurred and activities necessary to prepare all or part of the assets for their intended use or sale are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets for their intended use or sale are completed. Other expenses directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of the assets, such as cost of consumed materials and personnel costs, are also capitalised as part of the cost of the assets. Government grants Government grants are initially booked as deferred revenue, under non current liabilities only when there is reasonable certainty that the grant will be received and that the Group will fulfil the grant term conditions. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are booked in the income statement on a linear basis, on the same period in which the expenses are incurred. Grants that compensate the Group for the acquisition of assets are recognised in the income statement over the related assets useful life. Transfers of assets from customers The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued in November 2008, the interpretation IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers. This interpretation was approved by the European Commission on 27 November 2009, being applicable for periods beginning after 31 October 2009. For EDP Group, the first period after the approval of this interpretation is the year 2010. IFRIC 18 is applicable for agreements in which an entity receives from a customer an item of Property, plant, and equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of energy. This interpretation clarifies: ł the conditions in which an asset is under this interpretation; ł recognition of the asset and its initial measurement; ł identification of the services identified (one or more services in exchange for assets transferred); ł income recognition; and ł accounting for the transfer of money from customers. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 The Group adopted this interpretation for the allowances received from customers, recognising the assets received by its estimated construction cost against operating income. The assets are depreciated based on its useful life. i) Intangible assets The Group's intangible assets are booked at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The Group performs impairment tests whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, being any impairment recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is the higher of net sale price and value in use, the latter being calculated by the present value of the estimated future cash flows obtained from continued use of the asset and its sale at the end of its useful life. Acquisition and development of software The costs of purchasing software and the costs incurred by the Group to implement it are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset. Costs incurred by the Group directly related to the development of software, that are expected to generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Such costs include employee costs directly associated to the project and are amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Software maintenance costs are charged in the income statement when incurred. Concession rights on distribution of electricity and gas The concession rights on distribution of electricity in Brazil and the concession rights related to the distribution of gas in Portugal, are recorded as intangible assets and amortised on a straight-line basis over the concessions period, not exceeding 30 and 40 years, respectively. Concession rights to use the public hydric domain 203 Portuguese concession rights to use the public hydric domain are booked as intangible assets and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the concession period, which currently does not exceed 45 years. EDP Group records as concession rights the financial NEVERENDING ENERGY compensations for the use of public domain assets, whenever these compensations are paid and for all the Group subsidiaries. The accounting policy related to intangible assets assigned to concessions is described in note 2aa), Group concession activities. Industrial property and other rights Industrial property and other rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, which does not exceed 6 years. j) Leases The Group classifies its lease transactions as finance leases or operating leases based on the substance of the transaction rather than its legal form. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers to the lessee substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Operating leases Lease payments under operating lease contracts are recognised as an expense in the period to which they relate. Finance leases Finance leases are recognised by the lessee, at the inception of the lease, as assets and liabilities at the fair value of the leased assets which is equivalent to the present value of the future lease payments. Lease payments include the interest charges and the amortisation of the outstanding principal. The interest charges are recognised as costs over the lease period in order to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Lessors record assets held under finance leases as leased capital, by the net amount invested in the lease. Lease payments include the financial income and the amortisation of the outstanding principal. Financial results recognised reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding net balance of the lessor. Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease Following the issuance by International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, applicable from 1 January 2006, arrangements including transactions that, although do not take the form of a lease, convey the right to use an asset in return for a payment, are recognised as leases, provided that, in substance, they comply with the requirements defined in the interpretation. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 k) Investment property The Group classifies as investment property, property held for capital appreciation and/or for rental purposes. Investment property is recognised initially at acquisition or production cost, including directly attributable transaction costs, and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Subsequent expenditures on investment property are only added to the cost of the asset when it is probable that additional future economic benefits will arise when compared to initial recognition. l) Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of acquisition cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories includes purchases, conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated selling costs. The cost of inventories is determined by using the weighted average method. CO2 licences held by the Group for trade purposes are booked as inventories and measured at fair value, at each balance sheet date, against the income statement. m) Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less impairment losses and being presented in the statement of financial position net of impairment losses which are associated. Impairment losses are recorded based on the regular assessment of the existence of objective evidence of impairment resulting from doubtful accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, being subsequently reversed through the income statement if the estimated losses decrease, in a later period. 204 n) Employee benefits Pensions NEVERENDING ENERGY Some EDP Group companies grant post-retirement benefits to employees under defined benefit and defined contribution plans, namely pension plans that grant retirement complementary benefits for age, disability and surviving pensions, as well as early retirement pensions. Defined benefit plans In Portugal, the defined benefit plan is funded through a closed Pension Fund complemented by a specific provision. The Pension Fund covers the liabilities for retirement pension complements as well as for early retirement. In Brazil, Bandeirante has two defined benefit plans managed by the CESP Foundation, a closed complementary welfare entity with its own assets, segregated from those of its sponsors. Escelsa has a defined benefit plan that grants complementary benefits for retirement due to age, disability and survival pensions. Escelsa also has a special complementary benefit plan for retired employees who served in the Brazilian army. The Group’s pension plans are defined benefit plans, since the criteria used to determine the amount of the pension to be received by employees on retirement is usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary level. The Group’s pension liability for each plan is calculated annually at the balance sheet date, by independent experts individually for each plan, using the projected unit credit method. The discount rate used in the calculation is determined based on market interest rates of high quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have similar maturity to the related pension liability. Actuarial gains and losses resulting from (i) differences between financial and actuarial assumptions used and actual amounts and (ii) changes in the actuarial assumptions, are recognised against equity. The increase in past service costs arising from early retirements (retirements before the normal retirement age) or plan amendments are recognised in the income statement when incurred. The Group recognises as operational expenses, in the income statement, the current and the past service costs. Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) is recognised in financial results. The assets of the plan comply with the recognition criteria established by IFRIC 14 IAS 19 and the minimum funding requirements established by law or by contract. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Defined contribution plans In Portugal, Spain and Brazil, some companies have defined contribution social benefit plans that complement those granted by the Social Security System, under which they pay an annual contribution to the plans, calculated in accordance with the rules established in each plan. Other benefits Medical benefits and other plans In Portugal and in Brazil some EDP Group companies provide medical benefits during retirement and early retirement, through complementary benefits to those provided by the Social Security System. The medical benefits plans are classified as defined benefit plans, the liability being covered by provisions booked in the Group’s statement of financial position. Measurement and recognition of the medical benefits liabilities are similar to those of the defined benefit plans pension liabilities, explained above. Variable remuneration paid to employees In accordance with the by-laws of some Group companies, the shareholders approve in the Annual General Meeting a variable remuneration to be paid to the management and employees (bonus), following a proposal made by the Executive Board of Directors. The variable remuneration is charged to the income statement in the year to which it relates. o) Provisions Provisions are recognised when: (i) the Group has a present legal, or constructive obligation, (ii) it is probable that settlement will be required in the future and (iii) a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Provisions for dismantling and decommissioning in electric power plants The Group accounts for provisions for dismantling and decommissioning of assets when there is a legal, contractual or constructive obligation at the end of the assets’ useful life. Therefore, such provisions have been booked for the electric power plants to cover the cost of restoring the location and land to their original condition. The provisions are calculated at the present amount of the expected future 205 liability and are accounted for as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of those assets. NEVERENDING ENERGY Decommissioning and dismantling provisions are remeasured on an annual basis based on the best estimate of the settlement amount. The unwinding of the discount at each balance sheet date is charged to the income statement. p) Recognition of costs and revenues Costs and revenues are recognised in the year to which they relate regardless of when paid or received, in accordance with the accrual basis. Differences between amounts received and paid and the corresponding revenue and costs are recognised under other assets or other liabilities. Revenue includes amounts invoiced on the sale of products or services rendered, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after elimination of intra-group sales. The invoicing of electricity sales is performed on a monthly basis. Monthly electricity invoices are based on real meter readings or on estimated consumptions based on the historical data of each consumer. Revenues regarding the energy to be invoiced based on actual consumption not yet metered as at the balance sheet date is accrued on the basis of recent average consumptions. Differences between estimated and actual amounts are recorded in subsequent periods. q) Financial results Financial results include interest costs on borrowings, interest income on funds invested, dividend income, foreign exchange gains and losses, realised gains and losses, as well as gains and losses on financial instruments and changes in the fair value of hedged risks, when applicable. Interest is recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. Dividend income is recognised on the date the right to receive is established. Financial results also include impairment losses on available-for-sale investments. r) Income tax Income tax recognised in the income statement includes current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Deferred taxes arising from the revaluation of available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedge derivatives recognised in equity are recognised in the income statement in the period the results that originated the deferred taxes are recognised. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Current tax is the tax expected to be paid on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with the balance sheet liability method, considering temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax basis, using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date for each jurisdiction and that is expected to be applied when the temporary difference is reversed. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, differences arising on initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not be reversed in the future. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to absorb deductible temporary differences for taxation purposes. The Group offsets, as established in IAS 12, the deferred tax assets and liabilities if, and only if: (i) the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and (ii) the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in future periods in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered. s) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the consolidated and the company net profit attributable to the equity holders of EDP, S.A. by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding the average number of shares held by the Group and by EDP, S.A., respectively. For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding is adjusted to consider conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as convertible debt and stock options granted to employees. The dilution effect corresponds to a decrease in earnings per share resulting from the assumption that the convertible instruments are converted or the options granted are exercised. 206 t) Share based payments NEVERENDING ENERGY The stock options remuneration program enables the Group's employees to acquire EDP, S.A. shares. The exercise price of the options is calculated based on the listed price of the shares at the grant date. The fair value of the options granted, determined at the grant date, is recognised in the income statement against equity during the vesting period, based on their market value calculated at the grant date. If the option is exercised, the Group acquires shares in the market to grant them to employees. u) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets or groups of non-current assets held for sale (groups of assets and related liabilities that include at least one noncurrent asset) are classified as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be recovered mainly through sale, the assets or groups of assets are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. The Group also classifies as non-current assets held for sale, non-current assets or groups of assets acquired exclusively for its subsequent resale, that are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. The measurement of all non-current assets and all assets and liabilities included in a disposal group, is adjusted in accordance with the applicable IFRS standards, immediately before their classification as held for sale. Subsequently, these assets or disposal groups are measured at the lowest between their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. v) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include balances with maturity of less than three months from the balance sheet date, including cash and deposits in banks. This caption also includes other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and specific demand deposits in relation to institutional partnerships that are funds required to be held in escrow sufficient to pay the remaining construction related costs of projects in institutional equity partnerships in U.S.A., in the next twelve months. w) Operating segments The Group presents the operating segments based on internal management information. In accordance with IFRS 8, an operating segment is a Group component: (i) that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses; (ii) whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entity's chief operating decision maker in order to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and, (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 x) Tariff adjustments In regulated activities, the regulator establishes, through the tariff adjustment mechanism, the criteria to recognise gains or losses of one period in future periods. The tariff adjustments accounted for in the EDP Group financial statements represent the difference between the amounts invoiced by Portuguese regulated companies (based on the applicable tariffs published by ERSE in December of the previous year) and the regulated revenue calculated based on actual costs. The assets or liabilities resulting from the tariff adjustments are recovered or returned through the electricity and gas tariffs charged to customers in subsequent periods. Decree-Law 165/2008 of 21 August recognised the unconditional right of the regulated operators of the electric sector to recover the tariff adjustments under a regime identical to the one used for the tariff deficits. Consequently, EDP Group booked under the income statement caption Turnover Electricity and network access, the effects resulting from the recognition of tariff adjustments, against Debtors and other assets from commercial activities. According to the referred Decree-Law, the tariff adjustments determined annually, will be recovered by the regulated operators even in case of insolvency or cease of operations. ERSE is the entity responsible to establish the method to ensure that the entity entitled to these rights continues to recover the tariff adjustments until its complete payment. The Decree-Law also allows the transfer of the right to receive the tariff adjustment to third parties, in whole or in part, through future electricity tariffs. Decree-Law 87/2011, approved on 14 April and published in Diário da República on 17 July, confirmed the unconditional right of the regulated operators of the natural gas sector to recover the tariff adjustments. Consequently, EDP Group booked under the income statement caption Turnover of Gas and network accesses the effects resulting from the recognition of tariff adjustments against Debtors and other assets from commercial activities and Trade and other payables from commercial activities, in the same terms defined for the electric sector as mentioned above. y) CO2 licences and greenhouse gas emissions The Group holds CO2 licences in order to deal with gas emissions resulting from its operational activity and licences for trading. The CO2 and gas emissions licences held for own use are booked as intangible assets and are valued at the quoted price in the market on the date of the transaction. The licences held by the Group for trading purposes are booked under Inventories at acquisition cost, subsequently adjusted at the lower of aquisition cost and net realisable value. Gains and losses resulting from these adjustments are recognised in the income statement of 207 the period. NEVERENDING ENERGY z) Statement of Cash Flow The Statement of Cash Flow is presented under the direct method, by which gross cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities are disclosed. The Group classifies cash flows related to interest and dividends paid as financing activities and interest and dividends received as investing activities. aa) Group concession activities The International Financial Reporting Committee (IFRIC) issued in July 2007, IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements. This interpretation was approved by the European Commission on 25 March 2009 and is applicable for the annual periods beginning after that date. In the case of the EDP Group, the first annual period after the approval date is 2010 and, therefore, the EDP Group adopted IFRIC 12 for comparative purposes as of 1 January 2009. Under the terms of IFRIC 12, this interpretation was applied prospectively considering that the retrospective application was impracticable. The effect of the retrospective application would have a similar effect as a prospective application. IFRIC 12 is applicable to public-private concession contracts in which the public entity controls or regulates the services rendered through the utilisation of certain infrastructure as well as the price for such services and also controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure. According to IFRIC 12, the infrastructures allocated to concessions are not recognised by the operator as tangible fixed assets or as financial leases, as the operator does not control the assets. These infrastructures are recognised according to one of the following accounting models, depending on the type of remuneration commitment of the operator assumed by the grantor within the terms of the contract: Financial Asset Model This model is applicable when the operator has an unconditional right to receive certain monetary amounts regardless the level of use of the infrastructure within the concession and results in a financial asset recognition, booked at amortised cost. Intangible Asset Model This model is applicable when the operator, within the concession, is remunerated on the basis of the level of use of the infrastructure (demand risk) and results in an intangible asset recognition. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Mixed Model This model is applicable when the concession includes simultaneously guaranteed remuneration and remuneration based on the level of use of the infrastructure within the concession. Under the terms of the concession contracts of EDP Group to which IFRIC 12 is applicable, the construction activities are outsourced to specialised entities. Therefore, EDP Group has no margin in the construction of the assets assigned to concessions, thus the revenue and the expenditure with the acquisition of these assets have equal amounts (see note 7). Intangible assets within concessions are amortised over their respective useful lives during the concession period. The Group carries out impairment tests to the intangible assets within concessions whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, being any impairment recognised in the income statement. Grants received from customers related to assets within concessions are delivered to the Group on a definitive basis and, therefore, are not reimbursable. These grants are deducted from the value of the assets allocated to each concession. 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS IN PREPARING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IFRS require the use of judgement and the making of estimates in the decision process regarding certain accounting treatments, with impact in total assets, liabilities, equity, costs and income. The actual effects may differ from these estimates and judgements, namely in relation to the effect of actual costs and income. The main accounting estimates and judgements used in applying the accounting policies are discussed in this note in order to improve the understanding of how its application affects the Group’s reported results and disclosures. A broader description of the accounting policies employed by the Group is disclosed in note 2 to these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Considering that in many cases there are alternatives to the accounting treatment adopted by EDP Group, the reported results could differ if a different treatment was chosen. The Executive Board of Directors believes that the choices made are appropriate and that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Group’s financial position and results. 208 Impairment of available-for-sale investments NEVERENDING ENERGY The Group determines that available-for-sale investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in their fair value. Determination of a significant or prolonged decline requires judgement. In making this judgement, the Group assesses, among other factors, the normal share price volatility, assuming as significant a decline of more than 20% in listed shares. In addition, valuations are generally obtained through market prices or determined by external entities, or through valuation models that require assumptions or judgment in making the fair value estimates. Alternative methodologies or the use of different assumptions and estimates could result in different impairment losses being recognised with a consequent impact in the Group’s income statement. Fair value of financial instruments Fair values are based on listed market prices, if available, otherwise fair value is determined either by the price of similar recent transactions under market conditions or determined by external entities, or by pricing models based on net present value of estimated future cash flows techniques considering market conditions, time value, yield curves and volatility factors. These methodologies may require the use of assumptions or judgements in estimating fair values. Consequently, the use of different methodologies or different assumptions or judgements in applying a particular model, could generate different financial results from those reported. Contractual Stability Compensation CMEC Following a Portuguese Government decision to extinguish the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), EDP and REN agreed to the early termination of the PPAs, with effect from 1 July 2007. As a result of the PPAs termination and in accordance with the applicable legislation, a contractual stability compensation (CMEC) was granted to EDP Group. The mechanism for granting this compensation includes three types of compensation: initial compensation, compensation resulting from the revisable mechanism and final compensation. Initial compensation was recognised when the PPAs terminated as an account receivable of 833,467 thousands of Euros, booked at its net present value, against deferred income. Part of the initial compensation is recognised as operating income each year against a reduction of the deferred initial compensation. According to the applicable legislation, securitization of this amount is possible. Compensation resulting from the revisable mechanism refers to the correction of the initial compensation for each year considering the actual conditions and is recognised as a loss or gain in the year to which it relates. Final compensation will be calculated in accordance with the terms defined by the legislation relating to the termination of the PPAs, after the end of the revisable mechanism period (10 years). Interest resulting from the discount rate used is booked in the period to which it relates, based on the respective implicit rate, against income for each period. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Contractual Stability Compensation Revisable mechanism The revisable mechanism consists in correcting on an annual basis, during a 10-year period after the termination of the PPAs, the positive and negative variations between the estimates made for the initial stability compensation calculation and the actual amounts occurred in the market for each period. This mechanism gives rise to compensation resulting from the correction of the estimate referred to as CMEC revisable mechanism. In each period, the EDP Group calculates the CMEC considering market prices and the actual quantities sold, using the assumptions defined in the Valorágua model, according to the current legislation. Consequently, the use of different methodologies or assumptions from the used model, could give rise to different financial results from those considered. Review of the useful life of the assets The Group reviews the reasonability of the useful lives used to determine the rates of depreciation of assets assigned to the activity on an annual basis and prospectively changed the depreciation charge of the year. In the second quarter of 2011 EDPR Group changed the useful life of the wind farms from 20 to 25 years. The redefinition of the useful life of the wind generation assets was based on a technical study performed by an independent entity which considered the technical availability for an additional period of 5 years of useful life of these assets. The referred study covered 95% of wind installed capacity of EDPR Group, in the different geographies (Europe and North America), considering assumptions and estimates that required judgement. On 7 February 2012, the regulatory authority of Brazil, Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL), issued the Normative Resolution 474, which revised the economic useful life of assets associated to distribution concessions, and established new annual depreciation rates with retroactive effect from 1 January 2012 onwards. The implementation of this change in annual depreciation rates led to an increase in the average useful life of Bandeirante's and Escelsa's assets from 22 to 24 years and 20 to 22 years, respectively. In the third quarter of 2013, the Group reviewed and extended the useful life of the combined cycle plants from 25 to 35 years based on a technical study conducted by an independent entity which considered the technical availability for an additional period of 10 years. The referred study covered the combined cycle plants in Portugal (Lares and Ribatejo) and Spain (Castejon 1 and 2, Grupo 4 and Soto 5). Useful lives of generation assets Hydro independent generator in Brazil The hydro generation assets in Brazil for Independent Generators are amortised during the estimated useful lives, considering the 209 existing facts and circumstances at the date of preparation of the financial statements which includes, among other issues, EDP's best estimates of the useful lives of such assets, which are consistent with the useful lives defined by the regulator (ANEEL) and the technical NEVERENDING ENERGY and legal opinions and the respective contractual residual indemnification values at the end of each concession period. The remaining period of amortisation and the indemnification values at the end of the concessions, may be influenced by any changes in the Regulatory Legal Framework in Brazil. Tariff adjustments Tariff adjustments in Portugal represent the difference between costs and income of the National Electricity and Gas System, estimated at the beginning of each period for purposes of calculating the tariff, and the actual costs and income of the System established at the end of each period. The tariff adjustments assets or liabilities are recovered or returned through electricity tariffs to customers in subsequent periods. In Portugal, the Decree-Law 237-B/2006 of 19 December, and the Decree-Law nº 165/2008 of 21 August, recognised an unconditional right of the operators of the binding electric sector to recover or return the tariff ajustments and the related interest expenses, regardless of the form of its future payment or in situations of insolvency and cease of operations. The Decree-Law also allows the transfer of the tariff deficit collection right to a third party. Additionally, the legislation allows the transfer to third parties of the right to receive tariff adjustments, therefore, under this legislation regulated companies may provide to third parties, in whole or in part, the right to receive the tariff adjustments through the electricity and gas tariffs. In accordance with the accounting policy in force, the EDP Group recorded in the income statement under the caption Turnover Electricity and network access, the effects of the recognition of tariff adjustments in the electricity sector, against Debtors and other assets from commercial activities and Trade and other payables from commercial activities. For entities of the natural gas sector, Decree-Law 87/2011 of July 18, also establishes the unconditional right of regulated operators in this sector to recover or return tariff adjustments and related interest expenses, regardless of the form of its future payment or in situations of insolvency and cease of operations, allowing the transfer to third parties of the right to receive tariff adjustments. The EDP Group recorded in the income statement, under the caption Turnover Gas and network access, the effects of the recognition of tariff adjustments of Natural Gas, against Debtors and other assets from commercial activities and Trade and other payables from commercial activities. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 In Spain, the Royal Decree Law 6/2009, published on 7 May 2009 established, among other matters: (i) the possibility to securitise the Spanish tariff deficit supported by the electric sector companies using a State guarantee through the tariff deficit amortisation fund; (ii) the calendar for the elimination of the tariff deficit, such that on 1 January 2013, access tariffs would be enough to cover regulated activities’ costs, without the creation of an ex-ante tariff deficit and, in order to ease this gradual elimination, the Royal Decree Law also provided for the passage of some costs included in the electricity tariff to the Spanish State Budget; (iii) the revocation, as from 1 July 2009, of Royal Decree Law 11/2007, which established the obligation to return the additional revenues obtained from the incorporation of CO2 costs in markets prices, and which was to be in force until 2012; (iv) the creation of a social subsidy, which translates to a lower tariff for low income consumers and (v) the charge to electric companies of the costs with the management and treatment of radioactive waste from nuclear power plants and fuels consumed. However, Royal Decree Law 29/2012, endorsed on 28 December, abolished the regulatory requirement mentioned in paragraph (ii) above. The direct consequence of this suppression is that access tariffs will not be related to the sufficiency of the tariffs, so there may be temporary imbalances, to be recovered in a single annual fee in subsequent years. In 2010, the Royal Decree Law 14/2010 was published and addressed the correction of the tariff deficit of the electricity sector. As a result, the temporal mismatch of the settlement for 2010 came to be considered as a revenue deficit of the electricity system and established a set of measures to ensure that the various industry players contribute to the reduction, including: the establishment of generation rates, financing plans for energy efficiency and savings by the generation companies, and various regulatory measures that help reduce the additional costs of certain technologies in the special regime. In 2012, the Royal Decree Law 1/2012 was published, establishing a moratorium on adding new facilities in the pre-allocation records for remuneration and the Royal Decree Law 13/2012 which provides reductions in the remuneration for the distribution activity and an extraordinary decrease on other regulated activities. Both decrees were adopted with urgency to reduce the tariff deficit in order to achieve the limit provided for 2012 in the Royal Decree Law 14/2010. Based on the legislation issued, EDP considers that the requirements for the recognition of tariff deficits as receivables against the income statement are accomplished. Impairment of long term assets and Goodwill Impairment tests are performed, whenever there is a trigger that the recoverable amount of property, plant, equipment and intangible 210 assets is less than the corresponding net book value of the assets. On an annual basis, the Group reviews the assumptions used to assess the existence of impairment in goodwill resulting from acquisitions NEVERENDING ENERGY of shares in subsidiaries. The assumptions used are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic indicators and business assumptions used by management. The goodwill in associates is reviewed when circumstances indicate the existence of impairment. Considering the uncertainties regarding the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill as they are based on the best information available, changes in the assumptions can result in changes in the determination of the amount of impairment and, consequently, on the Group’s results. Doubtful debts Impairment losses related to doubtful debts are estimated by EDP based on the estimated recoverable amounts, the date of default, debt write offs and other factors. Certain circumstances and facts may change the estimated impairment losses of doubtful debts, namely changes in the economic environment, economic sector trends, client’s credit risk and increases in the rate of defaults. The evaluation process in determining whether an impairment loss should be recorded in the income statement is subject to numerous estimates and judgement. Changes in the estimates and judgement could change the impairment test results which could affect the Group’s reported results. Revenue recognition Electricity sales revenue is recognised when the monthly electricity invoices are issued, based on actual meter readings or estimated consumption based on the historical data of each consumer. Revenue relating to electricity to be invoiced, regarding consumption up to the balance sheet date but not measured, is booked based on estimates which take into consideration factors such as consumption in prior periods and analysis relating to the energy balance of the operations. The use of different estimates and assumptions can affect the Group’s revenue and, consequently, its reported results. Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in several jurisdictions. Certain interpretations and estimates are required in determining the global amount of income tax. There are several transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Different interpretations and estimates could result in a different level of income taxes, current and deferred, recognised in the period. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 In Portugal, the tax authorities are entitled to review the EDP, S.A. and its subsidiaries’ determination of their annual taxable earnings for a period of four years. In case of tax losses carried forward, this period can be five years for annual periods starting from 2012, four years for annual periods of 2011 and 2010 and six years for previous annual periods. In Spain the period is four years and in Brazil it is five years. In the United States of America, in general, for the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) to issue additional income tax assessments for an entity is three years, from the date that the income tax return is filed by the taxpayer. As a result, it is possible that some additional taxes may be assessed, mainly as a result of differences in interpretation of the tax law. However, EDP Group and its subsidiaries believe that there will be no significant corrections to the income tax booked in the financial statements. Pensions and other employee benefits Determining pension and other employee benefits liabilities requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including actuarial projections, estimated rates of return on investments, discount rates and pension and salary growth and other factors that can impact the cost and liability of the pension, medical plans and other benefits. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the amounts determined. Provisions for dismantling and decommissioning of power generation units The EDP Group considers that there are legal, contractual or constructive obligations to dismantle and decommission of Property, plant and equipment assets allocated to electricity generation operations. The Group records provisions in accordance with existing obligations to cover the present value of the estimated cost to restore the locations and land where the electricity generations units are located. The calculation of the provisions is based on estimates of the present value of the future liabilities. The use of different assumptions in the estimates and judgement from those referred could lead to different financial results than those considered. Measurement criteria of the concession financial receivables under IFRIC 12 In 2012, the Provisional Measure 579/12 was published in Brazil, meanwhile converted into Law 12.783/13, which determines the amount of the indenisation payable to the distribution companies regarding the assets not amortised or depreciated at the end of each concession, that should be determined based in the methodology of the new replacement value. This methodology determined an increase in the indenisation amount (financial asset IFRIC 12) of Bandeirante and Escelsa, booked, under IFRIC 12 terms, against other 211 operating income. This amount corresponds to the difference between the new replacement value versus the historical cost. NEVERENDING ENERGY Regulatory changes occurred in Spain On 12 July 2013, the Spanish Government approved the Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 which comprises a set of relevant changes in the remuneration scheme applicable to the entities operating in the electric sector in Spain, including the one regulated by the Royal DecreeLaw 2/2013. The main changes applicable to renewable energy producers are as following: (i) Derogation of the present remuneration scheme regulated by the Royal Decree-Law 661/2007 and subsequents, (ii) the remuneration of wind energy and cogeneration activity will be determined according to the reasonable rate, which will have in consideration the average of ten-year bond yield, in secondary market, plus 300 basis points, (iii) definition of a standard model for activity income and expenses. This model will determine the remuneration’s reasonable rate, considering the standard income of energy sales in market and the standard production costs and investment in standard facilities. On 26 November 2013, the Government submitted to CNMC ( Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia ), a draft decree describing the new remuneration scheme for renewable generation. This draft decree did not include the required parameters to calculate the remuneration for the renewables’ sector activities, but defined that it should be retrospectively applied since 14 July. These parameters were released on 3 February 2014 when the CNMC disclosed the draft Ministerial Order containing the needed parameters to calculate the remuneration for each one of the 1,600 different types of renewable installations defined by the government. According to these parameters, wind farms built in 2004 or earlier are not eligible to receive any incentive while the new wind farms will receive a flat premium per installed MW until the end of their regulatory life. The flat premium will be subject to tri-annual modifications due to updates in the forecast of the parameters affecting the profitability of the installations. Overall, the wind sector will receive 1,191 millions of Euros in 2014 which compares to the forecast of 2,000 millions of Euros that would have been received under the old regulation. This cut of approximately 800 millions of Euros in the wind sector represents 45% of the total savings for the whole renewable sector that were estimated at 1,750 millions of Euros in the budget published within the tariff and charges order draft. As a consequence of this measure, EDP Group estimated and booked the impact in the profit and loss for the year and calculated the impairment for wind farm assets and cogeneration assets as at 31 December 2013. As a result, an impairment loss of 16 millions of Euros and 31 millions of Euros was booked by EDPR Europe and HDC Group, respectively. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 4. FINANCIAL-RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES Financial risk management The EDP Group’s business is exposed to a variety of financial risks, including the effect of changes in market prices, foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group’s exposure to financial risks arises essentially from its debt portfolio, resulting in interest and exchange rate exposures. The unpredictability of the financial markets is analysed on an on-going basis in accordance with the Group’s risk management policy. Derivative financial instruments are used to minimise potential adverse effects, resulting from interest rate and/or foreign exchange rate risks on EDP Group's financial performance. The management of financial risks of EDP, S.A. and other EDP Group entities is undertaken centrally by the Financial Department of EDP S.A., in accordance with policies approved by the Executive Board of Directors. The Financial Department identifies, evaluates and submits to the Board for approval, hedging mechanisms appropriate to each exposure. The Executive Board of Directors is responsible for the definition of general risk management principles and the establishment of exposure limits. All transactions undertaken using derivative financial instruments require prior approval by the Executive Board of Directors, which defines the parameters of each transaction and approves the formal documents describing their objectives. As for the subsidiaries in Brazil, the Local Risk Management Department is responsible for the management of financial risks arising from fluctuation in interest and exchange rates. This management is performed according to the principles/policies set by the EDP Group for this geographical area. Exchange-rate risk management EDP, S.A. Financial Department is responsible for managing exchange rate risk exposure resulting from foreign currency loans, seeking to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the financial costs of the EDP Group companies and, consequently, on the consolidated results, through exchange rate derivative financial instruments and/or other hedging structures. The policy implemented by the EDP Group consists of undertaking derivative financial instruments to hedge exchange rate risk with characteristics similar to those of the hedged asset or liability. The operations are revalued and monitored throughout their useful lives 212 and, periodically, their effectiveness in controlling and hedging the risk that gave rise to them is evaluated. EDP Group is exposed to the exchange rate risk in US Dollars (USD), British Pounds (GBP), Japanese Yen (JPY), Swiss francs (CHF), NEVERENDING ENERGY Brazilian Reais (BRL), Romanian Leu (RON), Canadian Dollars (CAD) and Zloty (PLN). Currently, the exposure to USD/EUR, PLN/EUR and RON/EUR exchange rate risk results essentially from investments of EDP Group in wind parks in the USA, Poland and Romania. These investments were financed with debt contracted in USD, PLN and RON, which allows to mitigate the exchange rate risk related to these assets. The Brazilian subsidiaries exposed to the USD/BRL exchange rate risk as a result of their USD debt, use derivative financial instruments to hedge this risk. Additionally, investments in the Brazilian subsidiaries of EDP Energias do Brasil, whose net assets expressed in BRL are exposed to exchange rate risks, are monitored through analysis of the evolution of the BRL/EUR exchange rate. Regarding investments in wind farms of EDP Renováveis in Brazil, the Group decided to follow the strategy that has been adopted to hedge these investments in USA and Poland, by contracting a financial derivative instrument to cover the exchange rate exposure of these assets. The exchange rate and interest rate risk on the GBP, CHF and JPY bonds issued by EDP Finance B.V. under the Medium Term Notes Program for the Issuance of Debt Instruments have been hedged as from their issuing date. The EDP Group’s remaining debt, except for the debt contracted by the Brazilian subsidiaries, is denominated in Euros. Sensitivity analysis exchange rate Regarding the financial instruments that result in an exchange rate risk exposure, a fluctuation of 10% in the Euro exchange rate in relation to the following currencies, as at 31 December 2013 and 2012, would lead to an increase / (decrease) in the EDP Group results and/or equity as follows: Dec 2013 Profit or loss Equity Thousands of Euros +10% -10% +10% -10% USD 32,758 -40,038 -16,047 19,613 RON 1,019 -1,246 PLN 20,883 -25,524 54,660 -66,808 -16,047 19,613 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Dec 2012 Profit or loss Equity Thousands of Euros +10% -10% +10% -10% USD 40,462 -49,454 -27,842 34,029 RON 5,957 -7,280 PLN 11,628 -14,213 58,047 -70,947 -27,842 34,029 This analysis assumes that all other variables, namely interest rates, remain unchanged. Interest rate risk management The aim of the interest rate risk management policies is to reduce the financial charges and to reduce the exposure to interest rate risk from market fluctuations through the settlement of derivative financial instruments. In the floating rate financing context, the EDP Group engages interest rate derivative financial instruments to hedge the cash flows associated with future interest payments, which have the effect of converting floating interest rate loans into fixed interest rate loans. Long-term loans engaged at fixed rates are, when appropriate, converted into floating rate loans through interest rate derivative financial instruments designed to reduce financial charges and to level them to market conditions. In addition to these operations, more structured collar operations are engaged, as necessary, to mitigate exposure of the debt cash flows to market rate fluctuations. All the operations are undertaken on liabilities in the EDP Group’s debt portfolio and mainly involve perfect hedges, resulting in a high level of correlation between the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the changes in fair value of the interest rate risk or future cash flows. The EDP Group has a portfolio of interest rate derivatives with maturities up to 15 years. The Group’s Financial Department undertakes sensitivity analyses of the fair value of financial instruments to interest rate fluctuations. After the covering effect of the derivatives 47% of the Group's liabilities are at fixed rate. 213 Sensitivity analysis Interest rates (excluding the Brazilian operations) NEVERENDING ENERGY Based on the debt portfolio engaged by the Group, except for Brazil and the related derivative financial instruments used to hedge the related interest rate risk, a 50 basis points change in the reference interest rates at 31 December 2013 and 2012 would lead to the following increases / (decreases) in equity and/or results of the EDP Group: Dec 2013 Profit or loss Equity 50 pb 50 pb 50 pb 50 pb Thousands of Euros increase decrease increase decrease Cash flow effect Hedged debt -12,561 12,561 Unhedged debt -35,321 35,321 Fair value effect Cash flow hedging derivatives 23,759 -25,783 Trading derivatives (accounting perspective) -2,428 338 -50,310 48,220 23,759 -25,783 Dec 2012 Profit or loss Equity 50 pb 50 pb 50 pb 50 pb Thousands of Euros increase decrease increase decrease Cash flow effect Hedged debt -10,061 10,061 Unhedged debt -41,619 41,619 Fair value effect Cash flow hedging derivatives 26,993 -29,800 Trading derivatives (accounting perspective) -2,008 678 -53,688 52,358 26,993 -29,800 This analysis assumes that all other variables, namely exchange rates, remain unchanged. Counterparty credit risk management The EDP Group’s policy in terms of counterparty risk on financial transactions is managed through an analysis of the technical capacity, competitiveness, credit rating and exposure to each counterparty, avoiding significant concentrations of credit risk. Counterparties in derivative financial instruments are credit institutions with high credit risk rating notation and therefore the risk of counterparty default is not considered to be significant. Guarantees and other collaterals are not required on these transactions. The EDP Group has documented its financial operations in accordance with international standards. Therefore, generally, derivative financial instruments are contracted under ISDA Master Agreements. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Regarding the third-party debt generated by the Group’s day-to-day business, the credit risk arises essentially from the legal obligation of providing continuous low-tension electricity supplies even when there are payment delays. This risk is considered to be mitigated by the large number of customers and by their diversity in terms of sectors of activity, as well as by the large volume of residential customers. EDP Group believes that the amount that best represents the Group's exposure to credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount of trade receivables and other debtors, net of the impairment losses recognised. The Group believes that the credit quality of these receivables is adequate and that no significant impaired credits exists that have not been recognised as such and provided for. Liquidity risk management The EDP Group undertakes management of liquidity risk through the engagement and maintenance of credit lines and financing facilities with a firm underwriting commitment with national and international financial institutions allowing immediate access to funds. These lines are used to complement and backup national and international commercial paper programmes, allowing the EDP Group’s short-term financing sources to be diversified (see note 35). Energy market risk management In its operations in the non-regulated Iberian electricity market, EDP Group purchases fuel to generate electric energy and sells the electric energy generated by its plants in the organised market (OMEL and OMIP) as well as to third parties. The Group is exposed to energy market risks namely in its operations in the non-regulated market. Some electricity generating plants despite operating in the market, are subject to the CMEC legislation, and the changes in the operating margins are determined essentially by the difference between the prices in the market and the reference indexes defined in the contracts. As a result of its energy management operations, EDP Group has a portfolio of operations related to electric energy, carbon emissions (CO2) and fuel (coal, fuel and gas). The portfolio is managed through the engagement of operations with financial and physical settlement on the forward energy markets. The objective of the operations is to reduce volatility of the financial impact resulting from the managed positions and also to benefit from arbitration or positioning within the trading limits approved by the Executive Board of Directors. The financial instruments traded include swaps and forwards of electricity and fuels to fix prices. The activity of energy management is subject to a series of variables which are identified and classified based on their common 214 uncertainty characteristics (or risk). Such risks include market price evolution risk (electricity and fuel) and hydroelectric production volume risk (price and volume risk), as well as credit risk of the counterparties. NEVERENDING ENERGY Monitoring the price, volume and credit risks includes their quantification in terms of positions at risk which can be adjusted through market operations. This quantification is made by using specific models that value positions so as to determine the maximum loss that can be incurred, with a given probability and a determined time frame. Risks are managed in accordance with the strategies defined by the Executive Board of Directors, which are subject to a periodic review based on the evolution of the operations, in order to change the profile of the positions and adjust them to the established management objectives. Risks are monitored by means of a series of actions involving daily monitoring of the different risk indicators, of the operations grouped in the systems and the prudence limits defined by management area and risk component, as well as regular backtesting and supplementary validation of the models and assumptions used. This monitoring not only ensures the effectiveness of the strategies implemented, but also provides elements to enable initiatives to be taken to correct them, if necessary. The principal price and volume risk indicator used is the margin at risk (P@R), which estimates the impact of the variation of the different risk factors (price of electricity and hydrological) on the following year’s margin, P@R corresponding to the difference between an expected margin and a pessimistic scenario with a probability to occur of 5% (confidence interval of 95%) considering a time frame of 1 year. Both the volumes which are certain and those, which although uncertain, are expected, namely production of the plants and the corresponding consumption of fuel, are considered. In June 2013, P@R has included wholesale gas business. The P@R Distribution by risk factor is as follows: P@R Distribution by risk factor Thousands of Euros Dec 2013 Dec 2012 Risk factor Negotiation 2,000 Fuel 21,000 26,000 CO2 15,000 2,000 Electricity 21,000 18,000 Hydrological 36,000 38,000 Diversification effect -51,000 -43,000 44,000 41,000 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Regarding credit risk, the quantification of exposure considers the amount and type of transaction (e.g. swap or forward), the rating of the counterparty risk that depends on the probability of default and the expected value of credit to recover, which varies depending on the guarantees received or the existence of netting agreements.The EDP Group's exposure to credit risk rating is as follows: Dec 2013 Dec 2012 Credit risk rating (S&P) AAA to AA14.51% 6.63% A+ to A59.60% 56.54% BBB+ to BBB10.31% 33.55% BB+ to B0.82% 0.59% No rating assigned 14.76% 2.69% 100.00% 100.00% Brazil Interest rate and exchange rate risk management The main tool used to monitor and control market risk in the Brazilian subsidiaries is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is the maximum expected loss on the operations portfolio over a specific period of time, resulting from an adverse movement in the market that has a specific confidence interval. The VaR model used is based on a confidence interval of 95% and assumes a 10 day time frame for settlement of positions, based essentially on historical data. Considering market data for the last 2 years and observation of the relationship between the different prices and markets, the model generates a series of scenarios for changes in market prices. The VaR methodology used in Brazil considers a series of stress tests with the objective of monitoring the financial impact of the different market scenarios. The summary of VaR on the operations of the Brazilian subsidiaries is as follows: VaR Thousands of Euros Dec 2013 Dec 2012 Exchange rate risk 1,093 1,309 Interest rate risk 3,788 4,097 215 Covariation -1,340 -1,993 3,541 3,413 NEVERENDING ENERGY 5.

INCOME TAX NEVERENDING ENERGY In accordance with current legislation, tax returns are subject to review and correction by the tax authorities during subsequent periods. In Portugal the limit is 4 years, or 5 or 6 years if tax losses and tax benefits have been used. In Spain the period is 4 years and in Brazil it is 5 years. In the United States of America, in general, for the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) to issue additional income tax assessments for an entity is 3 years. Tax losses generated in each fiscal year, which are also subject to inspection and adjustment, can be deducted to the taxable income assessed in the subsequent years (5 years in Portugal for the tax losses assessed in 2012 and 2013, 18 in Spain, 20 in the USA and Canada, 5 in Poland, 7 in Romania, 9 in the Netherlands and without an expiry date in Brazil, France, Italy, United Kingdom and Belgium). Moreover, in the Netherlands and United Kingdom the tax losses may be carried back to the previous tax year and in the USA and Canada to the 2 and 3 previous years, respectively. However, the deduction of tax losses in Portugal, Spain, Brazil, France, Italy and Poland may be limited to a percentage of the taxable income of the year. The EDP Group companies are taxed, whenever possible, on a consolidated basis as allowed by the tax legislation of the respective countries. In August 2011, the Royal Decree-Law 9/2011 was approved in Spain, introducing a set of amendments to the Spanish income tax legislation. From 1 January 2012 onwards, the period for off setting prior years' tax losses carry forward was extended from 15 to 18 years. In Portugal, the Law 64-B/2011 of 30 December (2012 State Budget Law) has extended the period to carry forward tax losses from 4 to 5 years (for tax losses generated after 1 January 2012). However, the deduction of tax losses (even if generated before 2012) cannot exceed 75% of the taxable income earned in each tax period. This limitation does not prevent the deduction of the non-deducted losses, in the same conditions, until the end of the respective tax deductible period. In Spain, the Royal Decree-Law 12/2012, published on 31 March 2012, established a set of measures aimed to reduce the public deficit, namely a general limitation for the deduction of the net financial expenses to 30% limit of the adjusted operational profit. The amount of financial expenses incurred which exceed the above mentioned 30% limit may be deducted in the 18 following years, provided that this limit is not exceeded in each year. Additionally, the maximum annual rate of goodwill amortisation is established at 1% for the tax years of 2012 and 2013. The Royal Decree-Law 20/2012, which was approved in July 2012, introduced a new set of temporary measures regarding the Spanish Corporate Income Tax legislation. The main measures are related to the change of the method for the calculation of the payments on account due by large-sized companies in the years 2012 and 2013 and to the amendment of the limits to the deductibility of tax losses carried forward for the years 2012 and 2013: Companies whose last year turnover are between 20 and 60 millions of Euros, can only deduct tax losses up to 50% of the taxable income compared to the former limit of 75%; and Companies whose last year turnover exceed 60 millions of Euros, can only deduct tax losses up to 25% of the taxable income compared to the former limit of 50%. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Law 16/2012 was published on 28 December, introducing a set of tax measures aiming at the reduction of the public deficit and the expansion of the economic activity in Spain. The main measures with impact on the Group subsidiaries located in Spain are the following: Limit of 70% of the deductibility for tax purposes of the amortisation and depreciation of intangible and tangible assets and investment properties, on the tax years of 2013 and 2014. Therefore, the amortisation and depreciation which is not deductible for tax purposes in 2013 and 2014, may be deducted on a straight basis over a 10-year period or over the remaining useful life of the corresponding assets from the tax year of 2015 onwards; and Possibility of companies revaluate their tangible assets and investment properties, based on pre defined coefficients. According to the law, the effect of the reevaluation was taxed in 2013 at a single rate of 5% over the net increase in the taxable asset value. The amortisation and depreciation expense of the above mentioned net increase (revaluation) was tax deductible for the revaluated assets remaining useful life. In Portugal, the Law 64-A/2011 of 30 December, determines that the state surcharge will be calculated as follows (i) at a rate of 3% over taxable income in the range of 1.5 to 10 millions of Euros, and (ii) at a rate of 5% over taxable income exceeding 10 millions of Euros. The Law 66-B/2012 of 31 December aggravated the state surcharge as follows: (i) at a rate of 3% over taxable income in the range of 1.5 to 7.5 millions of Euros, and (ii) at a rate of 5% over taxable income exceeding 7.5 millions of Euros. In accordance with n.º 4 of Article 116º of the Law 64-B/2011, such modification applies for a two year period starting in 1 January 2012. Accordingly, during 2012 and 2013, the maximum corporate income tax rate in Portugal applicable to entities with taxable income exceeding 10 and 7.5 millions of Euros, respectively, is 31.5%. The Law 2/2014, published on 16 January 2014, which approved the Reform of the CIT, introduced a set of new tax measures. The main measures are related to the reduction of CIT rate and the extension of the period to carry forward tax losses: The CIT rate is reduced from 25% to 23% in 2014 to which is added the municipal and state tax. Additionally, a new tier of state surcharge was established over taxable income exceeding 35 millions of Euros, at a rate of 7%. Whereas these tax rates are already substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, they have been considered in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2013; The period to carry forward prior years' tax losses was extended from 5 to 12 years (for tax losses generated on or after 1 January 2014). Additionally, the deduction cap is reduced from 75% to 70% of the taxable income of the year. In previous years, as a result of the Portuguese Tax Authorities interpretations regarding municipal surcharge and the underlying IT systems used by the tax authorities, EDP Group paid in excess municipal surcharge on the individual taxable income of the subsidiaries 224 forming EDP taxation group in the amount of 43.1 millions of Euros. On 30 December 2011, the Administrative Court of Lisbon issued a favourable decision to EDP Group regarding the municipal surcharge NEVERENDING ENERGY of 2007, which resulted in the recognition of an income of 10 millions of Euros in 2011. On 24 April 2012, an additional favourable decision was issued by the Administrative Court of Lisbon, regarding the municipal surcharge of 2010 in the amount of 12.7 millions of Euros, which was recorded as an income in the second quarter of 2012. On 31 December 2012, the Administrative Court of Lisbon formally released a decision in favour of EDP regarding the 2008 municipal surcharge and autonomous taxation, which resulted in the recognition of an income of 7.5 millions of Euros in 2012. On 20 May 2013, an additional favourable decision was issued by the Administrative Court of Lisbon, regarding the municipal surcharge of 2009 paid in excess in the amount of 1.6 millions of Euros, which was recorded as an income in the second quarter of 2013. On 31 December 2013, the total amount of 2011 municipal surcharge paid in excess, for which EDP Group is still awaiting for a formal decision on the legal procedures, amounts to 11 millions of Euros.

Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is determined based on the value in use of the assets, calculated using valuation methodologies supported by discounted cash flow techniques, considering market conditions, the time value of money and the business risks. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 The recoverable amount testing is performed for each cash generating unit, identified in each country where EDP Group develops its activities/operations, namely: ł HC Energia (including NG Energia) Generation, Distribution & Supply of electricity and Distribution & Supply of gas; ł EDPR Europe – Wind generation; ł EDPR North America and EDPR Brasil Wind generation; ł EDP Brasil Generation, Distribution, and Supply of electricity. Therefore, for the purposes of these tests, the EDP Group has defined a set of assumptions to determine the recoverable amount of the main investments of the Group. Goodwill impairment test analysis – HC Energia Group (including NG Energia) The discount rates after taxes used by the Group in the impairment test analysis range between 5.70% and 6.77% (2012: between 6.77% and 7.47% respectively). Regarding to generation business the future cash flow projection corresponds to the remaining useful life of the respective assets (power plants). In the electricity and gas transmission business the cash flow projection period considered was five years added by a growth rate, since long-term contracts exist. For the remaining businesses there are estimated price curves for the reference periods. The main assumptions on which impairment tests are based are as follows: In the generation business, the estimated energy produced by the power plants: consider the best estimate of future market demand and total installed capacity; Prices of electricity, gas and coal were defined considering the market expectations regarding future price curves and considering the regulation in force. Contracted prices for future long term purchases were also used; Investment costs: the best available estimates of the future investments were used in order to guarantee a regular use of existing assets, as well as the estimates that resulted from legislative changes; Operating costs: operating costs were projected consistent with the company’s experience and internal models; 233 The growth rates used to make projections are the following: (i) for the electricity generation is zero; (ii) for electricity supply is 1.25%; NEVERENDING ENERGY (iii) for electricity distribution is 2.1%; and (iv) for gas activity is 1%. These growth rates are based on the market growth and inflation expectations; In the regulated business, namely distribution of electricity and gas, officially approved asset remuneration was used, considering the regulated mechanisms for the annual remuneration updates; Discount rate: the discount rates used reflect EDP Group’s best estimate regarding the specific risks associated to each CGU. The Group has performed a series of sensitivity analyses to the results of impairment tests in some key variables, such as (i) cost of fuel and respectively pool price (ii) discount rates; and (iii) trade energy. The sensitivity analysis results show that (i) an increase of 5% in the cost of fuel accompained by the expected impact in the prices and operation hours of the generation assets, or (ii) a decrease of 5% of trade energy, or (iii) an increase of 100 bps on the discount rate do not result in any impairment indicators. Goodwill impairment test analysis – EDP Renováveis The future cash flows projection used is the useful life of the assets (25 years) which is consistent with the current depreciation method. This projection also incorporate the long-term energy sale contracts in place and long-term estimates of energy prices, for the asset with market exposure. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 The main assumptions used for the impairment tests are as follows: Power produced: net capacity factors used for each CGU utilize the wind studies carried out, which takes into account the long-term predictability of wind output and that wind generation is supported in nearly all countries by regulatory mechanisms that allow for production and priority dispatching whenever weather conditions permit; Electricity remuneration: regulated or contracted remuneration has been applied where available, as for the CGUs that benefit from regulated remuneration or that have signed contracts to sell their output during all or part of their useful life; where this is not available, prices were derived using price curves projected by the company based on its experience, internal models and using external data references; New capacity: tests were based on the best information available on the wind farms expected to be built in coming years, adjusted by probability of success and by the growth prospects of the company based on the Business Plan Targets, its historical growth and market size projections. The tests considered the contracted and expected prices to buy turbines from various suppliers; Operating costs: established contracts for land leases and maintenance agreements were used; other operating costs were projected consistent with the company’s experience and internal models; Terminal value: considered at 15% of the initial investment in each wind farm, considering inflation; and Discount rate: the discount rates used are post-tax, reflect EDPR Group’s best estimate of the risks specific to each CGU and range as follows: 2013 2012 Portugal and Spain 5.3% 6.5% 7.0% 7.1% United States 6.0% 7.3% 5.5% 6.8% Rest of Europe 4.8% 7.6% 5.9% 8.2% Impairment tests were performed taking into account the regulation changes in each country, as disclosed in note 1. 234 A series of sensitivity analysis were performed on the results of impairment tests namely in some of the key variables, such as: EDPR NA, decrease in the Net Capacity Factors; NEVERENDING ENERGY EDPR NA, 5% and 10% reduction of Merchant Prices. Furthermore, EDPR Group has done an additional sensitivity analysis by increasing 100 basis points the discount rate used in the base case for EDPR NA and EDPR EU CGU's. These sensitivity analysis performed for each assumption independently did not indicate any impairment for the goodwill allocated to each country. Goodwill impairment test analysis – EDP Brasil For EDP Brasil, the cash flows were determined based on the production and consumption volume and estimated tariffs and installed capacity and tariff evolution prospects in the different markets / power purchase agreements. The period considered for the cash flows corresponds to the useful life of the plant & machinery and other relevant equipments or until the end of the concession contracts, if lower than the useful life. The discount rates used reflect the specific risks for each activities: 7.6% in generation, 8.2% in distribution and 9.1% in supply. The terminal value of the distribution business corresponds to the present value of the assets at the end of the concession period (Regulatory Asset Base). In the generation / supply business, the terminal value corresponds to the present value of the assets net of amortisation at the end of the concession period.

SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM EDP, S.A. is a company that was incorporated as a State-owned company and started its privatisation process in 1997. The second and third phases of the privatisation process were carried out in 1998, the fourth phase in 2000, the fifth phase consisting of a capital increase in 2004 and a sixth phase in 2005. In December 2007 the State issued bonds convertible into shares of EDP, S.A. under the seventh phase of the privatisation process. On 11 May 2012 regarding EDP's eight reprivatisation phase, the Portuguese State sold to CWEI (Europe), S.A. (former China Three Gorges International (Europe), S.A.), through a transaction executed outside a regulated market, the ownership of 780,633,782 shares representing 21.35% of the share capital of EDP, S.A. On 21 February 2013, Parpública – Participações Públicas (SGPS) S.A. (Parpública) notified EDP that on 19 February 2013 sold 151,517,000 shares, which correspond to 4,14% of EDP share capital. The decrease of the shareholding resulted from a private offer via an “accelerated bookbuilding” process, in which Caixa – Banco Investimento, S.A. and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc acted as Joint Bookrunners and its corresponding settlement was held on the regulated market “Eurolist by NYSE Euronext Lisbon”. As a result of this two last transactions, Parpública no longer has a qualified shareholding position in EDP share capital. The share capital amounts of 3,656,537,715 Euros and is represented by 3,656,537,715 fully paid up ordinary shares of 1 Euro each. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

HYDROLOGICAL ACCOUNT This caption is analysed as follows: Group and Company Thousands of Euros Dec 2013 Dec 2012 Non-Current 33,644 Current 35,641 22,832 35,641 56,476 The movements in the Hydrological account are analysed as follows: Group and Company Thousands of Euros Dec 2013 Dec 2012 Balance at the beginning of the year 56,476 69,142 Amounts received / (paid) during the year -22,831 -15,155 Financial charges 1,996 2,489 Balance at the end of the year 35,641 56,476 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 The hydrological account was established by Decree-law 338/91 and consists of a legal mechanism for compensating the variable costs of generating electricity. The hydrological account was set up in 1994 when the actual EDP Group was owned by the State, through a charge against the income statement. In 2000, through a spin-off of EDP, REN was set up, and new regulations were issued (through Decree-law 98/2000) which reinforced and maintained the requirement to keep the hydrological account in EDP’s balance sheet. As explained above, REN was part of the EDP Group until 2000. Thus, the entries in the hydrological correction account were made within the EDP Group. Since the split of REN in June 2000, EDP, S.A. (the Group parent company) has paid to or received cash from REN, which is booked against the hydrological correction account in the balance sheet and the related financial charges are booked in the income statement. REN uses the amounts received or paid to compensate the operators in the liberalised market, in accordance with the objectives of the hydrological correction account as explained above. In October 2010 it was issued the Decree-Law 110/210, which determines the extinction of the hydrological account mechanism on 31 December 2016. The differential of hydrological adjustment should be reflected in the tariff calculation applicable to all energy consumers, to cover the variation risk of tariff costs and revenues associated to the hydrological variability in Portugal. This decree regulates that the account of hydrological correction should be maintained in the balance sheet of EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. and the correspondent annual movements explained in the notes to the financial statements.

This change resulted in an increase in the post-employment liability for the active population, which is based on the company' estimatives will adhere to ACT early retirement program and the actual early retirees. This effect in the amount of 164,932 thousands of Euros is recognized in OCI as an assumption change. As mentioned under Accounting policies note 2 n), the EDP Group opted, upon transition to IFRS, to charge to reserves, the total amount of the deferred actuarial losses existing at that date, for the several employee benefits plans. The impact on reserves at 31 December 2004 amounted to 1,162,000 thousands of Euros. In the following years, in compliance with the accounting policy adopted, the actuarial gains and losses of these plans were recorded directly in reserves, having recognised in 2013 gains of 137,093 thousands of 251 Euros and in 2012 gains of 182,339 thousands of Euros. NEVERENDING ENERGY The weighted average duration of the defined benefit liabilities in Portugal is 9 years. Employee benefit plans Some EDP Group companies grant post-retirement benefits to employees, under defined benefit and defined contribution plans, namely pension plans that pay retirement complements of age, disability and surviving pensions, as well as early retirement pensions. In some cases healthcare is provided during retirement and early retirement, through mechanisms complementary to those provided by the National Health Service. The following is a summary of the nature of the plans and the companies covered, as well as financial and economic data of the plans: I. Defined benefit pension plans The EDP Group companies in Portugal resulting from the spin-off of EDP in 1994 have a social benefits plan funded by a closed Pension Fund, complemented by a specific provision. The EDP Pension Fund is managed by Pensõesgere with the management of the assets subcontracted to external asset management entities. This Pension Fund covers the liability for retirement pension complements (age, disability and survivor pension). The responsibilities for early retirement are not covered by the fund’s assets, being adequately provisioned through a specific provision. In Spain, following the collective labour agreement ( Convenio Colectivo ) signed in December 2007, HC Energia Group companies implemented an early retirement program that has been in place during the period from 2008 to 2012. Bandeirante in Brazil has two defined benefit plans managed by the CESP Foundation, until 31 May 2011. From this date, the plans management became the responsibility of EnerPrev, a closed complementary welfare entity, sponsored by companies of EDP Brasil, in order to manage a set of benefit plans for employees and ex-employees of Bandeirante: DB Plan in force up to 31 March 1998, a Benefit Plan that grants Balanced Proportional Supplementary Benefits (BSPS) in the form of an annuity payable to participants enrolled until 31 March 1998, of an amount defined in proportion to accumulated past service up to that date, based on compliance with the regulatory granting requirements. The company is fully liable to fund this plan; the DB plan in force after 31 March 1998, grants an annuity in proportion to the accumulated past services after 31 March 1998, on the basis of 70% of the average actual monthly wage for the last 36 months in service. In the event of death or disability caused by a labour accident, the benefits incorporate all the past service (including that accumulated up to 31 March 1998), and not only past service accumulated after 31 March 1998. The Company and the participants are equally responsible for funding the Plan.

In the course of its normal activity, EDP Group subsidiaries are involved in several litigations and contingencies (of possible risk) of administrative, civil, tax, labour and other natures. These legal, arbitration or other actions, involve customers, suppliers, employees, administrative, central, municipal, tax, environmental or other authorities. In EDP Group's opinion and its legal advisors the risk of a loss in these actions is not probable and the outcome will not affect on a material way its consolidated financial position. The losses of these processes were considered as possible, do not require the recognition of provisions and are periodically reassessed. At 31 December 2013, the more relevant situations considered as possible contingencies are described as follows: i) Bandeirante is involved in a lawsuit with the client White Martins, S.A. in the amount of 27,769 thousands of Euros, on the alleged existence of reflex effects of the Administrative Order 38/86 and 45/86 of the extinguished DNAEE, in the electricity tariff charged between 1986 and 2000.

As at 31 December 2013, the amount of this tax contingency totals 235.2 millions of Euros (31 December 2012: 224 millions of Euros). 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Considering the analysis made, the technical advice received and a favourable binding opinion obtained from the tax authorities in relation to the nature of the transaction occurred in the year of the assessment, the EDP Group considers as remote the risk associated with this matter. Under this analysis, the capital loss is tax deductible for income tax purposes as established in article 75 number 2 of the Corporate Income Tax Code ( Código do IRC ) based on the wording of the law in force at that date (actual article 81). Bearing the above in mind, and given that the EDP Group’s tax procedures comply with applicable Portuguese tax legislation at the date of the events, the Group is currently using all available legal means to contest these additional assessments. As a result of the administrative appeal dismissal, EDP presented a judicial claim, on 6 June 2012, which is still being analysed. Bandeirante, through the Union of Power Industry of the State of São Paulo SindiEnergia, filed two claims against the Department of Finance of the State of São Paulo, seeking the suspension of the effects of Decrees 55,421/2010 and 55,867/2010. Both claims obtained a favourable decision which was confirmed by the Court of Justice of the State of São Paulo. These decisions are still subject of appeal to higher courts. The estimated value at 31 December 2013 amounts to 51,124 thousands of Euros. 38.

Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 In 2012, as a result of the negotiations for the sale of the gas transmission network of NG Energia, the assets and liabilities associated with this business were presented as assets and liabilities held for sale. This operation was concluded in February 2013, after obtaining the required authorizations by the regulatory and antitrust authorities. NG Energia sold the gas transmission business to Enagás, S.A. (the Spanish gas transmission system operator) for 115,493 thousands of Euros, generating a gain of 55,829 thousands of Euros (see note 8). In this operation, Enagás also paid an intercompany debt of 129,654 thousands of Euros. On 21 January 2013, following the exercise of a call option by Soporcel as established in the shareholders' agreement, EDP Produção sold the cogeneration assets, through the sale of 82% shareholding in Soporgen, S.A to the other shareholder, Soporcel, S.A., for 5,060 thousands of Euros, generating a gain of 2,239 thousands of Euros (see note 8). Additionally, an amount of 5,349 thousands of Euros was received related to dividends distributed by Soporgen before this operation. Simultaneously with this divestment, EDP Produção received full reimbursement of the shareholders loans granted to Soporgen, including accrued interest, in the amount of 3,281 thousands of Euros.

On 6 December 2013, EDP Energias do Brasil comunicated to the market the establishement of a partnership with CWE Investment Corporation (CWEI) and CWEI Brasil Participações (CWEI Brasil), subsidiaries controlled by China Three Gorges, for joint energy projects in Brazil. In the context of this partnership, was agreed the sale of 50% of the stake held in Jari (CEJA) and Cachoeira Caldeirão hydro power plant projects. The agreement foresees joint participation in energy projects in Brazil with joint control. The transaction amounted to 490 millions of Reais for CEJA and the sale amount of Cachoeira Caldeirão corresponds to 50% of the investment made by EDP Brasil. With reference to 31 December 2013, and to the extent that these transactions, though highly probable, are subject to prior authorization by the competent authorities, the assets and liabilities related to these transactions were presented as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale.

RELEVANT OR SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Portuguese Government approves energy sector extraordinary contribution for 2014 The Portuguese Government approved on 31 December 2013, the state budget for 2014 approving the creation of an extraordinary contribution applicable to economic operators in the energy sector that develop the following activities: i) generation, transmission or distribution of electricity; ii) transport, distribution, storage or wholesale supply of natural gas; iii) refining, treatment, storage, transportation, distribution and wholesale supply of crude oil and oil products. The contribution rate on the energy sector will be 0.85% on the fixed tangible and intangible assets, as of 1 January 2014 or as of the first day of the fiscal year. In the case of electricity generation activity, this rate will be applicable only to the power plants in operation on that date. Among other, the following assets will be exempt from this rate: (i) CCGTs with an annual utilization of installed capacity in 2013, up to 2,000 hours (application of a reduced rate of 0.425% for annual utilization above 2,000 hours and below 3,500 hours); (ii) The hydroelectric plants with installed capacity below 20 MW; (iii) Wind farms; and (iv) Power plants with electricity generation licences awarded following tender procedures or competitive consultation. The Government expects the contribution to generate 150 millions of Euros of proceeds, of which 50 millions of Euros will be allocated to the reduction of the tariff deficit of the electricity sector and to energy efficiency measures. According to the information available, the impact net of taxes for EDP of this extraordinary contribution will amount to approximately 45 millions of Euros in 2014. 276 EDP issues U.S.$ 750,000,000 of notes NEVERENDING ENERGY On 7 of January, EDP Finance BV launched and priced an offering of a total of 750,000,000 US Dollars of Rule 144A and Regulation S notes, maturing in January 2021 with a coupon of 5.25%. The Notes were issued under EDP and EDP Finance B.V.’s Programme for the Issuance of Debt Instruments (MTN), and an application for the Notes admitted to official listing on the Irish Stock Exchange. The proceeds of the offering will be used to fund EDP’s general corporate purposes. Morgan Stanley, RBS, Société Générale Corporate & Investment Banking, UBS Investment Bank and Espírito Santo Investment Bank acted as Joint Lead Managers on the transaction. Fitch maintains EDP on rating watch negative On 15 January, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) has maintained EDP and EDP Finance B.V.’s “BBB-“ Longterm Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings and “F3” Short-term IDR on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). Fitch has also maintained Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico, S.A.'s “BBB-“ Long term IDR and “F3” Short term IDR on RWN. Fitch placed EDP on RWN in July 2013, together with other utilities exposed to the Spanish electricity market, following the introduction by the Spanish government of regulatory changes affecting the remuneration of electricity sector activities including electricity distribution and renewable generation assets. The maintenance of RWN reflects that although Fitch currently anticipates that EDP’s credit metrics could remain commensurate with the current ratings there remains an element of uncertainty. Fitch further states it will review its expectations once the outstanding details on the remuneration of renewables and company's updated strategy are available. EDP Renováveis executes project finance for its first project in Canada On 16 January, EDP Renováveis, S.A. (EDPR) has executed a project finance structure agreement for its first wind farm in Canada. The South Branch project located in Ontario with an installed capacity of 30 MW has secured a 20 year Feed-in Tariff awarded by the Ontario Power Authority. The long-term contracted debt facility amounts to 49 millions of Canadian dollars and the funding is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2014. EDPR financing strategy is to contract long-term debt in local currency at competitive prices in order to mitigate the refinancing risk and to reduce the foreign exchange risk by having a natural hedge between revenues and costs. With the successful execution of its first wind project in Canada, EDPR adds to its portfolio a market with a low riskprofile and attractive wind resource and extends its geographical diversification to 11 markets around the world (US, Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, Poland, Romania, UK, Italy, Brazil and Canada). 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Standard & Poor's affirms EDP's ‘BB+’ rating on stable outlook On 28 January, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed its 'BB+' long-term and ‘B’ short-term corporate credit ratings on EDP and EDP Finance B.V. and removed the longterm ratings from CreditWatch with negative implications. The outlook is stable. The affirmation and removal from CreditWatch follows S&P’s similar action on Portugal, on 17 January 2014. S&P stated that “outlook on EDP now reflects S&P’s expectation that the utility's business risk and financial risk profiles will remain resilient to persistently difficult and uncertain market, economic, and regulatory conditions in its Portuguese and Spanish core markets.” S&P also considers that “EDP's debt will continue gradually decreasing and its credit metrics will continue gradually strengthening in the next two years, thanks to additional asset sales, tariff deficit securitizations, and capex cuts”. A lowering of S&P’s long-term rating on Portugal by up to two levels would leave the rating on EDP unchanged, all else remaining equal. CTG Group enters partnership with EDP Brasil for construction of hydro power plant São Manoel On 13 December 2013, Terra Nova Consortium, held in 66.6% by EDP – Energias do Brasil (EDP Brasil) and 33.3% by Companhia Furnas Centrais Elétricas S.A. (Furnas), obtained the concession for the São Manoel hydro power plant in the A-5 auction held by ANEEL. This hydro power plant, with an installed capacity of 700 MW will be built on the border of the Mato Grosso and Pará States, in the Teles Pires River. In the context of the Memorandum of Understanding signed by EDP Brasil and CWE Investment Corporation (CWEI), on 6 December 2013, which establishes the key guidelines of a partnership aiming at future co-investments between EDP Brasil and CWEI, EDP Brasil signed, on 7 February 2014, a Purchase and Sale Agreement with CWEI (Brasil) Participações Ltda (CWEI Brasil), a subsidiary of CWEI, to sell 33.3% of the company holding the rights to develop São Manoel hydro power plant to CWEI Brasil. CWEI Brasil will reimburse the costs incurred by EDP Brasil and assume future equity commitments until the end of the construction, also assuming the risks and benefits of the project in proportion of the acquired stake. The financing of the project considers long-term debt with leverage estimated up to 66% on an investment of 2.7 billions of Reais, not considering inflation and capitalized interest. Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the conclusion of the transaction is subject to prior approval by the National Electric Energy Agency ANEEL, Chinese regulatory bodies and the realization of other measures of corporate nature, necessary to the 277 effectiveness of the transfer of control of the company's transactions’ object, which is expected to occur by the second half of 2014. NEVERENDING ENERGY The equity commitments made by CWEI Brasil shall be considered for the purposes of compliance with the Strategic Partnership signed between EDP and CTG, in relation to the total 2 billions of Euros investment by CTG (including co-funding CAPEX) in operating and readyto-build renewable energy generation projects. Iberdrola decreases its ownership interest in the share capital of EDP On 10 February 2014, Iberdrola Energía, S.A.

Currently, and following sales carried out since 31 December 2013 (including the aforementioned sale), Iberdrola holds 182,674,782 shares, corresponding to 4.996% of EDP’s share capital and voting rights. As a result of this transaction, Iberdrola decreased its position from 6.66% to 4.996% in EDP's share capital. Additionally, Iberdrola has contracted financial derivatives for the sale of EDP shares representing approximately 2.9% of EDP's share capital. The last due date of these derivatives will take place on 7 May 2014. Accordingly, at the due date of the last aforementioned derivatives, the participation of Iberdrola in the share capital of EDP will be around 2.1%. EDP sells 138 millions of Euros of tariff deficit in Portugal EDP Serviço Universal, S.A. (EDP SU), the last resort supplier of the Portuguese electric system, 100% owned by EDP Group, agreed on 10 February 2014 the sale of a portion of 138 millions of Euros, and the respective interest, of the 2013 tariff deficit related with special regime generation. This tariff deficit resulted from the 5-year deferral of the recovery of the 2013 overcost with the acquisition of energy from special regime generation (including adjustments for 2011 and 2012) in the total amount of 1.4 billions of Euros, with an outstanding amount at the end of 2013 of 1.3 billions of Euros. Norges Bank notifies qualified shareholding in EDP On 13 February 2014, Norges Bank (The Central Bank of Norway) notified EDP that, in accordance with article 20 of the Portuguese Securities Code, it came to hold 81,506,689 ordinary shares of EDP, which corresponds to 2.23% of EDP’s share capital and 2.23% of the respective voting rights. The qualified shareholding resulted from the acquisition of 9,250,000 shares on 12 February 2014. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Under this standard, the Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the defined benefit liability (asset) for the period using the same discount rate as when computing the defined benefit liability at the beginning of the annual period, taking into account every change that occurred in the defined benefit liability (asset) as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Consequently, the net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) comprises: interest cost on the defined benefit liability; interest income on plan assets; and interest on the asset ceiling effect. No significant impact in the Group resulted from the adoption of this amendment. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 Annual Improvement Project (2009-2011) In May 2012, IASB published the Annual Improvement Project that implied changes to the standards. However, the effective date of the referred changes is 1 January 2013, being early adoption allowed. The changes are the following: ł Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.

No significant impact in the Group resulted from the adoption of this amendment. Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the Group IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 279 The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2011, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption. NEVERENDING ENERGY This standard introduces a new approach in determining which investments should be consolidated, replacing IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC 12 Consolidation SPE. This standard establishes a single model to be applied in assessing the existence of control over subsidiaries, where an investor has control over a subsidiary when it is exposed, or has the right, to variable returns arising from its involvement in the subsidiary and has the ability to influence these returns because of the power over it. Additionally, was introduced the concept of de facto control . Therefore, the companies included as at 31 December 2013 under the full consolidation method and that will start to be consolidated under the equity method are disclosed in Annex I. IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2011, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption. This standard superseded IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and introduces several changes for accounting jointly controlled investments, the main aspect is the elimination of the option to consolidate joint ventures by the proportional method, being the equity method mandatory. The structure of a joint agreement ceases to be the main factor in determining the accounting model to adopt. The classification of a joint agreement requires the identification and evaluation of the structure, legal form of the contractual agreement and other facts and circumstances. Therefore, the companies included as at 31 December 2013 under the the proportional consolidation method and that will start to be consolidated under the equity method are disclosed in Annex I. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2011, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption. The information disclosed has to help users of the financial statements evaluate the nature and risks associated with its interests in other entities and the effects of those interests on the financial statements. The main issues considered are as follows: for the interests in subsidiaries, it should be disclosed: (i) the composition of the group; (ii) non-controlling interests; (iii) significant restrictions on the parent's ability to access or use the assets and settle the liabilities of its subsidiares; (iv) the nature of, and changes in, the risks associated with interests in consolidated structured entities; and (v) changes in its ownership interest that did or did not result in a loss of control during the reporting period; for the interests in joint arrangements and associates, it should be disclosed: (i) the nature, extent and financial effects of its interests in joint arrangements and associates, including information about contractual relationships with other parties; and (ii) the nature of, and the changes in, the associated risks with its interests in joint ventures and associates; for the interests in unconsolidated structured entities, it should be disclosed: (i) the nature and the extent of its interests in unconsolidated structured entities; and (ii) the evaluation of the nature and changes in the risks associated with the interests in unconsolidated structured entities. The Group is evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. IAS 27 (Amended) Separate Financial Statements The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2011, IAS 27 (Amended) Separate Financial Statements, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption. The amendment to IAS 27 in 2011 resulted from the Board's project on consolidation. A new IFRS, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses the principle of control and requirements relating to the preparation of consolidated financial statements. As a 280 result, IAS 27 now contains requirements relating only to separate financial statements. This change is reflected in the standard's amended title, Separate financial statements. NEVERENDING ENERGY No significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this amendment. IAS 28 (Amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2011, IAS 28 (Amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption.

IAS 32 (Amended) Financial Instruments: Presentation Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in December 2011, IAS 32 (Amended) Financial Statements: Presentation Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption. This amendment clarifies the required conditions to be met in order to present the net position of the financial assets and liabilities in the financial position of an entity, as follows: (i) the entity currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts, and (ii) the entity has the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. No significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this amendment. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 IAS 36 (Amended) Impairment of Assets: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2013, IAS 36 (Amended) Impairment of Assets: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption. This amendment removes the requirement to disclose recoverable amounts of an asset or a cash-generting unit when there has been no impairment or reversal of impairment. When an impairment is recognised or reversed and the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal, the following should be disclosed: the level of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of the asset or has been determined; for fair value measurements at level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy: (ii) a description of the valuation techniques used and any changes in that valuation technique; and (ii) key assumptions used in the measurement of fair value, including the discount rate(s) used in the current and previous measurement if fair value less costs of disposal is measured using a present value technique. No significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this amendment. IAS 39 (Amended) Financial Instruments: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in June 2013, IAS 39 (Amended) Financial Instruments: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption. This amendment clarifies that the novation of a hedging instrument should not be considered an expiration or termination resulting of the discontinuation of hedge accounting when the instrument is novated: as a consequence of laws and regulations, or the introduction of laws and regulations, one or more clearing counterparties replace the original counterparty; and changes in the terms of the novation process are limited to those necessary to effect the replacement of the counterparty (for example: changes in all collateral requirements, rights to offset receivables and payables balances and charges levied). 281 Any changes on derivative's fair value arising fom the novation process sould be reflected in its measurement and therefore in the and assessment of the hedge effectiveness. NEVERENDING ENERGY No significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this amendment. Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in October 2012, Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption. IASB defines the term investment entity as an entity whose business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income or both, and must evaluate the performance of its investments on a fair value basis. The amendments provide an exception to the consolidation requirements in IFRS 10 and require investment entities to measure particular subsidiaries ar fair value through profit or loss, rather than consolidate them. These amendments also set out the disclosure requirements for investment entities. No significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of these amendments. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in November 2009, IFRS 9 Financial instruments part I: Classification and measurement, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, being allowed its early adoption. This standard, changed in October 2010, has not yet been adopted by the European Union. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 This standard is included in phase I of the IASB's comprehensive project to replace IAS 39 and relates to issues of classification and measurement of financial assets. The main issues considered are as follows: the financial assets can be classified in two categories: at amortised cost or at fair value. This decision will be made upon the initial recognition of the financial assets. Its classification depends on how the entity presents these financial assets and the contractual cash flows associated to each financial asset in the business; debt instruments can only be measured at amortised cost when the contractual cash-flows represent only principal and interest payments, which means that it contains only basic loan features, and for which an entity holds the asset to collect the contractual cash flows. All the other debt instruments are recognised at fair value; equity instruments issued by third parties are recognised at fair value with subsequent changes recognised in the profit and loss. However an entity could irrevocably select equity instruments at initial recognition for which fair value changes and the realised gain or loss are recognised in fair value reserves. Gains and losses recognised in fair value reserves can not be recycled to profit and loss. This is a discretionary decision, and does not imply that all the equity instruments should be treated on this basis. The dividends received are recognised as income for the year; the exemption that allows unquoted equity investments and related derivatives to be measured at cost, under IAS 39, is not allowed under IFRS 9; and changes in fair value attributable to own credit risk of financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss, shall be recognised in Other comprehensive income. The remaining fair value changes related to these financial liabilities shall be recognised through profit or loss. The amounts recognised in Other comprehensive income shall not be reclassified/transferred to profit and loss. The Group is evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. IAS 19 (Amended) Employee Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans Employee Contributions The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in November 2013, IAS 19 (Amended) Employee Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans Employee Contributions, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014, being allowed its early adoption. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. 282 This amendment allows for: NEVERENDING ENERGY contributions that are independent of the number of years of service to be recognised as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the service is rendered, instead of allocating the contributions to periods of service; and other contributions made by employees or third parties to be attributed to periods of service either using the plan's contribution formula or on a straight-line basis. The Group is evaluating the impact of adopting these amendments. IFRIC 21 Levies The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued, in May 2013, IFRIC 21 Levies, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This interpretation clarifies: a levy is a payment made to a government for which an entity receives no specific goods or services; the obligating event is the activity that binds the entity to pay the levy which is typically specified in legislation enacting the levy; a liability to pay a levy to a government should only be recognised when an obligating event has occurred. While levies may be calculated based on past performance (such as generating revenue) that itself is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition to recognise a liability. No significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this interpretation. Annual Improvement Project (2010-2012) In December 2013, the IASB published the Annual Improvement Project that implied changes to the standards. These are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014, being early adoption allowed. This project has not yet been adopted by the European Union. • Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. The definition of vesting and market' conditions was amended. Additionally it defines the terms of performance condition and service condition (which were previously part of the definition of vesting condition). No significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this amendment. • Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations. This amendment clarifies that contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability shall be measured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in fair value shall be recognised in profit or loss. No impact in the Group is arising from the adoption of this amendment. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 • Amendment to IFRS 8 Operating Segments. The amendment requires an entity to disclose the judgements made by management in applying the aggregation criteria to operating segments and clarifies that an entity shall only provide reconciliations of the total of the reportable segments' assets to the entity's assets if the segment assets are presented to the chief operation decision-maker. No significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this amendment. • Amendment to IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

OPERATING SEGMENTS REPORT 286 In accordance with IFRS 8, an operating segment is a Group component: NEVERENDING ENERGY (i) that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses; (ii) whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. The Group develops a set of regulated and liberalised activities in the energy sector, with special emphasis in generation, distribution and supply of electricity and gas. The Group manages its activities based on several business segments, which includes the activities in Iberia. Moreover, the EDP Group also makes a separate analysis of the electricity generation business through renewable power sources, which is achieved in a specific segment (EDP Renováveis). Finally, taking into consideration the specificity of the Brazilian market, the Group also makes a separate analysis of the electricity generation, distribution and supply businesses in Brazil (EDP Brasil). The Executive Board of Directors regularly reviews segmental reports, using them to assess and release each business performance, as well as to allocate resources. The segments defined by the Group are the following: • Long Term Contracted Generation in Iberia; • Liberalised Activities in Iberia; • Regulated Networks in Iberia; • EDP Renováveis; • EDP Brasil. The Long Term Contracted Generation in Iberia segment corresponds to the activity of electricity generation of plants with CMEC and SRP plants in Portugal and Spain. This segment includes, namely, the following companies: • EDP Gestão da Produção de Energia, S.A. (CMEC and SRP generation); • EDP Produção Bioléctrica, S.A.; • Fisigen Empresa de Cogeração, S.A. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 The Liberalised Activities segment in Iberia corresponds to the activity of unregulated generation and supply of electricity and gas in Portugal and Spain. This segment includes, namely, the following companies: • EDP Gestão da Produção de Energia, S.A. (liberalised generation); • Empresa Hidroeléctrica do Guadiana, S.A.; • Electrica de la Ribera del Ebro, S.A.; • Hidroeléctrica Del Cantábrico, S.L.; • Central Térmica Ciclo Combinado Grupo 4, S.A.; • Patrimonial de La Ribera del Ebro, S.L.; • EDP Comercial Comercialização de Energia, S.A.; • Hidrocantábrico Energia, S.A.U.; • EDP Soluções Comerciais, S.A.; • Naturgás Comercializadora, S.A. The Regulated Networks segment in Iberia corresponds to the activities of electricity and gas distribution in Portugal and Spain and last resort supplier. This segment includes, namely, the following companies: • EDP Distribuição de Energia, S.A.; • EDP Serviço Universal, S.A.; • Electra de Llobregat Energía, S.L.; • Hidrocantábrico Distribucion Eléctrica, S.A.U.; • Portgás Soc. de Produção e Distribuição de Gás, S.A.; • EDP Gás Serviço Universal, S.A.; • Naturgás Energia Distribución, S.A.U. The EDP Renováveis segment corresponds to the power generation activity through renewable energy resources and includes all the companies of EDPR Europe, EDPR North America and EDPR Brasil subgroups. This segment also includes the holding company EDP Renováveis, S.A., and all the adjustments between the companies composing this segment, including consolidation adjustments. The EDP Brasil segment includes the activities of electricity generation, distribution and supply in Brazil, and is composed by the Holding EDP Energias do Brasil, S.A. and all its subsidiaries, with the exception of EDP Renováveis Brasil which is included in the EDP Renováveis 287 segment. As in the EDP Renováveis segment, this segment includes all the adjustments for the companies composing this segment, including consolidation adjustments. NEVERENDING ENERGY Segment Definition The amounts reported in each operating segment result from the aggregation of the subsidiaries and business units defined in each segment perimeter and the elimination of transactions between companies of the same segment. The statement of financial position captions of each subsidiary and business unit are determined based on the amounts booked directly in the companies that compose the segment, including the elimination of balances between companies of the same segment, and excluding the allocation in the segments of the adjustments between segments. The income statement captions for each operating segment are based in the amounts booked directly in the companies financial statements and related business units, adjusted by the elimination of transactions between companies of the same segment. Nevertheless, since EDP Gestão da Produção de Energia, S.A.’s assets belong to more than one business segment, namely the CMEC and SRP generation plants allocated to the Long Term Contracted Generation and the liberalised generation plants allocated to the Liberalised Activities -, it was necessary to allocate all its gains, costs, assets and liabilities to those power plants. Preferentially, it was used analytical accounting reports to allocate gains, costs, assets and liabilities by plant. For the remaining information, since those reports don’t comprise all the costs namely the shared costs in the Supplies and Services and Personnel Costs captions, and since the applicability of the previous criterion it's not possible, the shared costs were allocated in the proportion of costs directly allocated to each plant in the total costs and the remaining assets and liabilities were allocated following the proportion of each plant net assets in the total assets. During 2013, the Group analysed the nature of each asset, liability and operating investment reported in each business segment, which resulted in the revision of its allocation to each segment. The same criteria was adopted in the presentation of comparative information. In each business segment, Assets include the Property, Plant and Equipment, Intangible Assets, Goodwill, Trade Receivables and Inventories captions. The captions Debtors and other assets are allocated to each segment according to its nature. The remaining assets are presented in the Reconciliation of information between Operating Segments and Financial Statements . In each business segment, Liabilities include the Provisions and Employee benefits captions. The captions Trade and other payables are allocated to each segment according to its nature. The remaining liabilities are presented in the Reconciliation of information between Operating Segments and Financial Statements . In each business segment, the Operating Investment caption includes increases in Property, Plant and Equipment and in Intangible Assets, excluding CO2 licences and Green certificates, net of increases in Government grants and customers contributions for investment. 2013 ANNUAL REPORT : EDP EDP Ǧ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 In 2013, the EDP Group changed the information disclosed by Operating Segment, according to the mentioned above criteria.

The EDP Annual Report is published annually. It contains the economic, financial, social and environmental information, since 2008, providing an across-the-board view of the business. The report is divided into four distinct sections: EDP, which makes a summary presentation of the company, the climate in which it operates and its strategy; Performance, which reports the main initiatives of the year, in relation to material matters; Corporate Governance, which describes the organisation and governance of the company, complying with Article 4(1) of CMVM Regulation no. 4/2013, the Portuguese Companies' Code, the Corporate Governance Code and the Regulation on Information Disclosure Duties (no. 5/2008). Financial Information, which includes a detailed analysis of the financial performance of the Group. This analysis reflects the period between 1 January and 31 December 2013. In addition to this annual report, x EDP reports its quarterly results to the market and posts its most important sustainability indicators online; x makes qualitative and quantitative, operational, environmental and social data available online; x publishes sector reports, including the Social Report and Biodiversity Report, available at www.edp.pt > sustainability > publications; x the companies EDP Espanha, EDP Brasil, and EDP Renováveis publish annual and sustainability reports. These reports provide more detailed information on their sustainability performance. Go to www.edp.pt> sustainability> publications for more detailed information on the content and organisation of the annual reporting of EDP. EDP takes a systematic approach within the framework defined by the AA1000 APS (2008) standard to identify critical stakeholders, integrate their expectations into corporate strategy and provide feedback on their contributions. EDP was subject to the verification of compliance in 2013, as in previous years, with the AA1000 AS (2008) standard, type 2, by the auditor KPMG. It audited, in particular, the principle of inclusion, materiality and response. The principle of inclusion envisages that stakeholders are consulted, their expectations and concerns are known and are incorporated into the decision-making process. To ensure the improved uptake of this perspective among EDP employees, the cross-cutting training course in Communication of Projects (2013) continued to be run in 2013 (ComPro). The method for engaging stakeholders set out in ComPro is intended to be disseminated and applied to EDP projects according to their characteristics and potential impacts. Various initiatives aimed at interaction with stakeholders are externally conducted (Chapter on Stakeholder Relations, page 36). There are specific communication channels for each segment of stakeholders (www.edp.pt> sustainability> stakeholders). The method adopted for measuring material matters is based on the standards of accountability and information and it is gathered at the corporate level and in the business units. Materiality is obtained by the intersection of the topics identified by society with the importance attributed by the business. The themes identified by society are prioritized according to the frequency with which they arise in the different categories analysed. The society vector results from an analysis of the following vectors: A survey of current and emerging regulations is conducted, by region: Iberia (Spain and Portugal), other European countries, USA and Brazil. An international benchmark of 25 companies operating in the electricity and/or gas markets and headquartered in countries where EDP operates, is conducted. These peers are chosen based on external recognition of their sustainability practices. All materially relevant issues identified by sustainability strategy studies directed at the electricity or gas sector are consulted. The topics most frequently requested by ESG investors, based on benchmark surveys, are identified. SURVEY OF EXPECTATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS OF EDP Once the expectations of the different stakeholders are known, by means of: 1) interviews with the managers responsible for different stakeholders segments in the various Group companies; 2) surveys and interviews directly conducted with stakeholders; 3) identification and categorization of the issues addressed in the existing external communication channels; 4) internal workshop to analyse the relevant topics for stakeholders. The internal perspective of importance to the business was measured based on the interviews with the Managers and Heads of different areas of the corporate centre and the businesses, which identified the most important topics for the business in 2013. The materiality matrix is influenced by trends and the climate of society and business. The changes recorded in 2013 compared to the previous year were the following: x New Topics: energy access, functional energy market; and street lighting; x Topics that have increased their relevance in both axes: ethics and impacts on communities; x Topics that have seen their position rise in the society axis: facilities security; sustainability in the supply chain, corporate governance, tariffs and energy prices, regulations, taxes and subsidies, market liberalization; wellbeing, health and safety and innovation; x Topic that has seen its position rise in the business axis: responsible marketing; x Topics that have seen their positions fall in the society axis: citizenship, customer service, reputation and trust; responsible employer. x Topics that have seen their positions fall in the business axis: natural resources management, climate change and new businesses/markets. To check the renaming of topics on the 2012 materiality matrix, see the glossary (www.edp.pt> sustainability> stakeholders). The materiality matrix guides the reporting structure, in particular this report. The issues of greatest importance are reflected in its content. EDP answers its stakeholders directly through the adequate channels of communication or indirectly through strategic partnerships. Communication may result from a request or it may be proactively provided, when in anticipation and meeting the expectations and concerns of its stakeholders, who have been previously consulted. In the organisation chart of the Group on page 20 -, the universe of companies included in the annual reporting is summarised. The consolidation criteria of operational and sustainability information follows the accounts consolidation methods of EDP: x Full consolidation method: where the parent company holds the majority of voting rights (% control) in the subsidiary, either directly or indirectly. The results of such subsidiaries are reported at 100%; x Proportional consolidation method: where a company included in the accounting consolidation perimeter runs another company together with one or more companies not included in the perimeter. In this case, only the results corresponding to the percentage stake in the jointly-controlled company are reported. A list of companies and their consolidation method is available in note 5 to the financial statements of this report (page 215). The consolidation of operational information of the new Pecém thermoelectric power plant is still limited to the information of a financial and operational nature, and is not being reported for other sustainability indicators (proportional consolidation method: 50%). When available, information concerning Pecém is published in a table footnote. In 2012, EDP decided to raise the level of external verification of sustainability reporting information to a set of 30 key indicators that are on pages 24 and 25 of this report. The Expenditure on R&D indicator is excluded. EDP is currently reviewing the concept applied and the timing of calculation, and it was not possible to include this indicator as foreseen in the reasonable check in 2013. On the closing date of this report, the reported information still represents an estimate of expenditure on R&D. This check was conducted by KPMG & Associados – Sociedade de Revisores Oficiais de Contas, S.A.. For further information on the selection process, see page 133. An online glossary is available to improve the report's transparency. It includes definitions of the methods and quantitative indicators used throughout the document: www.edp.pt/pt/pages/glossário.aspx This Report has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative, GRI3.1. The following table summarises the indicators according to the protocol of the Electricity Sector, stating deadlines for the implementation of those specific indicators for which full compliance has not yet been possible to achieve. A full table is available at www.edp.pt> sustainability> reports. Simultaneously, the following table identifies the available information that responds to the 10 principles of the Global Compact, demonstrating EDP's commitment to this initiative.

The proposed modifications concerned the indicators used, especially their respective weights. Additionally, the form of payment of the variable multiannual remuneration component has been changed. During 2013, several meetings to assess the reasonableness of the remuneration policy were held, and the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board (REMC) decided to propose its maintenance to this General Shareholder’s Meeting, with the exception of the substitution of the Performance of Free Cash flow indicator by the Performance of Operating Cash Flow excluded of regulatory receivables indicator, as this last was considered to be more appropriate to evaluate the management performance. In summary, and if this amendment is adopted, the remuneration policy of the EBD members of EDP, for 2013-2014, will be based on the following principles and rules: -------------a.

Minimum and maximum thresholds to define the existence of a performance bonus and the highest value that it may assume. More specifically, if the concrete performance falls below 90% of the fixed targets, and submitted to the GSB, as a reference for performance assessment, there will not be any payment. If, on the other hand, it exceeds 10% or more of its targets, it shall be assigned, always and only, the maximum value. These general criteria apply both to the annual variable component (limited to 80% of the fixed remuneration) as to the multiannual component (which can go up to 120% of the fixed remuneration); -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------e. Criteria that determines the allocation of the multiannual variable remuneration regarding the 349 performance throughout the term of office: although it is calculated annually, it only becomes effective NEVERENDING ENERGY if, at the end of the mandate, at least 90% of the strategic goals have been achieved, according to the performance of the company, its comparison with strategic benchmarks and the individual contribution of each member of the EDB for the achievement of that purpose; ------------------------------------------------f.

The payment of the multiannual performance bonus will occur with a three year lag regarding the respective year; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2.

Qualitative component: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The remaining 20% result from an individualized assessment conducted by the REMC, based on the individual performance of each of the EBD members. ----------------------------------------------------------------a.3. The resulting value of the quantitative and qualitative component is applicable, as previously mentioned, to 80% of the fixed annual remuneration. ----------------------------------------------------------------b. Multiannual performance indicators -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------b.1. Quantitative component and its weight ----------------------------------------------------------------------------Total shareholder return vs Eurostoxx utilities e PSI20 -------------------------------------------------------(17%) ROIC/WACC--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(17%) EBITDA performance -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(8,5%) Operating cash flow excluded of regulatory receivables performance -------------------------------------------------(8,5%) Sustainability Performance Indicator --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(17%) The 68% resulting from the weighted sum of these indicators reflect the performance that is common to all EBD members. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------350 b.2.
