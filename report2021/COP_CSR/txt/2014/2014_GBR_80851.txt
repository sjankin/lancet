This study and the associated Waste and material report were revisited and updated in March 2012, March 2013 and February 2014, in line Land use with the actual construction programme. The restatements significantly altered the SOCIAL historical figures. Socio-economic contributions Community investment and contributions ― The Aecom analysis captures not only the embodied carbon associated with the materials Local procurement and apprenticeships and systems used in construction but also the potential wastage, on-site energy usage and Community Charter transportation factors associated with development. Local satisfaction Staff ― The analysis employs a range of carbon analysis tools and data libraries developed Customers specifically for the measurement and calculation of embodied carbon in buildings as data Health and safety sources. The approach taken begins at detailed component and material levels in both CO2 Governance and CO2e, together with the additional reporting factors, to build ‘building level’ estimates of embodied carbon. ― To determine a reliable overview of the portfolio and to avoid assessing every project by ‘deep-dive’ analysis, a detailed analysis was conducted on three of the largest and most representative projects, to form a core of data and series of benchmarks: ― North East Quadrant (NEQ), residential and commercial. ― The Leadenhall Building, vertical commercial. ― Whiteley Shopping, retail park. ― To analyse these projects, Aecom used the detailed cost plans and procurement strategy data (how it is/would be put together) to produce the embodied carbon values on a material, component and elemental basis.

To refine the m² carbon benchmarks further, Aecom supplemented, Water use and intensity where necessary, data from our own internal benchmarks, databases and project Waste and material experience to ensure each one was as robust as possible. Land use ― Assumptions and data sources: SOCIAL Socio-economic contributions ― Base material data: The models used embodied CO2e data from the Bath University Community investment and contributions ICE/BSRIA database for most materials data. This was supplemented in some areas Local procurement and apprenticeships by the Ecoinvent inventory housed in the SimaPro software package. For timber, we Community Charter Local satisfaction used our own data generated from a study on bio-renewable materials for the Staff National Non-Foods Crops Centre (NNFCC), an industry benchmark study. For steel, Customers further allowances for forming, fabrication, casting and others, were added, based on Health and safety research on energy costs for UK steel working factories. Governance ― Component data: The component data in the models used comprised ‘recipes’ of composite rates, which have been assembled for hundreds of typical building components. Each composite rate model consists of volumes, densities, weights and, where applicable, recycled content (such as metals) for each component. This also includes services items such as lifts. Each rate may be ‘flexed’ by factors such as thickness or concrete mix for floors, or capacity and number of levels for a lift, for example. Where a library data item could not be found to match the cost plan item, a similar library item would be used and a percentage adjustment applied to reflect whether the cost plan item was more or less intensive than the library item. However, no such items were found. A further layer, synchronised to the embodied CO2e and CO2 data, calculated the weights for each material within each component.

The Selected Information and the Reporting Criteria against which it was assessed are summarised below. Our assurance covers the year ended 31 March 2014 and does not extend to information in respect of earlier periods or to any other information included in the Full Data Report 2014. ― British Land’s GRI application level www.britishland.com/crdata ― Fig. 3: Cumulative like-for-like cost savings and investments (degree day adjusted) ― Fig. 4: EPRA 3.5 Total direct greenhouse gas emissions For our online Full Data Report, where you can download Excel data, please visit www.britishland.com/crdata British Land Full Data Report 2014 290 PERFORMANCE DATA TARGETS & MANAGEMENT ACTIONS REPORTING CRITERIA GRI INDEX UN GLOBAL COMPACT INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE CONTACT US INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE Continued from previous page ― Fig. 5: EPRA 3.6 Total indirect greenhouse gas emissions ― Fig. 6: EPRA 3.7 Greenhouse gas intensity from building energy ― Fig. 7: Reported footprint – Scopes 1 to 3 ― Fig. 9: Reported Scope 1 and 2 intensity (degree day adjusted) ― Fig. 10: Landlord influenced like-for-like Scope 1 and 2 (degree day adjusted) ― Fig. 11: EPRA 3.1 Purchased electricity use ― Fig. 13: EPRA 3.3 Energy consumption from fuels ― Fig. 14: Landlord influenced like-for-like energy use (degree day adjusted) ― Fig. 15: Office energy use ― Fig. 16: Retail energy use ― Fig. 21: EPRA 3.4 Energy intensity – floor area ― Fig. 23: Landlord influenced like-for-like energy intensity – floor area (degree day adjusted) ― Fig. 24: Energy intensity – floor area (degree day adjusted) ― Fig. 26: Energy Performance Certificate ratings – whole buildings ― Fig. 27: Energy Performance Certificate ratings – occupier demises ― Fig. 35: Waste management – developments ― Fig. 51: Community investment beneficiaries ― Fig. 53: Community contributions through planning ― Fig. 67: Staff turnover – rates ― Fig. 68: Median salary and remuneration For our online Full Data Report, where you can download Excel data, please visit www.britishland.com/crdata British Land Full Data Report 2014 291 PERFORMANCE DATA TARGETS & MANAGEMENT ACTIONS REPORTING CRITERIA GRI INDEX UN GLOBAL COMPACT INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE CONTACT US INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE Continued from previous page ― Fig. 69: Staff diversity – gender ― Fig. 81: Accidents – managed portfolio ― Fig. 83: Reportable accidents – British Land own occupied space ― Fig. 86: Health and safety – developments. We assessed the Selected Information using British Land’s Reporting Criteria as set out at www.britishland.com/crdata and the GRI G3.1 Guidelines at: www.globalreporting.org/resourcelibrary/ G3.1Sustainability-Reporting-Guidelines.pdf PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS APPLIED AND LEVEL OF ASSURANCE We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 – ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions information, with reference to the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 ‘Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements’ (ISAE 3410), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. OUR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL We applied the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) Code of Ethics, which includes independence and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. We apply the International Standard on Quality Control (UK&I) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent and multi-disciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.

The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques. The nature, methods and precision used to determine non-financial information can result in materially different measurements, affecting comparability between entities and over time. The Reporting Criteria used for the reporting of the Selected Information are as at 31 March 2014. WORK DONE Considering the risk of material misstatement of the Selected Information, we: ― Made enquiries of British Land’s management, including the Corporate Responsibility (CR) team and those with responsibility for CR management and group CR reporting; ― Evaluated the design of the key structures, systems, processes and controls for managing, recording and reporting the Selected Information. This included visiting five sites, selected on the basis of their inherent risk and materiality to the group, to understand the key processes and controls for reporting site performance data to the group CR team; ― Performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Selected Information at corporate Head Office and in relation to a limited number of sites to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported; ― With respect to the developments carbon footprint data disclosed in Fig 7 in the FDR, we evaluated the methodology and basis of the independent valuation of the developments carbon footprint, but did not test in detail the underlying calculation models and assumptions; ― With respect to data on Energy Performance Certificates disclosed in Figs 26 and 27 in the FDR, we have examined underlying reports produced by external consultants and engineers, but have not tested in detail the underlying calculation models and assumptions; For our online Full Data Report, where you can download Excel data, please visit www.britishland.com/crdata British Land Full Data Report 2014 293 PERFORMANCE DATA TARGETS & MANAGEMENT ACTIONS REPORTING CRITERIA GRI INDEX UN GLOBAL COMPACT INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE CONTACT US INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE Continued from previous page ― Assessed the GRI Index on British Land’s website www.britishland.com/crdata for compliance with the GRI application level requirements for B+; and ― Assessed the disclosure and presentation of the Selected Information.
