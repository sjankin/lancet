Date: Saturday, June 29, 2014 To our stakeholders ICT Alliance supports the ten principles of the Global Compact with respect to human rights, labor standards, environment and anti-corruption. We have also recommended these principles to our joint venture companies, and sister concerns. Similar to most of the developing countries our operation in South Asia is not out of context of corruption, human rights violation etc. Since they exist both in public and private sectors (in majority of the organizations), it is up to independent companies like ICT Alliance to stick to the right ways while conducting business, creating robust internal and external operational systems and processes that can help promote the principles. ICT Alliance has consistently followed several policies, supporting the ten principles of the Global Compact, right from the company’s inception. We would like to further confirm our continued support to these important values by being a member of Global compact. Towards our continuous commitment to build a greener world, we changed our company logo in a greener theme.
