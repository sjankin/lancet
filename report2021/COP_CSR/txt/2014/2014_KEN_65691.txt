Our CSR Policy states “PKF Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda prides itself in having a deep heritage of operating at the highest level of integrity . We have a strong commitment to responsible business practices and recognise the importance of balancing the interests of all our key stakeholders – employees, clients and the communities in which we work with.” Our CSR Policy revolves around four pillars: 1. The Workplace This involves all activities which uphold the wellbeing of employees within the workplace by incorporating work practices such as workforce diversity, work-life balance, health and safety, training etc. 2. The Marketplace We implement our policy by engaging in fair, ethical and responsible business practices in the marketplace. 3. The Community We offer support for community initiatives and institutions involved in community work and communal concerns by providing either or both financial and non-financial assistance. 4. The Environment We advocate for good environmental practices and engaging in environmentally friendly practices at the firm, with clients, corporate partners and the general public. The above pillars guide our approach to the Global Compact Principles on Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti–Corruption. Our Submission This communication of progress (COP) highlights practical actions the firm has taken to implement the Global Compact principles in each of the four issue areas: Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption in 2013. 5 UNGC Communication on Progress 2014 PKF Kenya recognizes that Human Rights are an integral part of corporate citizenship and we respect and support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The first two principles of the UN Global Compact, which are derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are:  Principle 1: and  Principle 2: Implementation PKF Kenya has an established code of conduct and core values which is consequently rooted in our culture of experience, confidence and delivery. Our culture is about fostering the best values and attitudes for pursuing our business drivers. These have been defined as i) producing quality work, ii) meeting clients’ needs, iii) leading and enabling, iv) achieving financial results and v) growing the business. Below are the values that guide our actions: Customers We are here to please our customers-without them nothing else matters. We only succeed when our customers improve their operations by using our services. We must understand their needs, how they use our services, and how they improve their business. Buying our services is just the first step. Successful implementation and value creation must follow. Accountability We take responsibility for our decisions at the individual and firm levels. Attitude We believe that remaining positive and looking ahead are essential parts of achieving our goals. Balance We work hard and we are well-rounded employees who combine work, family, and recreation. We make time for fun, and celebrate team and firm successes together. Boldness We believe that taking calculated risks encourages growth and new discovery. Challenge We push ourselves to the limit, question boundaries, and continually advance. 6 UNGC Communication on Progress 2014 Commitment We keep our promises to clients, employees, and their families. Community We donate time, money, and resources to local charitable organizations. We build key relationships by supporting our community. Integrity We execute with integrity, holding ourselves to the highest standards of performance, accountability and personal conduct. If something doesn't work, don't ship it. If a deal isn't right, don't take it. If the numbers don't add up, find out why. Our values guide our actions and beliefs. Our values are aligned to the human rights principles. It is the personal responsibility of everyone in the firm to ensure that we put these behaviors into practice. We also have a responsibility to intervene where we see others failing to uphold them. We provide several avenues to address any issue that contravenes the code of conduct as well as use of the confidential whistle-blowing procedure. Our ethical policy is at the core of our approach to our business At PKF in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda we aim to ensure that we maintain the highest level of professional integrity with our clients, our staff, professional regulators and others with whom we interact. This means that in all our dealings we aim to exceed the regulatory standards by which we are required to operate. We take great care to ensure that client confidentiality, our objectivity and our independence are hallmarks of everything we do. We also seek to support the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) through its business practices. The core requirements of the UDHR include freedom from torture, unjustified imprisonment, unfair trial and other oppression, along with freedom of expression, religion and political or other representation. Therefore PKF Kenya will not provide support or work with businesses or organizations which:  fail to uphold basic human rights within their sphere of influence  are involved in the manufacture or transfer of armaments to oppressive regimes  are involved in the manufacture of torture equipment or other equipment that is used in the violation of human rights PKF Kenya also advocates and supports the Fundamental International Labor Organization Conventions. These are the most widely-accepted standards for minimum labour rights and cover the use of under-age or forced labour.

We have a strong commitment to responsible business practices and recognize the importance of balancing the interests of all our key stakeholders our clients, our employees, and the communities in which we work. We:  Adopt business practices that are socially and environmentally responsible with the aim of making a positive difference to the individuals and communities around us.  Invest in the well-being of the community we live and work by initiating or supporting efforts in, environmental management and protection, upholding the standards and development of the profession, improving the lives of disadvantaged persons and community development.  Encourage our staff, clients and associates to individually and collectively adopt and implement an active and positive attitude towards Corporate Social Responsibility. Our CSR activities are primarily led by the staff through office CSR Committees with all planned activities review by the PKF Foundation. The PKF Foundation was set up to support the CSR activities of the firm. At PKF we have long recognized that local businesses and local communities are inextricably linked. The firm plays an active role in contributing to society through both financial support and through enabling our people to take part in activities organised by the firm as well as supporting them in their own initiatives. We encourage all of our people to take part in charitable and voluntary activities as we recognise that this strengthens our bond with the communities in which we work. PKF Kenya’s work in the community is supported by our CSR Policy. We strive to be a leader in corporate social accountability. Our CSR activities revolved around the four pillars of our CSR matrix: workplace, marketplace, environment and community. These focus on upholding the wellbeing of employees within the workplace. We do this by:  Investing in building our own offices which are planned with the insight to provide a comfortable working environment with Kalamu Houses in Nairobi, Kenya and in Kampala, Uganda.  Provision of training programs to staff for their professional development. 8 UNGC Communication on Progress 2014  Provision of a gym in the office premises to enhance employees’ wellness.

Our main and core purpose is creating and sustaining supportive relationships where objective and timely advice enables our clients to thrive, develop and succeed by advising the management of developing private and public businesses. We have done this by: i. Providing information to our clients and the general public through seminars.  National Budget Seminars In 2013, we provided an opportunity for our clients to voice their concerns and suggestions to the Ministry of Finance for consideration while preparing the National Budget for the 2013/2014 financial year. We held two budget seminars: One was for our clients to voice their opinions and suggestions of what the Ministry of Finance should consider when preparing the budget. The second seminar was to provide our clients and the general public with the content and implications of the budget that had been presented by the Ministry of Finance. In our mandate as key stakeholders in the economy, we also held a pre-budget briefing where as a firm we projected the Firms’ expectations and suggestions to the Ministry of Finance for input into the national budget. ii. We contribute to the improved efficiency and competitiveness of other companies and sectors by supporting initiatives that reward excellence in various sectors.  PKF Kenya was the Judging Process Partner at several Awards; Banking Awards, Insurance Awards and Capital Markets Awards 2013.
