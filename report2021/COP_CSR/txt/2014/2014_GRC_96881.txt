Nearly 70% of the world’s population will live in towns and cities by 2050. An increase of such scale will mean increased needs in transportations and infrastructure, accommodation, as well as energy efficiency and use of natural resources. These challenges are at the heart of our business. To address them we are developing products and solutions and adapting our production methods, to respond to market needs and take into account sustainability imperatives. Alongside our partners, we are today a major contributor towards developing enhanced urban environments with innovative solutions and higherperformance products for constructions. 1 sustainable construction p.24 and cities 2 SUSTAINaBLE SUPPLY CHAIN p.26 Thessaloniki, Nea Paralia.

In the first place, this entails reducing our carbon emissions and conserving our planet’s limited raw materials by reusing resources: our target is to increase the proportion of alternative fuels that we use, such as household refuse and agricultural waste (biomass), reaching a level of 20% of alternative fuels in our fuel mix by 2015 and 40% by 2020. As well as reducing our environmental footprint, this policy enables us to generate economic activity that is beneficial for local economies and also helps to improve the competitiveness of our plants. We are also working intently on water management and preservation of biodiversity in our quarries, developing biodiversity enhancement plans often in partnership with universities and research institutions. 1 energy consumption p.32 and resource management 2 Co2 and other Emissions p.35 3 biodiversity p.38 4 water p.40 View of our Milaki cement plant.
