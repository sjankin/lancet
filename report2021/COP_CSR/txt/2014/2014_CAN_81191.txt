Barrick Gold Corporation UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2013/2014 Barrick has long been committed to the principles articulated in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). We have been proud signatories to this international voluntary initiative since 2005. Barrick continues to integrate best practices in human rights, labour standards, environment and anticorruption into its culture and day-to-day operations. For the past five years, Barrick has been ranked as a world leader in social and environmental responsibility by the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, and has been part of the North America listing since 2007. The following Communication on Progress provides an overview of Barrick’s 2013 key achievements and objectives for 2014, aligned with the UNGC principles and the indicators corresponding with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. As Barrick is a member of the International Council on Mining &; Metals (ICMM), we have also linked this annual update with ICMM’s Sustainable Development principles. I hope you will find this Communication on Progress informative and I invite you to view the Barrick website, annual Responsibility Reports and Beyond Borders stakeholder publications for further detailed information on our commitment to corporate social responsibility and the principles of the UNGC.
