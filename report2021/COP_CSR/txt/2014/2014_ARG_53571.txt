which finds us happy to know that we have chosen the right path in terms of sustainability. Increasingly, our sustainability management is more visible and connected to the organization´s strategy, probably for three major reasons. Firstly, our integration as a global company feeds us with latest developments and put us at the forefront in this subject. Globally, we are one of the organizations that have decided to join the Integrated Report pilot programme that points the future way of corporate reporting. Secondly, the vocation to make sustainability a cross-discipline connects even more intensely the operations with the sustainable development strategy. Thirdly, our sustainability model and the organization´s overall strategy gives us a framework that allows to measure impacts and results of our management. We have a great opportunity and responsibility to generate impact in our clients, flex workers, employees and communities from our experience in the world of employment. That is why our sustainability model is focused on five relevant aspects over we have set some milestones. In terms of our customers’ programme, The best workforce for our clients”, we can realise an improvement in satisfaction levels compared with the previous year. With relation to our flex workers´ programme, “The best job for candidates”, we have achieved key goals such as the reduction of the accident rate, which continues to fall every year, besides achieving about 90% of employees with a positive view of their working experience with Randstad. Regarding our programme related to communities, Expertise for a better society , our flagship programme “Crop Nurseries” received recognition by the Global Compact Secretariat for Responsible Investment, ranking the programme as one of the 50 outstanding initiatives among all the signatories of the Global Compact. These results lead us to renew our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact. With regard to our employees, our programme The employer of choice for our employees achieved the most important result: a substantial improvement on employees’ satisfaction on the internal climate survey. This shows maturity and flexibility of our employees because in a year of great challenges, such as the rebranding, we were able to achieve an improvement with the feeling of belonging to the company. In terms of progress on aspects of sustainability basics, we took a step forward with our suppliers’ commitment. We know that this is a great challenge but based on dialogue and good management systems we will succeed in getting our spirit of sustainable development to all our value chain. This sustainability model will lead us to reach our long-term visions, identified as vision 2020 throughout the report. Andrea Avila. Executive Director 4 corporate social report 2012 randstad Sustainability letter Our 2012 corporate social report includes some aspects which hopefully will help to explain our stakeholders how we have built it. Our sustainability model, with the definition of the most relevant topics can be found in the Randstad’s value creation model section, and in section Mechanisms of dialogue with stakeholders we show how we have tried to carry forward the necessary dialogues to understand our responsibilities and impacts. To describe the impacts, challenges and opportunities we have introduced at the beginning of each section a brief of our management approaches for each of our programmes, summarising the most relevant aspects. Each of these sections are described like this: In this way we can provide clarity to our approach and appraise our management.

Sustainability basics 14 corporate social report 2012 randstad All stakeholders We can only promote the interests of the groups with whom we interact if we know them well. Accordingly, it will allow us to build a relationship of mutual trust, which is reinforced by providing quality services and supporting the interests of our environment, both inside and outside the company limits. Dialogue mechanisms with stakeholders Stakeholders to engage are selected by the Executive Management and the Sustainable Development area based on: (a) experience achieved in management and in the preparation of the three previous reports on the GRI framework, (b) strategic interests and (c) the Randstad’s global sustainability framework. Each of the stakeholders of our organization is closely related with one of the strategic pillars of our sustainability model. The Sustainable Development area is responsible for verifying and encouraging that dialogue mechanisms are taking place with stakeholders in order to strengthen its connections with the organization. Major players in 2012 were: flex workers, employees, managers, directors, customers, government actors and civil society. Moreover, the Human Capital area was responsible for dialogue with internal staff while the Commercial area focused its actions on developing programmes for clients and flex workers to maintain close contact with them. To measure and assess the development of relations with stakeholders, the Marketing area conducted surveys among customers and internal staff.

Anyone can arrange a meeting, send an e-mail to a / Manager or Director/a without reporting to his/her direct superior, or ask for special permits. Managing by walking around : promote the visit and walk through the working premises and visit desks of each employee, to facilitate informal dialogue with staff.

In areas where Crop Nurseries have been active, 100% of the children of field workers have maintained their levels of attendance during the harvest season. In addition, parents resulted not concerned about where to leave their children when go to work and can focus on their jobs throughout the day, increasing their productivity. This project was one of the 50 finalists for the Global Compact’s Pioneer Awards, a global competition on principles of social investment projects that reviewed projects of various organizations around the world (http://p4si.org/).

Suppliers We like to do what we say at our entire value chain, this is why we not just invite our suppliers to join our sustainability initiatives, but providing signs of commitment. Our suppliers must explicitly adhere our code of ethics at registration as suppliers on our website, where they must answer certain questions related to Corporate Social Responsibility as they provide us information to determine their level of commitment. 100% of our suppliers are subject to our providers’ obligations control mechanism and they have signed our code of ethics. The acceptance of the code of ethics is part of the supplier registration form. Mechanisms to safeguard our core Responsible supply Limit environmental values, business chain footprint principles and good management Environmental footprint Our Green Office provides staff’s education on responsible consumption of natural and energy resources, promoting the same message in schools in the form of workshops delivered by our volunteers and collection programmes as Ecopapel, among others. Ecopapel In mid-2012, we implemented a programme that consists of optimizing the use and recycling of paper. Under the considerable amount of printing, a paper recycling mechanism was put in place. Thus, we consider that a large percentage of the printed paper and not used for business purposes, is possible to recycle for newer needs. The objective is to continue strengthening this practice and promote awareness of rational use of paper in each of the members of the company. 50 corporate social report 2012 randstad By 2013 we will develop a control scheme that allows us to quantify the results of the implemented project and get regular checks. The idea is to carry out a documented mechanism for quarterly monitoring the progress of the progress of the project and / or possible errors.
