Page 4/14 Presentation of results Anti-discrimination and human rights: The aim is to make sure that there is an even number of men and women within the company. The chart shows the number of women as a percentage of the total number of company employees. andand Anti discrimination Anti-discrimination Human Human Right Rights Womenininthe Women the company company 100% 80% 60% 40% 61% 63% 20% 0% 2012 2013 Overview for 2013 Stable results: 63% for 2013 as compared to 61% for 2012 The entities whose main activities incorporate inc Language Services and Content and Document D Management, anagement, have significantly exceeded their target value. In entities which incorporate Consultancy and System Integration and management departments (euSA euMS), euMS women are less represented (the level of female staff varies between 25 and 40%). Target value for 2014 : 60% Trend in 2014 The target value has been maintained, however consideration must be given to ensure a balance is established in all entities and departments; the percentage of female staff is on the increase while the percentage of male staff decreases year on year. During the first half of the year, this trend has been confirmed, the percentage of female personnel has risen to 65%. This figure re will be adjusted when the new employees in the field of Professional Services are taken into account. The level of importance of this indicator can be questioned. Page 5/14 Training: The aim is to enhance employees' skills by way of training. The chart shows the number of actual training hours as a percentage of the planned number of hours.

For 2014, it was decided to focus on a more representative indicator: ratio of training hours in relation to the number of hours worked, with a target of 2%. Target value for 2014 : 2% Trend in 2014 The result for the first half of the year is 1%. Depending on the results at the end of the year, the target value may be re-adjusted, adjusted, or measures can be put in place to improve performance.

Good progress in the entities which did not carry out assessments in 2012. However, the level has to be maintained in 2014. Target value for 2014 : 100% Trend in 2014 At the end of June, the figure was 54%, well below the level recorded this time last year. In previous years, most assessments were carried out in the first quarter of the year. Page 7/14 Occupational health & safety: The aim here is to reduce the number of days lost to sick leave.

Page 8/14 2 Environmental principles The following principles are covered: Environmental Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally-friendly environmentally technologies. Policy and goals euroscript aims to be recognized as an organization that is transparent and ethical in all its dealings, as well as a company which provides a positive contribution to the community in which it operates. This is reflected reflected in the ‘Planet’ section of its CSR|SD Policy, which focuses on high standards in all matters regarding environmental protection. euroscript wishes to actively contribute to preventing global warming by reducing the company’s environmental impact. In orderorder to do this, euroscript seeks to minimize its gas emissions, reduce energy consumption and promote green purchasing. Implementation and measurement of outcomes Although our business sector does is not defined as a ‘polluting industry’, a group-wide group investigation has been started to check the existing hardware and eventually replace it by environmentally-friendly friendly hardware. We have invested in equipment and licenses for organizing video and telephone conferences, limiting business travel and thereby reducing our carbon footprint. Page 9/14 CO2 footprint: The aim here is to reduce the company's carbon footprint. The chart shows the CO2 emissions generated during g business travel. CO2 footprint 300 000 267 112 273 114 250 000 200 000 2012 2013 Overview for 2013 Overall, a slight increase of 2% in CO2 consumption, despite a marked decrease in most entities. However, a significant increase in euBA, euHU and euRO as a result of the company reorganisation and the various trips undertaken. Target value for 2014 : 3% reduction compared to last year. Trend in 2014 The trend for the first half of the year is in line with expectations, however this indicator is no longer representative in view of the numerous trips undertaken as part of the reorganisation and restructuring of the company. Page 10/14 Energy consumption: Here, the aim is to reduce energy consumption. The measurement used concerns electricity consumption in KWh. Energy consumption 2 000 000 1 929 118 1 904 546 1 900 000 1 800 000 2012 2013 Overview for 2013 The decrease in energy consumption has been effective (1%), but did not reach the desired target (3%). This figure is hard to measure in certain entities due to the lack of clear invoicing. However, it remains stable in most entities; euRO, euR , euPL and euCA have witnessed a sharp increase in electricity use. This indicator is closely linked to the number of employees and the number of offices opened; in 2014, it would be more realistic to analyse analy electricity consumption per person. Target value for 2014 : Not defined, at present only an overview of the situation. Trend in 2014 Once again, it has been difficult to obtain complete and reliable data. The calculation as made last year has been abandoned due to a change in scope. Results broken down per individual are difficult to interpret and compare for each entity as they are influenced by local parameters (various employees working for clients, server centres, etc.); however, this indicator will be retained until the end of the year for in-depth in depth analysis and pending a decision on a more representative indicator for 2015. Page 11/14 Ecological purchases: Green purchasing: The aim here is to encourage green purchasing. The chart shows the amount of recycled paper purchased in relation to the total amount of paper purchased (in kg). Overview for 2013 Ecological paper purchases are commonplace in Luxembourg and France. This is not the case in other countries. Target value for 2014 : > 80% Trend in 2014 Positive trend since the start of 2014 rate at 90% Page 12/14 3 Anti-corruption corruption principles and sustainability Turnover: The aim is to secure the company's long-term long term future. This is measured by calculating actual turnover against predicted turnover. Turnover 100% 80% 60% 96% 95% 40% 20% 0% 2012 2013 Overview for 2013 The results are similar to those for last year Target value for 2014 : > 100% Trend in 2014 The trend for the first half of 2014 (48%) is close to the target (objective of 50% by mid-year) mid Page 13/14 Incident management: The aim here is to bolster the implementation of the 10 principles in the UNGC.
