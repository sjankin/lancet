Other statutory information (a) Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were made-out, the Directors took reasonable steps: (i) to ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing-off of bad debts and the making of provision for doubtful debts and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written-off and that adequate provisions had been made for doubtful debts; and (ii) to ensure that any current assets which were unlikely to realise their values as shown in the accounting records in the ordinary course of business had been written-down to an amount which they might be expected so to realise. (b) At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances which would render: (i) the amount written-off for bad debts or the amount of the provision for doubtful debts, in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, inadequate to any substantial extent; and (ii) the values attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading.

(d) At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances not otherwise dealt with in this report or financial statements of the Group and of the Company which would render any amount stated in the financial statements misleading. (e) As at the date of this report, there does not exist: (i) any charge on the assets of the Group or of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year which secures the liabilities of any other person; or (ii) any material contingent liability of the Group or of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year.

Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgement, including the assessment of risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2013 and of their financial performance and cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act, 1965 in Malaysia.

DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 85 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 1. Corporate Information The Company is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia, and is listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”). The principal place of business is located at Lot 10, Jalan Delima 1/1, Subang Hi-Tech Industrial Park, 40000 Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan. The immediate and ultimate holding companies are Telenor Asia Pte Ltd and Telenor ASA, incorporated in Singapore and Norway respectively. The ultimate holding company is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange, Norway. The principal activity of the Company is investment holding. The principal activities of the subsidiaries are stated in Note 13. There have been no significant changes in the nature of the principal activities during the financial year. 2. Significant Accounting Policies (a) Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (“MFRS”), International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and the requirements of the Companies Act, 1965 in Malaysia. At the beginning of the current financial year, the Group and the Company adopted new and revised MFRSs which are mandatory for the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 as described fully in Note 3(a). The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared on the historical cost convention unless otherwise indicated in the accounting policies below. The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (“RM’000”) except when otherwise indicated. (b) Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the reporting date. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. The Company controls an investee if and only if the Company has all the following: (i) Power over the investee (i.e existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); (ii) Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its investment with the investee; and (iii) The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 86 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (b) Basis of consolidation (cont’d.) When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, the Company considers the following in assessing whether or not the Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power over the investee: (i) The size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders; (ii) Potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties; (iii) Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and (iv) Any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings. Subsidiaries are consolidated when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance. Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. The resulting difference is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company. When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interest, is recognised in profit or loss. The subsidiary’s cumulative gain or loss which has been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss or where applicable, transferred directly to retained earnings. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date control is lost is regarded as the cost on initial recognition of the investment. Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree. The Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Transaction costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 87 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (b) Basis of consolidation (cont’d.) Business combinations (cont’d.) Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance with MFRS 139 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it will not be remeasured. Subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. In instances where the contingent consideration does not fall within the scope of MFRS 139, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate MFRS. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss. (c) Investment in subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has all the following: (i) Power over the investee (i.e existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); (ii) Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its investment with the investee; and (iii) The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. In the Company’s separate financial statements, investment in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment losses. On disposal of such investments, the difference between net disposal proceeds and their carrying amounts is included in profit or loss. (d) Property, plant and equipment All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and equipment, except for freehold land and capital work-in-progress, are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost of an item includes expenditure that is attributable to the acquisition of the item. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively. The carrying amount of the replaced part is then derecognised. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the asset as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit and loss as incurred. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 88 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (d) Property, plant and equipment (cont’d.) Freehold land has an unlimited useful life and is therefore not depreciated. Capital work-in-progress representing assets under construction, is also not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for its intended use. Depreciation of other property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis to write-down the cost of each asset to its residual value over the estimated useful life, at the following annual rates or periods: Freehold buildings 2.0% Leasehold land and buildings 30 to 99 years Motor vehicles 20.0% Computer systems 20.0% 33.3% Furniture and fittings 20.0% Telecommunications network 3.3% 33.3% The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year-end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate, to ensure that the amount, method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising from the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the net carrying amount is recognised in profit and loss in the year the asset is derecognised. (e) Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least during each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated prospectively as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in profit and loss. Intangible assets not-yet-available for use are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired either individually or at the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) level. Such intangible assets are not amortised. Any gain or loss arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognised in profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 89 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (e) Intangible assets (cont’d.) (i) 3G spectrum Expenditure for the acquisition of the 3G spectrum are capitalised under intangible assets. The amount is amortised using the straight-line method over the shorter of the asset’s estimated useful life or remaining spectrum period up to 1 April 2018. (ii) Computer software Costs incurred to acquire computer software, that are not an integral part of the related hardware, are capitalised as intangible assets and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of three years. (iii) License fee License fees are capitalised and amortised over the period of the licenses. The license fees had been fully-amortised in the financial year ended 31 December 2009. (f) Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, impairment is measured by comparing the carrying amounts of the assets with their recoverable amounts. For intangible assets not-yet-available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at the end of each reporting period, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired either individually or at the CGU level. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, namely a CGU. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is written-down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of a CGU or groups of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to those units or groups of units, if any and then, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit or groups of units on a pro-rata basis. An impairment is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, and the impairment loss is recognised as an expense in profit and loss in the period in which it arises. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed if, and only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised previously. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 90 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (g) Inventories Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average basis. The cost of trading merchandise comprises costs of purchases and other incidental costs incurred in bringing these merchandise to their present condition and location. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. (h) Financial assets Financial assets are recognised in the statements of financial position when, and only when, the Group and the Company become a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. Financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired. On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss. Regular-way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the market place concerned. All regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised or derecognised on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Group and the Company commit to purchase or sell the asset. The Group and the Company classify their financial assets in the following categories at fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables, as appropriate. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. (i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading purposes or are designated as such upon initial recognition. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss Derivatives embedded in host contracts, if any, are accounted for as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with any gain or loss arising from changes in fair value being recognised in profit and loss. Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 91 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (h) Financial assets (cont’d.) (ii) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit and loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. (i) Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occured after the initial recognition of the assets, i.e. an incurred loss event, and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets of the Group and the Company, that can be reliably estimated. Trade and other receivables and other financial assets carried at amortised cost To determine whether there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets has been incurred, the Group considers factors such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or significant delay in payments. For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis based on similar risk characteristics. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables include the Group’s past experience of collecting debts, and reduced collection rates for specific ageing buckets. If any such evidence exists, the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable becomes uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. The amount of reversal is recognised in profit or loss. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 92 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (j) Provision for liabilities Provisions for liabilities are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability to the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. (i) Customer loyalty programme Customer loyalty programme-related costs are provided based on management’s best estimate on the amount of incentives realisable by the customers based on the past trend of customers’ usage and utilisation. (ii) Employee leave entitlements Employees’ entitlement to annual leave are recognised when the associated services performed by employees increase their entitlements to annual leave. A provision is made for the estimated liability for the annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period netted-off against annual leave utilised to-date. (iii) Site decommissioning and restoration costs Provision for site decommissioning and restoration costs is in respect of management’s best estimate on the costs necessary to be incurred to decommission the Group’s telecommunications network infrastructure and restore the previously-occupied sites. The estimated amount is determined after taking into consideration the time value of money, and the initial estimated sum is capitalised as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. (iv) Defined benefit plan Provision for defined benefit plan for eligible employees is as disclosed in Note 2(n)(iii). (k) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 93 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (k) Financial liabilities (cont’d.) A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is extinguished. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss. Financial assets and financial liabilities are off-set and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to off-set the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilites at fair value through profit or loss, or other financial liabilities, as appropriate in the statement of financial position, according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability. Management determines the classification of financial liabilites of the Group and the Company upon initial recognition. (i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading purposes and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit and loss. Financial liabilites are classified as held for trading purposes if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the nearterm. This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria. Derivative liabilities are initially measured at fair value and subsequently stated at fair value, with any resultant gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. (ii) Other financial liabilities The Group’s other financial liabilities include trade and other payables, and loans and borrowings. Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method Loans and borrowings are initially measured at fair value, and are subseqently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised in profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs are recognised in profit and loss as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that the Group incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. For other financial liabilities, gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 94 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (l) Share capital and share issuance expenses An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group and the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Ordinary shares are an equity instrument. Ordinary shares are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental transaction costs. Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are declared. (m) Leases Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Any initial direct costs are also added to the amount capitalised. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to profit or loss. Contingent rents, if any, are charged as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. All other leases where a significant portion of risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Leased assets are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease term. Operating lease payments, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are recognised as an expense in profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in which termination takes place. (n) Employee benefits (i) Short-term benefits Wages, salaries, bonuses and social security contributions are recognised as an expense in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees. Short-term accumulated compensated absences such as paid annual leave are recognised when services are rendered by employees that increase their entitlement to future compensated absences netted-off against annual leave utilised to-date, and short-term non-accumulating compensated absences such as sick leave are recognised when the absences occur. Where payment or settlement is deferred and the effect would be material, these amounts are discounted to their present value. (ii) Defined contribution plan As required by law, companies in Malaysia make contributions to the state-defined contribution pension scheme known as the Employee Provident Fund, and will have no legal or constructive obligation to make further contributions in the future, over-and-above what is existingly legally-required. The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit and loss in the period which the related services are rendered by employees.

(iii) Defined benefit plan The Group operates an unfunded defined benefit plan for its eligible employees. The benefits are calculated based on the length of service and the agreed percentages of eligible employees’ salaries over the period of their employment and are payable upon resignation after completion of the minimum employment period of ten years or upon retirement age of 60 years. The Group’s obligations under the retirement benefit scheme, calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method, is determined based on actuarial computations by independent actuaries, through which the amount of benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years is estimated. That benefit is discounted in order to determine its present value. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss over the expected average remaining working lives of the eligible employees when the cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains or losses for the retirement benefit scheme exceed 10% of the higher of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets. Past service costs are recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the amended benefits become vested. The amount recognised in the statement of financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations adjusted for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and unrecognised past service costs, and reduced by the fair value of plan assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the net total of any unrecognised actuarial losses and past service costs, and the present value of any economic benefits in the form of refunds or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Gains or losses on the curtailment of a defined benefit plan will be recognised when the curtailment occurs. The gains or losses would comprise any resulting change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation and any related actuarial gains and losses and past service costs that had not previously been recognised. The Group amended the defined benefit plan effective 1 January 2006 to restrict new entrants into the plan, and the benefits payable to be calculated based on the employees’ length of service up to 31 December 2005. (iv) Share-based payment The Group operates a scheme to award its eligible employees with the Company’s shares. The eligible employees, who have served for more than ten years, are entitled to a certain number of shares which are directly acquired under the employees’ names in the open market. The maximum entitlement of this benefit is capped to a certain amount as determined by the Group. The transactions are recorded as share-based cash-settled transactions, and the expense recognised under this scheme is determined by-way of reference to the number of employees qualifying for the scheme, the number of shares entitled and the market price of the shares; the total of which is capped at the maximum entitlement during the financial year. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 96 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (o) Income taxes (i) Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Current taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. (ii) Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purpose. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are off-set, if a legally enforceable right exists to set-off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. (p) Contingencies A contingent liability or asset is a possible obligation or asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future event(s) not wholly within the control of the Group. Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised in the financial statements. (q) Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sales of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s business activities, net of discounts and service taxes. The Group recognises revenue when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of the revenue can be measured reliably. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 97 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (q) Revenue recognition (cont’d.) (i) Telecommunication revenue Revenue relating to provision of telecommunications and related services are recognised net of rebates and discounts upon the transfer of risks and rewards when goods are delivered and services are performed. Revenue from prepaid services that have been sold to customers but where services have not been rendered at the reporting date is deferred. Revenue from sale of device is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership of the device have been passed to the customer, usually on delivery and acceptance of the device. (ii) Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis that reflects the effective yield on the asset. (iii) Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s and the Company’s right to receive payment is established. (r) Government grants As a universal service provider (“USP”), the Group is entitled to claim certain qualified expenses from the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (“SKMM”) in relation to USP projects. These claims are treated as government grants and recognised at their fair values where there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions. A grant relating to asset is recognised as income over the life of the depreciable assets by way of a reduced depreciation charge. Grant relating to income is recognised in profit and loss by crediting directly against the related expense. (s) Foreign currency transactions (i) Functional and presentation currency The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in RM, which is also the functional currency of all entities in the Group. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 98 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (s) Foreign currency transactions (cont’d.) (ii) Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are initially converted into RM at exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction. At each reporting date, foreign currency monetary items are translated into RM at exchange rates ruling at that date. Non-monetary items initially denominated in foreign currencies, which are carried at historical cost are translated using the historical rate as of the date of acquisition. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the reporting date are recognised in profit or loss. Exchange differences arising on the translation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for the differences arising on the translation of nonmonetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. Exchange differences arising from such non-monetary items are also recognised directly in equity. (t) Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each reporting date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 28(f). Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: (i) In the principal market for the asset or liability; or (ii) In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 99 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 2.

Changes in Accounting Policies (a) Adoption of new and revised MFRSs The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows: On 1 January 2013, the Group and the Company adopted the following new and amended MFRSs and IC Interpretations mandatory for annual financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. Effective for annual periods beginning Description on or after Amendments to MFRS 101: Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 1 July 2012 MFRS 3: Business Combinations (IFRS 3 Business Combinations issued by IASB in March 2004) 1 January 2013 MFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2013 MFRS 11: Joint Arrangements 1 January 2013 MFRS 12: Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2013 MFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement 1 January 2013 MFRS 119: Employee Benefits (IAS 19 as amended by IASB in June 2011) 1 January 2013 MFRS 127: Separate Financial Statements (IAS 27 as amended by IASB in May 2011) 1 January 2013 MFRS 127: Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (IAS 27 as revised by IASB in December 2003) 1 January 2013 MFRS 128: Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (IAS 28 as amended by IASB in May 2011) 1 January 2013 Amendments to MFRS 1: Government Loans 1 January 2013 Annual Improvements 2009-2011 Cycle 1 January 2013 Amendments to MFRS 7: Disclosure Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2013 Amendments to MFRS 10, MFRS 11 and MFRS 12: Consolidated Financial Statements, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: Transition Guidance 1 January 2013 DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 100 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 3. Changes in Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (a) Adoption of new and revised MFRSs (cont’d.) The adoption of the above standards and interpretations did not have any significant effect on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company except as discussed below: MFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement MFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under MFRS for all fair value measurements. MFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under MFRS. MFRS 13 defines fair value as an exit price. As a result of the guidance in MFRS 13, the Group re-assessed its policies for measuring fair values, in particular, its valuation inputs such as non-performance risk for fair value measurement of liabilities. MFRS 13 also requires additional disclosures. Application of MFRS 13 has not materiality impacted the fair value measurement of the Group. Additional disclosures where required, are provided in Note 28(h). (b) Standards issued but not yet effective The standards and interpretations that are issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s and the Company’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group and the Company intend to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective. Effective for annual periods beginning Description on or after Amendments to MFRS 10, MFRS 12 and MFRS 127: Investment Entities 1 January 2014 Amendments to MFRS 132: Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2014 Amendments to MFRS 136: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets 1 January 2014 Amendments to MFRS 139: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting 1 January 2014 IC Interpretation 21: Levies 1 January 2014 Amendments to MFRS 119: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions 1 July 2014 Annual Improvements to MFRSs 2010–2012 Cycle 1 July 2014 Annual Improvements to MFRSs 2011–2013 Cycle 1 July 2014 MFRS 9: Financial Instruments (IFRS 9 issued by IASB in November 2009) To be announced MFRS 9: Financial Instruments (IFRS 9 issued by IASB in October 2010) To be announced MFRS 9: Financial Instruments: Hedge Accounting and amendments to MFRS 9, MFRS 7 and MFRS 139 To be announced The directors expect that the adoption of the above standards and interpretations will have no material impact on the financial statements in the period of initial application except as discussed below: DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 101 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 3. Changes in Accounting Policies (cont’d.) (b) Standards issued but not yet effective (cont’d.) MFRS 9 Financial Instruments MFRS 9 reflects the first phase of work on the replacement of MFRS 139 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in MFRS 139. The standard was initially effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, but Amendments to MFRS 9: Mandatory Effective Date of MFRS 9 and Transition Disclosures, issued in March 2012, moved the mandatory effective date to 1 January 2015. Subsequently, on 14 February 2014, it was announced that the new effective date will be decided when the project is closer to completion. The adoption of the first phase of MFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets, but will not have an impact on classification and measurements of the Group’s financial liabilities. The Group will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when the final standard including all phases is issued. 4. Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty There were no significant judgements made in applying the accounting policies of the Group which may have significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. Management makes key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. The following represents a summary of the critical accounting estimates and the associated key sources of estimation uncertainty: (a) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets Depreciation and amortisation are based on management’s estimates of the future estimated average useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Estimates may change due to technological developments, modernisation initiatives, expected level of usage, competition, market conditions and other factors, which could potentially impact the estimated average useful lives and the residual values of these assets. This may result in future changes in the estimated useful lives and in the depreciation or amortisation expenses. A 5.0% difference in the expected useful lives of these assets from management’s estimates would result in approximately 2.3% (2012: 4.9%) variance in the Group’s profit for the year. (b) Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment on all non-financial assets at each reporting date. Nonfinancial assets are tested for impairment when indications of potential impairment exist. Indicators of impairment which could trigger an impairment review include evidence of obsolescence or physical damage, significant fall in market values, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the use of assets or the strategy of the business, significant adverse industry or economic changes. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 102 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 4. Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty (cont’d.) (b) Impairment of non-financial assets (cont’d.) Recoverable amounts of assets are based on management’s estimates and assumptions of the net realisable value, cash flows arising from the future operating performance and revenue-generating capacity of the assets and CGUs, and future market conditions. Changes in circumstances may lead to changes in estimates and assumptions, and may change the recoverable amounts of assets and impairment losses needed. (c) Impairment of loans and receivables The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. To determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment, the Group considers factors such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or significant reduction in collection rates. Where there is objective evidence of impairment, the amount and timing of future cash flows are estimated based on historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other receivables at the reporting date are disclosed in Note 15. If the present value of estimated future cash flows varies by 5.0% from management’s estimates, the Group’s allowance for impairment will cause either a 0.1% (2012: 0.1%) increase or 0.1% (2012: 0.2%) decrease respectively in the Group’s profit for the year. (d) Deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax implications arising from the changes in corporate income tax rates are measured with reference to the estimated realisation and settlement of temporary differences in the future periods in which the tax rates are expected to apply, based on the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. While management’s estimates on the realisation and settlement of temporary differences are based on the available information at the reporting date, changes in business strategy, future operating performance and other factors could potentially impact on the actual timing and amount of temporary differences realised and settled. Any difference between the actual amount and the estimated amount would be recognised in profit and loss in the period in which actual realisation and settlement occurs. 5.

At the reporting date, 20% (2012: 30%) of the Group’s trade receivables were past due but not impaired. These relate mostly to corporate customers with slower repayment patterns, for whom there is no history of default.

Derivative Financial Instruments (cont’d.) The above foreign currency forward contracts were entered into by the Group to minimise its exposure to foreign currency risks as a result of transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional currency, arising from the normal business activities. These contracts are not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges, and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposure and fair value changes exposure. Such derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. Foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge certain payables denominated in USD for which firm commitments existed at the reporting date, extending to January 2014. During the financial year, the Group recognised a gain of RM811,000 (2012: a loss of RM151,000) arising from fair value changes of derivative financial instruments. The fair value changes are attributable to changes in foreign exchange spot and forward rates respectively. The method and assumptions applied in determining the fair values of derivatives are disclosed in Note 28(f)(iv). 17.

Financial Instruments (a) Financial risk management objectives and policies In the normal course of conducting its business activities, the Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks, which include credit, foreign currency, liquidity and interest rate risks. The Group’s overall risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. (b) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counter-party default on its obligations. The Group’s credit risk arises in the normal course of business primarily with respect to trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Credit risk is managed through formalised policies on credit assessment and approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures. Deposits are placed only with or only entered into with reputable licensed banks and unit trust funds, if any. The maximum credit risk exposure in respect of trade receivables is limited to the carrying amount of the receivables less allowance for impairment, whereas the maximum exposure for other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents are the reported carrying values in the financial statements. Information regarding trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, and past due but not impaired, are disclosed in Note 15. At the reporting date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 124 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 28. Financial Instruments (cont’d.) (c) Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional currency, arising from the normal business activities. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the USD and SDR. Although approximately 20% (2012: 18%) of the Group’s total expenses are denominated in the above-mentioned foreign currencies, the settlements of these payables are on a net basis, together with revenues earned from the same operators and partners. The Group also holds cash and cash equivalents denominated in USD for working capital purposes. At the reporting date, the Group’s foreign-denominated cash and cash equivalents is disclosed in Note 17. Exposure to foreign currency risk is monitored on an on-going basis and when considered necessary, the Group will consider using effective financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency risk in accordance with its foreign currency hedging policy. In line with the Group’s foreign currency hedging policy, hedging is only considered for firm commitments and highly probable transactions of which hedging shall not exceed 100% of the net exposure value. Speculative activities are strictly prohibited. The Group adopts a layered approach to hedging, where a higher percentage of hedging will be executed for closer-dated exposures and with time, increase the hedge as the probability of the underlying exposure increases. These derivatives and their underlying exposures will be monitored on an on-going basis. The Group’s foreign currency forward contracts are executed only with credit-worthy financial institutions in Malaysia which are governed by appropriate policies and procedures. The cash requirement for settling these foreign currency forward contracts is solely from the Group’s working capital. Details of the Group’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of hedging certain payables denominated in USD for which firm commitments existed at the reporting date, extending to January 2014, are disclosed in Note 16. The effects of changes in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments have already been included in the financial statements during the financial year. Management believes that there is no reasonably possible fluctuation in the foreign exchange rate which would cause any material effect to the Group’s profit for the year. (d) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due to shortage of funds. The Group monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by management, for working capital purposes and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The Group invests only in highly liquid cash management funds, if any. The Group has remaining revolving credit and floating-rate term loan facilities with an aggregate nominal value of up to RM300.0 million (2012: RM700.0 million) as an alternative source of financing which can be executed as and when required. The Group’s trade and other payables and non-hedging derivative liabilities at the reporting date, are short-term in nature, and are payable either on-demand or within one year. Details of respective maturities for the Group’s loans and borrowings are as disclosed in Note 18. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 125 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2013 28. Financial Instruments (cont’d.) (e) Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the deposit placements and interest-bearing financial liabilities. The Group manages its interest rate risk for the interest-earning deposit placements by placing such balances on varying maturities and interest rate terms. The Group’s policy in dealing with interest-bearing financial liabilities is to minimise the interest expense by obtaining the most favourable interest rates available. A difference of 20 (2012: 20) basis points in interest rates applicable for the Group’s entire loans and borrowings (excluding finance lease obligation) would result in approximately 0.5% (2012: 0.8%) variance in the Group’s profit for the year. (f) Fair values The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values of the following classes of financial instruments: (i) Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments. (ii) Trade and other receivables and payables The carrying amounts approximate their fair values because these are subject to normal credit terms and are shortterm in nature. (iii) Loans and borrowings The carrying amounts of the current portion of loans and borrowings are reasonable approximations of fair values due to the insignificant impact of discounting. The carrying amounts of SFRTL are reasonable approximations of fair values as they are floating rate instruments that are re-priced to market interest rates on or near the reporting date. The fair values of non-current portion of loans and borrowings are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at market incremental lending rate for similar types of borrowing or leasing arrangements at the reporting date.

(ii) Where a member of the Company is an Exempt Authorised Nominee which holds ordinary shares in the Company for multiple beneficial owners in one securities account (“omnibus account”) as defined under the Securities Industry (Central Depositories) Act 1991, there shall be no limit to the number of proxies which the Exempt Authorised Nominee may appoint in respect of each omnibus account it holds. (iii) A power of attorney or certified copy thereof or the instrument appointing a proxy, shall be in writing under the hand of the appointer or his attorney duly authorised in writing, and in the case of a corporation, either under seal or under hand of an officer or attorney duly authorised. (iv) The instrument appointing a proxy or the power of attorney or a certified copy thereof must be deposited at the Company’s Share Registrar Office at Level 17, The Gardens North Tower, Mid Valley City, Lingkaran Syed Putra, 59200 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at least forty-eight (48) hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or any adjournment thereof. (B) EXPLANATORY NOTES 1. Agenda item no. 1 is meant for discussion only as the provision of Section 169(1) of the Companies Act, 1965 does not require a formal approval of shareholders for the Audited Financial Statements. Hence, this item on the Agenda is not put forward for voting. 2. Ordinary Resolution 6 proposed, if passed, will allow the Company and its subsidiaries (“Group”) to enter into recurrent related party transactions in accordance with paragraph 10.09 of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad and the necessity to convene separate general meetings from time to time to seek shareholders’ approval as and when such recurrent related party transactions occur would not arise. This would reduce substantial administrative time and expenses associated with the convening of such meetings without compromising the corporate objectives of the Group or affecting the business opportunities available to the Group. The shareholders’ mandate is subject to renewal on an annual basis. 3. In respect of Ordinary Resolution 7, the Board of Directors (“Board”) has via the Nomination Committee conducted an evaluation on the re-appointment of Dato’ Ab. Halim Bin Mohyiddin, who has served as Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company for a cumulative term of more than nine years, and recommended him to continue to act as Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company. Dato’ Ab. Halim Bin Mohyiddin fulfilled the criteria under the definition on Independent Director as stated in the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. His experience in the audit and accounting industries enables him to provide the Board with a diverse set of experience, expertise, skills and competence. As he has been with the Company for more than nine years, he therefore understands the Company’s business operations which enable him to participate actively and contribute during deliberations or discussions at Audit & Risk Committee and Board meetings without compromising his independent and objective judgement. He has contributed sufficient time and efforts and attended all the Audit & Risk Committee and Board meetings. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 142 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 LIMITED ASSURANCE STATEMENT Independent Limited Assurance Statement To The Management Of DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd We have performed limited assurance procedures in relation to DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd’s Sustainability Section in the Annual Report 2013 (‘the Report’) as detailed in the ‘Subject Matter’ below. The Management’s responsibility The Sustainability Section in the Annual Report 2013 has been prepared by the Management of DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd, which is responsible for the collection and presentation of the information it contains and for maintaining adequate records and internal controls that are designed to support the sustainability reporting process. There are currently no legally prescribed requirements relating to the preparation, publication and verification of sustainability reports. The auditor’s responsibility Our responsibility in performing our limited assurance activities is to the Management of DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd only and in accordance with the terms of reference agreed with them. We do not accept or assume any responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person or organisation. Any reliance any such third party may place on the Report is entirely at their own risk. Our review was limited to the information on the select indicators set out within the Sustainability Section in the Annual Report 2013 and our responsibility does not include: • Any work in respect of sustainability information published elsewhere on DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd’s website; • Sustainability information prior to 01 January 2013 and after 31 December 2013; and • Review of Management’s forward looking statements such as targets and intentions. Our multi-disciplinary team has the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement. Reporting criteria As a basis for the assurance engagement, the Subject Matter for assurance was verified for adherence to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G3.1) principle of accuracy and non-financial reporting guidelines applicable to the Telenor Group. We consider this reporting criterion to be relevant and appropriate to review the Report. Assurance standard used and level of assurance Our limited assurance engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with the ISAE 3000 Assurance Engagement Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information. This standard requires that we comply with the ethical requirements, and plan and perform the assurance engagement under consideration of materiality to express our conclusion with limited assurance. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 143 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 LIMITED ASSURANCE STATEMENT Assurance standard used and level of assurance (cont’d.) We have also considered the Global Reporting Initiative G3.1 (‘GRI G3.1’) reporting guidelines in conducting our limited assurance procedures. A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries and applying analytical and other limited assurance procedures. Our procedures were designed to provide a limited level of assurance and as such do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance. The procedures performed depend on the assurance practitioner’s judgement including the risk of material misstatement of the specific activity data, whether due to fraud or error. While we considered the effectiveness of Management’s internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our review was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. Subject matter The Subject Matter for our limited assurance engagement is: Statements and claims related to the following indicators for 2013 in relevance to DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd’s focus areas presented in the Report: • Empowerment through Connectivity: Number of students and teachers attending the DiGi Cybersafe Program; • Ethical and Responsible business: Number of employees signing off “Code of Conduct” policy in HRMS; • Best on people: Lost time due to injury and career development oriented training undergone by employees; and • Climate Change & Environment: Direct and indirect energy consumption, direct and indirect greenhouse gas emission, other indirect greenhouse gas emission (limited to business travel and mileage claims). What we did to form our conclusions The procedures performed aim to verify the plausibility of information. We designed our procedures in order to state whether anything has come to our attention to suggest that the Subject Matter detailed above has not been reported in accordance with the reporting criteria cited earlier. In order to form our conclusions we undertook the steps below: 1. Interviewed DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd’s executives including the Head of Communications and Corporate Responsibility who also holds responsibility for the sustainability reporting process, to understand the current status of their sustainable development agenda and activities; 2. Undertook visits to DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd’s offices; 3. Reviewed DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd’s’ processes for data collection, aggregation, analysis and quality control; 4. Reviewed selected relevant internal documents pertaining to the select indicators to assess the accuracy of reporting; 5. Reviewed draft of the Report for statements or assertions for consistency with the findings from our work; 6. Traced select relevant sources of information in line with the Telenor Group non-financial reporting guidelines, reviewed conversion factors in relation to their sources, relevance and accuracy; and 7. Obtained and reviewed evidence to support key assumptions and reasonableness in calculations and other data. DiGi.COM BERHAD (425190-X) << 144 >> ANNUAL REPORT 2013 LIMITED ASSURANCE STATEMENT The limitations of our review Our review was limited to the information on the select indicators set out within the Sustainability Section in the Annual Report 2013. The accuracy and completeness of the sustainability indicators are subject to inherent limitations given their nature and methods for determining, calculating and estimating such data. Our assurance report should therefore be read in connection with DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd’s procedures on the reporting of its sustainability performance. Our independence EY has provided independent assurance services in relation to the Sustainability Section in the Annual Report 2013. We have provided no other services relating to DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd’s approach to sustainability reporting. In conducting our assurance engagement we have met the independence requirements of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore, Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics. Our independence policies prohibit any financial interests in our clients that would or might be seen to impair independence. Each year, partners and staff are required to confirm their compliance with the firm’s policies. Observations and areas for improvement Our observations and areas for improvement will be raised in a report to DiGi Telecommunications Sdn Bhd’s Management. The focus on this report will be in addressing any identified gaps between the GRI principles for defining report content, materiality, completeness, sustainability context and stakeholder inclusiveness and those presented within the report. These observations do not affect our conclusions set out below. Conclusion Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained for the Subject Matter nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information in the Report does not comply in all material respects with the above mentioned reporting criteria.
