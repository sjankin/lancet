Over 2,700 employees took part and were engaged through various communications channels, a network of 14 voluntary water ambassadors, and an ideas competition during a series of road shows and workshops. From the 177 ideas received, 62 were implemented. The three winning ideas were:  Measures to recover energy from steam in E&P (Asset 2)  Water loss reduction in R&M (Cristian Fuel Terminal)  Water loss reduction at cooling towers in G&P (OMV Petrom City Power Plant). 40 OMV Petrom Resourcefulness Report 2013 Overview Resourcefulness Setting the standard Performance in detail Environmental and Energy Management Environmental compliance Environmental operating We carry out legal compliance monitoring Environmental expenditure and investment costs by environmental factors and audits on a systematic basis.
