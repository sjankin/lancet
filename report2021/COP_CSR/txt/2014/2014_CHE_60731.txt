We are pleased to share with you in this document the significant and concrete measures that Metalor has successfully implemented to meet the world's strictest industry legal and anticorruption requirements and ensure irreproachable business practices as well as a sustainable strong corporate ethic at all levels of the Company. f • \ Metalor's sector standards and in�iatives to combat corruption, p r e s e l e human rights and protect the environment Metalor is recognized by renowned international industry organizations for its best business practices: 1, Metalor is a member of the prestigious R esponsible J e w e l l e � C o u n c i l (RJC) The RJC is a standards-setting organization that has been established to reinforce consumer confidence in the jeweils�industry by promoting responsible ethical, human rights, social and environmental practices throughout the jewellers supply chain. The RJC has developed a common platform of standards for the jewellery supply chain and credible mechanisms for verifying responsible business practices through third pa�y auditing. Metalor commits to operating its business according to the RJC Principles and Code of Practices. In line with this policy, Metalor's commitment is to permanently integrate ethical, human rights, social and environmental considerations into our day-to-day operations' business planning activities and decision making processes. In 2010 Metalor became the first gold refiner worldwide to be audited and ce�ified by the Corporate Social Responsibility Standard of the RJC at all of the Group's refineries. In 2011� Metalor became one of the only four certified members of the RJC having successfully passed an audit which provides evidence of responsible business practices in compliance with the RJC's Code of Practices. In 2012 Metalor became the first gold refiner worldwide to be audited and certified by the RJC Chain of Custody Standard, which includes conflict-related due diligence throughout the gold supply chain. Again, in Januar 2014, Metalor successfully achieved re-ce�ification for its global Refining Group by meeting the highest ethical, social and environmental standards established by the RJC's Code of Practices (COP) Ce�ification System. At the same time, Metalor also obtained certification against the RJC Chain of Custody (CoC) Certification Standard for its newly created subsidia�in Singapore. The CoC Standard supports responsible, conflict-sensitive sourcing in supply chains vìa a chain-ofcustody through certified entities. These accomplishments represent a fu�her proof of Metalor's commitments to socially responsible business practices. Avenue du Vignoble, P.O.

Since 2003 Metalor has been a LBMA 'Good Delivery Company . The London Good Delivery List of Acceptable Refiners of gold and silver is maintained by the LBMA and lists those refineries whose gold and silver bars have been found, when originally tested, to meet the strict standard for acceptability in the London bullion market. Metalor is also one of the five worldwide referees for the LBMA and has been promoted to Ordinary Member, which represents the highest level of membership. Metalor is now able to vote on various issues deliberated upon at the Association's Annual General Meetings, nominate candidates for LBMA Committees and sponsor applications from other companies applying to become Members or Associates. Also, Metalor complies with the Responsible Gold Standard of the LBMA: Further to an independent third-party audit of our supply chain due diligence, Metalor successfully passed its Responsible Gold Audi Program for our refineries ¡n Marin ^Switzerland), North Attleboro (USA) and Hong Kong, and received the corresponding Responsible Gold Certificate from the LBMA for each of these three sites. Metalóos newly founded refinery in Singapore is also due to go through this strict process very soon. This certificate can be obtained only by companies listed on the LBMA s 'London Good Delivery List of Acceptable Refiners', which is the case for Metalor. It confirms that Metalóos business practices comply with the 'LBMA Responsible Gold Guidance', which formalizes and extends the already existing due diligence in the refining industry by incorporating a riskbased approach to avoid sourcing gold from areas subject to conflict. It is based on the Due Diligence Guidance of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) � in which Metalor took a leading role as well as on existing practices of Good Delivery refiners aimed at combating money laundering and terrorism-based financing. 3/ R JC-LBMA-EICC®-GeSI c r o s s recognition for Metalor The Group Metalor also has the recognition of the Conflict-Free Smelter (CFS) Program developed jointly by the E lectronic Industry Citizenship Coalition* and the Global Sustainability Initiative. Together with the RJC and the LBMA, these worldwide industry organizations have successfully agreed to cross recognition of their programs, audits and certifications. Metalor is now listed on the CFS Program compliant refiner list. TNs means a triple^approvallisting for all Metalor CoC Certified refineries (in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapore and the USA). � i ― All of these associations conform their standards to the OE CD Guidance and Gold Supplement, which have been recently endorsed by the United States Government.

Box 9 T+41 (0)32 720 61 11 www.metalor.com CH-2009 Neuchátel F +41 (0)32 720 66 25 lnfo@metalor.com METALOR® Metalor Technologies SA 4Z Metalor is pa�of the O E C D ' s dra�ing commi�ee Metalor, alone among gold refiners, has taken a leading role in the OE CD Gold Supplement drafting commies to create a worldwide due diligence guidance to avoid finance of conflict through gold transactions. In these e�o�s Metalor works with governments, leading NGOs and industry associations to create guidance that is strong and elective, and that has been widely endorsed. 5, Metalor is a founding member of the S w i s s Better Gold InWative The OE CD has recognized in its Gold Supplement the particular problems and concerns associated with artisanal gold mining, where many millions of ve�poor persons work, and strongly urged in its Gold Supplement that all participants work toward formalization and improvement of that sector. This initiative combines the e�ods of the governments of Peru and Switzerland, the Responsible Jewells�Council and NGO FaWrade,Fairmined, Metalor, and consumers of gold in Switzerland. Its goal is to formalize a large group of artisanal miners in Peru, with guidance and standards for improved environmental and social working conditions and operations, and to bring that gold into the formal gold industry to concerned consumers in a sustainable way. Launched in 2013 by the Swiss Be^er Gold Association (SBGA) and SECO (the State Secretariat for Economic A � s ) , the Better Gold Initiative (BGI) is an economic development partnership that creates a transparent, traceable and socially responsible value chain for certified gold from small-scale or artisanal mines to the market, whilst improving the living conditions of miners around the world. As a founding member of the Association, Metalor was the first refiner worldwide to respond to that request through the Swiss Better Gold Initiative. During a joint press conference in Bern, the Swiss Better Gold Association (SBGA) and SECO announced in October 2013 that certified gold was delivered to Switzerland for the first time thanks to the Better Gold Initiative. This project is considered by the government of Switzerland to be a pa�of its humanitarian e�ods in developing countries. 6, Metalor's refineries directly satisfy the S E C (US SecurWes and Exchange Commission) fules The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed that manufacturers can meet US conflict gold requirements by sourcing gold through refiners who have been ce�ified by OECD-consistent industry groups, conflict-free designation programs, such as the RJC, LBMA and CFS program. Metalor's gold refineries directly satisfy the SEC rule. Above and beyond these formal approvals, Metalor is reputed to be the leading gold refiner worldwide for�s constant e�o�s on conflict gold and improvement of artisanal mining.

BA��(Business Alliance for Secure Commerce) is an international business alliance, created to promote secure international trade in cooperation with governments and international organizations. The BASC was created to address the problem of concealing contraband in commercial trade. The BASC program examines the entire process of manufacturing and shipping of merchandise�om foreign countries to the United States, emphasizing the creation of a more security-conscious environment throughout the supply chain. Human rights Metalor's ethical sourcing Metalor has been highly active participant in the gold industry's development of responsible supply chains in the light of the provisions of Dodd Frank on conflict minerals. Metalor does not knowingly source any gold from any conflict or higher risk area, but has been fully supporting the development of multi stakeholder standards for the responsible sourcing of minerals from conflict or higher risk areas. Metalor Group ensures that gold is sourced from legitimate sources and remains committed to responsible and ethical sourcing. 2, Metalor is a major pawner of the Unicef As pa�of our Corporate Social Responsibility program, Metalor has decided to engage with Unicef as a long-term sponsor as�om 2014.

Labor 1/ Staff recruitment and management Metalor employs ¡ts staff primarily in developed economies with well-established labor regimes and practices. All locations have handbooks that regulate the employment policies and practices, in line as a minimum with local labor laws. Metalor staff comprises mainly experienced and skilled labor and cannot retain such staff if practices are not at least h line with the market standards. The Group monitors staff turnover in each of its locations and exit interviews are conducted by managers independent of the departing employees' line management. Any unusual elevation in turnover is a reason for investigation. 21 Health and Safety Health and Safety at work is a strategic priority for Metalor. �he Çroup has designed and implemented a full and effective Health and Safety policy, involving both significant investment and a training program for all staff on Metalor s i t around the world, with the key aim of continuous improvement to reach the zero^accident objective. Metalor^s Health and Safety policy includes compliance with the regulations of each country (and not just that of the Group). ^etalor has successfully developed a strong Health and Safety culture through targeted internal communication actions and tools, and regular exercises designed to strengthen team spirit around Health and Safety. The combination of the two strategies (training and capital expenditures to improve equipment), constant and comprehensive communication on lessons learned and specific continuous improvement actions have yielded an improvement of the safety records, as the accident severity rate has been divided by 7 compared to 2010, the accident frequency mte has been divided by 5 within the past 3 years and the number of work-related accidents has been halved in 2013. Metalor s safety awareness program called Safètyfirst has been Safetyfirst deployed worldwide at every level of the Group. Avenue du Vignoble, P.O.

Also, all Metalor sites in the world use state of the art production technologies and processes in full compliance with the highest environmental standards. 1/ Metalor protects the environment Metalor s Board of Directors and E xecutive Committee meet regularly in order to review, anticipate and mitigate any potential environmental risks associated with the Group's 3Ct¡VÍt¡6S. Through specific actions across all of its sites, such as the installation of the latest equipment and the training and involvement of staff, Metalor continually works hard to optimize ¡ts use of natural resources, like air and water, and avoid pollution throughout its industrial processes. For example, on the Marin site in Switzerland alone, Metalor has invested nearly 3 million CHF ¡n recent months in order to limit the Impact of�activities on the environment by replacing and installing the following equipment: 1/ Improve the air environment conditions at the smelting plant This new equipment has enabled us to reduce our environmental impact by trapping smaller particles using more efficient membranes. E nergy recovery techniques will also help to reduce our energy footprint. 2/ Improve the handling of emergency situations (in the event of gas leaks or other incidents] To ensure the safety of our production facilities, which are essentially used for our chemical activities, a network of safety controllers (similar to an electronic brain) has been put in place, coordinated by a main safety controller which has the same function as a control tower in an airport. In the event of an unexpected occurrence, whether gas is detected or another incident, this control tower receives information and ensures that the other controllers secure all the activities in progress on the production lines (valves closed, ventilation shut down, etc.). This enables us to evacuate everyone in the workshops in a proactive, efficient manner. 3/ Replacement of cold-water cooling towers The cold-water cooling towers in the production fäcilkies have been replaced, which has led to a substantial optimization of energy consumption. 4/ Production process monitoring A SCADA system (Supervisory Control and Data Acquis�ion) has been installed. This system enables real-time remote monitoring and operation of all technical equipment (production facilities, infrastructure and safety). The system acquires data points and specific values fbr the equipment (temperatures, levels, pressure, valve positions, alarms, etc.), enabling continuous data logging. Avenue du Vignoble, P.O.

Moreover, Metalor uses 100% recycled Cyclus paper, as recommended by the ^ ^ F � for large-scale print runs, and encourages its sta�to reduce printing at workin addition, Metalor has just replaced all its printers in Switzerland with environmentallyfriendly models. Having employees to use their badge to print prevents printed documents being forgo�en about, and double-sided printing in black and white is mandato��with outgoing faxes being sent directly from computers via the network, while incoming faxes are always received in digital format. These changes have led to a 25% reduction in paper and toner consumption. Launch of Metalor Green Gold Program Metalor is ve�committed to social and environmental responsibility and has built its corporate culture on these values. Over the last couple of years, Metalor has been proactively involved in not only becoming the largest multisite gold refine�in the world, but also in becoming known and considered as the most committed green refine�in the world. This has been a transnational internal e��achieved by employees in all the areas of the Company, with the common objective of maintaining our global leadership role in ethical, human rights, social and environmental standards. This justified and required the creation of a specific logo and slogan, and the e�o�s made by the Company to demonstrate its social responsibility to the world, have been received enthusiastically by all customers around the world. Behind this logo there is the weight of all Metalor's certifications and involvement in several prestigious organizations that care about being responsible toward the world we live in. Currently Metalor is being considered as a reliable source of Green Gold by its business pawners. This logo and slogan highlight the Group's corporate values and position Metalor as 3 responsible refining company. o�� * Ag � K s a ^ � 4 &�� �RWining Q O �A20158742 � NETWT R*ftpon»l • R »sp«n»lbl< FINENESS Refining �Refining SCS Responsible Source' Certified Product Metalor s Green Gold h4etalor Responsible Refining and Green Silver logo Green gold packaging label Avenue du Vignoble* P.O.
