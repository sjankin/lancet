KAITEKI signifies a sustainable condition which is comfortable not only for people, but also for society and the Earth. MCHC is proposing the concept of KAITEKI to stakeholders all over the world. Implementation of KAITEKI Management These days, companies are requested to take action to resolve global problems such as climate change, resource and energy depletion, shortages of food and water resources, and destruction of ecosystems. In this setting, we need to think about a new management approach that isn’t focused on only economic benefit. MCHC has adopted an approach called “KAITEKI Management” to realize KAITEKI. It is a management approach to enhancing corporate value based on three types of management. Two of them, Management of Economics (MOE) and Management of Three Axes Technology (MOT), have been traditionally emphasized. MOE promotes in to optimize capital efficiency within our company, and MOT strives to create innovations for society. And the third management approach, ManageKAITEKI Management ment of Sustainability (MOS), has a new perspective and aims to improve the sustainability of people, society and the Earth. Humanity faces a lot of environmental KAITEKI Management is unique, and we call the value created from the and social issues in the 21st century. three kinds of management “KAITEKI Value.” We believe that enhancing We promote KAITEKI Management KAITEKI Value will lead to the realization of KAITEKI. We promote this through which we aim to contribute to management approach aiming to generate revenue and develop ourselves solving these issues. sustainably while contributing to solving environmental and social issues as a company.

Group Philosophy Basic Approach to Social Responsibility We believe that our corporate social responsibility is to pursue the realization of KAITEKI by meeting the demands of people, society, and the Earth through our corporate activities. To fulfill our social responsibility as the MCHC Group, following the principles of the MCHC Group Charter of Corporate Behavior, which is a basis of our corporate activity for improving sustainability, we are promoting and strengthening initiatives related to awareness and responsibility, accountability and transparency, legal compliance, valuing stakeholders, respecting human rights, employment and labor, and fair business practices. In May 2006, we declared our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact, which consists of 10 principles regarding human rights, labour standards, the environment, and anti-corruption, and we’re conducting our corporate activities based on these principles. In addition, the basic philosophy of ISO 26000, which was launched in November 2010, is also reflected in our corporate activities as a whole. As well as this, MCHC is building up harmonious relationships with all our stakeholders through dialogues.

In our role as the KAITEKI Company, we are taking the initiative in realizing KAITEKI throughout the world. President & Chief Executive Officer Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation Yoshimitsu Kobayashi Fiscal 2012 Results During fiscal 2012, the Japanese economy showed signs of recovery, against the backdrop of rising demand associated with reconstruction after the Great East Japan Earthquake as well as the positive effects of monetary policy. All in all, however, the economy stopped short of a full-scale recovery,as exports remained stagnant due to the deceleration of the world economy. With respect to the business environment surrounding the MCHC Group, business conditions for the Performance Products and Industrial Materials domains remained difficult. This was mainly due to the stagnant state of demand from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and other foreign countries caused by the deceleration of the world economy, and the strong yen that persisted throughout the latter half of the third quarter. Meanwhile, the Health Care domain continued to perform favorably in general thanks to robust market demand, although it was affected by the market expansion of generic pharmaceuticals and by the National Health Insurance (NHI) drug price revision implemented in April 2012. As a result, our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2012 were as follows: Net sales decreased 3.7% compared to the previous fiscal year, to ¥3,088.5 billion. Operating income was down 30.9%, to ¥90.2 billion, and net income decreased 47.6%, to ¥18.5 billion. The effects of monetary and financial policies are likely to boost domestic demand gradually, and therefore the Japanese economy is expected to show a gradual recovery as well. We anticipate earnings growth in the Group’s businesses due to a correction of the strong yen and enhanced cost-reduction efforts, as well as a recovery of demand and sales expansion, mainly in the Performance Products domain. Taking into account the unification of depreciation methods and accounting periods, we are expecting increases in net sales and operating income of ¥143.0 billion and ¥20.0 billion, respectively. As a result, we forecast net sales of ¥3,570.0 billion, operating income of ¥158.0 billion, and net income of ¥51.0 billion. Step 2 of the APTSIS 15 Medium-term Management Plan: Achievement Toward Our Goals We express our fundamental policy under APTSIS 15, the Group’s medium-term management plan covering fiscal 2011–2015, as “Grow, Innovate, and Leap Ahead by Orchestrating the Group’s Strengths.” The plan’s strategy for enhancing our management practices is based on bolstering the Group’s combined power by generating synergies between our four core operating companies, improving our financial position, and continuing the reform of our business structure. Our efforts to expand growth include accelerating the shift 6 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation to high-performance/high-value-added businesses, promoting operations that contribute to realizing a sustainable society, developing new medicines to fulfill unmet medical needs, and pursuing global expansion, as well as cultivating Growth Driver Businesses in anticipation of future demand. We are also moving forward with a multilayered approach of strategic investment in alliances and acquisitions, in order to achieve a “leap ahead” in growth in the shortest time necessary. Based upon these same basic policies and strategies, in fiscal 2012 we engaged in thorough cost reductions, a reexamination of capital expenditures, asset streamlining, business restructuring (such as the decommissioning of Mitsubishi Chemical’s Kashima Plant’s No. 1 naphtha cracker), and strategic investment (such as the acquisition of Qualicaps Co., Ltd.). We also appointed Mission Coordinators to handle a crossfunctional Group strategy among the five core businesses (healthcare solutions, polymer processing and information/electronics, water treatment systems and services, carbon fiber and composite materials, and specialty chemicals), through which we can anticipate bringing the combined power of the Group into play. We have focused our strength on providing a structure for integrating the functions of the Group companies. On the other hand, the fact is that all segments, with the exception of Health Care, posted income substantially below their original targets, owing to the difficult operating environment. Taking this into consideration, in March 2013 we made adjustments to the plan for the three-year period from fiscal 2013 forward, resetting the targets for the plan’s final year. While our business management method was based on product life cycles and business growth potential and profitability, for Step 2 of APTSIS 15 we implemented three types of Growth Models—Stable Businesses, Growth Driver Businesses, and Volatile Businesses—that take into account profit structure volatility. Each of the Group’s businesses is classified by Growth Model in order to make an optimum resource allocation to the businesses according to the characteristics of each model. I feel certain that by conducting business in this way, we are sure to achieve our APTSIS 15 Step 2 goals. Solid and Stable Dividends The Group’s basic policy toward shareholder returns is “Enhance shareholder value by improving corporate value.” We are targeting a medium-term payout ratio of at least 30%, with emphasis on stable dividends and maintaining a balance between keeping sufficient internal reserves to fund business development and paying consolidated results-based dividends. Taking our policy described above under consideration, for fiscal 2012 we paid interim and year-end dividends of ¥6 per share, for a total of ¥12 per share for the year. In the upcoming fiscal year, as well, we plan to pay interim and year-end dividends of ¥6 per share, for an annual dividend of ¥12 per share. Progress Toward Realizing KAITEKI We are practicing KAITEKI Management that includes consideration of the time elements in Management of Economics (MOE), Management of Technology (MOT), and Management of Sustainability (MOS), and we are also making progress toward further growth through the achievement of self-driven results improvement that are not swayed by changes in the economy. We are focusing all of our efforts on our goals of realizing sustainable development of society, affluent and vibrant lives for people, and coexistence with the planet. I would once again like to request the continued support of each of our stakeholders. President & Chief Executive Officer Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation Yoshimitsu Kobayashi Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 7 Interview with the President The President Discusses KAITEKI As the KAITEKI Company, we aim to put into practice management codependent on Mother Earth. Q Until now, the Group has published an annual report and a CSR report separately, but with this edition it has combined those two reports, resulting in KAITEKI Report 2013. Please tell us about the progress and effect of KAITEKI Management to which the report’s title refers. A We have defined the basic concepts of KAITEKI Management within the company, and in order to maximize KAITEKI Value we will henceforth revise the MOS indexes and create MOT indexes, so as to ensure the concept takes root deeply. Moreover, in addition to the three axes for management of achieved a score of 188 for the year under review.

Also, can you outline the plans for Step 2, which unfolds over the plan’s final three years? A While we are adhering firmly to the basic policies and strategies of APTSIS 15, we have revised targets and business management methods within Step 2 to create a more solid vision of our future.

A We are investing to strengthen and expand our Stable Businesses and Growth Driver Businesses, and enhance their globalization, with a focus on the Performance Products and Health Care domains. We are expanding our high-value-added solutions and nearals business value chain. In addition to purchasing Qualifinal products businesses globally.

A The goal of the company and the determination of management is contributing to sustainable society by maximizing KAITEKI Value while achieving better returns, which is the objective of our business activities. By 2025 we intend to reap great benefits in all of the Growth Driver Businesses in which we are currently engaged. The global market will further expand, shifting from the rapid growth we currently see in the PRC and India to an expansion of the African market. Companies seek to profit by creating value, but that is not the whole story. A company is where each individual as an employee contributes to society, and an integrated chemical company like the MCHC Group provides many opportunities to generate manifold value. By delivering KAITEKI Value, which we create for many people in the expanding global market, we are contributing to make our society further sustainable in the 21st century. That is our determination in executing KAITEKI Management, and it also constitutes the significance of the Group’s existence. We will continue to strive toward these goals. Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 11 Special Feature Mission Coordinators are creating synergies beyond company boundaries To promote further cooperation and synergies within the Group, in April 2012 MCHC appointed four core operating companies’ presidents as Mission Coordinators. In this special feature, we introduce the Mission Coordinators and their synergy units’ basic strategies.

Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 25 Management of Technology 3 Continued Growth Supported by R&D R&D is a principal of MOT, one of the three axes of KAITEKI Management. We continuously pursue innovation as it is the driving force behind the continued growth of the MCHC Group, and contributes to the realization of KAITEKI. Basic R&D Policy We aim to maximize KAITEKI Value, or MCHC corporate value, by focusing R&D targets on our three decision criteria for corporate activities, sustainability Green , health, and comfort, and through our triple combination of R&D strategy with business strategy and intellectual property (IP) strategy. Based on our strengths of molecular design, function creation, further value addition, processing and device technologies, and an R&D system consisting of approximately 4,500 people across the Group, and leveragManagement strategy ing partnerships with industries, universities and governments from a Business IP strategy Joint strategy global perspective, we maintain a high Implementation level of competitiveness and are able Joint R&D strategy to achieve quick results.

Group From R&D to product launch Basic IP Strategy As globalization of the economy continues with markets expanding and becoming more complex, the MCHC Group believes that to realize synergies between each of its companies and achieve further growth, it is vital to increase the value of its patents, know-how, brands, and other accumulated intellectual capital, and leverage it strategically. For this reason, we plan and implement IP strategy for each of our businesses, considering what kind of IP situation we want to realize in order to increase revenues and what kind of technologies that business should produce. When implementing IP strategy, we also work to ensure legal protection and the active use of IP, respecting the validity of third-party IP rights while taking appropriate measures in cases where our IP rights are infringed. 26 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation Performance in Fiscal 2012 Performance Products Health Care • In June 2012, Mitsubishi Chemical achieved longer life and greater • In June 2012, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma received manufacturing efficiency for organic light emitting diode (OLED) lighting using a and sales approval in Japan for Tenelia to be used in the treatment wet process. of type-2 diabetes. • In July 2012, Mitsubishi Rayon developed a space-saving, energy• In March 2013, manufacturing and sales approval in the United efficient new hollow-fiber membrane, Sterapore, for purifying States was given for TA-7284, developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe municipal and industrial wastewater by filtering and separating Pharma and licensed to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to be used processed water and activated sludge. in the treatment of type-2 diabetes. • In September 2012, Mitsubishi Chemical made progress with the • In January 2013, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma received manufacturdevelopment of organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules, achieving a ing and sales approval in Europe for MCI-196 (BindRen) to be used world record of 11.7% conversion efficiency for organic thin-film in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. single cells. • In February 2013, Mitsubishi Chemical Medience developed a • In October 2012, Mitsubishi Chemical developed tuning/dimming highly sensitive analytical method for detecting darbepoetin alfa in type OLED lighting panels with boosted brightness and power efhuman urine by means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass ficiency and launched sales through Mitsubishi Kagaku Media. spectrometry for doping control. • In January 2013, Mitsubishi Plastics developed the world’s longest industrial carbon roller, together with Sunray Koki K.K., which will make a great contribution to industrial efficiency on production Industrial Materials • In March 2013, Mitsubishi Chemical succeeded in making translines for films, paper, and other products through its superior staparent continuous sheets of cellulose nanofibers in joint research ble rotation capacities. with Oji Holdings Corporation, and decided to produce and start the • In February 2013, Mitsubishi Plastics developed a zeolite catalyst supply of samples. for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, which uses urea to chemically reduce and detoxify nitrogen oxide (NOx) contained in exhaust gases. Quantitative Progress Management through MOT Indexes As science and technology become more complicated and advanced, to achieve its goals in a steady and timely manner MCHC has implemented three indexes for the quantitative progress management of MOT: the R&D index, the IP index, and the Market index. These indexes will be trialed in fiscal 2013 on some research themes and from fiscal 2014 we plan to expand the themes in Growth Driver Businesses and Stable Businesses.

(TKI), in April 2009, with the belief that it is crucial to have a long-term view of the future. TKI has four main missions—1) collect and analyze information pertaining to the future and identify major societal challenges that could represent opportunities for the MCHC Group in 2030 and beyond, 2) based on the findings, formulate future business concepts and plans for commercialization and propose them to the MCHC Group, 3) partner with experts around Europe Asia the world to promote cutting edge research for key technoloInformation network North America Japan gies supporting the proposed businesses, and 4) communicate the message of KAITEKI to the world and pursue the realization of KAITEKI for all the earth’s inhabitants.

Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 27 Management of Sustainability 3 MOS (Management of Sustainability) Toward the realization of KAITEKI, we have developed MOS Indexes in order to visualize MOS as we aim to improve sustainability for people, society, and the Earth and monitor progress and results. MOS Indexes MOS Indexes include elements based on the decision criteria for MCHC corporate activities—sustainability green , health, and comfort—chosen for their importance to the Group as a whole and their contribution to sustainability. They cover such issues as reduction of environmental impact, sustainable use of resources, reduction of energy usage, promotion of good health, and contribution to more comfortable lives. S-1 Contribute to reducing environmental impact through products and services S-1-1 Reduce environmental impact by 30% from fiscal 2005 levels S-1-2 Generate reduction of CO2 emissions by 3.5 megatons through products S-2 Take actions against the depletion of natural resources and implement energy-saving initiatives Three Indexes Sustainability S-2-1 Procure reusable materials equivalent to 10,000 t/y of heavy oil Green S-2-2 Reduce cumulative rare metal usage by 1,200 tons through improving processes and innovating products The MCHC Group vigorously pursues Index S-2-3 Generate resources and power savings of ¥8.8 billion sustainability, and as such has S-2-4 Provide 900 million tons of reusable water through our products developed three Management of S-3 Contribute to solving social and environmental issues Sustainability (MOS) Indexes— through supply chain management Sustainability Green , Health, and S-3-1 Achieve 80% of purchased items surveyed for toxic substances Comfort— the decision criteria for S-3-2 Achieve 90% purchasing of raw materials and packaging according to CSR guidelines its corporate activities.

When creating the MOS Indexes, we started by identifying index candidates while considering how we could contribute to solving such environmental and social issues as climate change and an aging society. At the same time, we conducted a close survey of the Group’s 69 business units and organized the results into a business group map. Following that, we compared our index candidates against our operations and produced proposals. We extensively discussed what we should emphasize and ways of monitoring, incorporating external opinions into the discussion. We then gathered data for our proposed indexes, revising them based on repeated simulations before receiving approval for what are our current MOS Indexes at the MCHC Management Committee. In our medium-term management plan, APTSIS 15, which started in April 2011 and will run until March 2016, these MOS Indexes were incorporated into management targets. MOS Indexes KAITEKI in 20–50 years pointing at 2025 Ubiquitous information network Aspirations of 2025 Preventive healthcare Progressive social infrastructure Conversion to renewable resources/society Medical care for aging society Discuss Enhanced function of clothing, index candidates food, and shelter Minimization of environmental impact Personalized medical care Sustainability Comfort Health 〔Green〕 Link indexes to businesses MCHC Business Groups MOS Progress In 2011, MCHC started its medium-term management plan, APTSIS 15, in which the MOS Indexes have been used as important management indexes to monitor progress with KAITEKI activities of the Group as a whole. In APTSIS 15 Step 2 review, the MOS Indexes were revised and advanced. Specifically, some of the targets were adjusted to meet changes in the business environment and new items were added related to improving customer satisfaction and other issues, to better reflect social trends and stakeholder expectations. (For more details, please see “MOS Progress at a Glance” on pages 30–31.) We set our goal of achieving a total of 300 points—comprising 96 points for the Sustainability Green Index, 111 points for the Health Index, and 93 points for the Comfort Index—as a target for fiscal 2015 and a means of assessing progress. The results feed back into improvements of the next fiscal Progress of MOS Indexes 300 year’s activities.

Overall, however, exports were sluggish due to a slowdown in the global economy, and as a result of this and other factors, a full-scale recovery was not reached. The Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Group faced a difficult business environment in fiscal 2012. Demand in PRC and other overseas markets was sluggish due to the global economic slowdown and the appreciation of the yen, which continued nearly to the end of the third quarter. These factors created especially difficult conditions for the Performance Products domain (Electronics Applications Segment and Designed Materials Segment) and the Industrial Materials domain (Chemicals Segment and Polymers Segment). On the other hand, despite the unfavorable impact of National Health Insurance (NHI) drug price revisions in April 2012 and the influence of the expansion of the generic drug market, steady demand had a favorable effect on the Health Care domain (Health Care Segment). In the fiscal year under review, the Group worked to reinforce its comprehensive strengths in accordance with APTSIS 15, its five-year medium-term management plan. For example, we took steps to advance the formulation and execution of Groupwide strategies in five business areas that extend across organizational boundaries — healthcare solutions, polymer processing and information & electronics, water treatment systems and services, carbon fiber and composite materials, and specialty chemicals. Specifically, we appointed the presidents of the core operating companies as mission coordinators. In this way, we accelerated the process of developing overall Group synergies. Further, in a rapidly changing business environment, we took steps to accelerate business restructuring, such as liquidating or withdrawing from unprofitable operations. Moreover, the entire Group worked to implement a range of policies to improve profits, such as rigorously reducing costs, reevaluating capital expenditures, and implementing asset reductions. As a result of these factors, the Group's net sales for the fiscal year under review decreased by ¥119.5 billion, or 3.7% compared to previous year, to ¥3,088.5 billion. This decline was principally attributable to sluggish demand in the Performance Products and Industrial Materials domains. Operating income declined by ¥40.3 billion, or 30.9%, to ¥90.2 billion. Net income was down by ¥16.8 billion, or 47.6%, to ¥18.5 billion. These declines were primarily attributable to a significant reduction in the difference between the prices of raw materials and the prices of finished products in the Industrial Materials domain. Results of Net Sales and Operating Income Net sales decreased ¥119.5 billion, or 3.7% compared to previous year, to ¥3,088.5 billion, as the Performance Operations Products and Industrial Materials domains faced weak demand. In the Industrial Materials domain, there was a significant reduction in the difference between the prices of raw materials and the prices of finished products. Due primarily to this factor, operating income declined by ¥40.3 billion, or 30.9%, to ¥90.2 billion. The operating margin was 2.9%, down from 4.0% a year earlier.

Combined, these income sources were ¥1.7 billion higher than in the previous fiscal year, largely because of higher dividend income. Interest expense was ¥15.0 billion, ¥700 million lower than a year earlier. Consequently, net financial expenses thus declined ¥2.4 billion to ¥4.0 billion. Equity in earnings of affiliates was ¥3.2 billion, down ¥11.6 billion. MCHC posted ¥8.1 billion in gains on foreign exchange, an increase of ¥5.8 billion from a year earlier. Other income included gain on sales of investment securities, net of ¥8.1 billion. Other expenses included impairment loss of ¥7.2 billion. As a result of these factors, income before income taxes and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries was ¥82.9 billion, down ¥44.5 billion. Income Taxes, Minority Interests in Income, and Net Income Current income taxes were ¥43.5 billion, and deferred income taxes were (¥3.3 billion), resulting in income taxes of ¥40.1 billion. The effective tax rate after applying tax-effect accounting was 48.4%, or 10.4 percentage points higher than the statutory tax rate. This was largely due to the influence of losses recorded at a company that does not apply tax-effect accounting. Minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries were ¥24.1 billion, down ¥14.6 billion. As a result of these factors, net income was ¥18.5 billion, down ¥16.8 billion from the previous fiscal year. Results by Industry Segment Electronic Applications In recording media, net sales significantly decreased due to DVD market shrinkage and a decline in sales volumes in external hard disk drives. In information and electronics-related materials, net sales continued favorably in general due to an increase in sales volumes in display materials and phosphors for LEDs. In imaging supplies, net sales decreased substantially due to a decline in unit sales of organic photo conductor (OPC) drums, toners, and chemical toners, which are printing materials for office equipment. As a result of these factors, net sales in this segment decreased by ¥15.5 billion, or 11.7%, to ¥118.1 billion. Operating results improved by ¥264 million, resulting in an operating loss of ¥5.0 billion. Major initiatives  Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation and Pioneer Corporation have successfully achieved a level of light efficiency and life spans sufficient for practical use for their organic light emitting diode elements using a coating process for the light-emitting layer in addition to the under layer. The two companies have also agreed to set up a testing facility with an eye to establishing mass production technology. (June 2012)  Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation announced the launch of a new color tunable/dimmable organic light emitting diode (OLED) panel VELVE, which is an OLED element that employs the coating process for the under layer.

Both companies agreed to strengthen cooperation in the future. (January 2013) 40 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 5 Designed Materials In food ingredients, business continued favorably. In battery materials, net sales significantly decreased due to a decrease in sales volumes associated with the end of substitute shipment caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the downward trend of sales pricing. In fine chemicals, net sales increased due to continued strong sales in coating materials for automobiles and others and to Chuo Rika Kogyo Corporation becoming a consolidated subsidiary in December 2011. In polymer processing products, net sales remained unchanged, as a significant increase in sales volumes of films for flat panel displays and favorable sales of films for touch panel displays were offset by sluggish overseas demand for non-optical polyester films and engineering plastics related products, as well as a piping business transfer in December 2012. In composite materials, alumina fibers continued favorably, although net sales of carbon fibers decreased due to lowering market prices brought by a decline in demand. In inorganic chemicals, despite an overall downturn in demand, net sales remained unchanged because a substantial decline in sales volume had been recorded in the previous year due to the Great East Japan Earthquake. In fibers, net sales decreased due to a decrease in sales volumes. Net sales in this segment decreased by ¥10.1 billion, or 1.5%, to ¥689.7 billion. Operating income decreased by ¥3.1 billion, or 12.1%, to ¥22.5 billion. Major initiatives  Mitsubishi Rayon Co., Ltd. and Toyota Tsusho Corporation announced their agreement on a joint investment into Fengxin JDL Environmental Protection, Ltd.

Ltd., a major supplier of small boilers for industrial use in Japan, to create new water treatment businesses such as operation and maintenance (O&M) of total water treatment systems. (February 2013) 6 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 41 Health Care In the pharmaceutical business, net sales increased due to the contribution of new products such as Simponi, anti-rheumatoid arthritis, Tetrabik, a combined vaccine, in addition to expanded sales of Remicade, an anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody, despite an expanding impact of generic drugs and NHI drug price revisions in April 2012. In diagnostic reagents and instruments and clinical testing, net sales decreased due to a sales decrease in the drug discovery support business. Net sales in this segment increased by ¥11.8 billion, or 2.4%, to ¥514.3 billion. Operating income decreased by ¥1.4 billion, or 2.0%, to ¥74.9 billion, due partly to a sales decrease in the drug discovery support business, in addition to the unfavorable impact of NHI drug price revisions. Major initiatives  Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation announced that VIVUS obtained NDA approval in the US for TA-1790, which Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma developed as a therapy for erectile dysfunction. Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma licensed VIVUS worldwide rights, except for Japan and certain parts of Asia, to develop and market the compound.

TA-7284 was discovered by Tanabe Seiyaku Ltd. (present Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation), and was licensed out to Janssen Pharmaceuticals. (March 2013) Chemicals The production volume of ethylene, a basic raw material of petrochemicals, increased by 16.3% to 1.13 million tons primarily due to the fact that the ethylene production facilities at the Kashima Plant of Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation stopped operations in the wake of the earthquake in the previous fiscal year, and the scale of regular maintenance was reduced, despite production cutbacks associated with the demand decline. In basic petrochemicals and chemical derivatives, demand was sluggish, but net sales increased compared to previous year because a substantial decline in sales had been recorded in the previous year due to the Great East Japan Earthquake. In synthetic fiber materials, net sales for terephthalic acid decreased considerably due to a significant drop in market price associated with an imbalance between supply and demand brought about by an increase in supply capacity, and to changes in overseas consolidated subsidiaries’ accounting periods in the previous fiscal year, which resulted in the recording of 15 months of sales. In carbon products, net sales of blast furnace coke significantly decreased due to lower sales prices incidental to a decline in the price of coking coal. Net sales in this segment decreased by ¥103.8 billion, or 10.3%, to ¥903.6 billion. Operating results worsened by ¥15.0 billion, and an operating loss of ¥230 million was recorded, mainly due to a significant reduction in the difference between raw material prices and product prices for terephthalic acid. 42 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 7 Major initiatives  Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation announced expansion of its production facility for ethylene carbonate at the Kashima Plant. (Current capacity: 3,000t/y; capacity increase: 5,000t/y) (June 2012)  Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation announced shutdown of its No. 1 ethylene production facility and No. 1 benzene production facility at its Kashima Plant.

The share transfer to Sanyo Chemical Industries has been completed. (March 2013) Polymers In synthetic resins, phenol-polycarbonate chain and polyolefin sales were able to recover from the adverse effects of the 2011 earthquake while markets for methyl methacrylate monomer, acrylic resin, and other products declined due to weaker supply-demand balance caused by lower demand. As a whole, net sales of the synthetic resins remained unchanged. Net sales in this segment increased by ¥17.0 billion, or 2.6%, to ¥675.6 billion. Operating income decreased by ¥23.6 billion, or 99.6%, to ¥111 million due to a shrinking price difference between raw materials and products as a whole, despite generally strong performance in sales of performance polymers, mainly for automotive use. Major initiatives  Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation’s consolidated subsidiaries: Japan Polypropylene Corporation and Japan Polyethylene Corporation announced shutdown of No. 3 polypropylene production facility and No.2 high-density polyethylene production facility at their Kawasaki Plant. (June 2012)  Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation signed an agreement with Faurecia, which produces automotive interior components, regarding joint research and development of bioplastics to be used in those components. (November 2012)  Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation announced establishment of Mitsubishi Chemical Polimeros de Desempenho Ltda. to produce and sell performance polymers in South America and expand sales to the automotive industry. (Capacity of olefin-base thermoplastic elastomer, THERMORUN: 4,600t/y (February 2013)  Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation announced acquisition of thermoplastic elastomer and PVC compound businesses from the Tessenderlo Group to strengthen its performance polymer business in Europe. (February 2013) Others Net sales decreased significantly due to segmentation changes in certain businesses, excluding engineering and logistics, effective from fiscal 2012 and a drop in engineering sales, although logistics in general showed a continued favorable performance. Net sales in this segment decreased by ¥18.9 billion, or 9.2%, to ¥186.9 billion. Operating income increased by ¥371 million, or 6.6%, to ¥6.4 billion. Note: 1. Segment operating incomes do not include expenses for basic testing, research, and other activities that cannot be allocated to reporting segments. Such expenses were ¥7.6 billion in fiscal 2012. 2. As of April 1, 2012, certain consolidated subsidiaries were transferred from the Polymers segment to the Designed Materials segment. As a result, in regard to comparisons with the previous fiscal year, figures for the previous fiscal year have been restated in accordance with the new segment classification. 8 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 43 R&D Expenditures Group companies maintain independent R&D programs and collaborate with each other by sharing technology and market information, and conducting joint research. They are also working closely with businesses outside the Group to refine and develop technologies. In fiscal 2012, consolidated R&D expenditures decreased ¥3.8 billion, or 2.7%, to ¥134.7 billion. There were 4,921 R&D employees at the close of the term. Liquidity and Financial Policies Sources of Funds The basic policy of APTSIS 15, MCHC's medium-term management plan, is to foster growth, innovation, and leap ahead by orchestrating the Group's strengths. MCHC established operating income, return on assets, the net debt-to-equity ratio, and the overseas sales ratio as basic benchmarks for this initiative. Key goals are to strengthen the Group by enhancing the Group's comprehensive strengths and financial position through restructuring. MCHC funds working capital and capital expenditures largely by drawing on internal reserves, loans, and bonds. Furthermore, the Group deployed a cash management system to employ Group funds efficiently and cut financial expenses. Going forward, the Group will pursue Groupwide improvements in capital efficiency by consolidating Group fund procurement and management functions. Financial Position Assets As of March 31, 2013, total assets stood at ¥3,307.7 billion, up ¥133.7 billion. This rise was due primarily to an increase in the assets of overseas consolidated subsidiaries, which were higher when converted to yen due to the correction of the yen appreciation, and to Qualicaps Co., Ltd., becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary. Securities were ¥84.9 billion, an increase of ¥38.6 billion compared to the end of fiscal 2011. This increase was attributable to increased investment of the Group's excess cash. Inventories were ¥546.9 billion, up ¥30.8 billion, due to increased stocks of new products and purchased products accompanying higher sales in the Health Care domain. Goodwill was ¥179.9 billion, an increase of ¥38.1 billion. This increase was attributable to the recording of goodwill when Qualicaps was made a wholly owned subsidiary. Net property, plant and equipment was ¥1.061.5billion, up ¥28.8 billion. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign currency translation adjustment of overseas consolidated subsidiaries when converted to yen as result of the correction of the yen appreciation.

This rise was due primarily to an increase in liabilities denominated in foreign currencies when converted to yen due to the correction of the yen appreciation. Interest-bearing debt (excluding notes discounted) was ¥1,198.7 billion, an increase of ¥34.6 billion compared to the end of fiscal 2011. Net Assets Net assets were ¥1,203.3 billion, up ¥58.3 billion compared to the end of fiscal 2011. This rise was due primarily to the weaker yen at the end of fiscal 2012 compared to the exchange rate at the end of fiscal 2011. Foreign currency translation adjustments were a negative ¥31.6 billion, down by ¥30.3 billion from fiscal 2011, due primarily to the yen being weaker at the end of the fiscal year under review than it was at the end of fiscal 2011. Minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries were ¥387.2 billion, an increase of ¥13.6 billion. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities totaled ¥206.5 billion, a decrease of ¥11.4 billion. This reflected ¥82.9 billion in income before income taxes and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries as well as depreciation and amortization. Net cash used in investing activities totaled ¥169.7 billion, an increase of ¥106.3 billion. This increase was primarily due to cash outflows from capital expenditures and from Qualicaps Co., Ltd., becoming a wholly owned subsidiary, which outweighed cash inflows from sales of investment securities and property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities totaled ¥26.2 billion, a decrease of ¥137.8 billion. This decline was mainly attributable to dividend payments. As a result, free cash flow, which consists of cash flows from operating and investing activities, was a cash inflow of ¥36.7 billion, a decrease of ¥117.8 billion compared to fiscal 2011. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year were ¥153.1 billion, an increase of ¥20.0 billion compared to the end of fiscal 2011. This increase was due in part to the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents of ¥8.8 billion. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, were ¥132.2 billion, an increase of ¥16.0 billion compared with the previous fiscal year. The majority of these expenditures were applied to construction of new or expanded facilities, renewal of existing facilities, and rationalization investments in other existing facilities. The major new or expanded facilities include a production facility for polyester film at Mitsubishi Polyester Film Suzhou Co., Ltd., a production facility for electrolyte for lithium-ion battery at Changshu Mitsubishi Lithium Battery Material Co., Ltd. and a production facility for separators for lithium-ion battery at MPI Nagahama Plant.

This section contains forward-looking statements based on information deemed relevant at March 31, 2013. The business risks presented are not all-encompassing. In recognition of exposure to risks such as those detailed below, the Group conducts risk assessments for each division once a year. Based on these assessments, risk management systems are established and revised in consideration of the risks faced by specific businesses. In this manner, the Group is working to prevent the risks from occurring and minimize the impacts of such risks be realized. Changes Affecting Many of the Group’s products can be impacted by demand and product markets domestically and abroad; pricing Operating Results and procurement volumes for crude oil, naphtha, utilities, and other raw materials and supplies; foreign exchange rates; and relevant laws and regulations. The principal assumed risks for each business domain are as follows. (a) Performance Products Domain These products must satisfy high-quality and performance requirements, and the Group must develop and supply them at the appropriate times to meet market needs. Group business results (“results”) may be adversely affected if market needs change far more than the Group envisages, or if the Group is unable to ensure the timely supply of products that meet market needs, including issues with the availability of raw materials. If supply is interrupted for raw materials that can only be procured from certain areas or specific suppliers, then this could adversely affect results. The Group outsources production of most information and electronics-related materials to other Asian manufacturers, so disasters or other issues with those facilities could disrupt the supply structure, adversely affecting results. Specifically, film and sheet products rely greatly on demand for liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, so drastic fluctuations in demand for LCD panels could adversely affect results. (b) Health Care Domain The results of the pharmaceuticals business are subject to the Group being unable to reach revenue and earnings targets by adequately expanding sales volumes of existing treatments or rationalizing operations in response to lower prices from periodic revisions in National Health Insurance prices of pharmaceuticals. Results are also subject to government policies in each country to constrain medical expenditures. In general, lead times for drug research and development are far longer than in other industries, whereas the percentage of drugs receiving approval is not high. It is therefore difficult to produce accurate forecasts for the certainty or timing of commercialization. Results are thus subject to drugs not being commercialized as planned. Even where drugs are commercialized, results are subject to sales volumes being lower because of intensified competition with rival offerings, volumes declining on reports of new side effects when usage of these drugs becomes broad-based, or when approval is withdrawn. Results are subject to supply disruptions on some raw materials for which the Group relies on external sources and can be influenced by an inability to secure adequate supplies of pharmaceuticals. In clinical testing and diagnostic reagents and instruments, results can be affected by periodic revisions in medical treatment fees and drug price revisions. Results in these businesses are subject to the Group being unable to reach revenue and earnings targets by adequately expanding sales volumes of existing treatments or rationalizing operations in response to lower fees or prices. In the pharmaceutical intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients business and the capsules for pharmaceutical products, results are subject to lower sales volumes of customers’ pharmaceuticals following revisions in National Health Insurance prices or patent expiries on customer products. 46 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 11 (c) Industrial Materials Domain In this area, MCHC consumes large volumes of naphtha and other raw materials, and uses considerable amounts of electricity and steam in production processes. For those reasons, drastic fluctuations in the costs of naphtha, fuels, and other resources owing to changes in crude oil prices; the demand and supply balance for raw fuels or naphtha; or the impact of foreign exchange rates could adversely affect results if MCHC is not fully able to adjust its product prices, or if there are delays in such adjustments. MCHC relies on suppliers from certain areas for its raw fuels, and an inability to secure required fuels at the right times could adversely affect results. A worldwide recession or increased production capacity among rivals could adversely affect results if it becomes impossible to maintain the product demand and supply balance or MCHC is unable to generate revenues and earnings or reach goals that are commensurate with its capital expenditures. MCHC relies heavily on certain business partners for some products in the Industrial Materials domain. For example, the coke business depends greatly on specific steelmakers, so if the steel output of those companies declines, such as because of dramatic fluctuations in the demand and supply of raw steel, the performances of such business partners could adversely affect MCHC’s results. (d) Others The Group includes companies offering engineering and logistics services. Those companies secure some external orders. Significant fluctuations in demand within and outside the Group, or in market conditions worldwide, could adversely affect results. (e) Overall Operations The MCHC Group aims to grow, innovate, and leap ahead by orchestrating its strengths. It is therefore reinforcing its structure and implementing growth strategies (including to deliver high performance and added value), while cultivating innovative businesses. Changes in the economic or business climates (including social demands relating to climate change measures and other aspects of the environment) that are far greater than projected could adversely affect results. The Group’s broad overseas activities include exporting products and manufacturing around the world. International geopolitical problems, inadequate supplies from utilities or other infrastructural shortfalls, other unforeseeable issues with regulations, taxation, working conditions, customs, transportation delays, large-scale natural disasters, or other risks impacting specific countries or regions could adversely affect results. Interest-Bearing The Group aims to balance its growth and innovation strategies with efforts to enhance its financial position. Debt MCHC’s results could be adversely affected in a situation where interest payments on interest-bearing debt rises, such as because interest-bearing debt increases, interest rates rise, or MCHC’s credit rating declines owing to fluctuating Group performances. Results could also be adversely affected if it becomes essential to procure funds to upgrade facilities and the Group must obtain financing at unfavorable terms. Risks Associated Results could be adversely affected if mergers, acquisitions, or joint ventures created in Japan or abroad to expand with Acquisitions, scale or overhaul MCHC’s business portfolio fail to deliver anticipated synergies or other benefits, or if the Group’s Mergers, or financial burden thereby increases or, if after mergers or acquisitions, the Group encounters new debt or other Restructuring issues that it did not initially envisage. Other factors that could adversely affect results include reorganizations as part of business selection and concentration initiatives, through which MCHC withdraws from unprofitable businesses or liquidates affiliates. Deferred Tax Assets The Group records deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences on tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are calculated based on various predictions and assumptions about future taxable income. If results differ from such predictions and assumptions, or if tax rates change in line with changes to the tax system, MCHC would need to recalculate deferred tax assets, which could adversely affect results. Impairment of The Group holds marketable securities, mainly as a minority shareholder in customer companies or financial Securities institutions to maintain long-term relationships with them. Major declines in the market values of such securities could adversely affect results. Impairment of Fixed The Group applies accounting standards related to fixed asset impairment. The Group could incur impairment Assets losses owing to dramatically deteriorating performances or major declines in property values, which could adversely affect results. 12 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 47 Pension and The Group calculates retirement benefit obligations and expenses for current and former employees based on Severance Plans actuarial assumptions, investment returns on plan assets, and other factors. A decline in the value of pension assets, fluctuations in the interest rate climate, and changes in retirement benefit obligations and expenses owing to changes in the retirement plan and pension systems could adversely affect results. Impact of Inventory The Group states inventory assets principally at cost based on the moving average method. Declines in the costs of Valuations naphtha or raw materials during the fiscal period could detract from earnings by affecting relatively expensive inventories at the start of a term, thereby increasing the cost of sales. Earnings would conversely rise if fuel costs rose during the fiscal period. Changes in fuel costs could therefore affect results. The Group applies the Accounting Standard for Measurement of Inventories (ASBJ Statement No. 9), so any book value write-down based on lower profitability could adversely affect results. Changes in Foreign The Group endeavors to minimize the short-term impact of fluctuations in foreign currency transactions, primarily for Exchange Rates exports and imports, notably by using forward foreign exchange contracts. Changes in exchange rates in the short, medium, and long terms may affect results. The Group engages in production and sales in Asia, Europe, North America, and other locations overseas. It translates sales, expenses, assets, and other items denominated in foreign currencies in such regions into yen in its consolidated financial statements. Even if the foreign currency valuations of such items remain unchanged, the yen equivalents could change after conversion from other currencies, so foreign exchange rate fluctuations could affect the Group’s results and financial position. Laws and The Group’s operations are subject to related laws and regulations in Japan and abroad. Such laws and regulations Regulations may govern security and safety, the environment and chemical substances, pharmaceutical safety policies, and other areas relating to Group operations. The Group maintains voluntary rules that are stricter than legal provisions while pursuing thorough compliance to satisfy laws and regulations in engaging in business activities. Dramatic changes in laws and regulations or strengthened legislation could further restrict the Group’s activities or increase its costs. Furthermore, should the Group violate laws or regulations, it could be ordered to halt operations at plants, and trust from society could be lost. All these factors have the possibility of influencing results. Product Liability The Group manufactures and sells products that conform with ISO 9001, the international standard for quality management systems. The Group endeavors to prevent product liability problems from arising when launching products or improving quality by previously evaluating such liability risks. The Group cannot guarantee, however, that all of its products will be free of defects. It therefore has product liability insurance to cover possible accidents. Regardless, product defects that could cause major product liability exposure with damages exceeding the range of such insurance could adversely affect results. Accidents and The Group regularly inspects its plants and otherwise endeavors to prevent accidents at facilities. It cannot, Disasters however, completely prevent or mitigate accidents at such facilities, nor natural disasters such as earthquakes. Accidents or natural disasters that damage property, cause human suffering or loss of life, or create environmental pollution could adversely impact production activities and reduce social trust in the Group, thereby adversely affecting results. Information The Group strictly manages corporate and personal information in its possession. Problems resulting from leaks of Management such information could decrease competitiveness or reduce social trust in the Group, which may adversely affect results. Research and The Group deems research and development as pivotal to supporting sustainable corporate growth, and has long Development undertaken solid R&D. It intends to deploy resources in a planned and sustainably stable manner from long-term perspectives. Results could be adversely affected, however, if the fruits of R&D are far less than anticipated. Intellectual Property The Group takes ample precautions to avoid violating the intellectual property of third parties. Nonetheless, injunctions or damages claims by third parties on the basis of patent or other infringements could adversely affect results. 48 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 13 Litigation The Group maintains various businesses, as mentioned in Changes Affecting Operating Results. In engaging in business, or in reorganizing or restructuring operations, the Group could face litigation from business partners or other third parties relating to intellectual property or the Group’s products. It is impossible to predict or assess the results of such lawsuits, which could adversely affect results. Litigation proceedings to which the Group is currently subject are as follows: a. Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation and Benesis Corporation were codefendants with the Japanese government in damages lawsuits over blood products tainted with hepatitis C virus. In September 2008, the defendants concluded a basic agreement with nationwide plaintiff groups and their attorneys to resolve this case in response to the Act on Special Measures concerning the Payment of Benefits to Relieve the Victims of Hepatitis C Infected through Specified Fibrinogen Concentrates and Specified Coagulation Factor XI Concentrates. The plaintiffs began dropping litigation against both companies, and in April 2009 the two companies decided to pay costs to the hepatitis C sufferers according to the payment apportionment standards of the above act. b. Consolidated subsidiary Verbatim Corporation (US) was sued for trademark infringement in Brazil. In May 2007, the court in Manaus, in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, ruled in favor of the plaintiff and ordered Verbatim to pay 377 million Brazilian real, or ¥17,534 million ($186,532 thousand). Verbatim, believing that no trademark infringement took place, and dissatisfied with the fact that reasons for recognizing the plaintiff's monetary claim were not disclosed, immediately filed an appeal with Brazil’s Supreme Court. In February 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Verbatim and returned the case to the Manaus court for retrial. In the following proceedings, the court ruled against Verbatim. However, dissatisfied with the ruling, Verbatim made a special appeal to Brazil’s Supreme Court, requesting that the case be tried in that court. In June 2011, the Supreme Court dismissed the charges of trademark infringement filed against Verbatim, and overruled the lower court’s order for Verbatim to pay the abovementioned damages. However, in April 2012 the plaintiff requested that the Supreme Court clarify its ruling, and the Company cannot deny the possibility that the plaintiff will oppose this ruling in the future. 14 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 49 Consolidated Balance Sheets Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries As of March 31 Thousands of U.S. dollars Millions of yen (Note 2) 2013 2012 2013 Assets Current assets: Cash and deposits (Notes 9,11) ¥ 115,980 ¥ 114,778 $ 1,233,830 Trade receivables (Note 9) 588,208 593,352 6,257,532 Securities (Notes 9,10) 84,993 46,355 904,181 Inventories: Finished goods 290,810 265,799 3,093,723 Work in process 74,405 80,531 791,543 Raw materials and supplies 179,816 167,127 1,912,936 Land held for sale 1,934 2,639 20,574 Deferred income taxes―current (Note 15) 32,227 31,710 342,840 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 90,281 77,922 960,436 Allowance for doubtful accounts (1,996) (2,491) (21,234) Total current assets 1,456,658 1,377,722 15,496,362 Property, plant and equipment: Land 247,214 255,034 2,629,936 Buildings 914,379 911,518 9,727,436 Machinery and equipment 2,408,558 2,318,574 25,622,957 Construction in progress 68,457 53,815 728,266 3,638,608 3,538,941 38,708,596 Accumulated depreciation (2,577,057) (2,506,203) (27,415,500) Property, plant and equipment, net 1,061,551 1,032,738 11,293,096 Investments and other assets: Investment securities (Notes 9,10) 355,742 349,001 3,784,489 Long-term loans receivable 2,353 1,265 25,032 Deferred income taxes―noncurrent (Note 15) 91,898 98,901 977,638 Goodwill 179,937 141,800 1,914,223 Other 161,471 174,201 1,717,777 Allowance for doubtful accounts (1,852) (1,658) (19,702) Total investments and other assets 789,549 763,510 8,399,457 Total assets ¥3,307,758 ¥3,173,970 $35,188,915 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 50 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 15 Thousands of U.S. dollars Millions of yen (Note 2) 2013 2012 2013 Liabilities and Current liabilities: Net Assets Short-term debt (Notes 9,18) ¥ 315,551 ¥ 289,574 $ 3,356,926 Current portion of long-term debt (Notes 9,18) 230,026 106,756 2,447,085 Trade payables (Note 9) 416,980 411,289 4,435,957 Accrued expenses (Note 1) 73,052 71,799 777,149 Accrued income taxes 24,083 15,665 256,202 Other current liabilities (Notes 1,15) 194,084 175,059 2,064,723 Total current liabilities 1,253,776 1,070,142 13,338,043 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt (Notes 9,18) 653,222 767,798 6,949,170 Accrued retirement benefits (Note 13) 126,713 124,517 1,348,011 Other noncurrent liabilities (Notes1,15) 70,731 66,559 752,457 Total long-term liabilities 850,666 958,874 9,049,638 Net assets: Shareholders’ equity: Common stock: Authorized—6,000,000 thousand shares: Issued and outstanding— 1,506,288 thousand shares at March 31, 50,000 50,000 531,915 2013 and 2012 Additional paid-in capital 317,693 317,628 3,379,713 Retained earnings 479,083 474,771 5,096,628 Less, treasury stock at cost— 33,053 thousand shares at March 31, 2013 and (11,280) (10,797) (120,000) 31,989 thousand shares at March 31, 2012 Total shareholders’ equity 835,496 831,602 8,888,255 Accumulated other comprehensive income: Net unrealized holding gain on other securities 13,959 4,574 148,500 Loss on deferred hedges 1,018 (139) 10,830 Land revaluation surplus 1,581 1,581 16,819 Foreign currency translation adjustments (31,639) (62,007) (336,585) Unfunded retirement benefit obligation (4,912) (4,882) (52,255) with respect to a foreign subsidiary Total Accumulated other comprehensive income (19,993) (60,873) (212,691) Warrants (Notes 7,14) 565 662 6,011 Minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries 387,248 373,563 4,119,660 Total net assets 1,203,316 1,144,954 12,801,234 Total liabilities and net assets ¥3,307,758 ¥3,173,970 $35,188,915 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

In presenting the accompanying consolidated financial statements, certain items have been reclassified for the convenience of readers outside Japan. As permitted, amounts of less than one million yen have been omitted. As a result, the totals shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements (both in yen and in U.S. dollars) do not necessarily agree with the sum of the individual amounts. Certain amounts from the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. (b) Principles of Consolidation and Accounting for Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries and Affiliates The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MCHC and all significant subsidiaries over which substantial control is exerted either through majority ownership of voting stock and/or by other means. Investments in certain unconsolidated subsidiaries and significant affiliates are accounted for by the equity method. Other investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are stated at cost or less. Where there has been a permanent decline in the value of such investments, MCHC has written them down to reflect the impairment. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of the consolidated subsidiaries are valued at fair value. Goodwill on acquisition of underlying net equity in consolidated subsidiaries and the excess of cost over fair value in affiliates accounted for by the equity method is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of less than 20 years depending on the source. (c) Securities Investment securities are classified as either held-to-maturity debt securities or other securities. Held-to-maturity debt securities are either amortized or accumulated to face value. Other securities with quoted market prices are carried at market value. The difference between the acquisition cost and the carrying value of other securities, including unrealized gain and loss, net of the applicable income taxes, is recognized as a component of net assets and is reflected as “Net unrealized holding gain or loss on other securities.” The cost of other securities sold is computed by the moving average method. Other securities without quoted market prices are stated at cost based on the moving average method. Held-to-maturity debt securities due within one year are presented as “Current assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All other securities are presented as “Investments and other assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. (d) Derivative Transactions Derivative transactions are measured at fair value. (e) Inventories Finished goods, work in process, raw materials, and other inventory assets are stated principally at cost based on the average cost. Supplies are stated primarily at cost based on the moving average method. Balance sheet amounts are calculated by writing down their book values in accordance with decreases in profitability. 58 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 23 (f) Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment of MCHC, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries in the Health Care segment, the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries in Japan in the Chemicals and Polymers segments (excluding Mitsubishi Rayon Co., Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries), and the Company’s overseas consolidated subsidiaries is principally calculated using the straight-line method. Other depreciation is principally calculated using the declining-balance method. Principal estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows: Buildings: 10–50 years Machinery and equipment: 4–17 years Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to income. Change in Method of Depreciation for Significant Depreciable Assets In the Health Care Segment, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries (hereafter, the “Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Group”) previously calculated depreciation of property, plant and equipment primarily by the declining-balance method. (However, for buildings acquired on or after April 1, 1998 (not including equipment attached to the buildings), the straight-line method was used). From the current fiscal year, the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Group has changed to the straight-line method. New drugs launched in the previous fiscal year made a contribution to sales in the current fiscal year. In addition, the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Group plans to launch multiple drugs of new types in the next fiscal year and thereafter. In the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Group’s operating environment, there are demands for the strengthening of safety measures after products are manufactured and sold. In this environment, the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Group’s policy is to rapidly collect and accumulate safety and efficacy data for the purpose of promoting the appropriate usage of these new drugs, and to conduct sales while formulating further safety measures as needed. Accordingly, the trend toward more-gradual growth in revenues/profits will steadily strengthen. In addition, in October 2011 the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Group formulated a medium-term management plan that covers the period to fiscal 2015 and announced aggressive upfront investment to strengthen its foundation and expand its business toward sustained growth. The Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Group undertakes full-scale implementation of this investment plan from the current fiscal year. At this turning point, through deliberations regarding the reevaluation of the depreciation method, the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Group confirmed that its product lines are expected to secure stable revenues/profits over the long term; that its property, plant and equipment are, in general, in stable operation; and that the upfront investment will contribute to further stable operation through consolidation and strengthening of production equipment. Accordingly, in the judgment of the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Group, the allocation of expenses through uniform depreciation over the useful life of the property, plant and equipment will enable the actual usage conditions of the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Group’s property, plant and equipment to be reflected appropriately. Therefore, the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Group reevaluated the previous depreciation method and decided to use the straight-line method from the current fiscal year. In comparison with the previous method, this change had the effect of increasing operating income by ¥2,637 million ($28,053 thousand), and income before income taxes and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries by ¥2,677 million ($28,479 thousand), respectively. Change in Method of Depreciation for Significant Depreciable Assets Accompanying Change in Corporate Tax Law In accordance with the revised corporate tax law, from the current fiscal year, domestic consolidated subsidiaries that use the declining-balance method have changed the method of depreciation for property, plant and equipment acquired on or after April 1, 2012. Consequently, in comparison with the previous method, this change had the effect of increasing operating income by ¥1,637 million ($17,415 thousand), and income before income taxes and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries by ¥1,659 million ($17,649 thousand), respectively. The effect of this change on segment information is described in Note 19 (Segment Information). 24 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 59 (g) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for at an amount estimated with reference to individual accounts deemed uncollectible plus an amount calculated by a historical rate based on the actual uncollectible amounts in prior years. (h) Accrued Bonuses to Employees To provide for payments of bonuses to its employees, bonuses and related social insurance premium are accrued and recorded at the amount expected to be paid. The corresponding balances of ¥35,210 million ($374,574 thousand) and ¥37,160 million are included in “Accrued expenses” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (i) Reserves for Possible Losses in Connection with Litigation Reserves for possible losses in connection with litigation are set aside for payments to settle lawsuits and in preparation for payments that may arise in the future. 1. Reserve for Health Management Allowances for HIV Compensation Balances of ¥1,627 million ($17,309 thousand) and ¥1,461 million are included in “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To provide for future payments of health management allowances and settlement payments (including attorney fees) in connection with a lawsuit for damages filed by plaintiffs infected with HIV, the consolidated subsidiary, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (MTPC) has set aside an estimated amount for such future payments. 2. Reserve for HCV Litigation Balances of ¥3,593 million ($38,223 thousand) and ¥2,520 million are included in “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To provide for losses that may arise in the future from a settlement of lawsuits filed by plaintiffs infected with HCV (hepatitis C virus), MTPC has set aside an estimated amount for payments related to such settlement based on estimates of the number of people receiving relief and the amount of relief payments required under a law which stipulates that relief be provided to people who contacted hepatitis C from specific fibrinogen products or specific coagulation factor IX products. 3. Reserve for Health Management Allowances for Sub-acute Myelo-Optical Neuropathy (SMON) Compensation Balances of ¥3,172 million ($33,745 thousand) and ¥3,622 million are included in “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. MTPC pays health management allowances and nursing expenses for plaintiffs covered under the compromise settlement reached in the SMON litigation. MTPC has made a provision in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the estimated future medical treatment payments to be made over the remaining lives of the parties entitled to such payments under the compromise settlement. (j) Reserve for Periodic Repairs Several consolidated subsidiaries provide for costs of periodic repairs of production facilities in plants and oil tanks. The corresponding balances of ¥9,357 million ($99,543 thousand) and ¥6,242 million are included in “Other current liabilities” and “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (k) Accrued Retirement Benefits and Pension Plans Upon terminating their employment, employees of MCHC and its consolidated subsidiaries are entitled, under most circumstances, to lump-sum severance payments or pension payments by defined benefit plans and/or defined contribution plans. For retiring employees, under normal circumstances, payment is at an amount based on current rates of pay, length of service, and the type of termination (voluntary or involuntary). In calculating payments for retiring employees due to meeting mandatory retirement age requirements, MCHC and its significant consolidated subsidiaries in Japan may grant additional benefits. MCHC and some of its significant consolidated subsidiaries in Japan 60 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 25 have defined benefit pension plans funded through several financial institutions in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. The funding policy is to make actuarially determined contributions to provide the plans with sufficient assets to meet future benefit payment requirements. The pension benefits are determined based on years of service and the compensation amounts, as stipulated in the pension plans’ regulations, are payable at the option of the retiring employee in a lump-sum amount or as a monthly pension. The Group prepares to pay employee retirement benefits by recording the amounts it expects to incur as of the end of the fiscal year based on projected retirement benefit obligations and pension assets. The Group amortizes prior service cost by using the straight-line method over a certain period (in principle, five years) that is shorter than the remaining average service period from the date incurred. The Group expenses unrecognized actuarial gains or losses beginning in the year following that in which they are incurred by using the straight-line method over a certain period (in principle, five years) that is shorter than the remaining average service period from the date incurred. Differences from accounting policy transitions are charged over an average of 15 years, in principle. (l) Directors’ Retirement Benefits Accrued lump-sum retirement benefits for directors, executive officers and corporate auditors are determined based on internal regulations. The corresponding balances of ¥1,273 million ($13,543 thousand) and ¥1,273 million are included in “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (m) Reserve for Costs Associated with Liquidation of Subsidiaries and Affiliates Several consolidated subsidiaries provide for estimated costs derived from liquidation of its subsidiaries and affiliates. The corresponding balances of ¥1,409 million ($14,989 thousand) and ¥3,916 million are included in “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (n) Reserve for Prospective Loss on Removal of Fixed Assets Several consolidated subsidiaries provide for prospective loss on removal of fixed assets. The corresponding balances of ¥7,426 million ($79,000 thousand) and ¥10,185 million are included in “Other current liabilities” and “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (o) Provision for Losses on Disaster Balances of ¥990 million ($10,532 thousand) and ¥2,335 million are included in “Other current liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, as a provision, to cover the estimated costs deemed necessary in restoring fixed and other assets damaged in the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011. (p) Provision for Environmental Measures Provision is made to cover estimated future losses from environmental measures work. A balance of ¥2,341 million ($24,904 thousand) is included in “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013, and a balance of ¥871 million is included in “Other current liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2012. (q) Foreign Currency Translation Current and noncurrent monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of MCHC and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries are translated into yen at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising from foreign exchange differences are credited or charged to income in the year in which they are made or incurred. 26 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 61 (r) Foreign Currency Financial Statements The balance sheet accounts of foreign consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into yen at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding minority interests, which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts of foreign consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into yen at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the financial statements of foreign consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates into yen are accumulated and presented under “Foreign currency translation adjustments” as a component of net assets. (s) Principal Hedge Accounting Methods 1. Hedge accounting method The Group defers recognition of gains or losses related to fair or appraised value hedges. For receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, such as those with foreign exchange contracts, deferral hedging is used where satisfying deferral hedging criteria, while specific matching is used for interest rate swaps meeting specific matching criteria. 2. Hedging instruments and targets The Group uses foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, notably imports and exports, financing, and funds management. The Group similarly uses interest rate swaps to lower exposure to interest rate fluctuations in financing and funds management transactions. The Group also uses commodity futures contracts to hedge against the risks of fluctuations in the purchase costs of raw materials. 3. Hedging policy The Group maintains a policy of limiting the use of derivative transactions to actual demand and does notengage in such transactions for speculative purposes. The Group minimizes credit risk stemming from breaches of contract of counterparties by restricting its use of derivative transactions to financial institutions with high credit ratings. 4. Method of assessing hedge effectiveness The Group has confirmed that the hedging instruments and targets used in executing derivative transactions nearly match crucial requirements, and it can offset the effects of market fluctuations on and after implementing hedges. The Group decides on whether to engage in planned transactions after assessing whether or not such transactions are extremely feasible. (t) Amortization of Goodwill Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over less than 20 years, depending on the source. Goodwill related to the launch of consolidated subsidiary Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation is being amortized over 15 years. Goodwill from making Mitsubishi Plastics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary is being amortized over 10 years. Goodwill from making Mitsubishi Rayon Co., Ltd. and Qualicaps Co., Ltd. into wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries is being amortized over 20 years. 62 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 27 (u) Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments, generally with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are so near maturity that they represent only an insignificant risk of any change in value attributable to changes in interest rates, are considered cash equivalents. (v) Research and Development Expenses related to research and development activities are charged to income as incurred. (w) Distribution of Retained Earnings Cash dividends are recorded in the fiscal year in which they are approved at the relevant shareholders’ meeting or, in the case of interim dividends, the respective years in which they are declared by the Board of Directors. (x) Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized by the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided against the deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that they will not be realized. Additional Information Several Overseas Consolidated Subsidiaries’ Year-ends Switched from December 31 to March 31 During the fiscal year under review, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Korea Co., Ltd. and 15 other companies changed their fiscal year-end from December 31 to March 31. The Company thus prepared consolidated financial statements based on the financial statements for those companies for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012, and three months through March 31, 2013. The year-ends of Tianjin Tanabe Seiyaku Co., Ltd. and 5 other companies are December 31, but from this fiscal year the Company started to prepare financial statements presenting provisional settlements for those companies as of March 31. “Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Statement No. 26, May 17, 2012) and “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Guidance No. 25, May 17, 2012) (1) Outline Under the revised accounting standard, actuarial gains and losses and past service costs, etc., after adjusting for tax effects, are recognized in the net assets section of the consolidated balance sheet and the deficit or surplus is recognized as a liability or asset. Also, in regard to the method of attributing the expected retirement benefit to periods, in addition to the straight-line basis, the benefit formula basis may now be applied. In addition, the method of determining the discount rate has also been revised. (2) Date of application The Group plans to adopt the accounting standard from the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014. However, in regard to the revisions in the methods of calculating projected benefit obligations and service costs, plans call for adoption from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015. (3) Effects of adoption of the accounting standard, etc. The effect of the adoption of the accounting standard is currently being evaluated. 28 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 63 Note 2 U.S. Dollar Amounts MCHC and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for convenience and have been translated, as a matter of arithmetical computation only, at the rate of ¥94 to U.S.$1.00, the approximate exchange rate prevailing on the Tokyo foreign exchange market at March 29, 2013. This translation should not be construed as a representation that yen amounts actually represent, or have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars at this, or any other rate. Note 3 Impairment Losses In principle, the MCHC Group maintains groupings of assets in terms of operational, manufacturing process, and regional relevance based on business units. The Group recognizes impairment losses for idle assets by individual asset. In the fiscal year under review, the Group posted ¥7,298 million ($77,638 thousand) in impairment losses as part of other expenses. The main assets for which impairment losses were recognized are as follows: Impairment loss Purpose Site Category Millions of Thousands of yen U.S. dollars Japan Polyethylene Polyethylene Corporation, Machinery and manufacturing Kawasaki Plant equipment, ¥1,976 $21,021 facility (Kawasaki City, Buildings, others Kawasaki Prefecture) Japan Polypropylene Polypropylene Corporation, Machinery and manufacturing Kawasaki Plant equipment, ¥1,911 $20,330 facility (Kawasaki City, Buildings, others Kawasaki Prefecture) Composition of Impairment Losses Polyethylene manufacturing facility The impairment loss of ¥ 1,976 million ($21,021 thousand) includes ¥1,194 million ($12,702 thousand) for machinery and equipment, ¥769 million ($8,181 thousand) for buildings, and ¥13 million ($138 thousand) for others. Polypropylene manufacturing facility The impairment loss of ¥1,911 million ($20,330 thousand) includes ¥1,021 million ($10,862 thousand) for machinery and equipment, ¥875 million ($9,309 thousand) for buildings, and ¥15 million ($160 thousand) for others. In regard to the polyethylene manufacturing facility and polypropylene manufacturing facility, due to sluggish domestic demand and other factors, profitability declined substantially and the possibility of recovery in the future was low. Accordingly, the decision was made to halt operations at these plants, and the book value was reduced to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount was determined based on value in use. The discount rate is not presented because future cash flows before discounting are negative. 64 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 29 Note 4 Contingent MCHC and its consolidated subsidiaries were guarantors for the following borrowings Liabilities principally incurred by unconsolidated subsidiaries, affiliates and others: Net MCHC’s and Gross including consolidated subsidiaries’ third parties’ liabilities own liabilities Thousands of Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars Millions of yen U.S. dollars Guarantees ¥4,543 $48,330 ¥4,498 $47,851 Stand-by guarantees 174 1,851 174 1,851 Trademark Infringement Lawsuit The consolidated subsidiary Verbatim Corporation (US) was sued for trademark infringement in Brazil. In May 2007, a court in Manaus, in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, ruled in favor of the plaintiff and ordered Verbatim Corporation to pay 377 million Brazilian real, or ¥17,534 million ($186,532 thousand). Verbatim Corporation, believing that no trademark infringement took place, and dissatisfied with the fact that reasons for recognizing the plaintiff's monetary claim were not disclosed, immediately filed an appeal with Brazil’s Supreme Court. In February 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Verbatim Corporation and returned the case to the Manaus court for retrial. In the following proceedings, the court ruled against Verbatim. However, dissatisfied with the ruling, Verbatim made a special appeal to Brazil’s Supreme Court, requesting that the case be tried in that court. In June 2011, the Supreme Court dismissed the charges of trademark infringement filed against Verbatim, and overruled the lower court’s order for Verbatim to pay the abovementioned damages.

MCHC deployed a cash management system to facilitate intragroup lending and borrowing and use funds more efficiently and reduce financial costs, engaging in intragroup lending and borrowing. Other policies are to ensure that derivatives transactions purely accommodate actual demand and to refrain from speculative trading. (2) Financial Instruments and Risks Trade receivables are exposed to customer credit risk. As MCHC operates globally, foreign currency denominated trade receivables are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations. MCHC hedges the resulting risks, net of trade payables in those currencies, with forward foreign exchange contracts. Marketable and investment securities are subject to market risk. Those securities mainly comprise held-tomaturity debt securities and shares in other companies with which the Group does business or has capital affiliations. Most trade payables are due within one year. While partly exposed to foreign exchange risks from imports of raw materials and other items, MCHC hedges with forward foreign exchange contracts as it does with trade receivables. Borrowings, corporate bonds, and bonds with subscription rights to shares are to secure the funding needed for operations and capital investments. Some of these instruments are subject to interest rate fluctuation risks, which MCHC hedges using interest rate swaps. MCHC engages in various types of derivatives transaction. They include forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange fluctuation risks associated with foreign currency denominated trade receivables and payables, borrowings and loans. MCHC also uses interest rate swaps to hedge fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings and loans, as well as commodity futures contracts to hedge the risks of price fluctuations from raw materials purchases. (3) Financial Instrument Risk Management Structure a. Credit Risk Management (including risks of customers breaching contracts) In keeping with its credit management rules, MCHC regularly monitors the statuses of key customers with outstanding trade and long-term receivables and oversees dates and balances while endeavoring to swiftly identify and ameliorate collection concerns that could stem from deteriorating financial positions or other factors. The credit risks of held-to-maturity debt securities are insignificant, as MCHC’s portfolio includes only instruments with high credit ratings. MCHC minimizes credit risks relating to counterparty breaches of contract with derivatives by transacting solely with highly creditworthy financial institutions. The maximum credit risk amount at March 31, 2013, is the balance sheet value of financial assets exposed to such risks. b. Market Risk Management (foreign exchange and interest rate risks) Where necessary, MCHC uses forward exchange contracts and currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated operating receivables, debt and loans. It uses interest rate swaps to minimize the risks of interest payment fluctuations for debt and corporate bonds. MCHC regularly assesses the prices of marketable and investment securities and the financial positions of issuers (business partners). It factors in relationships with business partners in constantly reviewing the necessity of instruments other than held-to-maturity debt securities. In keeping with internal rules on transaction rights and limitations, reports on the contract balances and market prices of derivative transactions are submitted regularly to the director in charge of such matters. c. Funding-Related Liquidity Risk Management (risk of inability to settle by payment dates) MCHC is exposed to liquidity risk for customer credit and debt, managing them by producing and managing funding plans. 70 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 35 (4) Supplementary Explanation of the Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, if available. When there is no quoted market price available, fair value is reasonably estimated. Since various assumptions and factors are reflected in estimating the fair value, different assumptions and factors could result in different fair value. Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, and estimated fair value are shown in the following table. The table below excludes instruments whose fair value is extremely difficult to determine.

Method to Determine the Estimated Fair Values of Financial Instruments and Other Matters Related to Securities and Derivatives Transactions Assets Cash and deposits Book value is used, as it approximates market value because of the short maturities of these instruments. Trade receivables Book value is used, as it approximates market value because of the short maturities of these instruments. Marketable and investment securities The fair value of stocks is based on quoted market prices, while the fair value of debt securities is based on quoted market prices or the prices provided by the financial institutions with which MCHC conducts transactions. Book value is used for negotiable certificates of deposit and commercial paper, as it approximates market value because of the short settlements of these instruments. For information on securities classified by holding purpose, please refer to Note 10, Securities. Liabilities Trade payables, short-term debt, current portion of long-term debt, bonds due in one year or less, and current portion of bonds with subscription rights to shares Book value is used, as it approximates market value because of the short maturities of these instruments. Corporate bonds The market price of corporate bonds is based on the quoted market price. Long-term debt Market value is based on the present value of principle and interest, discounted using current assumed rates for similar new debt. Long-term debt is subject to special procedures for interest rate swaps (see Note 12, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting) and the total principal and interest for these swaps are discounted using rationally estimated interest rates for similar new debt. Derivative Transactions Please refer to Note 12, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting. 72 Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation 37 2.

As a result, Qualicaps became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Qualicaps has established a position of leadership in the market for capsules for pharmaceuticals and health & nutrition products, which is expected to record stable growth, and the Company expects Qualicaps to make a contribution to stable profits. The Company believes that the proposed transaction will strengthen the existing businesses of both MCHC and Qualicaps. Qualicaps’ global network of customers is highly complementary to MCHC's existing healthcare solutions and API businesses.

I call it “sustainability revolution”. As existing business models continually become obsolete, as stated in the 30-year theory for corporations, we can find many examples of success and failure in attempts at change driven by innovation and other methods. In my understanding of KAITEKI Management, MCHC is not simply changing to face the next 30 years, but rather the Company is linking opportunities for its massive corporate group with a historic revolution in a prime example of active focus on CSR. I have not heard of any other corporate groups except for family-owned company groups which base their strategies on philosophical considerations in the way that MCHC does. I look forward to seeing the development of KAITEKI. Risk management processes are the foundation for progressive management, but I believe that how the identification, assessment, and development of measures for risks related to climate change and market trends are conducted will be the most important part of future non-financial disclosure and reporting, such as CSR and Integrated reporting. Awareness of the business environment until 2025 in APTSIS 15 is fundamental. KAITEKI Value will be maximized through the three axes of MOS, MOT, and MOE, and I highly praise the creation of indexes for the former two, when usually only the latter MOE is quantified. I also have high expectations for continual improvements in their accuracy. In addition, I can see that the concept of selection and concentration comes through adding Growth Model types to business portfolio management. Incidentally, now most corporate value is found in intangible assets, which are generally divided into assets relating to innovation, organizations, and human resources. I can see that MCHC implements many innovation initiatives including organizational reform and R&D investments, and cross-organizational initiatives such as synergy units based on the concepts of orchestration and the appointment of Mission Coordinators. Regarding human resources, the direction and initiatives given in the report are appropriate, with no sense of incongruity. However, as synergy is the key to implementing KAITEKI Management, it is necessary for employees to be highly motivated. It would be even better to be able to see the motivated faces of your employees. Also, I believe it will take time to achieve global diversity in your company. As the construction of a global human resources database is being planned, I would like MCHC to prepare a long-term policy on diversity and a roadmap looking ahead to, for example, 2030–2040. I feel that diversity is another key to the implementation of KAITEKI Management. It is not necessarily easy to see in the report what the Group companies other than the four core operating companies are doing in terms of CSR activities. Fundamentally, with mainly only B to B business, there has been little need to interact with society in general until now, but as the overseas proportion of net sales increases, naturally what happens at Group companies and also in the value chain cannot help but influence the Group as a whole. Finally, to allow as many people as possible to read this report I think it would be good to add explanations of technical vocabulary. Response to Opinions Received Noboru Tsuda Senior Managing Executive Officer Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation We very much appreciate Mr. Goto’s opinions on our KAITEKI Report. As we revised APTSIS 15 in fiscal 2012, we also added new MOS Indexes and readjusted goals for fiscal 2015 at the same time as applying combined and quantitative results in MOS and MOE Indexes to the evaluation. We are also creating MOT Indexes. While lending a sincere ear to society’s demands, we will continue to evolve KAITEKI Management further. Regarding Mr. Goto’s suggestions, we will not only enhance and disclose fundamental data, but also disclose initiatives and examples of “My Own MOS”, which display the boundless enthusiasm of organizations and employees, case studies of Group companies’ activities, and other examples of initiatives in the value chain. Additionally, we will create approachable and easy-tounderstand reports.
