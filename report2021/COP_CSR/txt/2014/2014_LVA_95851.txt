Waste, obtained throughout the manufacturing processes, is accordingly sorted; TO DECREASE hazardous waste is transferred to licensed disposal organizations for destruction. Amounts of THE RESOURCE hazardous waste per unit of production compared to 2012 have decreased by 7.5%. “Grindeks” is CONSUMPTION a partner of “Green Dot of Latvia”, “BAO”, “Ekoosta” and other waste management organizations. UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2014 SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONCEPT OF BIOLOGICAL INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT A modern, closed-type biological wastewater treatment plant, where industrial wastewaters are purified in the environmentally friendly way, was opened by “Grindeks” in 2009. Because of this environmentally friendly concept of wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical manufacturing and development of the company can be reconciled with respect for the environment. Despite the increase of manufacturing capacity, the company is caring effectively for the environment. There is also a modern laboratory in the treatment plant where the analysis of wastewaters and the monitoring of results are carried out, as well as the wastewater research. By carrying out qualitative wastewater treatment process management and system optimization, industrial wastewater treatment efficiency indicator reached 93.34% in 2013. Overall, there were treated 69 242 m³ of industrial wastewaters, which is by 22% more than in 2012. “Grindeks” as one of the cooperation partners of “Environment, Bioenergetics and Biotechnology Competence Center” is successfully continuing participation in the research of pharmaceutical industry “Biological treatment of water containing pharmaceutical and petroleum compounds”. The aim of the study is to detect, identify and maintain specific microorganisms and microbial groups that are most efficient in breaking down difficult biodegradable chemicals in the pharmaceutical and oil-containing wastewater. In the framework of the project, there were selected and identified 65 microbial communities from INDUSTRIAL activated sludge of industrial wastewater of “Grindeks”; there was also held an examination on WASTEWATER their ability to treat the wastewaters of pharmaceutical manufacturing biologically. The results TREATMENT will help to select the communities with the highest potential for industrial wastewater EFFICIENCY treatment. They will be practically applicable to make a biological wastewater treatment plant INDICATOR optimization, increase the efficiency of industrial wastewater treatment and ensure the long REACHES term sustainability of the treatment process. 93.34% Scientific publication is being prepared on the outcome of the research. UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2014 REGULAR MEASURES TO REDUCE EMISSIONS INTO WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT AIR AND ATMOSPHERE To reduce emissions in the workplace environment and atmosphere, “Grindeks” takes regular measures to reduce the consumption of environmentally unfavourable solvents significantly while consummating manufacturing technologies. Closed equipment prevents release of dust into the atmosphere; on the equipment and possible emission sources, dust filters, receivers of acid gases and solvent vapour are installed. These receivers also prevent odours from spreading. TARGETED MEASURES TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS AND OTHER WASTE UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2014 FUTURE COMMITMENTS TARGETS FOR 2014 FUTURE COMMITMENTS Quality, safety and environmental policy: · To look constantly for new, innovative and even more effective solutions to save natural 14 resources · To carry out regular environmental measures based on environmental impact assessment and monitoring results · To minimize and avoid possible pollution risks by analysing how certain activities may affect the environment UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2014 ABOUT THIS COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS ABOUT THIS COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 15 JSC “Grindeks” joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2002 and this Communication on Progress covers the activities of the leader of the pharmaceutical industry in the Baltic's – JSC “Grindeks” in year 2013. All operations of the company around the world are committed to the Global Compact principles and the company is continuously making further progress as to these commitments.
