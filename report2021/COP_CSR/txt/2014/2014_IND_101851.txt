Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. The Shipping Corporation of India has taken environmental challenges seriously and it is demonstrated through its’ day-to-day operations. The ‘Safety and Page 6 of 13 Occupational Health & Environment Protection Policy is in effect and implementation is monitored on board vessels. In continuation to initiatives taken before 30.09.2013, SCI continues to follow the policy of implementation of environmental regulations on all new SCI vessels ordered / delivered in recent past. Environmental Regulations All new shipbuilding projects of SCI are complying with strict environmental regulations, such as : (i) Fuel oil tanks are protected on the sides to avoid direct contact in case of accident. (ii) Engines fitted on new vessels are complying with EU directive 2005/33/EC and thus EU compliant. (iii) NOx Tier II compliant engines are being fitted on new vessels. (iv) Environment friendly refrigerant is being used for the AC plants on new vessels. (v) The vessel shall have green passport upon delivery i.e. list of all hazardous materials will be kept onboard which will be of great help during recycling/handling of hazardous materials during in-service repairs. (vi) Paint applied on the underwater portion of the hull is tin-free. (vii) Energy Efficiency Design Index is being implemented at design stage to reduce the Green House Gas emissions. (viii) Ballast water Treatment Plant is being fitted on the new vessels. The last 3 vessels delivered to SCI (Kamsarmax bulk carriers), from a Chinese shipyard, comply with all above environmental regulations. The VLCC under construction at a Chinese shipyard is also complying with the above regulations. Further, SCI is technical consultant to the various Government Organizations for their tonnage acquisition programme. SCI as a policy is ensuring that even the vessels owned by these Organizations comply with environmental regulations. Air and Sea Pollution The company is committed to safe guard against air and sea pollution by way of exhaust gases, pollution by oil or sewage and pollution by garbage toxic, plastics etc. into the sea water. The Company takes following precautionary measures in this direction. • Company’s vessels are fully compliant of MARPOL regulations and hold valid International Oil Pollution Prevention certificate (IOPP). Each vessel is Page 7 of 13 provided with a Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP) or Shipboard Marine Pollution Emergency Plan (SMPEP) • Ships maintain weekly inventory of oil residues. Disposal and transfer carried out as per regulations and record is maintained in “Oil Record Books”. • Each vessel is holding valid International Sewage Pollution Prevention Certificate (ISPP) • Each vessel is holding valid International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate (IAPP). • Vessels use low sulphur bunkers with less than 1.0% in Sulphur Emission Controlled areas (SECA) and less than 3.5% in other areas. • Vessels use bunker with sulphur content less than 0.1% in European ports. • Inventory of Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) is maintained on all tanker vessels. • Company has Garbage Management Plan and each vessel complies with the same. • The Company tries to avoid supply of goods which are packed in plastic and promotes eco-friendly/ biodegradable items such as garbage bags, envelops etc. • The company is also in the process of modifying its existing tanker fleet to be EU compliant. Environmental Management System The tanker division in SCI has obtained certificate of compliance for Environmental Management system to the ISO 14001:2004 standard by “Indian Register of Quality Systems”. Environmental Safety • A procedure for leak detection at pre-determined intervals of CFC based refrigerants in all refrigeration and air-conditioning systems on board are being complied. (Record of same is being maintained in vessels’ Planned Maintenance System). • In order to reduce the disposal of lead and other hazardous substances into the sea/land; lead – acid batteries and other batteries are returned to the manufactures. • As per International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships 2001, the Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on existing tankers (less than 20 years) have been replaced by non-harmful anti-fouling systems since 31st December 2007 onwards. Page 8 of 13 Liner Vessels The Liner ships of the Company are sometimes engaged in the carriage of Hazardous and dangerous goods, both in the break bulk as well as container vessels. The company has developed an in-house manual which caters to shipment of International Dangerous Maritime Goods Code (IMDG) cargoes in containers. This document also highlights the company’s policy and procedures in respect of carriage of hazardous and dangerous goods and also their procedures adopted in implementing such carriage. The officers connected with dealing of hazardous goods are trained by attending various workshops and seminars and their knowledge is updated on matters involving carriage of hazardous goods. Frequent interaction with our partners in the container line, owners of vessels, other bodies have benefited SCI in developing hazardous cell. Principle 8: Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater Environmental responsibility The company is committed to environmental protection as per International Conventions for the prevention of pollutions from ships. Recently SCI has floated tender for the acquisition of 2 x 1200 Passenger vessels on behalf of Andaman & Nicobar Administration. Page 9 of 13 Even though as per IMO, EEDI regulation is not applicable to these vessels, SCI has requested shipyards to calculate the EEDI for this project on voluntary basis. This shows that SCI is committed to the UN Global Compact Initiative. In addition to above, recently SCI provided technical consultancy to Geological Survey of India (GSI) towards acquisition of Oceanographic Research vessel “Samudra Ratnakar”. These vessels will be operating mostly in Indian territorial waters and need not meet all environmental regulations which are applicable to international sea going vessels. Despite that SCI ensured that vessels comply with DNV’s CLEAN design requirements. Further, these vessels are fitted with Ballast water Treatment Plants on voluntary basis. Even the EU requirements of low sulphur fuel are applied on these vessels on voluntary basis. Principle 9: Business should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. The company is committed to doing business consciously and responsibly and believes in setting up sustainable systems to protect the environment. The business of transportation of goods by sea brings the operations of the company very close to delicate marine ecosystems and the atmosphere. Implementation of Eco-friendly technologies SCI has been taking initiatives in incorporating various measures such as • Installation of ballast water treatment plants in all new vessels being ordered well ahead of regulation coming into force to minimise transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens. • Vessels are built with a green passport and carry the inventory of Hazardous Materials. • The company while acquiring new building vessels ensures full compliance with the stringent international regulations of design and operating systems in force. • The design and equipment of these vessels further greatly reduce the environmental impact from emissions to air and also discharges to the sea. These vessels have been assigned the optional notations such as “CLEAN” or “ES”. • Company has put in place leak detection system at pre-determined intervals of CFC based refrigerants in all refrigeration and air-conditioning systems on board. • Ballast Water Treatment Plant has been fitted on voluntary basis on the new Oceanographic Research vessel. Page 10 of 13 • SCI is also encouraging shipyards to consider fuel saving devices on the new buildings. These devices can reduce the fuel consumption to some extent. These devices have been fitted on the Kamsarmax bulk carriers recently delivered to SCI. • In the recently delivered vessel “Samudra Ratnakar” for GSI, SCI has also followed the concept of Green Room. The Green Room concept basically means that all heat dissipating servers or work stations are enclosed inside separate room and isolated from the laboratory where the Scientists/Crew are working for their comfort and safety. Principle 10: Business should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Preventive Measures • Financial and commercial transactions are fully computerized on a network platform and the working is transparent and least susceptible to human manipulation. • All vessel acquisition tenders are put up on SCI website as well as Government website (Central Procurement Portal) to ensure transparency in action. • All other tenders above Rs.2 lakhs are put up on SCI and Government websites to ensure transparency in procurement. • Bidders are invited for opening of tenders at both the stages i.e. technical bid opening and price bid opening. Both the bids are opened in presence of representatives of SCI and bidders. • In case of second hand vessels, where confidentiality is required to be maintained, price bids are opened in presence of SCI nominated Independent External Monitor to ensure transparency. • “Procure to Pay” procedure is integrated in the computer system which enhances the transparency in procurement cycle. • Payments are directly credited to the bank accounts of parties/employees through electronic payment modes offered by banks. • SCI has switched over to the electronic sale/auction process from its current physical tender process for sale of vessels. Apart from being popular, the electronic processes ensure transparency and work against social evils such as corruption bribery etc. • The details of contracts awarded over Rs 50 lakhs are posted on the SCI website on a monthly basis. Adoption of Integrity Pact SCI has taken a leap forward towards ensuring further transparency, equity and competitiveness in public procurements by adopting Integrity Pact Programme for Page 11 of 13 major public procurements in company. The Integrity Pact is applicable to public procurements above threshold value of Rs. One Crore. The Integrity Pact (IP) was designed and launched by Transparency International in the 1990s with the primary objective of safe-guarding public procurement from corruption. Thus, Integrity Pact is a tool to help Govt., businesses and civil society to fight corruption in the field of public contracting and ensures that all activities and transactions between a Company and their suppliers are handled in a fair, transparent and corruption free manner. Independent External Monitors (IEMs) are appointed to monitor implementation of Integrity Pact.
