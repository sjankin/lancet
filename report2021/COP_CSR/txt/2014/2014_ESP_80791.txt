Francesc Llobell. President 4 Consum Sustainability Report 2013 a committed company 5 Francesc Llobell President 6 Letter From the President (1.1, ES 1.1) I am extremely pleased to be presenting this new Sustainability Report, which again goes to show all there is behind a socially responsible company. As the years have gone by we have gradually established our Corporate Responsibility policy through sustainable initiatives, managed with approaches involving economic, environmental and social efficiency, always focussing on the central core of people, who, since cooperatives were first set up, have been their reason for existing. As a Cooperative proud to be one, we work year after year so that our development, based on sustainable growth, can continue to be a successful formula for generating and distributing wealth, apart from fostering solidarity among all those who form part of this, because behind Consum there is a company with a commitment to all its interest groups; there is profitability properly understood, with profits for all; there are innovative initiatives; there is stable, quality employment which produces committed workers and consequently satisfied customers; there is a less contaminated planet; there is far more than just words; there is transparency, in fact. As part of the Cooperative’s philosophy, in 2013 the norms for corporate governance were defined through the approval of the Code of Good Practice of the Corporate Government. Its aim for 2014 will be to put these rules into practice, as part of the campaigns for management of workers’ attitude, known as “anfitriones” and “estás on”, which are based on excellence in service to customers. We are persuaded that all the endeavours which are intended to improve the cooperative model will work, because a business in which all the groups involved play a major role in its evolution works out in a socially responsible management, which is furthermore profitable. This had led us to receive a large number of different kinds of public recognition in the different spheres of our business, which we are proud of, because behind each recognition lies the effort made by everyone who forms part of Consum: the workers, the customer-members, the franchisees and suppliers. 7 Juan Luis Durich Director General 8 Letter From the direCtor-GenerAL (1.1) One more year I am pleased to be addressing readers of this Report to provide an appraisal of accounting period 2013. In a period defined by a complicated economic situation, significantly marked by the slump in consumption, I would like to convey a confident message to our partners, workers and customers, suppliers, franchisees and in general to society a whole. After an awkward first six months, some degree of recovery started to be appreciated from halfway through 2013; this can be vouched for by the Cooperative’s results. Consum thus closed the year with a turnover of 1840.3 million euros, 4.31% more than the previous year, and a profit of 32.2 million euros, 0.33% more than the previous year. These results were possible thanks to the efforts made by the nearly 11,000 Consum workers and the trust placed in us by over 2 million customer-members. This year the first period of the Operating Plan 2013-2014 concluded, reinforcing Consum’s presence in the zones where it works. In this respect, the Cooperative has invested 81.4 million euros in 2013, mainly for opening new supermarkets, adapting the network and building a new logistics platform in Barcelona Free Zone, which will supply 150 shops. These and other measures will give us an impetus to take on this coming year 2014 with verve. On the commercial level, always concentrating on listening to and catering for customers’ needs, we go on with our commitment to the ability to choose, to variety, quality and the best price. We thus set out to be references in the fresh produce sections, reducing the time it takes the product to get here from its source, offering the most extensive range and always at the optimum point of ripeness. We will also go on working to consolidate our own brand as a quality alternative at a good price, enabling the consumer to save right from the very first unit. To round off the commercial cycle, we will be improving our interest programme so that the member will always feel satisfied. Well aware of the environmental impact generated by our business, in 2013 we continued to place our commitment on renewable energy sources, as these make up 67% of the total energy consumed by the organisation. With the aim of reducing our Carbon Footprint even more than ever, measures have been taken to minimise the consumption of materials. The energy savings policy, along with the control of goods transport, have contributed to improving Consum’s carbon footprint by 8% and for next year work is being done on a new calculation which will enable us to have this certified. None of this would ever have been possible without a great staff, because people are our driving force, and if we all head in the same direction and focus our efforts on attaining certain aims, the final result is always satisfactory. We would like to thank our suppliers for the trust that they have placed in us, the franchisees, for their commitment to a business model which works, our customers, for their loyalty, and our workers – stressing that this year we have increased our workforce by 537 persons to reach 10,977, stable quality jobs. My thanks to each and every one of them, because the cooperative management model proves that great things can be done when we work as a team. 9 profit 32.2 million euros 0.33% more thAn the Previous yeAr sales 1840.3 million euros 4.31% more thAn the Previous yeAr investments 81.4 million euros workers 10,977 537 more thAn the Previous yeAr work-personal life balance 5.5 million euros 509 euros Per worker ‘profit’ scheme (solidarity work) 6 million euros in Food donAtions 10 Consum Sustainability Report 2013 shops 625 innovation 7.9 million euros environmental expenses and investments 4.5 million euros sharing the Cooperative’s annual profits among the worker-members 16.9 million euros 1714 euros on AverAGe Per worker-member customer-members 2,165,648 gift cheques for customer-members 20.9 million euros 11 1 a committed company PresentAtion (2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 4.8) Consum is the biggest cooperative in the Spanish Mediterranean arch and does business in the commercial distribution sector, through Consum and Consum Basic supermarkets Committed workers and Charter franchises.

In order to be able to assess its proper progress, the Governing Board and Management Board work with indicators showing up the impacts and possible deviations generated, facilitating feedback processes. The annual Management Plan is the process of defining and monitoring economic, environmental and social objectives. The annual, monthly and weekly objectives are defined in this, along with progress indicators. These also specify the actions, deadlines for accomplishment, competences and resources needed to carry these out. The progress indicators are given in the COPLAN application.

This means that the basic wage for the worker-member at the Cooperative is always over the local minimum wage. The worker-member operating personnel at Consum (who make up 89% of the staff) are paid, from the second year (when they are consolidated as members) an average gross monthly wage of 1553 €, considering the cooperative worker-member’s advance payment and the part for the share in profits, as well as any incentives that they may collect through attaining the targets set. The minimum initial wage of a worker-member at Consum is over 56% higher than the minimum inter-professional wage. The total salary expenses of the Cooperative during business year 2013 came to 239.3 million euros, including salaries, pensions and other benefits and compensation.

At Consum there is no difference in the basic wage for men and women 2012 in the same working category. The organisational change introduced in 228,889,664 2013 and Consum’s Equality Policy are helping more women to reach positions of responsibility. This is being consolidated, without yet having reached the maximum remuneration pertaining to them, according to the Cooperative’s Valuation Regulation, in which there is no difference per sex. Even so, in 2013, the difference between the average salary rate of 2013 men and women is 0.41 as an absolute value.

This is a project directly addressing the customer at supermarkets, to ensure that they are all satisfied. To achieve this the workers at the Cooperative’s supermarkets have received the ‘Good Hosting Guide’, a personalised instrument for each job of work, which shows what their attitude should be and explains the working procedure that ought to be used to make sure that we offer the best product and the best service: these procedures are perfected through continuous training.
