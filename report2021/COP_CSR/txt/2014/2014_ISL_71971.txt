The Bank wants to contribute positively to social progress and to the success of future generations. In 2013 the bank launched a project to coordinate the strategic approach of our CSR policy and to build awareness within the bank. This initiative reflects the Bank’s emphasis on social responsibility which is now an inherent part of the Bank’s strategic themes. Responsible banking Birna Einarsdóttir, CEO Responsible banking is integrated into our operations. We have numerous stakeholders with whom we need to connect and engage with continuously. The strategic work has involved all of the Bank’s employees. The first phase consisted of a CSR assessment and audit. During this phase dozens of interviews were conducted with members of the Executive Board, the Board of Directors, Branch Directors, employees as well as heads of divisions with the aim of getting an overview of initiatives and policies already in place and developing a working definition of CSR for Íslandsbanki. Corporate documents and processes were reviewed, workshops were held with the bank’s leadership team and employees were surveyed on their interest in, and opinions on, CSR in a survey. A report on the outcome of the assessment was presented to the Executive Board in January 2014. Connect CSR strategy to business strategy In February 2014 the Board of Directors decided that responsible banking would be one of three pillars of the Bank’s business strategy. In the second phase the Bank’s CSR team worked with consultants and heads of divisions in defining specific policies and initiatives, shaping the Bank’s commitments and strategy in the field of sustainability. An outline of the strategy was presented at the Bank’s annual Strategy Summit in March 2014 where employees were given an opportunity to voice their opinions and take part in defining and shaping the strategy. A total of 700 employees out of our 1,000 employees participated in the work. Our aim is to connect the CSR strategy strongly to every aspect of our daily business. Global Compact Report — 2014 5 Healthy banking The idea that healthy banking is based on strong ethics and the highest operational standards bringing benefits to our customers, employees and society as a whole lies at the core of our approach. We have divided healthy banking into four categories: • Responsible operations – we emphasise best practices in corporate governance, efficiency and risk management • Responsible workplace – we promote an environment of diversity, equal opportunities and purpose for employees • Responsible environment – we place emphasis on sustainability and we want to measure and minimize our ecological footprint • Responsible society we want to contribute to making our society a better place to work and live in In 2014 we will focus on implementing our strategy which includes new initiatives as well as defining specific targets and measuring progress within each category. Our vision of healthy banking is based on the understanding that a healthy financial system is a cornerstone of a stable society and a prerequisite for a sustainable economy. Realising the strategy Íslandsbanki adheres to and supports the United Nations guiding principles for corporate social responsibility; the Global Compact. As one of Iceland’s leading companies and biggest workplace, the Bank embraces the responsibility of its actions and encourages a positive impact on the society. It is not enough to sign a well phrased policy about being socially responsible. It has to be integrated into the business model and supported at all levels in the Bank. It is a substantial task we take seriously and we strive to improve each and every day.

Global Compact Report — 2014 11 Being socially responsible The Bank wants to contribute positively to social progress and the well-being of future generations to a level that is above and beyond what is required by law. It is about being a good role model. For the last five years Íslandsbanki has been adhering to the UN Global Compact on social responsibility. The compact is a guide for companies on how to be socially responsible in practice. Íslandsbanki works within the parameters set by the compact and they have scoped the Bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility policy. The policy covers four key areas: Business, Human capital, the Environment and the Community. The Bank’s participation in community programmes is based on those areas. Four main pillars of social responsibility: Business Environment Íslandsbanki endeavours to serve its customers Íslandsbanki seeks to work in harmony with the environment, as reflected in its operations, management through clear regulations, efficient disclosure practices and investments. of information, increased transparency, and fair treatment of all its customers. Human capital Community Íslandsbanki aims to recruit, strengthen and Íslandsbanki contributes to the community by supporting various social, artistic, cultural and sporting retain a skilled and conscientious workforce. The activities, as well as encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship. Bank aspires to employ an ambitious and varied group of people, with differing backgrounds and experience. 12 Global Compact Report — 2014 New CSR Policy and implementation In 2014 Íslandsbanki is in the process of crafting a new CSR policy. Our main focus is to integrate social responsibility into all its activities, from daily operations to lending and investments. The CSR strategy process can be viewed below: January 2014 February 2014 April 2014 October 2014 Project plan approved Board approves CSR CSR committee New CSR policy by management board as a strategic theme established presented November 2013 March 2014 August 2014 Data gathering Strategic theme 2015 objectives and management presented for leaders defined interviews at leadership courses Annual strategy summit with focus on CSR The LazyTown Run is a popular family fun run held in relation with the Íslandsbanki Reykjavik Marathon where thousands of kids and parents participate every year Global Compact Report — 2014 13 Business The Bank’s most important social purpose relates to its very function and role as a bank. This purpose is to provide capital for investment and the growth of Icelandic business and industry and to work with retail customers and companies in their enterprises. At Íslandsbanki, our primary goal is to fulfil our role with a balance of enthusiasm and prudence. Íslandsbanki is committed to providing customers with effective communication, transparency and equal treatment. The Bank places an emphasis on good service to customers to ensure customers’ satisfaction and trust in the Bank. 14 Global Compact Report — 2014 Healthy business Íslandsbanki offers universal banking services and is one of Iceland’s leading companies. As a large workplace with a very broad client base, the bank has made it a priority to maintain a good relationship with its immediate environment and customers. Íslandsbanki endeavours to bring a progressive, professional and positive approach to all its activities and believes that if it can be guided by those values, it can build a responsible, open and reliable bank that plays a proactive role in the enhancement of the community and environment in which it operates. With a clear vision to be #1 in service, Íslandsbanki has addressed the adversities arising from the downturn of 2008 in a positive, professional, and progressive way. The bank’s strategic direction is guided by three themes of relationship banking, simplified banking and responsible banking. It is supported by clear, quantifiable financial targets and is implemented through key projects. Strategy pyramid The building blocks of Íslandsbanki’s overarching strategic policy are illustrated in graphic form using the strategy pyramid. The Bank’s overall policy has been refined slightly since its introduction in 2009, and three strategic themes were incorporated into the strategy pyramid during a comprehensive review in 2013. These themes set out our strategic direction for the next three to five years and differentiate us from our peers. In the five years since the Bank’s establishment, we have built a robust, reliable bank based on a sustainable universal banking model. Our recovery path can be described in terms of three strategic steps: back to basics, consolidation, and building a sustainable future for Íslandsbanki Strategy pyramid Global Compact Report — 2014 15 Back to basics At the time of its establishment in 2008, Íslandsbanki faced significant challenges. The country had suffered a systemic collapse of its financial markets. No one knew what the future held, economically or politically, and no one knew what effect the collapse would have on households’ and businesses’ debt position. The trust that had been built up over 100 years had more or less evaporated overnight, employees were demoralised and disoriented, and customers were angry and demanded action. In order to succeed, it was essential to engage the Bank’s employees and encourage them to take an active part in mapping a strategic direction for the Bank. We took great care to conduct households’ and businesses’ financial restructuring according to the highest professional standards in order to safeguard our relationship with our customers and regain their trust. The Bank also made a substantial effort to improve its infrastructure and promote sound governance practices. In addressing legacy issues and executing our strategy, we have transformed our Bank and regained the trust of our customers. Indeed, confidence in the Bank measures higher today than it did in early 2008. As a result, in terms of size, operations, and corporate governance, Íslandsbanki is a completely different entity from its predecessor. Consolidation We want to create a responsible and sustainable future for banking in Iceland. In 20112012, we participated actively in the much-needed consolidation of Iceland’s financial market. We also strengthened our balance sheet and increased our market share through bolt-on acquisitions of Byr, Kreditkort, and FramtídarAudur. Our objectives were to operate the most efficient branch network in the country, gain market share in order to support cross-selling more effectively, and cut costs. Building a sustainable future These important steps helped us to build an outstanding platform for organic growth. A significant increase in market share and a larger customer base give us the opportunity to leverage our relationship banking model. The core of this strategy is cross-selling; i.e., doing more business with our existing customers by using data analysis, cross functional processes, and channels. At the same time, we will continue to realise synergies and focus on cost-efficiency and streamlining. Internationally, the Bank will expand on its established expertise in the seafood, energy, and offshore service vessel industries throughout the North Atlantic region. 16 Global Compact Report — 2014 Corporate Governance Sound governance promotes improved work habits and communications, which in turn enhances trust and confidence among shareholders, the Board, management, employees, and other stakeholders in the Bank. The Iceland Chamber of Commerce, the Confederation of Icelandic Employers and the Centre for Corporate Governance at the University of Iceland acclaimed Íslandsbanki as “Exemplary in Corporate Governance” at the beginning of the year 2014. A clear governance framework strengthens the Bank’s infrastructure and clarifies responsibility, thereby strengthening the foundations of the Bank’s objectives. Íslandsbanki’s governance practices are consistent with general corporate governance guidelines for entities regulated by official supervisors and regulatory instruments. The management and control of Íslandsbanki are shared by shareholders, the Board, and the CEO in accordance with the Bank’s Articles of Association, other Board directives, and the external regulatory environment. Íslandsbanki was acclaimed Exemplary in Corporate Governance in 2014 Decision-making matrix One of Íslandsbanki’s key projects recently focused on sound governance principles. The project entailed mapping out all major decisions that the Bank may wish to take under given circumstances. This was done in order to foster improved decision making and ensure that the decisions taken within the Bank fulfil the appropriate requirements at any given time. Methodology The decision-making matrix was formally launched on 1 November 2012 and has been in effect since that time. In order to fulfil its obligations to observe sound governance practises, the Bank has defined the following methodology for major decisions. • The Bank’s decisions serve the interests of the Bank and its stakeholders in accordance with current regulatory instruments, the documents pertaining to the Bank’s establishment, and the Bank’s contractual obligations • Decisions are taken by the parties (shareholders, Board members, supervisors, managers, or employees) best qualified to carry them out effectively and efficiently in view of their professional obligations, sphere of responsibility and interest, knowledge and expertise and access to the appropriate information • Decisions are based on the best available information and are taken following appropriate scrutiny.

The policy, which is required under Pillar 3 of the Basel framework, outlines the governing principles and framework for external disclosure and communication. The Bank believes in open and consistent communication with its stakeholders as it is essential for trust building and for maintaining a good relationship. Íslandsbanki aims to make correct and sufficient disclosure of material information and keep the disclosure accessible to all relevant stakeholders in a compliant, reliable, useful, timely and consistent manner. The main channel for Íslandsbanki’s risk and capital management disclosure is through the Risk report, the Annual report, the quarterly financial statements and investor presentations. If material risk exposures change significantly between reporting periods, the Bank can choose to disclose this information more frequently. Accordingly, Íslandsbanki may decide not to disclose information that is considered to be immaterial. In addition, the Bank will not disclose information that is deemed to be proprietary or confidential. The classification of proprietary and confidential information is based on Icelandic law and regulation. 18 Global Compact Report — 2014 Risk Report Íslandsbanki has published for the fourth time a special Risk Report. The report provides detailed information on the Bank’s risk profile and risk management. The objective of Íslandsbanki’s Risk Report is to provide market participants and other stakeholders with information that facilitates a better understanding of Íslandsbanki’s risk profile and capital adequacy, and thus comply with Basel disclosure requirements. The Risk Report presents comprehensive information on the Bank’s risk governance, risk assessment processes, material risk exposures, capital adequacy and capital composition. In addition, it provides detailed information about the restructuring and recalculation of distressed debt which have been key tasks since the establishment of the Bank in 2008. The Risk Report also gives a short introduction to the main domestic legislative and regulatory changes, as well as information on the Bank’s remuneration policy. At year-end 2012 the Bank was in compliance with its defined risk appetite and all regulatory requirements were fulfilled. The Risk Report can be found on the Bank’s website: www.islandsbanki.is/riskreport “Risk management is at the heart of Íslandsbanki’s operations and the Bank works constantly to improve its risk and capital management framework. The Bank allocates substantial resources to this area in order to meet the highest and latest international standards. The Bank’s risk governance and risk appetite is implemented Sverrir Örn Thorvaldsson through policies approved by the Board of Directors. Chief Risk Officer This report provides insight into the many aspects of the Bank’s risk proﬁle and risk management.” Global Compact Report — 2014 19 Anti-corruption The Compliance unit is responsible for monitoring and assessing on a regular basis the appropriateness and effectiveness of measures undertaken by Íslandsbanki to ensure that the work carried out by the Bank, its Board, and its employees is in compliance with current laws, regulations, and internal rules and procedures at all times and that it is consistent with sound and appropriate business practise. Íslandsbanki’s Compliance Officer is appointed by the CEO and has an independent position in the Bank’s organisational chart. The Officer files reports to the CEO and the Board on regular basis. Internal Audit Compliance risk is defined as the Group Internal Audit provides Íslandsbanki with independent, impartial confirmation and consultancy risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, designed to add value and improve the Bank’s operations. It helps the Bank to assess and improve financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s the effectiveness of its risk management, monitoring, and governance practises. Furthermore, Group reputation in the event of failure to Internal Audit leads investigations into possible instances of misconduct in the Bank’s operations.

Internal Audit, the Compliance department carries out a special Anti-money laundering “fit-and-proper” test undergone by Íslandsbanki is committed to the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In this managers and key employees. regard the Bank has set for itself rules that are based on and in strictest compliance with Measures to Prevent Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, as subsequently amended, and guidelines of the Financial Supervisory Authority-Iceland (FME). These rules mandate identity verification whenever the Bank enters into “a permanent contractual (business) relationship” with a new customer. Such verification shall involve identifying and verifying the customer’s identity using information or data from a reliable and independent source. These rules apply to the Bank, its branches and its subsidiaries. All employees are obliged to attend a lecture on anti-money laundering. An electronic monitoring system (Norkom) for money laundering was set up in 2009 in collaboration with the Icelandic Banks Data Centre. The system has increased the Bank’s security and reduced the risk of fraud for money laundering purposes. Operational risk The Bank has adopted the definition of operational risk from the European Parliament and of the European Council, where operational risk is defined “as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events“. The Bank’s definition of operational risk includes legal risk, compliance risk, and reputational risk. The Board has defined limits for acceptable losses due to operational risk, and if quarterly losses exceed a certain limit, a report of the losses and a risk mitigation plan is delivered to the Executive Board or the Board of Directors. 20 Global Compact Report — 2014 Responsible lending Íslandsbanki’s lending policies and practices aim to ensure that clients are treated fairly. Íslandsbanki is committed to avoiding over-indebting clients, by offering well-designed products and carefully evaluate the customer’s ability to meet his obligations. A new law on consumer lending were applied on 1st of November. The legislation stipulates increased disclosure of information by financial institutions to borrowers. The new legislation also places increased responsibilities on borrowers to provide detailed information about their financial situation when applying for credit. The law is based in part on the EU directive which is intended to ensure a consistent regulatory environment in the European Economic Area, promote increased disclosure of information and facilitate consumer comparisons on credit terms. The Bank’s employees have reviewed and updated loan processes in relation with the new law on consumer lending. This has also improved disclosure on information to customers and a more thourough evaluation of their creditworthiness. Promoting education and financial literacy Íslandsbanki has set out to boost financial literacy in Iceland through a series of educational courses and seminars. Keeping the customers well informed is important to the Bank.
