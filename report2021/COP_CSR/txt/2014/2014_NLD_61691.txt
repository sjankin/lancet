Letter of the CEO P a g e 3 of 4 3 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2. Introduction and scope of COP B&S is modern and professional organisation a long and strong track record. The Company is a leading partner in the wholesale and distribution of Fast Moving Consumer Goods, active in various nice markets with the head offices in the Netherlands near the harbour of Rotterdam. With our background in the Netherlands and being used to professional business conduct, the areas of Human Rights and Labour Rights are well regarded. In this respect we mainly focus on our location in Afghanistan, were the impact of our actions regarding Labour Rights is of higher relevancy. We maintain a high responsibility to the community. We further continuously strive to an enterprising, well-respected and trustworthy organisation that makes a sustainable contribution towards society. In the interests of our stakeholders we further maintain the highest ethical standards in all aspects of our business with high respect for Human Rights and Labour conditions. In accordance with legal regulations and vis-à-vis all its stakeholders it is the responsibility of our Company to strive continuously to apply sustainable practices in order to rank among the leading enterprises in our industry. In this Communication on Progress, we provide an update of the Company’s activities in respect of the 10 UN principles by reflecting on the reporting period February 2013 to January 2014. This report includes far more information than the previous reports. The Group’s strategy is included and gives a view on how we integrate sustainability in to our long-term vision. This report also includes “Context of Operation and verification” which discloses the Company’s profile, mission, vision, DNA, Corporate structure, key financial data and other Company data. It gives a broader picture of the B&S Group and its activities. Additionally we incorporated information on Corporate governance and Corporate Social Responsibility as well as the Company’s Risk management. These are all standards elements in our day-to day business, being regularly reviewed and updated. They are stated in our Annual Reports and based on Company policies, guidelines and procedures. In this year’s “Communication on progress” we have identified the main goals, boundaries and main risks per UNGC discipline. The update is further expanded with clear Company actions in the reporting period and a “Measurement of Outcome” table. This is considered an important improvement from our previous reports. P a g e 4 of 4 3 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 3. B&S: strategy and overview During the 2013 year the B&S division remained very committed to investing in clients, personnel, suppliers and sustainable business. Last year we rolled-out our new ‘in good hands’ concept. Our amended client approach has already had a positive impact, with our closest clients becoming even closer business partners. Despite more difficult market conditions the B&S Group reported a good financial year during 2013 with turnover and bottom line result similar to 2012. Our new approach enables us to offer supplementary services to some of our retail partners. These services, which range from assistance with promotional activities to optimising inventory supplies, create added value for our clients. This strengthens our client bonds and enables us to develop more sustainable relationships. Putting customers first – in other words, customer centricity – is fundamental to how we operate within B&S. The importance of operating a sustainable business lies in the unique concept of our Company, which is down to the drive and spirit of our people, the Company structure, and the relationship we have with our clients. For us, sustainable business means putting long-term vision ahead of short-term profits. That long-term vision goes further than our bottom line result; it means adding value in everything we do. It is about our relationship with clients, suppliers, the wellbeing and development of our employees, as well as our relationship with the environment. Developing sustainable relationships with our employees and our clients is already part of our core values, but the role of sustainability will take on even greater importance within the business as we go forward. This is one of the reasons why we support the UN Global Compact. As a leading organisation we show our commitment to the ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. When we develop our business, we look for sustainable solutions. One good example of sustainability in action is our engagement with Eindhoven Airport in the Airport Carbon Accreditation program, where we are actively involved in promoting the awareness amongst our employees as well as to carry out actions in order to reduce the airport carbon footprint. In our warehouses in the North of Holland, we invested in a fully automated storage system for an affiliated company. It has brought us new clients, who now benefit from a more advanced and reliable picking process and shorter lead times in the ordering process. At the same time, it has resulted in lower energy use and less maintenance costs. Another vital form of sustainability within the Company is full compliance at all stages of the business process. Our stakeholders expect and demand the toughest criteria to be applied P a g e 5 of 4 3 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress across all compliance issues, from food safety and transparency through to customs clearance and legal compliance. Internally, we invest a great deal of time and resources into ensuring compliance is top-of-mind and managed to the highest standards. For that reason, sustainability and risk management have been recurring topics on our management agenda. In this report we elaborate further on how we view risks and how we mitigate these risks. It highlights our strong belief in operating a Company that greatly values social responsibility and is risk adverse. Strategy The Company’s strategy is based on adding value for both its clients and its suppliers by making their interests converge. We deliver a wide assortment of goods to our clients in markets in which our suppliers are unable to deliver. These niche markets are often remote and difficult to reach, which means clients’ demands cannot easily be met. By balancing the needs of both parties we add value to the chain. Our strategy is based on four basic aspects, the pillars of our organisation. P a g e 6 of 4 3 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Growth is the lifeblood of B&S and the premier pillar of the Group’s strategy. We firmly believe that growth is based on innovation and quality, fuelled by entering into new BALANCED GROWTH markets and by continuously making use of new business opportunities. Growth certainly leads the Company further and energizes the organisation. The growth strategy is based on: Organic growth and on growth through acquisitions  Sustainable growth  Innovation  Quality growth  Diversified growth  Profitable growth B&S aims to sustain its outstanding competitive and leading position in its markets. COST LEADERSHIP The Group strives continuously for further improvements in efficiency and economies of scale in order to lower corporate expenditure in relation to turnover. This is being achieved through bulk purchasing and investments in ultra-modern and innovative logistic concepts and ICT solutions and through synergy advantages achieved through the active cooperation of the various business units within the Group. Excellent added-value and service during and between business activities makes B&S is a unique business partner. Added-value forms the bond between clients and suppliers and creates long-term relationships built on expertise and involvement. CLIENT CENTRICITY Sales activities are always combined with a complete service that includes client support, customs handling and transportation. The Company strives for partnerships and long-term relationships with its clients. The organisational model is designed to be as flexible, efficient and responsive as possible. This is achieved through: Short communication lines from top to bottom and across the Company;  A motivated team of young/dynamic staff with creative problem-solving minds;  A hands-on mentality;  The greatest command of customs licences; B&S supplies and sources products at a global level in different niche markets. This DIVERSIFICATION means the Company is well diversified in markets, products and regions and also has a wide client portfolio. One of B&S strengths is its expertise in accessing remote areas and markets at an early stage. This enables our suppliers to launch products in these markets, which is considered a strong competitive advantage. P a g e 7 of 4 3 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 4.

B&S headquarters in Dordrecht, the Netherlands. Page 12 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 5. Corporate governance B&S B.V. is a private limited liability company established under the laws of the Netherlands. The Company considers the interests of all its stakeholders, from clients and suppliers to staff and shareholders and from financiers to governmental institutions, to be important. The desire to pursue best practices is embedded in the Company’s corporate philosophy and policies. The Company’s governing bodies are aware that the environment is constantly changing as well as of the necessity of having consistent Corporate Governance guidelines that assist them in carrying out their responsibilities. The Board of Directors is responsible for the Company’s day-to day affairs, its strategy and the advocacy of the general stakeholders’ interests and is based on the creation of an optimum span of control. A number of centralised corporate departments, (legal affairs, HRM, M&A, marketing, logistics, ICT and Finance & Control), assist the management at the helm of the Group in making effective steering decisions. As much authority as possible is delegated to the divisions and their business units. Within agreed guidelines the Group’s staff, especially its senior managers, enjoy a high degree of autonomy and responsibility. This philosophy encourages staff to develop as experts in their business while, at the same time, functioning as co-entrepreneurs. The composition of the Board of Directors does not reflect a situation as described in article 276 Book 2 Dutch Civil Code. Control over the Company through the Board of Directors is to a large extent influenced by the ultimate shareholders. A balanced situation as outlined in the above mentioned articles would only be realised if and when vacancies may become available and only to the extent that compliant candidates are of equal quality. Page 13 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 6. Corporate Social Responsibility The B&S Group’s stability is based on profitable growth. The Company strives continuously to act as an enterprising, well-respected and trustworthy organisation that makes a sustainable contribution towards society and sees global citizenship as the seamless merging of profit and purpose. We believe it is possible to strive for a profitable business while serving a greater good. In fact, we view the two as inextricably linked. The aim of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy is to promote the Company’s longterm viability by balancing the needs of its stakeholders and delivering sustainable returns to its shareholders, while simultaneously introducing initiatives to reduce its environmental footprint and contribute towards the community. As a support to long-term growth, the Company constantly invests in the most up-to-date logistic facilities and innovative logistic concepts and ICT solutions and seeks improvements to its entrepreneurial policies, working methods and best practices so as to enhance its leading positions in its respective markets. This is why we are committed to our strategic approach of mutual trust between our Company, our clients and our suppliers and, above all, operating in accordance with a sustainable business model. The Company’s commitment to sustainability is embedded in its promise to its clients and embodied by its employees, who continuously deliver excellence in all its services. We recognise our responsibility to make a positive difference related to a host of sustainability issues in order to drive the growth of the Company while creating social value. B&S CSR policy covers the following aspects:  Integrity and legal compliance  Assets, data handling and information  Working conditions and working environment  Environment  Community The complete CSR policy is incorporated in the Company’s Annual Report 2013. Page 14 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 7. Risk management and internal control Risk management and internal control form an integral part of the Company’s day-to-day business operations. The corporate strategy is focussed on seizing entrepreneurial opportunities while, at the same time, managing risks effectively.The corporate policy is to safeguard the Company’s continuity while maintaining a balance between risk appetite and financial returns. The Board of Directors, supported by senior managers within the organisation, is responsible for identifying, prioritising and mitigating risk and maintaining a robust risk management system and internal control mechanisms The Company’s risk profile is regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors. Although the Company’s risk profile did not change fundamentally, the risk review in 2013 led to adjustments to the risk management framework, which is now classified in accordance with the COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework. As a result the Company’s risk profile has been divided into the following risk categories:  Strategic risks  Operational risks  Legal compliance risks  Financial and reporting risks Strategic risks are the risks that can prevent the Company from achieving its strategic ambition. Operational risks are closely related to the business operations. Legal compliance risks relate to risks arising from changes in regulations and applicable laws. The Financial and reporting risks are limited to financial matters and transparent reporting, both internally and externally. Particular risks can fall into more than one category or have overlapping determinants. This risk management framework is firmly embedded in the Company guidelines and policies and supports the achievement of the Company’s strategic, operational and financial targets while complying with legislation and regulations. The Company’s risk opinion is determined by the likelihood of the risk occurring and its potential impact on the achievement of the Company’s strategy. The following table shows a brief summary of the main risks that the Board of Directors has identified. These risks and the measures that have been taken to mitigate these risks are described in more detail in the Company’s Annual Report 2013. Page 15 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Although the Board of Directors believes that the risks and uncertainties described in the next few pages are the most material risks, other risks might be present. All of these factors are contingencies, which may or may not occur. Potential other risks and uncertainties that have not yet been identified or that are currently deemed immaterial may also have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, operations and financial performance. Sensitivity analysis and benchmarking Throughout the year the Board of Directors, senior managers, financial controllers, internal compliance officers and risk officers carry out self-assessment tests. These are combined with various external audits in relation to the defined key risk areas. For several risks the Company is used to go through various sorts of sensitivity analysis. Carrying out a sensitivity analysis of key risk areas enables the approximate exposure in the event that certain specified parameters were to be met under a specific set of assumptions to be estimated. The range of changes chosen reflects the changes, which, in the Company’s view, are reasonably possible during a one-year period. The scenarios that are tested relate to, but are not limited to, rapid changes in market conditions, changes in gross margin, increases in interest rate and currency fluctuations. The effects on the Company’s net result, cash flow and equity are analysed. These scenarios do not reflect any action the Board of Directors could take which might mitigate the effects. In 2013, although the outcome of these tests revealed some negative effects on the Company’s overall financial standing, they also showed that the Company remains within its long-term targets and financial guidance. This demonstrates that the Company has adequate buffers for dealing with substantial effects of potential risks. As a Company that holds sizeable levels of inventory with certain volatility during the year, we also carry out critical stress tests on the theoretical financial boundaries of inventory positions versus equity, covenants and working capital financing. In addition to the sensitive analysis the Company also applies benchmark assignments within the organisation. A benchmark analysis involves comparing various metrics with the averages of peer organisations and best practices for individual business segments within the Group. These benchmark analyses are supporting strategic decisions, but also provide forward-looking insight. The results of control self-assessments, audits, scenarios and benchmarks are reported frequently and discussed with and between the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Board. The outcome is further used for internal staff training and for improving the risk awareness within the organization amongst staff members.

Human Rights principles Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Overview The B&S organisation is mainly based in the Netherlands and the majority of the business is directed from the Netherlands, where the key offices and staff are situated. The Group further operates a warehouse in Afghanistan. B&S is a modern and professional company that adheres to national laws, rules and regulations in the countries in which it is active. All employees are offered the best possible conditions. As a minimum these conditions exceed the ILO labour conventions. Our Company respects human rights and always treats people with respect and dignity. B&S is never involved in any child labour or forced labour. There is no discrimination of gender, age, race and religion in employment of B&S staff. As the Company mainly operates from the Netherlands and adheres to local laws, the Human Rights principles are well taken care of. In Afghanistan were we also operate a warehouse, the national Human Rights conditions may be found different from what we are used to in Europe. With the standard Human Rights conditions that the Company is accustomed to and following our own beliefs and standards, we apply Human Rights similarly in Afghanistan. This is applicable for our own staff as well as for all other stakeholders in and around the Company. In the next paragraphs, we will provide further details of the progress that was made in relation to our Afghan offices and warehouses during the last year.. Assessment, policy and goals We emphasize our support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The protection of the Human Rights is derived from group ethics, rules and policies and further based on applicable policies from the ILO and UN conventions, all as far as relevant for the activities of our Company and our industry. The relevant procedures are firmly embedded in the Company’s Code of Conduct, which is applicable for all staff members working within our Company. The Code of Conduct includes policies on respecting and supporting Human rights. It also includes a non-discrimination clause. All staff members should understand the principles, procedures and guidelines stated in this Corporate Code of Conduct. It is expected that staff members work in the spirit of those principles and actively propagate them in order to protect or to improve the Company’s integrity and reputation. Page 19 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Company managers are expected to lead according to our standards of ethical conduct, in both words and actions. Managers are responsible for promoting open and honest two-way communications. Managers must be positive activists and role models and must be diligent in reporting unethical or illegal conduct.

Overivew As it’s our people who make the difference when it comes to serving our stakeholders, human resources are considered a strategic factor. B&S has set itself challenging but realistic goals and, as a consequence, human resources management is a decisive factor and primarily focused on supporting the sustainable growth of the Company through an operational staff of talented people. The human resources function within B&S is set to ensure the quality of our human capital and has the opportunity to help shape the Company’s future by focusing on the career development, retention, work safety and well-being of staff members. The Company offers an international and high-quality working environment in which performance and world-class leadership are promoted. Assessment, policy and goals Our ambition is to be amongst the most attractive and active employers within our industry. All employees have standard working hours, based on local regulations and industry standards and in accordance with the ILO conventions. All employees receive fair compensation for their work in line with local minimum requirements specified by the law and by the industry standards in relevant countries as well as by ILO conventions. B&S employees have the right to a healthy and safe workplace. This is particularly important when it comes to working conditions in the Company’s warehouses and for operational activities. B&S has always invested in state-of-the-art equipment and materials. At the same time we do our utmost to ensure the safety of third parties, their goods and the environment. As far as our offices are concerned, all the Group companies use the latest technology and provide high-quality employee facilities including catering. The main offices have modern fitness facilities that are available to our employees. These facilities offer both novice and advanced sportsmen and women a perfect place to exercise and workout under professional supervision in order to keep fit and maintain a healthy lifestyle. The good working conditions and positive working atmosphere within our organisation contribute towards the general motivation and effectiveness of the Company as well as the structurally low average absenteeism. The sickness rate in 2013 was approximately 2.8%, slightly above the 2.7% in 2012. Page 21 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Implementation (actions) 2013 Topic 1. Procedure review and discussion with senior management on breaches On a yearly base the Company review procedures and has discussions between the Board of Directors and senior managers on the effectiveness and completeness of the procedures, breaches, and incidents. Topic 2. Labour conditions Afghanistan subsidiary By adhering to our own Group polices and the ILO conventions and rights as a minimum we strive to upgrade the labour rights of the local staff in Afghanistan. Along with the growth of our organisation and activities in Afghanistan the number of staff increases, which is also reflected by the improving ratio local employees versus expats. In Afghanistan we employ a total of 104 people, from which 62 are local employees. From those 104, 79 people work at our warehouse facilities and 25 people work at our PX shops. The personnel policy in Afghanistan is basically the same as our personnel policy that is used in the Netherlands, only is partly modified to the local conditions and circumstances. The main points of our Human Resource policy comprise of:  Employment is recorded by means of a contract;  Agreements are in line with local laws and regulations;  Salaries are competitive with ILO convention as a minimum; and  Each employee will receive internal training and work guidance. The fair salary payment for B&S staff in Afghanistan is reflected in competitive salary conditions offered by B&S. Besides a fair salary, staff receives a monthly food allowance and a monthly transport allowance. Working overtime is paid at a rate of 150% and working on Official Public and Religious Holidays is paid at a rate of 200%. Staff is entitled to 10 days paid leave for every six months worked. The working hours are based on the Labour and Employee Law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and differ depending of the season:  April 1st – October 31st 08.00 hrs. until 17.00 hrs. (1 hour lunch break included)  November 1st – March 31st 08.00 hrs. until 16.00 hrs. (1 hour lunch break included)  Ramadan hours 08.00 hrs. until 14.00 hrs. (no lunch break included) Page 22 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 3. Secure working conditions Afghanistan subsidiary The security in Afghanistan of the Company’s offices and warehouses is an important aspect. As the Company stores consumer goods in its warehouse, the premises need to be protected in relation to potential attacks, theft and other breaches. The B&S compound is located in a relatively safe area just past the city gate of Kabul. The nearest police and military post is only 0.5 kilometre away. The compound is secured by 34 guards on location (working in two shifts), equipped with adequate defence tools. The compound is surrounded with a high fence. There are separate guarded exit and entry gates. All vehicles entering the compound are thoroughly inspected. And also the visitors are registered and searched before entering. Also in the warehouse safety is an important aspect, albeit in a different capacity. In the warehouse equipment such as forklifts, electric pallet trucks, pallet jacks and electric wrapping machines are used. The staff is well trained to use this equipment safely. Furthermore the warehouse is well organized and clean which also contributes to the safety of our staff. The training of staff is a on-going process. Topic 4. Training food safety, hygiene, personal health and hygiene B&S has an extensive training program to ensure that employees are competent to perform their jobs and to improve efficiency in relation to food safety, personal health and hygiene. Training course are provided in different ways:  Workshops  Presentations  Training on the job A logbook is kept in which all trainings are registered. The following types of training are given: 1. Introduction training 2. HACCP Awareness 3. Food Safety 4. Personal Hygiene 5. Manual Handling 6. Fork-lift safety 7. Fire safety 8. First aid 9. PPE Example of first aid training Page 23 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 5. Health checks All people hired by B&S will get a full healthcare check. This check includes:  Blood tests (Hepatitis A/B/C, HIV, Tuberculosis)  X-ray of the chest  Physical Examination  Urine tests Topic 6. Good working environment B&S takes care of a good working environment. Initiatives and involvement from our employees are highly valued. Often meetings are organized whereby staff can share their ideas to improve processes and working conditions. Besides there are a lot of social area’s where the staff can sit together watching movies. Also a volleyball court, pooland table tennis tables and a gym facilities are available. On top of that, every summer a big barbeque is organized to which local staff can bring their family. Topic 7: Employees council: election and promotion During 2013 there were Employees Council elections (as indicated by law every 4 years). The Board of Directors requested the Communication Department to actively promote the elections and create awareness among the employees of the importance of their role within the organisation. See below some posters examples from the awareness campaign: Translation Dutch-English: Employees Council Elections, Thursday 18 April 2013 The Employees Council will not leave you alone…what about you? Present your candidacy! Many complains? Do something about it! Present your candidacy to the Employees Council Page 24 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 8. Employees Council Teamwork and Trainings After the elections, a new Employees council was formed with 7 members. Since only 2 of them had previous similar experiences and knowledge in the different labour rights and laws, the company facilitate within working hours some trainings in order to support their education and to help create teamwork among the members of the Council. See below pictures of our Employees council at the 2 days training. Translations: (left) our colleagues are back to school very enthousiastic; (right) establishing the agenda points for 2014 Page 25 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 9: B&S as knowledge centre Employees are given considerable autonomy in performing their tasks. Although general guidelines are established to assist them in making decisions and taking responsibility, they are allowed to act as pioneers and individual entrepreneurs. The initiative of its staff has enabled the Company to explore new markets, sell new products and pioneer new regions. Thanks to the organisation’s horizontal and cellular structure with short-lines of communication, top-talent surfaces swiftly. These are employees who stand out because of their individual success in their tasks: they are proactive, creative in searching for solutions and they think “out of the box”. B&S is keen to embrace talented employees and gently guide their internal career development towards filling management positions within the organisation. Over 90% of the managers within B&S have risen through the ranks in this way. We believe that investing in our employees encourages motivation on our employees at the same time brings the complete company to a more professional stage. It is also part of our policy that seniors are actively involved in the training of the job of the starters and juniors and in this way share their knowledge with their colleagues. Topic 10: B&S Academy During 2013 the Company has formalised the set-up of its own B&S Academy. All new Company entrants participate in a traineeship by following a combination of on-line and in-class courses. The trainee programme comprises several modules covering a variety of subjects, such as the Company’s history & background, its corporate strategy and objectives and its main policies and general guidelines. Practical subjects relate to commercial aspects, logistics, customs affairs, IT solutions and finance. These courses also provide new entrants with an insight into the opportunities and personal development possibilities. The training course for new employees also helps the new recruits get to know staff members working in other company disciplines, departments and Group companies. The resulting contact networks encourage the exchange of best practices later on. Following the success of the B&S Academy for new entrants, the Company started a training programme for the juniors in the organisation. Here the training focus is more focused on themes related to the different job positions. In the Company’s experience, the opportunity to gain further knowledge is highly appreciated by employees as it supports career development. Apart from the training programme for new staff and the junior programme, the organisation offers a wide range of more dedicated training programmes. This varies from job training, language courses and logistics courses to external sessions for financial staff during which employees have to work out case studies presented by entrepreneurs and specialists and learn from best practices and trends in their own field of expertise. The Junior Program is divided into 6 pillars, and comprises a total of 42 modules. At the moment 30 junior colleagues are following the Junior Program, all of them are working between one and three years at the Company. Page 26 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress In order to optimise the development, follow up and evaluation of this program, an investment in online system Learning Management System has been done. All users (trainees, juniors, managers and trainers) can individually log in and find all the necessary information well organise. It is also a great tool for our HR department in order to properly follow up the progress in a detailed level.

Environmental principles Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Overview B&S takes good care of the environment by doing more than required by local environmental regulations. Whenever possible practices of reduction, reuse, recycling and recovery are implemented to ensure resources are utilised in the most environmentally prudent manner. We have considered this ‘Environment’ section in a more broader sense, including our environmental responsibility towards the planet, as well as our social role towards the community. In this part, we further include and describe our responsibility as distributor within the food supply chain. Assessment, policy and goals B&S is concerned about the conservation of the environment in its broadest sense and recognises that certain resources are finite and must be used responsibly. We aim to limit the use of finite resources in all our business ventures and, in particular, recognise our obligation to manage responsibly the assets we use and occupy. To this end we take the precautionary approach of avoiding the use of materials and methods that pose environmental and health risks whenever suitable alternatives are available. When deciding on corporate investments we always seek sustainable solutions and try to maximise both financial return and social good. Investments in warehouses and offices are executed in accordance with the most modern standards, which includes trying to save energy and use recycled material. Continuous instructions to the Company’s staff are raising awareness of good garbage handling and waste reduction and embedding it in the Company culture. As a food distributor, B&S has a responsibility within the distribution channel. Over the last years our efforts on supply chain transparency have increased remarkably, for example establishing internal procedures in both directions of the distribution channel: towards suppliers and towards customers. Page 31 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Implementation (actions) 2013 Topic 1. Procedure review On a yearly base the Company review procedures and has discussions between the Board of Directors and senior managers on the effectiveness and completeness of the procedures, breaches, and incidents. Topic 2. Food safety and transparency B&S purchases, stores, handles and sells large quantities of food products. Maintaining and observing food safety standards and transparency related to food products are a priority within the Company. All food products that enter the logistics centres are subject to comprehensive quality controls, are handled with the utmost care and are stored in climate-controlled environments. The proper handling of food is a key priority within the organisation. The Company' has a risk management system for food processing in place at the highest level and its processes are ISO 22000 and HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control points) certificated. All compliance and safety procedures are rigorously checked with a special attention to highrisk products, such as meat and poultry. The Company’s logistics centres are checked by the European Food Safety Authority on a regular basis. Documents are examined to ensure they conform to the correct standards and random product samples are taken for laboratory analysis. Topic 3. Supply chain transparency As one of the largest food handlers in Europe in its markets, B&S is playing an active role in the trend towards improving transparency related to food products. This is evidenced by a focus on the provenance of food, which means ensuring there is a clear paper-trail from the moment a food product enters the supply chain to the moment it is delivered to the client. To improve transparency related to our own GoodBurry products we have further improved the product information on our product packaging. The information on our product labelling fully complies with the most stringent regulations for product labelling, such as the most current EU and UN regulations.  Addition of nutritional values  Clear declaration of ingredients  Better traceability through the addition of EU registration number, or EU Health mark, and on seafood products the FAO fishing areas.  Better legibility through amending the label structure. Page 32 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 4. UN Compliant supplier B&S is officially registered as a supplier for the following United Nations organisations: UNGM, FAO, ITC, UNOPS, UNOV, UNAMID, UNECA, UNIFIL, UNMIT, UNPD, WFP, WIPO and UNAMI. Since end of the 80’s B&S has delivered food and supplies to various appointed catering contractors for the UN Peacekeeping forces. Since the interest regarding food safety and complete chain transparency has increased, the UN has established guidelines according to the following subjects:  Product specifications (product quality and product information on the packaging)  Supplier specifications (origin of the product, factory certifications, health & safety in production etc.) In the past year we have successfully established a UN project team with specialist from purchase, sales and logistics in order to optimise these procedures, and ensure a transparent supply chain of goods. Topic 5. Waste management B&S has outsourced waste processing to a professional recycling company. The operational waste (packing, boxes, etc.) is collected from the warehouses and offices, compressed selectively in dedicated compactors for paper, foil and general (mixed) garbage and whenever possible recycled. Waste paper is collected in special bins and recycled. Printing and copying is carefully limited, the scanning of documents and electronic document sharing is preferred. Continuous instructions to the Company’s staff are raising awareness of good garbage handling and waste reduction and embedding it in the Company culture. Topic 6. Energy consumption and CO2 reduction Most of the Company’s offices use motion-detection lights and energy saving bulbs or led lights. When this is not the case office employees are instructed to limit the use of energy and trained to switch off lights when they are not needed. Management staff is very strict in controlling this energy-saving policy. When commissioning investments the aim is always to reduce carbon emissions. A good example is the newly built warehouse in the North of the Netherlands for an affiliated company. This warehouse holds one of the most innovative fully-automated storage systems. Products are stored and picked in a most reliable and efficient way. This contributes towards far lower energy consumption and maintenance costs. Page 33 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Another example is the investments for the B&S Shop Fly at Eindhoven Airport, developed in partnership with the airport authorities, where we have managed to reduce the carbon emission significantly. Using electric trolleys for transporting products within the centre has completely eliminated emissions. B&S Shop Fly: engagement with Eindhoven Airport We drive to reduce carbon emissions at our B&S Shop Fly at Eindhoven Airport, which we have been developing in partnership with the airport authorities. The opening of a new logistics centre was one step in that direction and lead to fewer truck deliveries and hence a strong reduction in our carbon footprint. And within the centre, goods are transported by electric trolleys, eliminating emissions completely. Topic 7. Community As one of the many players on the global playing field B&S believes in acting as a responsible corporate citizen. Our Company supports activities that improve the lives of people in the communities in which our employees live and work. These activities may include education, health care, community building, infrastructure or nature development. Employees are encouraged to participate actively in community programmes. Managers are expected to give their employees the opportunity to play an active role in society, for example through community or educational programmes, unless participation in these activities would create a conflict of interest. Memberships B&S is closely involved with different organisations in the industry. Several of our employees are member of market and industry organisations, such as the National Association of Dutch Exporters (Fenedex), NVVS, ITCA, EVO and other leading organisations in the industry. Education The Company considers education to be the important factor for personal development. B&S maintains close relationships with Universities, high schools and teachers in the areas in which it is active with the intention of contributing towards the education of the community and sharing knowledge. Page 34 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Our educational activities comprise training courses, workshops and presentations. Dedicated learning projects are organised in cooperation with universities. Every semester a number of students participate in our internship programme or undertake graduation assignments in or based on our organisation. Charity B&S is open to providing funds for charities, but has chosen to do this in a focused way by sponsoring local projects and charity initiatives. Food donations B&S trades in food and consumer products and holds sizeable levels of own stock in its warehouses. Food products that are nearing the expiry date are regularly offered to general food associations or Food Banks (i.e. The European Federation of Food Banks). Although these products have lost their commercial value they can often provide a welcome supplementary source of food for people with fewer resources.

Page 38 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 11. Anticorruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Overview Our Company has a long history with diverse activities dating back for more than a century. Our Company is rightly proud on its background. It has evolved over time and determines the professional Company that we are today. The way we do business, our Corporate Code of Conduct has evolved alongside. It is a sustainable and strong pillar on which the Company has earned the trust of its business partners. Whereas the Corporate Code of Conduct is firstly applicable for the Company’s own staff members, we considered it important that our stakeholders follow similar good governance and business ethics. We actively promote our ethical behaviour to stakeholders, even in other languages if needed for a better understanding. Our integrity should be beyond all doubt. In view of the important social role of our Company, it is imperative that all our employees comply with the legislation and regulations of the countries in which we are active and also comply with the values and standards that apply within our Company and which have been laid down in this Corporate Code of Conduct. We expect our employees to show integrity and honesty in their mutual relationships and in relationships with stakeholders. We also expect integrity and reliability from our business partners, such as clients, suppliers and other business partners. Our Company operates worldwide, sometimes in remote areas and in developing countries. The stance to institutions is important for the way we operate. The Company abides by the local legislation, industry minimum standards, ILO and UN conventions and other statutory requirements. Page 39 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Assessment, policy and goals Our Company will not cooperate in illegal transactions or transactions suspected to aim on the laundry of money. We do business on the basis of honest and ethical management, trust and integrity. We expect the same from everyone with whom we do business. Our Company will not accept any influence in the decision making by people based on promises, gifts, bribes or kickbacks, or by any other measure that is unethical or that will tarnish our reputation for honesty and integrity. Even the appearance of such conduct shall be avoided. Gifts, favours and hospitality are to be handled with great caution. Excessive gifts and hospitality can affect our business judgment and can create expectations from third parties. As a result the Company can be embarrassed by its disclosure. Gifts, favours and hospitality may only be accepted when they are consistent with general accepted business practices and ethical standards and do not in any way violate applicable law. In accepting gifts, favours or hospitality any attempt of bribery or kickback should be avoided. Staff members who are engaged in procurement activities should safeguard their freedom of action to deal impartially and to avoid conflicting loyalties. Therefore, gifts, favours and hospitality of any kind, which would obligate or tend to obligate the staff member, must not be accepted. We expect our suppliers to respect our gift policy when doing business with us, just as we will respect the similar policies of our clients. Giving gifts, favours and hospitality to our business partners are acceptable provided they are appropriate for the business purpose and are not excessive. Our Company maintains a zero tolerance attitude towards fraud. This is applicable for all our staff members but we also expect our business partners to refrain from fraud. All the divisions and business units are subject to general policies, procedures and control mechanisms to prevent and detect fraud. Reports of fraud or attempt of fraud will be seriously investigated and reported to the Board of Directors, followed by appropriate sanctions, if necessary. The policies and procedures are reviewed and updated yearly and are further regularly discussed with senior managers. For 2014, we continue to make improvements in this particular field. Page 40 of 43 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Implementation (actions) 2013 Topic 1. Procedure review Primary actions on Anticorruption relate to the yearly review of procedures and discussion between the Board of Directors and senior managers on the effectiveness and completeness of the procedures, breaches, and incidents. Topic 2. KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure During 2013 we have intensified our actions to have a better understanding of our customers. The Company has sophisticated CSR software in place, which is filled with all kind of client details. As the Company works with a large number of business to business clients there was need a to analyse the availability of complete information per client. This resulted in further improvements relating to our “Know Your Customer (KYC)” procedure during the last year. The KYC procedure includes the data reporting of full client data (name, address, mail address, web site, VAT number, bank account number etc. The procedure is applicable for all new clients and is being updated every year. The KYC procedure is further relevant to some of our Key suppliers, for example manufacturers that work in the Liquor and Tobacco industry. In order to avoid corruption, bribery, fraud and other unethical behaviour, these large suppliers are extremely satisfied with our initiatives to uphold professional procedures and need to be assured that the Company has an effective KYC procedure in place, also in relation to applicable legislation. Topic 3. Staff training Each year, the Company provides its staff with dedicated training courses in which also the risks of corruption, bribery and other unethical behaviour is dealt with based on (internal) cases and cases from the industry.
