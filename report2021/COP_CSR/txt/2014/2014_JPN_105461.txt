Contribution to Society Our CSR Approach and Basic Policy At EIZO we believe our business activity in itself constitutes our most important CSR. We strive to consistently provide products and services that offer solutions for diverse challenges in various areas to pursue business with integrity by complying with laws and regulations while respecting human rights, and to return all the benefits produced through our business to society. We also enthusiastically engage in regional activities with the understanding that this support represents another aspect of our corporate social responsibility. We have been participating in the United Nations Global Compact since 2012 with clear recognition of the need to fulfill our social responsibilities with a broader perspective on the world and society as EIZO operations become increasingly globalized. The concepts behind the United Nations Global Compact have been incorporated into the guidelines that each individual member of the EIZO Group is expected to follow, and in the EIZO Group Principles of Conduct – Seven Promises that we uphold as our promise to stakeholders. The Principles of Conduct also serve as the basic policy of our CSR, and this CSR Report has been compiled in line with the Seven Promises. Bringing about a Paradigm Shift Last year we adopted “Changing the Paradigm” as the slogan expressing our goal of becoming an enterprise that delivers high value on a global scale to address evolving social needs with an eye on the next ten years. We must steadfastly address this challenge to facilitate specific, clearly defined paradigm shifts. Just as we have asked each employee to break free from conventional thinking and change the way they think and work, we have also taken action as a company, including the transition to direct sales by Group companies in Europe in 2012 and the change in our corporate name in 2013. In addition, we have boldly transferred personnel in ways that significantly depart from conventional EIZO Corporation CSR REPORT 2014 05 thinking, such as promoting younger employees to concentrate our resources in the medical market in China. We now feel these efforts have led management positions in order to ensure we assign to establishing a considerable reserve in our corporate ability, and we intend to adopt an even the best possible people to specific situations. I believe more aggressive course in the future. For example, we plan to make additional investments in this has had a considerable impact on our employees, the United States to raise our presence specifically in the medical market as well as the graphics and that creating a greater sense of openness within and imaging market, and allocate more resources in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. the company has had a positive effect on employee attitude, focus and motivation. The Power to Hand Down Our Corporate Culture We also recognize the development of human resources as a significant aspect for From Hardware to Solutions maintaining and enhancing our corporate ability. Although practical training offered by As for the paradigm shift required in our business external lecturers can contribute important content for human resource development, I also model, the challenge lies in making the transition from believe we should encourage our employees to become well acquainted with the history hardware to solutions. We can no longer expect to of EIZO. By understanding EIZO’s past turning points and how the company has overcome satisfy customers by selling hardware alone. In future, specific situations to arrive at where it is today, we can share a deeper affiliation with the we will focus on offerings for imaging environments company and its products. that are even more comfortable and optimal, rather For example, soon after the company listed its shares on the Second Section of the Tokyo than simply providing display equipment. With this basic idea, we are working on presenting Stock Exchange in December 2002, we discovered a flaw that occurs when a monitor is left on a total solution that comprises not only our products but other companies’ products as well, for an extended period of time while the PC has been turned off or was in power save mode. after verifying compatibility and ease of use, if they are necessary for creating the ideal imaging Since this flaw was the result of misuse and not a product defect, we debated whether a environment for the customer. We have established a dedicated organization for this purpose product recall was required. This became a significant turning point. In the end, we announced and are reinforcing our structure to meet customer requirements through a coordinated effort a recall that cost us about 1 billion yen. Our decision was backed by a firm determination that unites all departments. to remain faithful to users who counted on EIZO monitors and our desire to safeguard our corporate culture of open disclosure. I believe that recounting these episodes and drawing our own conclusions will empower us to transmit our corporate culture to the next generation. Seeking to Enhance Our Corporate Capabilities This is how EIZO is striving to enhance its corporate ability and apply that ability as the In considering our policy for future growth, accurately evaluating our own corporate foundation upon which to grow our business, which we hope will, in turn, offer greater ability will be an important factor for decision making. For example, we should not pursue contributions to society. This CSR Report represents a means for reporting on our efforts and unreasonable global deployment that places an excessive strain on our logistics and results in as a tool for addressing public expectations for information disclosure. We look forward to the deterioration of our quality management. EIZO had its start in Europe, where we have been comments and feedback from our stakeholders who read this report. focusing on market development.
