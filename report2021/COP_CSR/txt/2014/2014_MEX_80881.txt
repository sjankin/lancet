WE CONTINUED TO CONSOLIDATE OUR GROWTH PLATFORM GEARED TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOST MODERN INDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIO IN MEXICO. WE ALSO IMPROVED OUR FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WHICH ALLOWS US TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO OUR CLIENTS´ NEEDS AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN MEXICO. Lorenzo Berho C. Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer 1.1, 1.2 4 VESTA Message from the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer In 2013, we celebrated our first anniversary as a Public Company. We continued to consolidate our growth platform geared towards the development of the most modern industrial portfolio in Mexico. We also improved our financial and non-financial performance which allows us to effectively respond to our clients´ needs and to take advantage of the positive outlook for the industrial sector in Mexico. We strengthened our balance sheet and our rental income increased by 12.8%. We have 1.3 million square meters of gross leasable area valued at US$951 million with a 91.1% occupancy rate. Additionally, our 75 hectares of land reserves were valued at US$58 million. Last June, we issued a follow-on equity offering of US$193 million. As a result, over 70% of the Company’s shares are floating on the public market. The average trading volume has increased approximately 121% since the Initial Public Offering in 2012. Vesta receives equity coverage from five recognized financial institutions and we are already part of the MidCap Index of the Mexican Stock Exchange. Since the Company’s incorporation, we built a platform to establish professional and transparent corporate governance. The Board of Directors has five independent members, and five operating committees, which aid to improve the Company’s business and strengthen our institutionalization. I am very pleased to say that our Board of Directors has taken on the commitment to integrate sustainability into the highest level of governance within the Company. We are fully aware that our commitment to sustainability is the right thing to do and a determining factor of our future performance as an industry leader. During 2013, we established a Social Responsibility and Environmental Committee, which is chaired by one of our board members. We also approved our social investment and environmental policies and formed a sustainability department. Last year, we obtained our first LEED certification for a build-to-suit building. Three of our new projects are currently undergoing the certification process. One hundred percent of our new inventory buildings were built in accordance with our internal “eco-efficient” guidelines, with which we underline our commitment to preserving the environment. In line with our social investment policy, we have worked together with our stakeholders to carry out several social initiatives that benefit the communities in which we do business. I have no doubt that the key to Vesta’s success lies with our people. We are a motivated, dynamic and innovative team with a true entrepreneurial spirit; attributes that we call upon to come up with the best possible solutions to meet our customers’ needs. Our compensation schemes and aligned interests translate into a remarkable retention rate. Being the leader in the industry is a constant challenge.Therefore, we continue implementing best practices in all aspects of business, in order to make the most of every opportunity. That is why this year we updated our ethics commitment and promoted the values of the United Nations Global Compact among our stakeholders. Mexico is increasingly becoming a key part of North America’s productive supply chains. As we witness the regionalization of these supply chains (supported by “near-sourcing” and “reshoring” trends). we can expect an unprecedented manufacturing and logistics boom as more and more goods will be produced, sold, and used in the same geographical area. In response, Vesta has specialized in developing Park-to-Suit® parks that are designed to attract the business of entire supply chains. Two examples of this are the Queretaro Aerospace Park and Nissan suppliers’ park in Aguascalientes, two of Vesta’s most important projects. As a final note, I would like to share my optimism for the future in the face of the recent structural reforms and the opening of new markets for Mexico. I wish to stress our commitment to take full advantage of this potential through an aggressive growth strategy, which is founded in developing sustainable projects and solutions. We will continue to create value for all our shareholders, while contributing to the 5 IA 2013 development of our country. 6 VESTA EXCELLENCE IN HUMAN CAPITAL WE HAVE A YOUNG, DYNAMIC AND EXPERIENCED TEAM WITH A CLEAR STRATEGY TO CONTINUE SERVING AS ONE OF MEXICO´S LEADING COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRIAL REAL ESTATE SECTOR.

All executives receive a performance review based on pre-established objectives and 18% of them have their 10% 2013: 30 EMPLOYEES bonus linked to sustainability targets. In 2013, with the purpose of retaining and motivating our talent, Vesta hired a third party to conduct a series of studies regarding employee compensation vis-à-vis the rest of the industry. As a result, we were able to establish more competitive salaries and to design long-term compensation plans for executives. We believe that this scheme partly explains why Vesta has 08% 2012: 26 a very low turnover rate of 10%. 70% of our employees have been working together for more EMPLOYEES than nine years and directors own shares in the Company.

OUR PROPERTIES ARE STRATEGICALLY LOCATED IN THE COUNTRY’S MAIN LOGISTICS CORRIDORS, WHERE SUPPLY CHAINS FOR THE COUNTRY’S MOST IMPORTANT INDUSTRIAL SECTORS ARE EXPANDING. 27 IA 2013 At the end of 2013, we had a portfolio of 102 buildings with a total gross leasable area of 1.3 million square meters and a market value of US$951 million, positioning Vesta as one of the main suppliers of industrial real estate solutions in Mexico. Our portfolio consists of mostly Class A buildings with the highest quality on the market. We seek to develop working spaces where companies can increase their productivity and maximize the quality of their working environment. Custom-tailored solutions We develop industrial parks and buildings for light manufacturing and logistics. In response to our clients’ needs, we provide innovative and customer-tailored real estate solutions, constantly adapting to changing industry trends.

In order to meet their needs, we have developed the Park-to-Suit® concept. Our growth strategy, focused on development, is reinforced by our Park-to-Suit® offer: ADVANTAGES • HAVING STRATEGIC SUPPLIERS OF AN INDUSTRY IN THE SAME PLACE MAKES MANAGEMENT OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN MORE EFFICIENT. RESPONSE TIME IS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED AS LOGISTICS COSTS ARE CUT SUBSTANTIALLY. • REDUCES THE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AS TRANSPORT OF MATERIAL IS CUT DOWN. THUS, WE HAVE CREATED A COMPETITIVE MEANS OF DOING BUSINESS THAT MEETS THE CHALLENGE OF OPTIMIZING RESOURCES, SAVING TIME, USING ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT, WHICH INCREASES THE PRODUCTIVITY OF AN INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. We currently work with two industries that have opted for this solution: the aerospace industry (Bombardier and Grupo Safran) and the automotive industry (Nissan). This type of development also works for other types of industries. The first Park-to-Suit® was the Queretaro Aerospace Park (QAP), built in 2007 as a result of the combined efforts of the Mexican government, Bombardier and the State of Queretaro to create the first aerospace cluster in Mexico. This park accommodates Bombardier, some of its suppliers and other companies that are part of the same sector. Currently, the park has twelve buildings, two of which are LEED certified. The Universidad Nacional Aeronautica de Queretaro (UNAQ) is next to the park, as is the international airport, which helps to create important synergies. We believe that our involvement in the development of the QAP has been very successful and is an important aspect of our growth strategy. Furthermore, we signed an agreement with Nissan in 2013 to build a suppliers park in the Company’s complex in Aguascalientes. Five buildings for seven suppliers were agreed to be built at an overall cost of US$57 million. This will enable Nissan to make its supply chain and logistics operation more efficient. The project is backed by the local government and uses qualified local labor. Even though rights were granted for an original period of 25 years, Vesta and Nissan signed an amendatory agreement at the end of the year to extend the term to forty years. The first five leasing agreements for industrial buildings to be developed were also signed at this time. Gross leasable area will amount to 153,870 square meters. This development will contribute to Vesta’s consolidation in the automotive sector in Mexico. 29 IA 2013 INDUSTRY The Company did not pay any significant fines in 2013 due to non-compliance of DIVERSIFICATION regulations regarding the use of our products and services. (PER RENTAL INCOME) Our headquarter offices are in Mexico City and we have six regional offices in Toluca, Queretaro, Guanajuato, Aguascalientes, Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, to remain closer to 27% AUTOMOTIVE our clients and constantly monitor the dynamics and opportunities in local markets. We believe that by managing and improving our processes we will improve our portfolio efficiency and our day-to-day operations. Our management processes are certified with ISO 9001 and are audited every year. We introduced a program in 2013 to systemize our processes, which will be implemented in different stages starting in the 24% FOOD AND third quarter of 2014. An external Company will help us to implement this system, which was tailored designed in order to meet the needs of the organization. BEVERAGE A diversified portfolio 16% AEROSPACE Our portfolio is comprised of a broad tenant base with strong credit ratings and long-term lease agreements. The portfolio is cautiously diversified by industry and geographical location. Approximately 60% of our portfolio is leased to light manufacturing companies while the remaining 40% is leased to logistic companies. At 12% LOGISTICS Vesta, we believe that such diversification minimizes the risk of unfavorable market cycles that could affect specific industries and enables us to secure a more stable and long-term cash flow in the form of monthly rents. Vesta places special importance to maintaining strong tenant relationships as a core 05% PLASTICS part of our business. We are committed to offering the highest level of quality and a personalized customer service. As a result we have established a network of longlasting relationships with all our clients, as evidenced by the high retention rate of 81% of our total gross leasable area. Another example of our achievements in terms of customer loyalty is that 59% of our growth in terms of gross leasable area in the last 04% fourteen years has come from existing clients leasing additional space. MEDICAL For the past seven years, we have conducted annual satisfaction surveys to measure DEVICES customers’ satisfaction level regarding: the quality and design of our buildings and the service and response capability of our employees. Through this effort we collect meaningful feedback, learn more about our customers’ specific needs, identify areas 12% OTHERS of improvement as well as growth opportunities; it also serves as a mechanism to review the performance of our commercial staff. According to the 2013 customer satisfaction survey, 80% of our customers considered the quality of service, performance, and availability of staff to be good/excellent. 70% opined that Vesta team was engaged and supportive of their expansion needs; 92% would work with us again, and 90% would recommend us to another customer or supplier. The survey had a response rate of 53%. 2.3, EC2, EC4, EN26, EN27, HR1, HR2, PR5, PR9 30 VESTA Innovation in projects Our innovation efforts led to initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of our business. Throughout our Environmental Policy, we reaffirm our commitment to sustainable development by aligning our strategies and using best practices in the industry to reduce the environmental impact of the developments and operations to benefit of our tenants, our portfolio, the industrial real estate industry and the community in general. We believe that overtime the design and construction of industrial developments that not only meet but also exceed international energy, water and environmental standards, will yield a better performance of the portfolio increasing the value of our shareholders. We have established environmental objectives and goals to measure our environmental performance: ·· Reduce the environmental impact of our developments ·· Reduce the environmental impact of our general operations ·· Improve knowledge on sustainable development among our key stakeholders For the construction of the buildings, we conduct a transparent bid process to select the most appropriate general contractor for each project, considering as part of our policy the compliance with the “Sustainability Requirements for Suppliers”, as well as the compliance with the applicable legal dispositions. However, it is the sole responsibility of the contractor, and Vesta is only obliged to supervise the processes and activities which are aligned with our policy. At Vesta, we seek to raise our environmental commitment to the corporate bodies of influence. All projects submitted for approval to the Investment Committee must have a recommendation from the Social Responsibility and Environmental Committee to ensure the compliance with the policy and to assess any potential environmental risks. The Investment Committee is the most important organ of the corporate structure in this regard; its main responsibility for this purpose is to approve strategic investments. We have taken specific actions to reinforce our commitment in this area: ·· Creation of the Social and Environment Committee ·· Implementation of environmental policy to our operations ·· Establishment of “Suppliers Sustainability Requirements” In 2012, as a joint-initiative with DEG (Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH), a German development bank and our partner since 2008, we developed our Sustainable Construction Manual to determine our Ecoefficient construction guidelines. This manual sets sustainability parameters and includes all relevant provisions of the Federal Labor Act. Our LEED-Certified gross leasable represents 1.14% of our portfolio and 20% of our offices. 100% of inventory buildings developed since 2013 meet Eco-efficient standards. Vesta has also improved energy efficiency in existing buildings at remodeling and implemented best practices in self operated industrial parks. Our offices in Queretaro, which opened in 2013, are in the process of being LEED Silver certified and have been converted into a sustainable showroom to promote energyefficiency and sustainable best practices in the industry for the community and clients. 31 IA 2013 The table below shows Our business cycle our business cycle, Each stage involves all stakeholders that will make decisions on the information we can provide them.

Due to the nature of our business, we have a direct and indirect impact on the environment and the usage of natural resources. Our aim is to share the best practices in our sector with our customers and business partners to reduce the impact of our developments throughout their lifecycle. The developments we promote are located only within industrial parks and before starting the building process we carry out a Phase-I environmental risk assessment. Additionally, we are conscious that our business does not affect protected natural areas, high biodiversity valued areas or habitats of endangered species. In 2013, we spent US$109,707 on environmental and community projects; this does not include the direct investment of building improvements. It is worth mentioning that independent companies, such as GE Real Estate, audit existing buildings with criteria that include engineering and environmental management of our tenants.

We promote the use the amount of recycled materials, using materials with high-recycled material content, and selecting materials that can be reused at the end of their useful life for our purpose. CRE1, CRE3, CRE4, CRE5, CRE7, EN1, EN2, EN3, EN4, EN6, EN7, EN8, EN9, EN16, EN17, EN18, EN19, EN20, EN21, EN22, EN23, EN24, EN25 36 VESTA Energy management Vesta´s direct energy consumption is limited to our operations that include our corporate and regional offices and the operation of our industrial parks. This year we have used a minimum quantity of diesel fuel. Since Vesta only develops the industrial buildings, and has no control on the tenant operations, the energy consumption of our tenants is their own responsibility. However, we promote energy efficient initiatives to reduce consumption. Inventory buildings built since 2013 have efficient and self-sufficient outdoor lighting, using photovoltaic panels that produce the equivalent of outdoor lighting energy consumption in an interconnection scheme with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). For the Industrial Parks that we operate, energy efficiency strategies have been implemented: ·· We started replacing all outdoor lighting in 2013 and have replaced part of the outdoor lighting at the Queretaro Aerospace Park with efficient LED lighting, which is expected to conclude in 2014. ·· New industrial parks have state of the art street lighting and are solar powered. ·· We achieved a total installed capacity of 46.55 kW of photovoltaic energy in 2013. Water management Our industrial parks usually have their own wells, with the necessary concession licenses and permits for use. We supply water to our tenants and treat their wastewater biologically. We have established initiatives in our parks for wastewater to be treated and reused for irrigation purposes; this substantially cuts down on the use of potable water. We use ponds to capture rainwater to maintain the natural flow of water in streams and reduce the impact of our business. The water we treat is of sufficient quality to be disposed in national rivers as per code. We have a system to monitor the quality of treated water and, up until now, treated water quality has been compliant with the expected standards. We comply with all legal requirements with regard to water treatment and the specific conditions established by the authorities when granting concessions and permits. Emissions management We have introduced initiatives to reduce Vesta´s operations and products emissions that include LEED certified buildings, our own guidelines for eco-efficient inventory buildings established at Sustainable Construction Manual to develop a modern portfolio. Vesta has no control on the internal activities and consumption of the tenants, however, we are aware of the impact of our tenants on the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore we are in the process of implementing initiatives to help reduce their consumption and develop criteria to quantify this impact. As already mentioned, we only develop industrial parks; we are not in charge of the construction. The construction is entitled to a third party (General Contractor), however, our Project Managers ensure that all our contractors meet sustainable building requirements such as the use of ecological refrigerants to reduce the environmental impact in the event of a leak. The highest volume of waste that we produce is the sludge extracted at wastewater treatment plants, the non-hazardous waste produced in our parks and office waste of our corporate and regional offices. A specialized and certified waste treatment Company takes sludge away. No significant spills were reported last year nor was it necessary to repair any surface area. All of our developments are established on industrial areas, therefore voluntarily or involuntarily community relocation is required. 37 IA 2013 Social responsibility Performance and priorities Complete On going Past Present Future In 2012 we committed to: In 2013 we: Status Medium term Long term Interact with local ·· Participated with ·· To introduce ·· To participate in all community in regions projects in 80% of initiatives aligned regions in which we where we operate. the regions where with the Company’s operate. we operate. social investment ·· Participated in ten strategy. social responsibility ·· To increase our projects together involvement in the with our regions where we stakeholders. operate.

We believe that our developments directly benefit such communities given that they allow the creation of direct and indirect jobs that promote qualified labor and the transfer of know-how. In addition, we have taken on the responsibility to support non-profit initiatives in the areas of education and environment to further improve the social condition of our neighboring communities. Our commitment to social responsibility is carried out through three different strategies: 1. Involvement in socially minded projects in coordination with our customers and other stakeholders. 2. Direct support of welfare activities in the communities where we operate. 3. Voluntary projects with our employees. In 2013, we participated in various social projects with our local communities and we strive each year to create a more meaningful impact. Some of the initiatives include: a 5K race for people suffering from disabilities (mostly blindness) who were helped through the race by volunteer runners; the space launch of a satellite used for scientific research designed and built by 32 low-income Mexican children with IQs above 140; full remodeling of a foster home for abandoned children; support for relief of natural disasters and housing construction for low-income families, among others. We spent 963 man-hours on community projects. Seventy percent of Vesta employees volunteered to take part in these programs. We have maintained a consistent social investment policy of US$0.01 per leased square foot. We spent nearly US$78,370 in 2013 on community causes and have also incorporated our stakeholders into our community activities to leverage our workingrelationships in benefit of the communities where we operate. As part of our organizational culture, we believe it is important to play an active role in the industry institutions, associations and organizations, to positively influence on decisions that drive the industry sustainability. Our CEO is the Chairman of the Latin American Council of the Real Estate Network of YPO/WPO (Young Presidents Organization/World Presidents Organization), with the aim of sharing the best practices within real estate business and improving companies professionalization. He is also chairman of the Mexico-Germany Bilateral Committee of the Mexican Foreign Trade Council, whose purpose is to improve the strategic alliance between these two countries through investment, trade, technology transfer and professional training. Our Commercial Director was appointed as Chairman of the Mexican Industrial Parks Association (AMPIP) in October 2013, whose purpose is to help Mexico to introduce the best possible industrial infrastructure standards, as well as to increase the competitiveness of Mexico’s logistics providers, and reinforce our commitment to sustainable development. 39 IA 2013 SYNERGIES THAT CREATE IMPACT MULTIPLYING EFFECT At Vesta we are committed to giving back to the communities where we operate and we are always seeking to have a positive effect on them. This commitment to community involvement, together with our stakeholders, was well depicted this year with our project of refurbishment of “Hogares Providencia”, a community hostel in Queretaro, where we joined forces with our suppliers, employees and families on August 23rd. Our combined efforts helped to improve the living conditions of 55 children and teenagers, by making their surroundings more pleasant and helping them to better take advantage of their day-to-day activities, including their study hours in classes and workshops and, of course, by enjoying a healthier environment for playing and growing. We first approached “Hogares Providencia” through one of our clients: Bombardier, who were already working with the nonprofit organization. “Hogares Providencia” has three hostels: one for boys and one for girls under the age of nine, and another for teenagers. Thanks to the positive response of our suppliers, together with their contractors, plus the involvement of more than thirty of our employees, customers, suppliers and members of the community, we completely refurbished the three hostels in two weeks, cleaned yards and encouraged the children to look after and maintain their facilities. ON THE COMMUNITY 4.12 40 VESTA VESTA CHALLENGE III MAXIMUM EFFORT WITH A CAUSE PEDAL THE CAUSE The team spirit of Vesta is not only evident in its day-to-day business, but also in what we call the “Vesta Challenge”. Directors and employers, and members of their families, coordinated with investors and persons closely involved with Vesta, have taken part in the last three editions of the Vesta Challenge, a social event that comprises riding bicycles for several days at a very high competitive level, similar to the Tour de France. Those who took part in the event were able to socialize and were motivated in the knowledge that they were making a personal and team effort in beautiful scenery. In each edition of the Vesta Challenge we have shared what we call “the power of peloton” (team effort), an example of how teamwork is better than doing things on your own. After these few days together, we discovered certain individual abilities that we were not aware of. 2008 Vesta Challenge I – Pyrenees, France and Spain 2010 – Vesta Challenge II – Tour of Toscana, Italy 2013 – Vesta Challenge III – Pedal the Cause California, United States of America One person who took part said: “Thank you for giving us the opportunity to challenge the limits of our abilities, for encouraging us to achieve targets that seemed impossible, for making us realize that the team effort is stronger than what we thought it was, and for giving us the opportunity to share this great experience with our colleagues and families”. “It was not easy. Many of us thought that we could not achieve this, and others called it the impossible dream, but thanks to a team effort, the affection of our families and the help of a great leader, we were able to achieve this target”. In 2012, as part of the Vesta Challenge III, we decided to combine the event with another noble cause: finding a cure for cancer. The Vesta team donated USD$15,000 and participated in the Pedal the Cause bicycle race in San Diego, California. In October 2013, Vesta’s directors and some of their relatives took part in a two-day event to raise funds to support research into a cure for cancer being conducted by the SanfordBurnham Medical Research Institute in San Diego, California. 41 IA 2013 42 VESTA EC1, EC9 Direct Economic value, produced and distributed At Vesta we are aware of the long-term impact that our business has on the industrial development of Mexico. Our Company contributes to this development by creating value in the regions and communities where we operate. We believe that our developments directly benefit such communities through the creation of direct and indirect jobs, promoting environmental education and by transfering know-how amongst a variety of stakeholders. 2013 2012 US$ US$ Direct economic value Total income 58,522,064 51,863,597 produced and distributed Total rental income 56,973,857 50,886,957 Real Estate Tax 810,893 942,922 Direct Operating Costs Insurance 301,997 249,740 Maintenance 382,576 435,585 Other property expenses 1,045,254 1,118,783 Total 2,540,720 3,498,435 Marketing 61,344 68,244 Administrative Expenses Audit and legal expenses 723,108 651,359 Acquisition Fee 195,001 199,990 Asset Management Fee 0 765,388 Employees benefits 5,630,566 2,390,207 Total 6,610,019 4,075,188 43 IA 2013 “WE ARE CONVINCED OF THE INDUSTRIAL AND LOGISTICS VOCATION OF MEXICO.

LORENZO BERHO, CHAIRMAN OF 44 VESTA THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CEO. OUTLOOK OF SOLID GROWTH 45 IA 2013 Financial and stock market analysis As a Company, we believe we had a great year. The most important achievement was the successful follow on carried out last June and which helped the Company strengthen its balance sheet and positioned it to serve a robust pipeline. Other important accomplishments include: ·· Celebration of our 15th anniversary. ·· Deployment of US$103 million (CAPEX 2013) through build-to-suits and inventory buildings. ·· Gross leasable area growth of 19.5%. ·· Extension of trust agreement with Nissan to 40 years. ·· Openings of six build-to-suit buildings. ·· Inclusion of Vesta whithin the Mexican Stock Exchange MidCap Index . As of December 31, 2013 the fair value of our portfolio was US$951.9 million. Such figure includes US$928.9 million of existing buildings, US$58 million of land reserves, and US$35.1 million of costs required to complete constructions in progress. Once again, rental revenue had a double-digit increase of 12.8% from the previous year. The results were possible due to an increase of 17.6% in rental income to new customers established in new spaces or available spaces from our existing portfolio. In addition there was a 2.8% increase in rent adjustments due to inflation, an increase of 0.8% due to the conversion effect of rentals that are denominated in pesos, and an increase of 1.1% in reimbursement of expenses incurred on behalf of our clients. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a decline of 9.4% in revenue from contracts that experienced a reduction in rent price and from contracts that expired and were not renovated during 2013. Gross profit for the year rose 15.3% to US$55.1 million compared with 2012. The operating cost of investment properties declined 15.9%, largely due to fees paid in 2012 to Desarrolladora Vesta, S. de R.L. de C.V., which were not paid in 2013. In addition, maintenance cost of investment properties and other related expenses also declined in 2013. Profit before taxes reached US$127.9 million in 2013, a 163% increase in comparison with the previous year. Net income in 2013 was US$89.4 million and US$41.7 million in 2012. 46 VESTA MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS AS OF DECEMBER 31 Rental Income Rental Income for the period ended December 31, 2013, was US$58.52 million compared with US$51.86 million for the period ended December 31, 2012, which represents an increase of US$6.66 million, or 12.8%. The increase was primarily attributable to: ·· An increase of 17.6% in rental income from new leases or new contracts in new ·· space or in space which was vacant during 2012 and was leased during 2013; ·· An increase of 2.8% in rental income resulting from rent adjustments due to inflation protection provisions in our lease agreements. Most of our lease agreements include a provision whereby rents are automatically adjusted on a year-to-year basis to reflect the change in the U.S. Consumer Price Index if the rental payments under the lease agreement are denominated in U.S. dollars or the INPC if the rental payments are denominated in pesos. The change in the INPC was 4.0% and 3.5% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, and the U.S. inflation rate was 1.5% and 1.7% in 2013 and 2011, respectively; ·· An increase of 0.8% due to the effect of conversion of rental income denominated is pesos to dollars; an increase in rental income of 1.1%, in expenses that we paid on behalf of our customers that later were reimbursed by such customers and that were accounted for under rental income. These increases were partly offset by: ·· A decrease of US$4.71 million, or 9.1%, in rental income from leases that expired during 2012 and which were not renewed in 2013; ·· A decrease of US$0.16 million, or 0.3%, from lower rents in leases that expired during 2013 and 2012 and which were renewed at lower rental rates in order to retain the customer. Operating Costs Our property operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2013 were US$3.45 million compared to US$4.11 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, which represented a decrease of US$0.66 million, or 16%. Of this decrease, US$0.96 million is attributable to the direct operating costs of leased investment properties which generated rental income. During 2013 and 2012, these costs amounted to US$2.54 million and US$3.50 million, respectively. This decrease is principally attributable to: ·· An increase of US$0.05 million, or 20.9%, in insurance for investment properties. Insurance cost in 2012 was US$0.25 million and US$0.30 million in 2013; ·· A decrease of US$0.13 million, or 14.0%, in property taxes which were US$0.84 million and US$0.94 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Real estate property taxes are paid in pesos. Real estate property taxes paid in 2013 and 2012 were Ps.$14.01 million and Ps.$12.41 million, respectively, resulting in an increase of Ps.$1.60 million, or 13%. The effect of depreciation of the peso against the US dollar contributed to this increase. The value of the peso against the dollar decreased from Ps.$13.1630 pesos per US$1.00 in 2012 to Ps.$12.7681 per US$1.00 in 2013; ·· A decrease of US$0.05 million, or 12.2%, in maintenance costs, which were US$0.38 million and US$0.44 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively; ·· Other property related expenses decreased by US$0.07 million, or 6.6%, from US$1.12 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to US$1.05 million for the year ended December 31, 2013; ·· A decrease of the property management fee of US$ 0.75 million, as “Desarrolladora Vesta” (or “DV”) was eliminated as the external management company hired by Vesta and all the activities previously performed by DV are now done by Vesta Management, a fully owned subsidiary of the Company. In addition, direct operating costs of investment properties that have not been leased and which did not generate rental income decreased by US$0.30 million. This decrease was the result of: ·· Real Estate property taxes of US$0.17 million in our properties which did not generate income; ·· An increase of US$0.12 in other expenses related to the properties, which are generated from the fees paid to industrial parks where we maintain land reserves; ·· Accrued insurance of US$0.01 million on properties that did not produce any income. 47 IA 2013 Administrative expenses Administration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were US$6.80 million compared to US$6.64 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, which represents an increase of US$0.16 million, or 2.4%. This increase is primarily due to the expenses of the incorporation of management to the Company. During 2013, there was: ·· An increase of US$3.24 million due to the salaries and expenses of personnel management hired by the new subsidiary of the Company. Vesta used to be administered by an external company that charged a commission. This change came into effect in August 2012; ·· An increase in legal expenses and fees paid to board members of the corporate practice and auditing committees of US$0.07 million, or 11%. ·· These increases were partially offset by: ·· Indirect expenses for the initial public offering amounting to US$2.56 million in 2012, consisting of an extraordinary and once-only expense. The secondary public offering expenses in 2013 amounted to US$0.19 million. ·· A decrease of US$0.77 million in fees, which were previously paid to Desarrolladora. We have incorporated all administrative personnel into the Company and consequently we will no longer pay such fees. ·· A decrease of US$0.01 million, or 10.1%, in marketing expenses Depreciation Depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2013 was US$0.08 million compared to US$0.06 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Other income and expenses Other income and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 was income of US$79.69 million compared to an expense of US$7.65 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is primarily explained from the increase in the gain on the revaluation of our property and the increase in the income from interest derived from the investments made with the proceeds of the initial and secondary public offering. Income expenses decreased due to a lower average debt level in 2013 compared with 2012. The assessment of 2013 shows a gain of US$95.05 million, compared with a profit of US$21.83 million in 2012. The assessment was made in December 2013 and reflects the conditions of the real estate market observed at this date. Year ending December 31, 2013 2012 (millions of dollars) Other income and expenses Interest Income US$6.95 US$3.45 Other gains (loses) (0.06) 0.04 Income expenses (23.44) (24.95) Exchange gain (loss) 1.19 7.28 Gain (loss) on revaluation of investment properties 95.05 21.83 Total other income US$79.69 US$7.65 Interest income increased US$3.50 to reach US$6.95 million in 2013, compared to US$3.45 million in 2012. The increase stems from the investment of the proceeds of our follow-on offer that are being invested in short-term government instruments. The foreign exchange gain in 2013 amounted to US$6.09 million compared to 2012. The foreign exchange gain is mainly explained by the effect of the foreign exchange in the balance of the debt in dollars with WTN, and the peso balance in our cash and investments accounts. Other income dropped to US$0.10 million as of December 31, 2013. This was due to lower inflationary adjustments on refunds of tax and credits in 2013. Interest expense declined US$1.51 million, or 6.1%, as of December 31, 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease stems from a lower average debt balance during 2013 compared to 2012. The gains from the revaluation of the investment properties at the end of December 31, 2013 increased by US$73.22 million, compared to 2012. 48 VESTA Profit before income taxes For the reasons described above, our profit before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013 was US$127.88 million compared to a profit before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012 of US$48.71 million, representing an increase of US$79.2 million. Income taxes Income tax benefit (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2013 was an expense of US$38.45 million compared to an expense of US$7.86 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily attributable to the difference between deferred tax expenses between 2013 and 2012. Deferred tax expenses mainly reflect: (1) the effect of the exchange rate used to convert the taxable assets on our balance in Mexican pesos for tax calculations (including the fiscal value of our investment properties and benefits of tax loss carry forwards) to US dollars at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2012; (2) a benefit resulting from the impact of inflation on the tax base of our fiscal assets, according to the extent allowed under the law of income tax; and, (3) for the purpose of recognizing the fair value of investment property for accounting purposes as the tax value of assets remains at historical cost and then appreciated. Profit for the year For the reasons described above, our profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 was US$89.43 million compared to a profit of US$40.84 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Comprehensive income for the year Comprehensive income reflects the impact of the fluctuation in exchange rates in the capital accounts of WTN, which is our only subsidiary and which uses the Mexican peso as functional currency. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded other comprehensive income of US$0.08 million, compared to other comprehensive income of US$0.82 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Cash flow The table below shows the production and use of cash as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Year ending December 31, 2013 2012 (millions of dollars) Cash flow from operating activities US$32.52 US$35.80 Cash flow from investing activities (208.82) (178.79) Cash flow from financing activities 147.60 174.77 Effects of exchange rates changes on cash 0.04 0.32 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents US$(28.65) US$32.10 Cash flow from operating activities The main factor that affected the cash flow generation of our Company was the product of our base rents charged to tenants Our cash flow generated by operating activities in 2013 was mainly affected by the increase in recoverable taxes, amounting to US$10.65 million. Cash flow produced from operating activities in 2012 was mainly affected by the increase in recoverable taxes, amounting to US$7.19 million, mostly related to value added tax, and the payment of taxes in 2012, amounting to US$2.43 million. 49 IA 2013 Cash flow from investing activities Cash flow from investing activities was US$208.62 million and US$178.9 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In 2013, investing activities were primarily related to constructions of new buildings in the Bajio and Center regions. Total investment in the year amounted to US$102.94 million in 2013 and US$ 65.30 million in 2012. Cash flow from financing activities Cash flow from financing activities in 2013 and 2012 was US$147.61 million produced and US$174.77 million used, respectively. The Company successfully raised capital in 2013 by issuing 114.57 million shares, which allowed for the aggregation US$197.94 million of additional capital. The issue of 168.62 million shares in 2012 meant that the Company could add US$217.98 million to its capital. Debt As of December 31, 2013, Vesta’s total outstanding debt reached US$318.03 million, of which 2.6%, or US$8.22 million, is related to short term liabilities, while the US$309.81 million, or 97.4%, represent longterm debt, both contracted with GE Real Estate de Mexico, S. de R. L. de C.V. All the debt is guaranteed by a trust, which is tied to most of our income properties as well as the rental revenue derived from outstanding contracts. At the close of December 31, 2013, 100.0% of the debt was denominated in dollars. Main corporate events in 2013 On December 16, Vesta announced that Mr. Alejandro Berho Corona had resigned as a member of the Board of Directors, effective October 24, 2013, due to commitments with his employer. This announcement also acknowledged the resignation of Mr. Guillermo Briones Perez as Director of the Central Region. In this case the Board of Directors did not appoint an alternate member.

CORPORACIÓN INMOBILIARIA VESTA, S. A.B. DE C.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 (In US dollars) 1. GENERAL INFORMATION Corporación Inmobiliaria Vesta, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Vesta”) is a corporation incorporated in Mexico. The address of its registered office and principal place of business is Bosques de Ciruelos 304, 7th floor, Mexico City. Vesta and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Entity”) are engaged in the development, acquisition and operation of industrial buildings and distribution facilities that are rented to corporations in eleven states throughout Mexico. The Entity does not have employees and receives all its administrative services from a related party. On June 25, 2013, the Entity issued equity through a follow-on public offering of shares in the Mexican stock market for a total number of shares of 114,573,661. On July 25, 2012, the Entity issued equity through an initial public offering of shares in the Mexican stock market becoming a listed corporation (sociedad anonima bursatil), under the Mexican Securities Law, such that its denomination became Corporación Inmobiliaria Vesta, Sociedad Anónima Bursátil de Capital Variable, (S.A.B. de C.V.). On August 1, 2012, the Entity’s newly incorporated subsidiary, Vesta Management S.C., hired all of the former employees and executives of Desarrolladora Vesta, S. de R.L. de C.V., a related party, that until such date provided management services to Vesta. This subsidiary will incur employee benefits, other employee related expenses and employee retirement and postemployment obligations that were formerly paid to Desarrolladora Vesta by the Entity. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 2.1 Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. 2.2 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment properties and financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Entity takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis. In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: • Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date; • Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and • Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 2.3 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Vesta and entities (including structured entities) controlled by Vesta and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Entity: • has power over the investee; • is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and • has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. The Entity reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Entity obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Entity loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Entity gains control until the date when the Entity ceases to control the subsidiary. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Entity’s accounting policies. All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Entity are eliminated in full on consolidation. 57 IA 2013 OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE Subsidiary/entity 31/12/13 31/12/12 Activity QVC, S. de R.L. de C.V. 99.99% 99.99% Holds investment properties QVC II, S. de R.L. de C.V. 99.99% 99.99% Holds investment properties WTN Desarrollos Inmobiliarios de México, S. de R.L. de C.V. 99.99% 99.99% Holds investment properties Vesta Baja California, S. de R.L. de C.V. 99.99% 99.99% Holds investment properties Vesta Bajío, S. de R.L. de C.V. 99.99% 99.99% Holds investment properties Vesta Queretaro, S. de R.L. de C.V. 99.99% 99.99% Holds investment properties Proyectos Aeroespaciales, S. de R.L. de C.V. 99.99% 99.99% Holds investment properties CIV Infraestructura, S. de R.L. de C.V. 99.99% 99.99% Holds investment properties Vesta Management, S.C.

(2) Vesta DSP, S. de R. L. de C.V. was incorporated as a subsidiary of the Entity as of January 1, 2013. 2.4 Foreign currencies The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Vesta and all of its subsidiaries except for WTN Desarrollos Inmobiliarios de México, S. de R. L. de C.V. (“WTN”), which considers the Mexican peso to be its functional currency and is considered to be a “foreign operation” under IFRS. However, Vesta and its subsidiaries keep their accounting records in Mexican pesos. In preparing the financial statements of each individual entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the exchange rates in effect on the dates of each transaction. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates in effect at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates in effect on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of WTN are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect on the last business day of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates in effect on the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recorded in other comprehensive income. 2.5 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist mainly of bank deposits in checking accounts and short-term investments, highly liquid and easily convertible into cash, maturing within three months as of their acquisition date, which are subject to immaterial value change risks. Cash is carried at nominal value and cash equivalents are valued at fair value; any fluctuations in value are recognized in interest income of the period. Cash equivalents are represented mainly by investments in treasury certificates (CETES) and money market funds. 2.6 Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when Vesta or its subsidiaries become a party to the contract governing such financial instruments. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss. 2.6.1 Effective interest method on financial assets The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows expected to be received (including all fees and expenses paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. Income is recognized on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss. 2.6.2 Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed payments or payments that may be determined and are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables (including operating lease receivables and others) are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. 58 VESTA 2.6.3 Financial assets at fair value through profit of loss (FVTPL) Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. A financial asset is classified as held for trading if: • it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the near term; or • on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or • it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument. Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the ‘interest income’ line item. Financial assets at FVTPL consist mainly of holdings in investment funds. The Entity has not designated any asset as at FVTPL. 2.6.4 Derecognition of financial assets The Entity derecognizes a financial asset only when the contract granting the Entity the right to receive cash flows from the asset expires, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity. If the Entity neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Entity recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Entity retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Entity continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received. 2.7 Investment property Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including property under construction for such purposes). Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are included in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. An investment property is derecognized upon sale or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected to be received from such investment property. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognized. 2.8 Office furniture Office furniture is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. An item of office furniture is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of the asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss. 2.9 Provisions Provisions are recognized when the Entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, when it is probable that the Entity will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties associated with the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the effect of the time value of money is material). When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. 2.10 Financial liabilities and equity instruments 2.10.1 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (“at FVTPL”) or other financial liabilities. 2.10.2 Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities (including borrowings) are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and expenses paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. 2.10.3 Derecognition of financial liabilities The Entity derecognizes financial liabilities only when its obligations are discharged or cancelled or when they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss. 59 IA 2013 2.11 Direct employee benefits Direct employee benefits are calculated based on the services rendered by employees, considering their most recent salaries. The liability is recognized as it accrues. These benefits include mainly statutory employee profit sharing (“PTU”) payable, compensated absences, such as vacation and vacation premiums, and incentives. 2.12 Employee benefits for termination Employee benefits for termination are recorded in the results of the year in which they are incurred. 2.13 Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease agreement transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. The Entity, as a lessor, retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership of the properties and accounts for its leases as operating leases. Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease agreement. As a lessee, the Entity recognizes operating lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. 2.14 Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 2.14.1 Current tax Income tax (“ISR”) and the Business Flat Tax (“IETU”) are recorded in the results of the year they are incurred. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated statement of profit and other comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Entity’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 2.14.2 Deferred tax In order to recognize deferred income taxes, based on its financial projections, the Entity determines whether it expects to incur ISR or IETU. Deferred taxes are then calculated by applying either the ISR or IETU tax rate to temporary differences resulting from comparing the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and including, if any, future benefits from tax loss carryforwards and certain tax credits. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recorded only when there is a high probability of recovery. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Entity expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. The Mexican income tax law does not provide different tax bases or tax rates with respect to the use of investment properties (i.e. whether investment properties are used to generate rental income or are whether they are held to recover their value through sale). 2.14.3 Current and deferred tax for the year Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination. 2.15 Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill At the end of each reporting period, the Entity reviews the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss. 2.16 Earnings per share Basic earnings per common share are calculated by dividing net income of the controlling interest by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are determined by adjusting consolidated net income and common shares on the assumption that the Entity’s commitments to issue or exchange its own shares would be fulfilled. However, as the Entity does not have any dilutive instruments, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same. 60 VESTA 2.17 Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 2.17.1 New and revised IFRSs affecting amounts reported and/or disclosures in the financial statements In the current year, the Entity has applied a number of a new and revised IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after January 1, 2013. Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The Entity has applied the amendments to IFRS 7, Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for the first time in the current year. The amendments to IFRS 7 require entities to disclose information about rights of offset and related arrangements (such as collateral posting requirements) for financial instruments under an enforceable master netting agreement or similar arrangement. The application of the amendments did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. New and revised Standards on consolidation, joint arrangements, associates and disclosures In May 2011, a package of five standards on consolidation, joint arrangements, associates and disclosures was issued, comprising IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, IAS 27 (as revised in 2011), Separate Financial Statements and IAS 28 (as revised in 2011), Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Subsequent to the issue of these standards, amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 were issued to clarify certain transitional guidance on the first-time application of the standards. Key requirements of these five standards are described below: IFRS 10 replaces the parts of IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that deal with consolidated financial statements. SIC-12, Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities will be withdrawn upon the effective date of IFRS 10. IFRS 10 changes the definition of control such that an investor has control over an investee when a) it has power over the investee, b) it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and c) has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. All three of these criteria must be met for an investor to have control over an investee. Previously, control was defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Additional guidance has been included in IFRS 10 to explain when an investor has control over an investee. IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures, and the guidance contained in a related interpretation, SIC-13, Jointly Controlled Entities – Non-Monetary Contributions by Venturers, has been incorporated in IAS 28 (as revised in 2011). IFRS 11 deals with how a joint arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control should be classified and accounted for. Under IFRS 11, there are only two types of joint arrangements – joint operations and joint ventures. The classification of joint arrangements under IFRS 11 is determined based on the rights and obligations of parties to the joint arrangements by considering the structure, the legal form of the arrangements, the contractual terms agreed by the parties to the arrangement, and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (i.e. joint operators) have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (i.e. joint venturers) have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Previously, IAS 31 contemplated three types of joint arrangements – jointly controlled entities, jointly controlled operations and jointly controlled assets. The classification of joint arrangements under IAS 31 was primarily determined based on the legal form of the arrangement (e.g. a joint arrangement that was established through a separate entity was accounted for as a jointly controlled entity). The initial and subsequent accounting of joint ventures and joint operations is different. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (proportionate consolidation is no longer allowed). Investments in joint operations are accounted for such that each joint operator recognizes its assets (including its share of any assets jointly held), its liabilities (including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly), its revenue (including its share of revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation) and its expenses (including its share of any expenses incurred jointly). Each joint operator accounts for the assets and liabilities, as well as revenues and expenses, relating to its interest in the joint operation in accordance with the applicable Standards. IFRS 12 is a disclosure standard and is applicable to entities that have interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and/or unconsolidated structured entities. In general, the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12 are more extensive than those in the current standards. IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement The Entity has applied IFRS 13 for the first time in the current year. IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements. The scope of IFRS 13 is broad; the fair value measurement requirements of IFRS 13 apply to both financial instrument items and non-financial instrument items for which other IFRSs require or permit fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements, except for sharebased payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS 17 Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value (e.g. net realizable value for the purposes of measuring inventories or value in use for impairment assessment purposes). IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions. Fair value under IFRS 13 is an exit price regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. Also, IFRS 13 includes extensive disclosure requirements. 61 IA 2013 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income The Entity has applied the amendments which introduce new terminology for the statement of comprehensive income and income statement. Under the amendments to IAS 1, the ‘statement of comprehensive income’ is renamed the ‘statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income’ and the ‘income statement’ is renamed the ‘statement of profit or loss’. The amendments to IAS 1 retain the option to present profit or loss and other comprehensive income in either a single statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. However, the amendments to IAS 1 require items of other comprehensive income to be grouped into two categories in the other comprehensive income section: (a) items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and (b) items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions are met. Income tax on items of other comprehensive income is required to be allocated on the same basis – the amendments do not change the option to present items of other comprehensive income either before tax or net of tax. The amendments have been applied retrospectively, and hence the presentation of items of other comprehensive income has been modified to reflect the changes. Other than the above mentioned presentation changes, the application of the amendments to IAS 1 does not result in any impact on profit or loss, other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income. IAS 1 The Entity has applied the amendments to IAS 1 as part of the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2009-2011. IAS 1 requires when a statement of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period (third statement of financial position) and the related notes are required to be presented. This amendment did not have any impact on the Entity’s consolidated financial statements IAS 19 Employee Benefits (as revised in 2011) IAS 19 (as revised in 2011) changes the accounting for defined benefit plans and termination benefits. The most significant change relates to the accounting for changes in defined benefit obligations and plan assets. The amendments require the recognition of changes in defined benefit obligations and in the fair value of plan assets when they occur, and hence eliminate the ‘corridor approach’ permitted under the previous version of IAS 19 and accelerate the recognition of past service costs. All actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately through other comprehensive income in order for the net pension asset or liability recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position to reflect the full value of the plan deficit or surplus. Furthermore, the interest cost and expected return on plan assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 are replaced with a ‘net interest’ amount under IAS 19 (as revised in 2011), which is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. These changes did not have a material impact on the amounts recognized in profit or loss and other comprehensive income in prior years. In addition IAS 19 (as revised in 2011) introduces certain changes in the presentation of the defined benefit cost including more extensive disclosures. 2.17.2 New and revised IFRSs issued but not yet effective The Entity has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective: IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (3) Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, Mandatory Effective Date of IFRS 9 and transition disclosures (2) Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27, Investment Entitites (1) Amendments to IAS 32, Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (1) (1) Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014, with earlier application permitted. (2) Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, with earlier application permitted. (3) Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 1, 2016, with earlier application permitted. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9, issued in November 2009, introduced new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets. IFRS 9 was amended in October 2010 to include requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for derecognition. Key requirements of IFRS 9: • All recognized financial assets that are within the scope of IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are required to be subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value. Specifically, debt investments that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding are generally measured at amortized cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods. All other debt investments and equity investments are measured at their fair value at the end of subsequent accounting periods. In addition, under IFRS 9, entities may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of an equity investment (that is not held for trading) in other comprehensive income, with only dividend income generally recognized in profit or loss. 62 VESTA • With regard to the measurement of financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss, IFRS 9 requires that the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is presented in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability’s credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. Under IAS 39, the entire amount of the change in the fair value of the financial liability designated as fair value through profit or loss is presented in profit or loss. Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Investment Entities The amendments to IFRS 10 define an investment entity and require a reporting entity that meets the definition of an investment entity not to consolidate its subsidiaries but instead to measure its subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss in its consolidated and separate financial statements. To qualify as an investment entity, a reporting entity is required to: • Obtain funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing them with professional investment management services. • Commit to its investor(s) that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both. • Measure and evaluate performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis. Consequential amendments have been made to IFRS 12 and IAS 27 to introduce new disclosure requirements for investment entities. Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The amendments to IAS 32 clarify the requirements relating to the offset of financial assets and financial liabilities. Specifically, the amendments clarify the meaning of ‘currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off’ and ‘simultaneous realization and settlement’. At the date of these consolidated financial statements, the Entity has not fully assessed the effects of adopting these new standards on its financial information but management believes that their adoption will not have a material impact on its financial position or the results of its operations. 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the application of the Entity’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 3.1 Valuation of investment properties As described in Note 8, the Entity uses external appraisers in order to determine the fair value of its investment properties. Such appraisers use several valuation methodologies that include assumptions that are not directly observable in the market to estimate the fair value of its investment properties. Note 8 provides detailed information about the key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the investment properties. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Entity uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Entity engages third party qualified valuers to perform the valuation. The valuation committee works closely with the qualified external valuers to establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. The Chief Financial Officer reports the valuation committee’s findings to the board of directors of the Entity every quarter to explain the cause of fluctuations in the fair value of the assets and liabilities. Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 and 14. The Entity’s management believes that the chosen valuation methodologies and assumptions used are appropriate in determining the fair value of the Entity’s investment properties. 63 IA 2013 4. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and in banks, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the reporting period as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows can be reconciled to the related items in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows: 31/12/2013 31/12/2012 Cash and bank balances $ 3,766,015 $ 3,972,805 Cash equivalents 26,208,428 Restricted cash 4,531,782 6,765,861 $ 8,297,797 $ 36,947,094 Restricted cash represents balances held by the Entity that are only available for use under certain conditions pursuant to the loan agreements entered into by the Entity. Such conditions include payment of monthly debt service and compliance with certain covenants set forth in the loan agreement. 5. FINANCIAL ASSETS HELD FOR TRADING The portfolio of financial assets that the Entity has classified as held for trading relates to investments used by the Entity to manage its cash surplus. Such financial assets were acquired in active markets and are principally comprised of investment funds with no maturity date and which mainly invest in AAA debt instruments, such as government bonds. 6. RECOVERABLE TAXES 31/12/2013 31/12/2012 Recoverable value-added tax (“VAT”) $ 14,899,233 $ 8,233,933 Recoverable taxes other than VAT 1,591,518 1,752,885 Other receivables 55,524 425,671 $ 16,546,275 $ 10,412,489 7. OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES 7.1 The aging profile of operating lease receivables as of the dates indicated below are as follows: 31/12/2013 31/12/2012 0-30 days $ 6,580,998 $ 3,960,900 30-60 days 103,202 263,738 60-90 days 22,559 58,549 Over 90 days 1,815 Total $ 6,706,759 $ 4,285,002 Pursuant to the lease agreements, rental payments should be received within 30 days following their due date; thereafter the payment is considered past due. As shown in the table above, 98% and 92% of all operating lease receivables are current at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. All rental payments past due from 30 to 90 days are monitored by the Entity and efforts are made to collect payment from the respective client. Operating lease receivables past due for more than 30 days but less than 60 days represent 1.5% and 6% of all operating lease receivables at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Operating lease receivables past due for more than 60 and less than 90 days represent .5% and 1% of all operating lease receivable at December 31, 2013 and 2012. When rental payments are past due for more than 90 days, the Entity normally initiates legal action to recover such amounts from its clients. Amounts due over 90 days represent 1% of all lease receivables at December 31, 2012. 7.2 Movement in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 31/12/2012 Balance at beginning of the year $ (832,986) Amounts written off during the year as uncollectible 832,986 Balance at end of the year $ The Entity individually reviews each of its operating lease receivables and according to the aging report determines the need to create an allowance for the recoverability of such receivables.

The same client accounted for 20% and 21% of the total rental income of Entity for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 7.4 Leasing agreements Operating leases relate to non-cancellable lease agreements over the investment properties owned by the Entity, which generally have terms ranging between 5 to15 years, with options to extend the term up to a total term of 20 years. Rents are customarily payable on a monthly basis, and are adjusted annually according to applicable inflation indices (US and Mexican inflation indices). Security deposits are typically equal to one or two months’ rent. Obtaining property insurance (third party liability) and operating maintenance are obligations of the tenants. All lease agreements include a rescission clause that entitles the Entity to collect all unpaid rents during the remaining term of the lease agreement in the event that the client defaults in its rental payments, vacates the properties, terminates the lease agreement or enters into bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. All lease agreements are classified as operating leases and do not include purchase options, except for two lease agreements which contain a purchase option at market conditions at the end of the lease term. 7.5 Non-cancellable operating lease receivables Future minimum lease payments receivable under non-cancellable operating lease agreements are as follows: 31/12/2013 Not later than 1 year $ 67,282,095 Later than 1 year and not later than 3 years 118,549,785 Later than 3 years and not later than 5 years 117,861,367 Later than 5 years 120,904,109 $ 424,597,356 8. INVESTMENT PROPERTY The Entity uses external appraisers in order to determine the fair value for all of its investment properties. The independent appraisers, who hold recognized and relevant professional qualifications and have vast experience in the types of investment properties, owned by the Entity, use valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flows approach, replacement cost approach and income cap rate approach. The techniques used include assumptions, the majority of which are not directly observable in the market, to estimate the fair value of the Entity’s investment property such as discount rates, capitalization rates and occupancy rates. The values, determined by the external appraisers annually, are recognized as the fair value of the Entity’s investment property at the end of each reporting period. The appraisers use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of land and buildings (using the expected net operating income (“NOI”) of the investment property) and a market approach to determine the fair value of land reserves. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values are included in the consolidated statements of profit and other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. The Entity’s investment properties are located in México and they are classified as Level 3 in the IFRS fair value hierarchy. The following table provides information about how the fair values of the investment properties are determined (in particular, the valuation technique(s) and inputs used).

INCOME TAXES The Entity is subject to ISR and through December 31, 2013, to ISR and IETU. ISR -The rate was 30% in 2013 and 2012 and as a result of the new 2014 ISR law (2014Tax Law), the rate will continue at 30% in 2014 and thereafter. IETU – IETU was eliminated as of 2014; therefore, up to December 31, 2013, this tax was incurred both on revenues and deductions and certain tax credits based on cash flows from each year. The respective rate was 17.5%. The current income tax is the greater of ISR and IETU up to 2013. Based on its financial projections, the Entity determined that it will essentially pay ISR. Therefore, it only recognizes deferred ISR. 13.1 Income taxes are as follows: 31/12/2013 31/12/2012 ISR expense: Current $ 6,947,623 $ 5,564,057 Expired ISR credit on dividends 580,701 Deferred 30,919,613 1,729,683 38,447,937 7,293,740 IETU expense: Current 571,812 Total income taxes $ 38,447,937 $ 7,865,552 13.2 The effective ISR rate for fiscal 2013 and 2012 differ from the statutory rate as follows: 31/12/2013 31/12/2012 Statutory rate 30% 30% Effects of exchange rates on tax balances (1)% (9)% Effects of inflation (4)% (6)% IETU expense 1% Effects of change in ISR rate (2014 Tax Law) 3% Other 2% Effective rate 30% 16% 13.3 The main items originating the deferred ISR liability are: 31/12/2013 31/12/2012 Deferred ISR assets (liabilities): Investment property $ (107,817,334) $ (74,464,893) Effect of tax loss carryforwards 15,398,333 11,830,926 Other provisions and prepaids 900,398 117,522 Deferred income taxes – Net $ (91,518,603) $ (62,516,445) To determine deferred ISR the Entity applied the applicable tax rates to temporary differences based on their estimated reversal dates. 13.4 The benefits of restated tax loss carryforwards for which the deferred ISR asset has been recognized can be recovered subject to certain conditions.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 14.1 Capital management The Entity manages its capital to ensure that the Entity will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the return to partners through the optimization of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Entity consists of net debt (borrowings as detailed in Note 9 offset by cash and bank balances) and equity of the Entity (comprising issued capital, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings and other comprehensive income as detailed in Note 10). The Entity is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. 14.2 Leverage ratio The Board reviews the capital structure of the Entity on a regular basis. As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The leverage ratio at end of following reporting periods was as follows: 31/12/2013 31/12/2012 Debt $ 318,027,746 $ 327,862,243 Cash and bank balances (8,297,797) (36,947,094) Financial assets held for trading (233,052,020) (120,345,021) Net debt 76,677,929 170,570,128 Equity 789,585,406 517,228,170 Net debt to equity ratio 10% 33% Debt includes long-term debt plus its current portion. Equity includes capital stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings and other comprehensive income of the Entity. 14.3 Categories of financial instruments Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognized, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The Entity’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash equivalents and restricted cash as disclosed in Note 4, recoverable taxes and operating lease receivables as disclosed in Notes 6 and 7, respectively and financial assets held for trading in Note 5. The Entity’s principal financial liability is long-term debt as disclosed in Note 9. 14.4 Financial risk management objectives The Entity seeks to minimize the effects of market risk (including fair value interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk (although currently the Entity only has fixed rate debt instruments with varying maturity profiles). No significant interest rate hedges or trading financial instruments were entered into during the period of the acCompanying consolidated financial statements. 14.5 Market risk The Entity’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates (see 14.8 and 14.9 below) and foreign currency exchange rates (see 14.6 and 14.7 below). The Entity may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. There has been no change to the Entity’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which these risks are managed and measured. 14.6 Foreign currency risk management The Entity is exposed to foreign exchange risk, primarily with respect to the Mexican peso and to the US dollar in respect of one of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Mexican peso. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognized monetary assets and liabilities. The carrying amounts of the Entity’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting period are as follows: 31/12/2013 31/12/2012 Monetary assets Mexican pesos 3,354,707,083 2,060,405,495 US dollars $ 261,858 $ 264,977 Monetary liabilities Mexican pesos 16,307,237 1,052,321 US dollars $ 40,874,151 $ 41,361,548 71 IA 2013 14.7 Foreing currency sensitivity analysts The following table details the Entity’s sensitivity to a 10% appreciation or depreciation in the US dollar against the Mexican peso. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel, and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where the US dollar appreciates 10% against the relevant currency. For a 10% depreciation of the US dollar against the Mexican peso, there would be a comparable impact on the profit or equity, and the balances below would be negative. 31/12/2013 Profit or loss impart Mexican peso – 10% appreciation – gain $ (23,208,878) Mexican peso – 10% depreciation – loss 28,366,407 U.S. dollar 10% appreciation – loss 4,061,229 U.S. dollar 10% depreciation – gain (4,061,229) 14.8 Interest rate risk management The Entity minimizes its exposure to interest rate risk by borrowing funds at fixed rates, because investment properties owned by the Entity generate a fixed income in the form of rental income which is indexed to inflation. 14.9 Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Entity. The Entity has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Entity’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are monitored, and the transactions consummated are entered into with approved counterparties. The Entity’s clients operate in a variety of industries. Its real estate portfolio is primarily concentrated in the food and beverage, automotive, aerospace, medical, logistics and plastics industries. The Entity’s exposure to these industries subjects it to the risk of economic downturns in such industrial sectors to a greater extent than if its properties were more diversified across other industries. The Entity currently leases two distribution facilities to a single customer, which represent 24% of its total portfolio’s gross leasable area, and 89% and 67% of its operating lease receivable balance and its annualized rents as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. If this customer were to terminate its lease agreements with the Entity, the Entity may experience a material loss with respect to future rental income. 14.10 Liquidity risk management If the Entity is unable to raise additional debt or equity, its results of operations could suffer. The Entity closely monitors the maturity of its liabilities and the cash needs of its operations. It prepares and provides a detailed cash flow analysis on a quarterly basis and presents it to its board of directors. Decisions are made to obtain new financing or limit cash investments in order to maintain a healthy projected cash balance. The maturity of the long-term, its current portion and the accrued interest at December 31, 2013 is as follows: Weighted average Less than 1-3 3 months interest rate 1 month months to 1 year 1-2 years Total % Long-term debt 7.02 $ 601,520 $ 2,232,195 $ 8,324,839 $ 306,869,192 $ 318,027,746 Accrued interest 1,712,584 6,190,830 22,211,969 34,016,175 64,131,558 $ 2,314,104 $ 8,423,025 $ 30,536,808 $ 340,885,367 $ 382,159,304 72 VESTA 14.11Fair value of financial instruments 14.11.1 Fair value of financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis The Entity’s financial assets held for trading are classified as level 1 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy since they are traded in an active market. 14.11.2 Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortized cost The fair value of long-term debt and its related current portion as of December, 31, 2013and 2012 is $325,471,021 and $328,637,868, respectively. Management considers that the carrying amounts of financial assets and other financial liabilities recognized in the consolidated financial statements approximate their fair values. This measurement is classified as level two since management uses an adjusted observable discount rate to determine its fair value. 15.

LITIGATION, OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS In the ordinary course of business, the Entity is party to various legal proceedings. The Entity is not involved in any litigation or arbitration proceeding for which the Entity believes it is not adequately insured or indemnified, or which, if determined adversely, would have a material adverse effect on the Entity or its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As mentioned in Note 8, all rights to construction, improvements and infrastructure built by the Entity in the Queretaro Aerospace Park automatically revert back to the government of the State of Queretaro at the end of the concession, which is approximately in 45 years. 17. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUANCE AUTHORIZATION On February 17, 2014 the issuance of the consolidated financial statements was authorized by Juan Sottil, the Entity’s Chief Financial Officer; consequently, they do not reflect events occurred after that date.
