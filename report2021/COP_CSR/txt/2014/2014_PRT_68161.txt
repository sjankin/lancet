Rui Cartaxo Chairman of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee REN Redes Energéticas Nacionais ANNUAL REPORT 2013 7 01 MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT “IN A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT YEAR, OUR COMPANY CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE RESILIENCE OF ITS BUSINESS MODEL.” The financial year of 2013 was one of decreased by 7.1%. At the end of the most difficult in recent times with the year, the number of company regard to the REN economic-financial employees stood at 676, against 735 environment and where the main for the previous year. Through these difficulty lay in the asymmetry caused efforts to improve efficiency, REN to REN’s results by financial market managed to cancel out most of the fluctuations. short-term negative impact brought about by the fall in interest rates.

The concession is for a period of 50 years and started in 2007; and • Natural gas – the high pressure transmission and the overall technical management of the national natural gas system, the reception, storage and regasification of liquefied natural gas and the underground storage of gas, REN Gasodutos, S.A., REN Atlântico – Terminal de GNL, S.A. and REN Armazenagem, S.A. (respectively), companies from the REN Group, have been public service concession holders since 2006, and the licence is for a period of 40 years. Through REN Trading, S.A., REN manages the energy to be acquired from two electrical power plants, as part of energy acquisition contracts which were not subject to early termination. Since 2002, REN has also been present in the telecommunications sector through REN Telecom – Comunicações, S.A., established with the aim of using the surplus capacity of the safety telecommunications networks which are vital to electricity and natural gas transmission. In October 2010, the Portuguese state awarded Enondas, Energia das Ondas, S.A., a company wholly owned by REN, a concession for wave energy production in a pilot area to the north of S. Pedro de Moel. The concession has been granted for a period of 45 years and includes authorization to build the infrastructures required to connect to the public power grid. Group business functions are conducted by REN Serviços, S.A. (“REN Serviços”). More specifically, this includes support for the concession holders and back-office services.

The revenue allowed from GGS and TEE is received by applying two regulated tariffs: the tariff for the General System Use (UGS) and the tariff for Transmission Network Use (URT). Both tariffs are defined annually by the Energy Services Regulatory Authority (ERSE) based on energy and economic forecasts for demand, costs, revenues and investment. In 2012, a new regulation period was started and while no changes were made to the actual form of the regulation, the regulatory parameters were updated. The efficiency factor applied to operating costs for the TEE Power was altered to 3.5% (2013 and 2014) and the remuneration rate is now indexed to the 5 year Portuguese Republic Credit Default Swap rating. Also introduced were limits to the remuneration base rate for the 2012-2014 period of between 7.5% and 10.5%. Regulation of activities Activity relating to the GGS is regulated by a remuneration rate applied to the assets allocated to the activity, net of depreciations, subsidies and eligible operating costs. Activity relating to the TEE is regulated by incentives: (I) incentive to efficient investment in the transmission network; (ii) incentive to efficiency in operating costs by establishing a maximum limit for these costs plus a component based IN 2013, THE BASE on the level of company activity; (iii) incentive to maintain equipment at the REMUNERATION end of its service life in operation; and (iv) incentive to increase the availability of the elements of the National Transmission Network (RNT).The aim of the RATE investment incentive is to reward, as additional remuneration, the efficiency was 8.06% obtained in investment subject to reference costs and which falls within set parameters. The value of operating costs set for the 1st year of the regulation period evolves in subsequent years in line with the variation rate of the Price Index implicit in GDP, and with an efficiency target determined by ERSE, which for 2013 and 2014 is 3.5%. Added to this amount is the change in OPEX due to the annual growth in the transmission network (in kilometres of lines and in the number of panels at substations), calculated with the corresponding incremental costs, also set by ERSE. The aim of the incentive to maintain equipment in service which has reached the end of its working life is to stimulate continuity in service of certain assets which are at the end of their economic life but still technically viable in operational terms. For 2013, this incentive stood at 8 millions of euros. The aim of the incentive to increase the availability of the National Electricity Transmission Grid, which was introduced in 2009, is to promote more efficient operation and maintenance of the grid’s infrastructure and is calculated based on values that have already occurred. For 2013, this incentive stood at approximately 1 millions of euros. The regulated assets base (RAB) for electricity consists of the assets net of amortizations and subsidies allocated to the activities of TEE and GGS. As already mentioned, through the publication of ERSE Official Order No 14430/2010 of 15 September 2010, the assets base to be remunerated is based on the application of the valuation mechanism of new investment in the RNT, at reference costs with effect from 1 January 2009. Therefore, in 2013, the average RAB on which the premium rate of 9.56% was applied, was 892 million euros, while the remaining 1 132 million euros was remunerated at a non premium rate of 8.06%. 24 REN AT A GLANCE In the activity of GGS, the principle of RAB valuation is based on historic costs. In these cases, the remuneration rate of 8.06% is applied. In 2013, the average RAB for the activity of GGS stood at 43 million euros. Moreover, part of the assets allocated to this activity is public land used for hydro-electrical purposes, the remuneration for which is calculated through the interbank swap rate with the maturity closest to the remaining lifetime of each asset, calculated on the 1st day of each period, as published by Reuters, plus 50 base points, pursuant to Implementing Order (Portaria) No 542/2010 of 21 July 2010, which in 2013 corresponded to a remuneration rate of 2.8% applied to a sum of 293 millions of euros. The following graph shows the RAB for the different asset groups: RAB FROM 1999 TO 2013 2 500 892 753 561 2 000 351 130 1 500 M 1 000 706 701 696 722 775 833 911 1 034 1 172 1 298 1 324 1 273 1 245 1 220 1 175 500 523 507 492 476 461 445 427 409 394 361 347 333 319 306 293 0 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013E RAB POWER PLANT LAND RAB RATE WITHOUT PREMIUM (EXCLUDES LAND) RAB RATE WITH PREMIUM The tariffs set by ERSE also reflect tariff differences which, after two years, (to the extent they are justified and accepted by ERSE) reconcile the forecast and real values of income and costs and differences in demand. The adjustments arising from the differences are recovered or returned two years after they have occurred. This sum is remunerated at a regulated rate equal to the 1 year Euribor average seen each year, plus a spread published annually by ERSE for the year in question. The difference in 2013 of 18 million euros to be returned by REN, was mainly due to an underestimation of relative energy consumption by the asset remuneration rate regulator and the application of Implementing Order (Portaria) No 215 A/2013 of 1 July 2013 on interruptibility, which differs by one year due to the repercussions on income allowed in GGS for sums paid in accordance with this system. 2.6.1.1 REN Trading REN Trading is responsible for the Purchase and Sale of Electrical Power from the Commercial Agent, which consists of trading in the Iberian Electrical Power Market (MIBEL), resulting exclusively from the placing of production on this market from the remaining Power Purchase Agreements (CAE), from the Tejo Energia and Turbogás power plants. The revenue resulting from the purchase and sale of electrical power from the commercial agent comes from incentives defined by ERSE which have an ANNUAL REPORT 2013 25 underlying sharing of the benefits from the optimisation and management of supply from these plants with electrical power consumers. The final value of the incentives is a result of company operations, both with regard to the optimisation of sales of power from the plants and in relation to the minimisation of fuel acquisition costs and CO2 emission licenses. The difference between the contract cost within the scope of the CAE, plus the incentives to optimise its management and the efficient management of the CO2 emission licences, plus the income from the market sale of power and system services supplied by the respective power generators is reflected in the General System Use tariff. In 2013, the balance of the tariff difference account from the Purchase and Sale of Electrical Power was 28 million euros to be recovered from tariffs. 2.6.2 NATURAL GAS Natural gas business The natural gas activities listed below are subject to economic regulation by ERSE: • The high-pressure transmission of natural gas – through REN Gasodutos • General technical management of the SNGN – through REN Gasodutos • Reception, storage and regasification of LNG – through REN Atlântico • Underground storage of natural gas – through REN Armazenagem • Management of the supplier switching process – through REN Gasodutos In July 2013, a new three year regulatory period started. The main changes EFFICIENCY introduced by the regulator were: (i) indexation of the remuneration rate to TARGETS evolution in earnings on Portuguese Treasury Bonds, with a maturity of 10 years and the introduction of limit to the remuneration rate for the 2013-2016 period for the current of between 7.33% and 11%, (ii) the introduction of a mechanism to attenuate tariff adjustments at the LNG terminal with the aim of reducing the impact of regulatory these adjustments on the tariffs defined annually for that activity and (iii) the period vary extension of incentives based regulation to underground storage in a similar manner to that for the high-pressure transmission of natural gas and LNG between 1.5% reception, storage and regasification. and 3% per year Currently, the level of eligible operating costs (cap) to calculate income on activities subject to incentives based regulation has a maximum permitted value and includes a fixed part, subject to a regulatory revenue cap approach and one or more parcels subject to a price cap approach, indexed to cost variables relating to the size of the infrastructures and the intensity of use. The value approved for OPEX for the first year of the current regulation period, evolves in subsequent years in line with efficiency targets established and published by ERSE for these years and with the variation rate of the Price Index implicit in GDP. The variable for the consumption of electricity at the LNG terminal (energy component) evolves in line with the average annual variation in the price of electricity on the futures market, published by OMIP, and with the efficiency target set by ERSE. The efficiency targets for the current regulatory period vary between 1.5% and 3% per year. The GTG of the SNGN with regard to the process to change supplier is not subject to efficiency targets. This is also the case for certain expenditure which is not considered to be controllable by the company. 26 REN AT A GLANCE Regulation of activities The revenues relating to invested capital stem from the return on fixed assets in operation, net of amortizations and subsidies (RAB), at a rate set by the regulator at the start of every regulatory period, at a rate of 7.98% in 2013, plus the corresponding amortizations. Up to the end of 2013, the six monthly average RAB values for the natural gas companies had the following evolution: RAB FROM 2007 TO 2013 1 200 1 000 800 M 600 400 200 0 2007 2007 2008 2008 2009 2009 2010 2010 2011 2012 2013 1Sem 1Sem 1Sem 1Sem REN GASODUTOS REN ATLÂNTICO REN ARMAZENAGEM Tariffs are set based on estimates of quantities and the total income allowed, calculated for each activity. This income includes return on assets, recovery of the value of amortizations and established operating costs, per activity, as well as the tariff adjustments for previous years. The adjustments are recovered or returned in a transitory manner each year based on estimates. The real value of the adjustments arising from the differences are recovered or returned two years after they have occurred, based on a comparison with the provisional adjustments. This sum is remunerated at a regulated rate equal to the 12 month Euribor average seen each year, plus a spread published annually by ERSE for the year in question. 2.7 2.7.1 ELECTRICITY At the end of 2013, the RNT (National Transmission Grid) consisted of 8 733 km in TECHNICAL lines and 67 transformer substations and 13 step down, switching and transition substations. INFRASTRUCTURES The RNT also connects to the European Transmission Grid through 9 interconnection points with the Spanish Transmission Grid as well as delivering VHV directly to numerous consumers. The National Dispatch Centre in Sacavém (Loures) coordinates general operations and ensures balance in the National Electricity System. The Network Operations Centre in Vermoim (Maia) is responsible for the Monitoring and Remote Operation of all National Transmission Grid equipment.

The interconnection with the Spanish Transmission Network is provided by one 130 kV line between Minho and Galicia, three 220 kV lines at Douro International and by five 400 kV lines, two between Minho and Galicia, one at Douro International, one at Tejo International and one between the Alentejo and Estremadura. The national stretch of a new 400 kV interconnection is now concluded between the Algarve and Andalusia. 2.7.2 NATURAL GAS REN’s natural gas infrastructures include: • The National Natural Gas Transmission Network; • The Sines Natural Gas Liquefaction terminal; • The Carriço natural gas underground storage facilities (three caverns and one surface station). In 2013, the Mangualde-Celorico-Guarda gas pipeline came online, approximately 76 km in length, and provides a ring connection for Batches 5 (Monforte/Guarda) and 6 (Cantanhede/Mangualde). This will increase supply security and is a possible option for the future third interconnection of the RNTGN with Spain. Other facilities associated to this pipeline include the conclusion of construction of four new stations, Arcozelo, Soeiro do Chão, Celorico da Beira and Avelãs de Ambom. 28 REN AT A GLANCE Therefore, at the end of 2013, the RNTGN consisted of the following infrastructures: • 1 375 km of high-pressure gas pipelines • 65 junction stations for pipeline branching • 46 block valve stations • 5 T-branch interconnection stations • 84 gas pressure regulating and metering stations • 2 custody transfer stations LENGTH OF GAS PIPELINES, km 1 390 1 375 1 360 1 330 1 296 1 298 1 298 1 300 1 270 1 267 1 240 1 210 1 180 1 150 1 120 1 090 1 060 1 030 1 000 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 THE NATIONAL NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION NETWORK Ø (mm) km Batch 1 Setúbal – Leiria 700 173 Batch 2 Leiria – Gondomar 700 164 Gondomar – Braga 500 50 Batch 3 Campo Maior – Leiria 700 220 Batch 4 Braga – Valença 500 74 Batch 5 Monforte – Guarda 300 184 Batch 6 Mealhada – Viseu 500 68 Batch 7 Sines – Setúbal 800 87 Batch 8 Mangualde-Celorico-Guarda 700/300 76 High-pressure 150-700 278 lines Total 1 375 ANNUAL REPORT 2013 29 At 31 December 2013, the available capacity for commercial purposes of relevant points of the RNTGN was as follows: AVAILABLE CAPACITY FOR COMMERCIAL GWh Mm3(n) PURPOSES OF RELEVANT POINTS per day per day Input Sines 193 16.2 Carriço (Withdrawal US) 85 7.1 Campo Maior (IP39) 134 11.3 Valença do Minho (IP40) 40 3.4 Output Sines 143 12.0 Carriço (Injection US) 24 2.0 Campo Maior (IP39) 70 5.9 Valença do Minho (IP40) 25 2.1 Outputs per GRMS (total) 707 59.4 Supervised from a state-of-the-art National Dispatch Centre, using redundant fibre-optic technology telecommunication systems, the RNTGN connects the gas pipeline stations with the Sines LNG Terminal and the Carrico underground storage facility in Pombal. All systems are equipped with digital communication, especially with regard to the reading of network input and output flows. This allows for the best practices to be adopted both in relation to information quality and supervision response. In 2013, the LNG terminal was only subject to small-scale investment projects. As such, the terminal maintains its main operating capacities: • Annual natural gas regasification capacity of 8 bcm • Storage capacity of 390 000 m3 •M ooring adapted for methane tankers with capacities ranging from 40 000 to 216 000 m3 • Maximum supply, for RNTGN, of 1 350 000 m3(n)/h • Tanker truck filling capacity of 4 500 loads/year Gas is stored at great depth in underground salt caverns which connect to a gas station allowing the management of gas stored by injection through natural gas compressors and withdrawal through natural gas dehydration systems for subsequent injection into the transmission network. The REN gas station also interconnects with another concession holder’s caverns. REN constructs salt caverns using a leaching station, water collection equipment and a system which rejects brine into the sea. At the end of 2013, the natural gas underground storage facilities of the REN Armazenagem concession were as follows: • three operational caverns • maximum capacity: 1.64 TWh <> 138 Mm3(n) •n ominal capacities of the surface station: injection: 84 000 m3(n)/h (24 GWh/day) withdrawal: 300 000 m3(n)/h (86 GWh/day) • REN Armazenagem is responsible for operating the surface station 30 MANAGEMENT REPORT A PLAN FOR SUCCESS The results obtained this year prove that REN has continued to grow and invest in Portugal. The success of our strategic plan now motivates us to look abroad and seek new sources to create value outside Portugal, leveraged by our extensive experience and technical skill.

The forecast for growth in economic activity was +2.8% (vs. +3.1% in 2012 and +3.9% in 2011). This slowdown has affected both advanced economies (+1.1% in 2013 vs. + 1.4%. in 2012) as well as emerging and developing economies. (+4.5% in 2013 vs. + 4.9% in 2012). Focusing the analysis on advanced economies, it is worth mentioning the improvements seen in the European Union (zero growth in 2013), following a contraction in the economy in 2012 (-0.4%). A major contributing factor to this performance was the stabilisation of the Euro zone, that emerged from the longest recession in its history, and the strong performance of other EU member states (such as the United Kingdom, with growth of +1.3% in 2013 against that of +0.1% in 2012. Japan is expected to report similar growth to that of 2012 (+2.1% in 2013 vs. +2.0% in 2012), whilst political uncertainty in the United States and the implementation of fiscal consolidation measures are expected to contribute to a reduction in the growth of GDP from +2.8% in 2012 to +1.6% in 2013. Emerging economies also continue to slow down, as a result of the structural challenges affecting many of the main economies in this group, such as the current transition in China from an investment based economic model to a consumer based model, or Russia’s dependency on raw materials. Looking at the main regions, in 2013, growth of +7.5% is expected in China, +5.0% in Sub-Saharan Africa and +2.9% in India. Latin America (+2.6%) and Russia (+1.9%) are expecting to see growth below the world average. Euro zone2 Following a contraction of GDP by -0.7% in 2012, the Euro zone is expected to EURO ZONE GDP contract by only -0.4% during 2013. Major factors in this improvement are the -0.4 % reduced uncertainty surrounding the future of the Euro zone, and the reduction in budgetary consolidation across the various members of the single currency. As a result, the fall in private consumption was reduced by half (-0.7% in 2013 vs. -1.4% in 2012), public spending stabilised in 2013 (following a reduction of 0.5% in 2012) and net exports continued to make a positive contribution towards growth (positive contribution of 0.6% in 2013). On the down side, it is worth mentioning a further increase in the level of unemployment (from 11.4% in 2012 to 12.2% in 2013). 1 European Commission: European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013 2 European Commission: European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013 – Euro Zone 34 MANAGEMENT REPORT Interest rates3 4 During 2013, the ECB cut its reference rate twice from 0.75% to 0.25%, while the United States Federal Reserve kept the Fed Funds Target Rate between 0% and 0.25%. Moreover, the drop in the reference rate and the uncertainty about the future of the single currency kept Euribor rates at reduced levels. Therefore, at 31 December 2013, Euribor rates for 3, 6 and 12 months stood at 0.287% (compared to 0.187% at the end of 2012), 0.389% (vs. 0.320%) and 0.556% (vs. 0.542%). Portuguese economy5 6 2013 was marked by a recovery in the growth of the GDP in equivalent terms EXPORTS and by the end of the recession in the third trimester. As a result of increased activity throughout 2013, a -1.5% contraction in the GDP is expected at year end +5.9 % (-3.2% in 2012). This development came as a result of reduced cuts in private consumption (-2.0% in 2013, vs. -5.4% in 2012), public spending (-1.5% in 2013, vs. -4.8% in 2012) and investment (-8.4% in 2013, vs. -14.3% in 2012). The strong performance of exports is of note (+5.9%), and is greater than the increase in imports (+2.7%). Taking a closer look at the contributing factors to the variation of the GDP in 2013, domestic demand is expected to drop by -2.7% and net IMPORTS exports are expected to rise by +1.1%, representing, as in 2012, the only positive +2.7 % contribution to the Portuguese economy. Finally, it is worth noting that although the public deficit targets are expected to be met, public debt continues to increase, and is forecast to reach 127.8% of GDP in 2013 (as against 124.1% in 2012). 3 Reference rates: ECB and FED (www.ecb.int; www.federalreserve.gov) 4 Bank of Portugal: Euribor rates 5 Bank of Portugal: Economic Bulletin Winter 2013 6 European Commission: European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2013 – Portugal Very High Voltage Support Assembly Operation ANNUAL REPORT 2013 35 3.1.2 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT European energy Policy During 2013, the European Union set out various actions with a view to the completion of the EU internal energy market by 2014 and to the development of interconnections in order to put an end to any isolation of member states from the European gas and electricity networks by 2015. In some cases, state intervention in the energy markets may be necessary so as to guarantee supply and to achieve climate objectives. In order to avoid additional costs for the consumer and distortion of the internal electricity market, public intervention needs to be carefully established. To this end the European Union published a guidance document for the member states regarding renewable energy support mechanisms and capacity guarantee Delivering the internal electricity market and making the most of public intervention. In March, the European Commission took a first step towards the establishment of ’A 2030 framework for climate and energy policies’, with the adoption of a Green Paper that promotes public consultation on the content of the strategic framework. What are the type, nature and level of targets to establish for 2030? How to ensure the cohesion between different policy instruments? How can the EU best improve security of energy supply internally by ensuring the full and effective functioning of the internal energy market (e.g. through the development of necessary interconnections) and externally by diversifying energy supply routes? How should the framework ensure an equitable distribution of effort amongst the member states? These are some of the questions raised in the consultation, envisaging that the strategic framework is approved in 2014. In the field of energy infrastructure, Regulation 347/2013 was published, establishing guidelines on the timely development and interoperability of the priority corridors and areas of the trans-European energy infrastructure In October, the European Commission published a list of almost 250 energy infrastructure projects, ‘projects of common interest’ (PIC), that will benefit from accelerated licensing procedures and improved regulatory and may have access to financial support from the Connecting Europe Facility. The list includes close to 140 projects in the field of electricity transmission and storage, almost 100 in the field of gas and LNG transmission and storage and the remainder relating to oil and smartgrids. With the adoption of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) in 2012, there is now an EU wide legislative framework that shall be promoted and implemented by the member states. The Council considers that initiatives in the area of energy efficiency can contribute significantly towards the reversal of the current rises in energy price and costs, and as such, the implementation of the Directive is of vital importance. Domestic Energy Policy In Portugal, during 2013, the XIX Constitutional Government proceeded with the implementation of an ‘energy model based on economic rationality and sustainability, by combining measures to promote energy efficiency and the use of energy from indigenous renewable sources as well as reducing extra costs which increase energy prices’. Council of Ministers Resolution No 20/2013 approves the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency for the period 2013-2016 (Energy Efficiency Strategy – NEEAP 2016) and the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy for the period 20132020 (Renewable Energy Strategy – NREAP 2020). 36 MANAGEMENT REPORT On a regulatory level, it is worth noting the establishment of a mechanism aimed at ensuring a competitive balance in the wholesale electricity market in Portugal, with a focus on the general economic interest costs (GEIC) component of the General System Use tariff (Decree Law No. 74/2013). Implementing Order (Portaria) 288/2013 establishes the process for conducting a study on the impact of non-market actions or events taking place in the European Union and their redistributive effect on the various factors influencing electrical energy tariffs, and the mechanism for proper distribution of the general economic interest costs borne by the energy providers under the ordinary production scheme and other energy producers which operate outside the framework of guaranteed payment. The amendment to DL 240/2004 (DL 32/2013) sets out the possibility of a reduction in the compensatory payments made to electricity producers through the advanced termination of the PPAs, thereby making possible a reduction, as proposed by the producer, of the financial burden, resulting in benefits for electrical energy consumers due to a reduction in the costs that make up their energy bill. During 2013, the Government carried out amendments to the remuneration regime applied to renewable plants (installations licensed under Decree-Law No 189/88 of 27 May 1988, and 312/2001 of 10 December 2001), envisaging the possibility of adhesion to an alternative remuneration scheme. Liberalized market in Portugal Electricity During 2013, approximately 1 200 000 customers switched to the free market system for electricity, totalling in December, more than 2 269 000. Average annual consumption by those clients supplied under the free market system on the final day of December 2013 was in excess of 32 GWh (compared to almost 27 GWh in December 2012). In overall terms, consumption on the free market reached, in December, more than 72% of total consumption in the country, representing an increase of over 12%compared to the equivalent period in 2012. Almost all consumption by heavy users is through the free market. In spite of experiencing a significant increase during 2013, only around 40% of overall domestic consumption is through the free market. Natural gas Since the end of 2012, consumers have been switching to the free market at a faster rate. By the end of November 2013 the total number of clients currently on the free market was in excess of 502 000. In overall terms, the free market represents almost 94% of the total consumption of natural gas. In the case of heavy users, 100% of consumption is supplied on the free market, along with around 94% in the case of industrial users. 3.1.3 SECTORAL ENVIRONMENT Overall, the energy year of 2013 was marked by changes to the global energy map. Intensification of production of non-conventional oil and gas, the progressive abandonment of nuclear energy and the increased adoption of renewable energies have come to change our view on the distribution of the world’s energy resources. The major importing nations are now becoming exporters, whilst nations that for many years have been seen as exporters are now taking on an important role in the demand for energy. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 37 The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its New Policies Scenario states that despite recent developments and new policies, this will only have a marginal impact on long-term trends for energy and climate. According to IEA forecasts – New Policies Scenario – world energy demand is expected to grow by more than 30% up to 2035. In the long-term, the evolution in energy related CO2 emissions points to an increase of 3.6°C in the average temperature (above the target limit of 2°C for average global temperature increase). The IEA estimates that emerging economies will account for 90% of the increase in the demand for energy by 2035. China will lead the way in the demand for energy during the current decade, until India assumes the mantle around from 2020. In short, China will be the main oil importer and, in 2020, India will be the main coal importer. The Middle East will emerge as an area of increased consumption. In 2020, it will be the second biggest consumer of gas and, in 2030, the third biggest consumer of oil. In OECD countries, the increase in the demand for energy will be largely insignificant. Over the next ten years the role of the OPEC countries as the major source of oil will be temporarily reduced due to increased production in the United States, Canada and Brazil. However, around the middle of the 2020s, oil production in non OPEC nations will begin to decrease and the Middle East nations will reassume the predominant role on a global scale. As far as the energy sources in use, and despite the rapid growth in renewables, the dominance of fossil fuels will continue, tending towards a reduction in weighting in the global mix from the current 82% to 76% by 2035. The flexibility and environmental advantages of natural gas, compared to other fossil fuels, will be seen as the main reasons behind its increased long term use. The demand for natural gas will increase by almost 50% by 2035, as a result of the increased growth of emerging economies. New sources of gas, both conventional and non-conventional, will contribute to a greater diversification in the global supply of gas. WORLD DEMAND World demand for electricity will continue to grow, with an increase of two thirds expected by 2035. World demand for electricity will continue to grow, FOR ELECTRICITY and an increase of over two-thirds is expected by 2035. The IEA expects that renewable energies will supply almost half the expected increase by 2035, with will continue variable energy sources – wind, solar and photovoltaic – accounting for 45% of to grow, with this increase. Coal will be the major fossil fuel, with a significant increase in OECD nations. Natural gas will represent the greatest increase in absolute terms, seeing an increase an increase in all regions. Overall, the percentage of renewable energy sources of two-thirds in the production of electricity is expected to exceed 30% in 2035, ahead of the share of natural gas but still below that of coal Nuclear energy, in spite of a expected by 2035 reduction in the construction of new plants due to regulatory restrictions, will still account for 12% of overall global production (due to expansion in countries such as China, Korea, India and Russia). In this period, the IEA estimates that the electricity sector will require global investment of approximately 17 billion dollars, with more than 40% of this investment dedicated to transmission and distribution networks. In spite of the introduction of new policies in the field of energy efficiency in various regions, we are still a long way from achieving our goal. In the IEA’s New Policies Scenario, two thirds of the economic potential to improve energy efficiency remains untapped, pointing to a need for measures to eliminate the barriers to investment in this field. 38 MANAGEMENT REPORT CONSUMPTION Demand and production of electricity ELECTRICITY In 2013, electricity consumption supplied by the public network totalled 49.2 TWh ELECTRIC ENERGY PROVIDED 49.2 TWh, an increase of 0.2% on the previous year.

This segment of the market corresponds to just 7% of overall gas consumption, the lowest figure seen since 1998. The usage of available capacity by these plants dropped to 4%, due to a lack of competitiveness compared to coal and the exceptional conditions seen in the production of both hydro and wind power.

ENERGY The figures recorded by three (ENF, TIE and SARI) of the five general indicators NOT SUPPLIED 8.6 MWh for service continuity established in the Quality of Service Regulations, were the second best ever, thereby placing REN on a level with the world’s best companies in a similar field. The remaining two indicators (SAIFI and SAIDI) recorded the third best figures ever. The Equivalent Interruption Time (EIT), an indicator of overall performance commonly used by electrical utility firms, was 5.4 seconds, the second best figure ever, equivalent to energy not supplied of 8.6MWh. That is to say, REN fed electrical energy to the various consumer delivery points 99.99998% of the time (almost 999 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds, for every 1 000 hours). 42 MANAGEMENT REPORT EVOLUTION OF EQUIVALENT INTERRUPTION TIME EIT Minutes 1.8 1.18 1.6 1.4 1.2 0.67 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.07 0.2 0.42 0.48 0.09 0.27 0 0.0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 (1) INTERRUPTIONS CAUSED BY (2) INTERRUPTIONS ALL EXCEPT (1) AND (2) FORTUITOUS CAUSES, FORCE CAUSED BY INCIDENTS OF MAJEURE OR SECURITY REASONS AN EXCEPTIONAL NATURE In 2013, the monitoring of voltage waveform quality continued at delivery points and interconnecting points on the RNT. The measurements carried out continued to show results that, with a reduced number of exceptions in individual and localised cases, reflect the figures recommended in the Quality of Service Regulations. The overall level of electrical energy quality depends on the number of incidents recorded or with impact on the transmission grid. In 2013, the number of incidents and disturbances was 249 (35% more than in 2012), 208 of which originated in the Very High Voltage Network (VHV), 20 in the High Voltage Network (HV) and 21 in other grids but with an impact on the REN networks VHV and HV. This increase was reflected above all in the incidents that occurred on 19th January, numbering 33 in total, due to the storms and strong winds affecting the Greater Lisbon area. Only eight incidents (3.2% of the total) actually caused interruptions to the supply of electricity to clients, having caused eight interruptions of consumption at delivery points.

This indicator is a ratio of the number of supply interruptions to the number of incidents. In 2013, the transmission network registered on average 0.0120 long interruptions (> 3 min) and 0.0201 short interruptions (between 1 sec and 3 min) per incident.

In this field, it is particularly worth noting the outages that occurred on the corridor between Recarei and Riba d’Ave that, aside from topological measures, also required the mobilisation of generation at the Tapada do Outeiro plant and reduction of hydropowered generation located in the Cávado basin. In 2013, the national consumption of electricity remained at identical levels to IN 2013 THE those seen in 2012, leading to a continued excess of energy in the RNT, and consequent difficulty in controlling voltage. The aforementioned difficulty NATIONAL was overcome by implementing measures such as turning the Sines plant into CONSUMPTION the technical verification headquarters for the day market, limiting output on subsequent intraday markets, the disconnecting of MHV lines or requesting that of electricity the operator of the National Distribution Grid disconnect their capacitor banks. remained at Finally, also of note in 2013 was the fact that new maximums for wind energy production were once again recorded, both with regard to energy and peak identical levels production. Once again the national electricity system managed to store all this production without having to introduce reductions. to those seen during 2012 Availability The Combined Availability Rate, a regulatory indicator introduced by ERSE in 2009, reached a new historic record in 2013, with a value of 98.89%.

On this day, 41 faults were registered on lines, including the collapse of four pylons in the Lisbon region. The number of faults per 100km of circuit thereby saw an increase of 33% compared to the previous year. Without the faults that occurred on that day, the figure would be close to that seen in 2012 (+4.8%). The graph below illustrates the performance of lines in the last 5 years, with regard to the number of faults per 100 km of circuit.

In general, all substations recorded favourable behaviour in their service performance. In spite of this, there was a slight increase in the number of damaged transformers and circuit breakers compared with the 2012 figures, although, in the majority of cases, there were no consequences to network operation. The overall availability rate of transformers and autotransformers (including the respective panels) stood at 98.48%, a similar figure to that seen in 2011 (+0.03%). This indicator is mainly affected by remodelling and replacement work on HV equipment and transformers during 2013. More in-depth technical detail is available in the Quality of Service report published annually by REN. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 45 3.2.2 INVESTMENT IN THE RNT Projects concluded in 2013 In 2013, the projects concluded in the National Electricity Transmission Network (RNT) contributed toward improved reception capacity, particularly from renewable sources, toward improved international exchange capacities with Spain and to better power feeding conditions to distribution networks, and towards the safety and reliability of the overall system operation. In the Trás-os-Montes region, to reinforce supply to consumers and improve power feeding conditions to the network in that area, a new connection came into operation between the Valpaços and Vila Pouca de Aguiar substations, completing the 220 kV circuit of the mountainous axis between Lagoaça and Valdigem. On the route of the Douro and in the Porto area, of note are the 400kV connections between Armamar-Recarei and Recarei-Vermoim, along with the introduction of a 400kV level at Vermoim substation, reinforcing the safety and reliability of supply to consumers in the Greater Porto region and improving interconnection capacity. Also in the Porto area, the refurbishment to 220kV of the Maia steel plant was concluded and came into operation, along with the connection that feeds it. In the southern coastal region of Greater Porto a new 400/60kV substation came online at Feira, supplying consumers in the municipalities of São João da Madeira, Feira and Arouca. In Beira Interior a second 150kV connection came into service between the Falagueira and Castelo Branco substations, offering this interior region the possibility to improve the supply of renewable energies and the overall safety of the network operation. In the Lisbon area, in order to reinforce supply to consumers, it is worth noting the construction of a new 220kV underground circuit between the Alto de Mira and Sete Rios substations. Also with the aim of reinforcing supply to consumers, the introduction of a 400kV level at the Fernão Ferro substation was concluded. Seven new transformers started operation, with a total power increase of 1 069 MVA (of which 320MVA is at the Maia steel plant substation). Main investments underway Reinforcement of the interconnection capacity between Portugal and Spain • In order to reinforce the exchange capacities between Portugal and Spain, a new 400 kV interconnection is planned in the Minho region, connecting the future Viana do Castelo installation on the Portuguese side with Fontefria on the Spanish side Connection of special status producers to the RNT (except for large scale hydropower) • Transformation improvements in various substations Connection of large-scale producers to the RNT • Entry into service of a new 400kV switching station in Vieira do Minho and the implementation of two connections, also at 400kV, between this point and the Pedralva substation, to connect the power upgrades from the Venda Nova (Venda Nova III) and Salamonde (Salamonde II) hydroelectric plants • Construction of a new 400kV axis between the Porto region and the area of Viana do Castelo, running east to the Pedralva substation. This axis, as well as proving important in ensuring the running of the large amounts of new hydropower plants in the Cávado/Alto Minho, will also form an integral part of the new interconnection with Spain in that region, thereby facilitating 46 MANAGEMENT REPORT international exchanges. At the same time, the new RNT substation at Vila Nova de Famalicão which forms part of this axis, will leverage improved safety in the power supply to those consumers in the coastal Minho region • In the Central region, in order to connect the new hydroelectric plant at Girabolhos, the construction of a new 400kV line is planned between the Penela substation and the Seia area Feeding to the distribution networks to improve the supply of large load centres • In Minho, opening of a 150/60 kV substation in the Fafe area, which also supplies the neighbouring counties of Guimarães, Vizela and Felgueiras • In Lisbon, the opening of the 220/60 kV Alto de S. João substation, fed by two underground circuits, from Sacavém and Fanhões (Prior Velho) • In the Setúbal Peninsula, the completion of the second 150 kV overhead line between the substations of Fernão Ferro and Trafaria • In the Alentejo, construction of a new 400 kV line between Estremoz and Divor 3.2.3 SPECIAL STATUS PRODUCTION REN activity in the coordination of connection and integration processes relating to projects for Special Status Production (PRE) in the Public Service Power Grids (RESP), particularly those which connect to the RNT, so as to ensure the effective and safe integration of renewable energy sources into the National Electric System (SEN), has focused on several different areas: • the planning of reception capacity for new production, the necessary network upgrading and the technical connection requirements; • the development of projects, the planning of work, the execution of work under the responsibility of REN and the monitoring of work under the responsibility of promoters; • participation and monitoring of inspections and the execution of connections to the network; the definition of protection and communication systems and command and control systems; • the definition of metering systems and border systems with the markets and the operational control of the execution of this operation through the dispatch control centres; • the forecasting of energy volumes produced and the resolution of management problems in the production of power required to satisfy consumption. Mértola WIND FARM 60 kV connection at the REN Tavira substation on 5 November 2013 ANNUAL REPORT 2013 47 At the end of 2013, installed PRE power (not including large-scale hydropower) connected to the RESP totalled around 6 800 MW. Within this figure, highlight goes to the increase over the previous year of 114 MW of wind power from farms connected to the RNT. This has been essentially due to the connection of new wind farms and the expansion and remodelling of farms already in operation. It is also worth emphasising that Decree–Law No 215 – A/2012 of 8 October 2012 revised the concept of special status production, defining it as follows: (in accordance with Article18(1)): ’Special status production is considered to be the activity of production licensed under special legislative schemes, such as the production of electricity through cogeneration or endogenous resources, renewable or non-renewable, microproduction, miniproduction and production that does not feed power into the grid, as well as the production of electricity through endogenous resources, renewable or non-renewable, that is not subject to a special legislative scheme.’ WIND FARM Baixo Alentejo. Mértola 48 MANAGEMENT REPORT 3.3 3.3.1 OPERATION OF RNTIAT NATURAL GAS Quality of service The performance of REN natural gas infrastructures in terms of continuity of service was once again excellent in 2012. No supply interruptions occurred and all the natural gas indicators were within the limits set out in the Quality of Service Regulations (QSR). The accumulated indicator for the frequency of incident occurrence per year per 1 000 km of high-pressure transmission infrastructure currently stands at 0.052, based on the total exposure time of the infrastructure. Considering only the last 5 years it is 0.154. The value of the same indicator published by the European Gas Pipeline Incident Data Group (EGIG) for all TSOs participating in the scheme is 0.162 for the last 5 years. In relation to the indicators defined in art. 13 for quality of service in the Natural Gas Sector, REN Armazenagem and REN Atlântico registered the following annual figures: GENERAL QUALITY OF SERVICE INDICATORS FOR REN ARMAZENAGEM Compliance with nominations for natural gas withdrawal 100.0% Compliance with nominations for natural gas injection 99.7% Compliance with energy storage 100.0% Notes: -C  ompliance with nominations for natural gas withdrawal: the ratio between the number of nominations complied with and the total number of nominations -C  ompliance with nominations for natural gas injection: the ratio between the number of nominations complied with and the total number of nominations -C  ompliance with energy storage: determined based on the mean square error between nominated and real energy values resulting from the total requests by the users of both injection and withdrawal of gas ANNUAL REPORT 2013 49 General quality of service indicators for Ren Atlântico Total unavailability was 23 hours, of which 11 were planned, corresponding to facility availability of 99.76%. Internally, 62 301 hours of work were carried out and one non-fatal accident took place. In terms of subcontracted workers, 33 304 hours of work were carried out, also with one non-fatal accident taking place. GENERAL QUALITY OF SERVICE INDICATORS FOR REN ATLÂNTICO Compliance with commercial service (nominations) 100.0% Injection of natural gas into the network (injected/ requested) 99.54% Availability of facility 99.76% System operation In 2013, the intake of natural gas into the infrastructure operated by the RNTGN concession holder was predominantly through Campo Maior (55.8%), which connects with the Maghreb gas pipeline and supplies Portugal with gas mainly from Algeria. The intake from the regasification of liquefied natural gas at the REN Atlântico Sines Terminal stood at 40.0%. Inputs into the grid via underground storage and Valença were equivalent to 3.5% and 0.7% respectively of the total intake to the national system. The following graph shows the weighting of entries to the system: 3.5% 0.7% 40.0% 55.8% SINES AS VALENÇA CAMPO MAIOR 50 MANAGEMENT REPORT With regard to the usage of maximum system capacities, in 2013 the maximum entry figure through Campo Maior was 110.4 GWh and 150.2 GWh through Sines. These recorded highs are equivalent to the use of 82.4% of the maximum capacity in Campo Maior and 78% in Sines. With regard to the interface with underground storage, the maximum extraction reached 85.1GWh whilst the maximum injection reached 23.5GWh, equivalent to almost 100% usage of the maximum infrastructure capacity. During 2013, plans were laid out for the commissioning and entry into operation of a new cavern alongside the underground storage caverns currently in operation, thereby guaranteeing sufficient availability for both the gas station and the operating conditions of RNTIAT. With regard to the supervision of the system carried out from the dispatch centre, December 2013 saw the conclusion of the upgrade of REN Gasodutos supervisory, control and data acquisition system, leading to the involvement of various technical teams and the coordination of activities to ensure availability of supervision and to control the NG transmission system. The aim of this project, covering all the stations, is to ensure the timely availability of SCADA data to those downstream interfaces that depend on it, thereby ensuring the proper functioning of their technological processes. The transition to the new SCADA system (VS ICS) took place gradually (station by station), ensuring users could still have access to all the previous functionalities in a more user friendly and intuitive environment, as well as providing access to new technological functionalities with the aim of facilitating access to information and subsequent decision making. The new regulations relating to the European grid laid down by Regulation EC 715/2009, changing the framework for internal NG transmission systems, impacted above all on capacity allocation Having therefore introduced the concept of auctions, it was necessary to adapt the internal rules that have been in effect until this point in Portugal, to ensure progressive and as quick adaptation to this new scenario. In this sense, the operating system was directly involved in the establishment of regulations and products included in the publication by ERSE in August 2013 of the Procedures for Access to Infrastructures Manual (MPAI), as well as in the review of the main operation procedures manual (MPGTG). Alongside the establishment of these regulations it was necessary to put them into operation via the implementation of the relevant access platform with the support of the operating system. Remaining on the subject of new regulations relating to the management of access to the infrastructure, and with reference to the adoption of new concepts across the Portuguese gas system, of note is the operational slots that can be reserved by market agents for the loading and unloading of LNG via the carrier vessels at the Sines terminal, which is linked to the other new development surrounding operational storage capacity relative to the capacity dedicated exclusively to the undertaking of these operations. Operation of the Sines LNG terminal With regard to operations, the LNG Terminal received a total of 41 ships in 2013 (32 unloading operations, three cooling operations and six loading operations), corresponding to total unloaded energy of 26.16 TWh and regasification of 19.52 TWh to the network. In the same period, 3 138 tanker trucks were loaded, all from the domestic market, corresponding to total energy of 956 GWh. The company conducted six audits, all with positive results, two of which were under the SEVESO directive, two relating to the verification of the integrated quality, environment, health and safety management system, one internal audit relating to the ISPS Code and one within the scope of the APS concession. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 51 A safety drill was conducted with the participation of external entities, which tested the response capacity of REN Atlântico and other bodies involved in the protection of the facility (ISPS) and Safety (PEI-SEVESO). Operation of REN Armazenagem In 2013, a total of 1 351 GWh of natural gas was withdrawn and 290 GWh was injected into REN Armazenagem caverns, with a global self consumption of around 4 GWh. With regard to the operation of the gas station, total processed natural gas was 3 671 GWh, broken down into 1 719 GWh of withdrawals and 1 952 GWh of injection, corresponding 1 587 GWh to the first filling of the cavity TGC-2 of Transgás-Armazenagem. Overall self consumption by the gas station in 2013 corresponded to 18 GWh. At the end of the year, compared with 2012, the following balance of stocks was observed: NATURAL GAS STOCKS AT REN ARMAZENAGEM (GWh)* AT 31 DECEMBER AT 31 DECEMBER VARIATION 12/13 2012 2013 (ENERGY) 1 509 443 71% * The figures indicated do not include cushion gas LNG STORAGE Terminal 52 MANAGEMENT REPORT AVERAGE DAILY LEVEL OF NATURAL GAS STOCKS AT REN ARMAZENAGEM (GWh)* 2012 2013 VARIATION 12/13 (ENERGY) 1 429 1 218 % * The figures indicated do not include cushion gas The quantities stored at the end of 2013 represent a reduction of 71% compared to figures for the previous year, justified by the movements of gas taking place in November and December.

This plan, which includes development and expansion projects, internal reinforcement and revamping investment and connection to the RNDGN and customers, represented an investment in 2013 in natural gas infrastructures of 36.8 million euros, with the respective asset value under operation totalling 42.5 million euros. REN Gasodutos As part of the expansion of the RNTGN, REN Gasodutos put the MangualdeCelorico-Guarda gas pipeline into operation, running for almost 76km and closing the loop between lots 5 (Monforte/Guarda) and 6 (Cantanhede/Mangualde), thereby increasing the safety of supply and making possible a future third interconnection of the RNTGN with Spain. Along with the pipeline, four new stations also came into operation at Arcozelo, Soeiro do Chão, Celorico da Beira e Avelãs de Ambom. This project was eligible under the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) criteria.

The new system will officially come into operation on 16th December 2013. The evolution of the new SCADA system will safeguard the continuation of supervision, control and data acquisition, supported by modern, user friendly technology, and making the evolution of both NG transmission procedures and related technologies (technological compatibility) a possibility. 54 MANAGEMENT REPORT REN Armazenagem In 2013, REN Armazenagem developed a set of investments with a view to ensuring security of supply and the availability of natural gas storage capacity level. This included: • Continuation of construction of cavity RENC-6, which underwent leaching operations throughout 2013. An accumulated volume of approximately 467 000 m3 was reached. The estimated volume will be around 530 000 m3, in 2014, upon completion of the work • As a result of the environmental impact study and the base engineering project for cavity RENC-8, that gave rise to the licensing process submitted to the DGED in June 2012, the Environment Impact Statement (DIA) was issued in March 2013 • The installation of variable speed drives in the electric motors belonging to the high voltage pump system at the leaching plant, in line with the recommendations made by the energy audit carried out under Decree-Law 71/2008 Management System of Intensive Energy Consumption (SGCIE), with the aim of reducing specific energy consumption, and which the company has adopted in its energy efficiency plans • In line with the actions recommended under the certification of the safety management system for the prevention of serious accidents, the fire suppression system (RIA) was upgraded at the gas station thanks to the installation of water cannon. Improvement of the gas station’s command and control and emergency systems for integration with the TCG-2 cavern operated by Transgas Armenezagem REN Atlântico In 2013, only minor investment projects were carried out. 3.4 3.4.1 REN TRADING MANAGEMENT OF POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (PPA) OTHER BUSINESSES Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) not subject to early termination in conformance with Decree-Law No 172/2006 of 23 August 2006, are managed during the period they are in effect by REN Trading, a 100% subsidiary of REN Redes Energéticas Nacionais, SGPS. In this context, REN Trading manages the PPA with Tejo Energia through the thermal power plant in Pego (576 MW), and the PPA with Turbogás, for the thermal power plant at Tapada do Outeiro (990 MW). The company’s objective is to maximise profits by means of the market sale of energy and system services, as well as to minimise the costs of PPAs, pursuant to Official Order No 11210/2008, amended by Directive No 7/2011 of 22 December 2011 and by Directive No 1/2013 of 2 January 2013, of the ERSE. Within the scope of managing the respective PPAs, REN Trading acquires all the energy and systems services from the Pego and Turbogás plants. In this field, in addition to the Natural Gas Consumption Management Agreement (AGC) established with GALP Gás Natural, S.A., it is also necessary to accompany the markets in fuels (coal and natural gas) and their respective indexes. During 2013, negotiations continued with Galp with the aim of reducing the quantity of gas consumed at the Turbogás power plant this year, so as to adapt the plant’s production to real market needs, with the resulting benefits of a reduction in costs to be borne by the consumer. With regard to operating in the European market for emissions licences (ETS Emissions Trading Scheme), there was a greater participation than in previous years on the ICE (Intercontinental Exchange), the leading futures exchange. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 55 THE SALE OF REN Trading is responsible for managing the CO2 emissions licences attributed to its two plants, although, with the start of Phase 3 (2013-2020), there are no ELECTRICAL longer free licences allocated to electrical plants. A management strategy was put in place for these environmental requirements, involving the purchase of ENERGY emission licences, namely EUA (European Unit Allowances), on a secondary futures market of the ICE. 2013 continued to see a drop in the carbon market, on the market due to various factors. mainly takes The sale of electric energy in the market is mainly carried out by means of the place on the Iberian Electricity Market (placing daily and intraday sales and repurchase offers on the OMIE) and the System Services market, operated by the System Manager. Iberian energy The company continued to actively participate in the Portuguese System Services market, with good overall results. market. In order to improve the results achieved by means of sales, and so as to diversify risk, REN Trading participated in diverse CESUR auctions held during 2013, only finalising one contract in the first trimester and with a positive outcome overall. Through its area of Financial Products, REN Trading accompanies the most relevant market trends in the sector, with an emphasis on energy and CO2 emission licences. Future options were traded on centrally issued CO2 licences along with term hedges (on the derivatives market) and some purely financial operations that were negotiated with regard to providing services to REN SGPS. As it is a regulated company, in its Official Order No 11210/2008 of 8 April 2008, amended by Directive No 7/2011 of 22 December 2011, and by Directive No 1/2013 of 2 January 2013, the Energy Services Regulatory Authority (ERSE) established a set of incentives defining methods of sharing the benefits of regulated activities between electricity consumers and the company. The final value of the incentives is derived from operations in the company’s diverse areas of activity, related with optimising the sales of energy from the power plants as well as minimising the costs of acquiring natural gas and CO2 emissions licences. Thus, the company’s operating results in 2013 correspond to the value calculated for the incentives set by ERSE, which are identified below (the ICO2, an incentive for the efficient management of CO2 emission licences was eliminated this year, along with swaps, as there is no longer an annual allocation of EUAs to be exchanged): • I1 – Incentive related to the efficient supply of energy from the Turbogás Power Plant in the daily market (limited to 1.5 million euros, fully achieved in 2013) • I3 – Incentive related to optimising the production of the Tejo Energia Power Plant (limited to 1.5 million euros, fully achieved in 2013) Thus, the total incentives obtained in 2013 amounted to 3.0 million euros, a figure lower than that of the previous year (due to the elimination of incentives relating to CO2 emissions licences). 3.4.2 REN TELECOM The REN Group is present in the Information and Communication Technologies market through REN TELECOM, a company 100% owned by the Group and certified by APCER in accordance with the NP EN ISO 9001, NP EN ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards. REN TELECOM was incorporated in 2002 with the primary goal of deriving profits from the surplus capacity of the REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional secure telecommunications network and it subsequently expanded the scope of its activity to the REN Gasodutos infrastructure when this company was integrated into the REN Group in 2006. 56 MANAGEMENT REPORT REN TELECOM is engaged in various activities, including infrastructure (rental of fibre optics and communication towers), data transmission, data centres, maintenance, projects and consulting. In 2013 a REN TELECOM consolidated its presence in the information technology Marketplace, ensuring a systematic approach towards the national and international markets both in terms of companies (70%) and operators (30%). In 2013, REN TELECOM continued to develop its international business activities and is involved in diverse opportunities relating to Iberian infrastructure and telecom networks in Africa. 3.4.3 ENONDAS Brief business description ENONDAS is a company dedicated to public service, holding a concession granted by the Portuguese Government, which aims to support the development of energy production from ocean waves, managing a maritime area of around 320 km2 and providing it with the necessary infrastructure for the development of marine energy. Enondas activities During the last year, Enondas continued with some of the projects it had begun whilst carrying out its development plan. On the other hand, the results of the project to prepare a geophysical profile of the Pilot Area, which reached its conclusion in 2012, were promoted and marketed to some of Enondas potential customers, namely in national and international forums. Following the approval of Enondas Budget in 2012 by ERSE, they are now awaiting the moment in which the government puts amendments 5/2008 and 238/2008 into place, at which point the legal framework will be duly consolidated and all conditions met in order to proceed with the construction phase of the infrastructure. Aside from these pending legal procedures, Endondas has already initiated some vital projects to ensure the expected success of the Pilot Area; regulating access to the Pilot Area and its environmental profile study. As referred to above, the most important activity carried out in 2013 was commercial, via promotion, marketing and appearances at conferences, workshops and seminars, most notably the participation at the Fórum Empresarial para a Economia do Mar, the presence at a workshop organised by the Portugal-Belgium-Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce on the economy of the sea, and the annual conference organised by Wavec – Wave Energy Centre. The Enondas team’s visits to France and Norway to meet with manufacturers, service providers and promoters proved to be very important for the marketing of the Pilot Area and its potential future usage. As part of its commercial activities and with regard to potential customers with which it is a more advanced stage of discussions, coupled with the aspects described in the previous paragraph, Enondas promotes, in addition to the services it provides to its customers, ties to companies in the sector, namely shipyards, industrial companies, maritime services companies, consultants and service firms. Main investments 2013 was marked by the final phase for regulating access to the Pilot Area and its environmental profile study. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 57 Future prospects Enondas will continue with the infrastructure project (electricity connection and undersea cable), and it is expected that the engineering project will be at an advanced stage by the end of 2014. ENONDAS will continue its marketing efforts, promoting the Pilot Area and Portuguese companies and institutes for the know-how necessary for the logistics chain of its customers. Strongly dependent on discussions with the public bodies responsible for the licensing of the project, Enondas has an open platform at its disposal, which will be raised on opening and promoted, namely by the Directorate General for Energy and Geology, the Portuguese Environment Agency the Directorate General of Maritime Authority and the Directorate General of Natural Resources, Safety and Maritime Services, in order to ensure the success of this project. On the part of the Government, it is hoped that the importance of this project continues to be seen from an economic, energy and innovation policy standpoint, whilst waiting on the approval of the pending legal decrees that would finalise the legal framework of Enondas. 3.4.4 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT After changes in its shareholding structure in 2012, REN strengthened the conditions that contribute towards promoting its image internationally and now has a broad range of competitive advantages that enable effective internationalization based on its core competences. Thus in 2012, REN reviewed its strategic plan for the period 2013-2016, identifying the internationalisation of its activities as one of the fundamental pillars of the company’s future strategy. A set of guidelines were defined for REN’s internationalisation programme, INTERNATIONALInotably the objective of, based on the company’s core competencies, reducing SATION exposure to a regulated single market, through the diversification of investment and revenue sources. In carrying out its internationalisation plan, REN will ensure is one of the a balanced use of its resources between M&A opportunities – projects generating immediate cash flow – and greenfield opportunities – projects implemented over fundamental a longer term. Taking into consideration the inherent risks and competitive nature of the target markets, internationalisation will be carried out in phases and on a pillars of REN’s case by case basis, with a financially responsible attitude, ensuring an adequate return on investment. future strategy. As part of the internationalisation plan, priority areas were identified for expansion and consolidating its international presence, namely: South America, South Africa, Europe, Middle East and Asia, along United States of America (on a case by case basis in the case of the latter region). During 2012 and 2013, REN carried out various exploratory missions in some of the identified regions, and has negotiated the acquisition of stakes and consultancy projects with companies and governments controlling energy infrastructure. In 2013, continuing the exploratory work already carried out, REN entered into formal M&A and greenfield negotiations for the first time in the energy transmission sector These negotiations, although unsuccessful, represented the first steps in the REN’s internationalisation, and offered the chance to develop the necessary international visibility and experience, which will prove advantageous in future projects. 58 MANAGEMENT REPORT Notable developments in REN’s internationalisation plan include: South America • Identifying and monitoring opportunities of strategic interest to be established in the short-term, including consulting opportunities as well as M&A and greenfield opportunities (Colombia and Peru) South Africa • Strategic involvement in the development consortium for the Energy Transmission Project (STE) project in Mozambique, responsible for the development, operation and maintenance of the High Voltage National Electrical Energy Transmission Network (the ’’backbone’’ project) spanning almost 2 000km with links to South Africa as well as future projects for hydroelectric and thermoelectric production. • Identifying opportunities, mainly to be carried out over the medium/long term • Developing relationships with local stakeholders through the provision of consulting services Europe • Identification of potential opportunities to use REN’s technical know-how in the field of European energy Middle East and Asia • Agreements for conducting consultancy projects to support planned energy networks and overcoming the challenges of integrating renewable energies REN seeks to ensure the group’s sustainability leveraging its efficient and recognised national experience as an operator of systems transmitting electricity and natural gas, with a view to: • Identifying partnerships with operators of reference energy networks at an international level, which can result in agreements for operations cooperation, technical exchanges and business evaluations of common interest; • Establishing and formalising relations with multilateral international agencies supporting the development and funding of infrastructure. 3.5 In the 2013 fiscal year, REN’s net profit decreased by 1.8% (-2.3 millions of euros) to 121.3M. The 6.2 millions of euros (-4.6%) fall in financial income was a major FINANCIAL contributing factor, resulting from growing financing costs due to an increase in the average gross debt. On the other hand, and somewhat compensating for PERFORMANCE this development, EBITDA increased by 9.9 millions of euros (+1.9%) compared to 2012, reflecting a continued aim for improvement in the operational performance of the group. It should be noted that as a result of implementing the changes It should be noted that as a result of implementing the changes in standard IAS 19 – Staff Benefits, which is required to be applied in financial years starting on or after 1 January 2013 (see Notes 3.1 and 21 of Chapter 5 – Consolidated Financial Statements), the values reported referring to 31 December 2012 have been re-expressed. The use of a single discount rate has now been considered in compliance with the new wording of IAS 19. This has resulted in an increase in the category ‘Staff costs’ in the Consolidated Statement of Results for 2012 (and as such, a reduction in net profits for the financial year of 2012), and taken to the category of ‘Accumulated Profits’ on 31 December 2012, in the amount of 0.3 millions of euros. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 59 Investment decreased by 6.6% (-13.2millions of euros), reflecting the end of the Sines Terminal expansion project (23.5millions of euros) during 2012, whilst exploration costs exhibited the same results. In spite of these reductions, average RAB increased in comparison to the previous year. The group’s funding access conditions began to turn during 2013, with the average debt cost set at 5.54%, a reduction of 16 b.p. compared to the previous year, and the net debt reduced by 110.1millions of euros (-4.4%) in comparison to 2012.

The following factors made a positive contribution to the evolution of EBITDA: • A decrease in Opex by 12.8 millions of euros (-10.4%), of which the following are worthy of note: i) a decrease of 5.5 millions of euros in non-core costs, including -2.8 millions of euros in forest clearing and 3.3 millions of euros in system services and cross-border tariffs; ii) reduction of 8.0 millions of euros in external core costs, including -4.4 millions of euros in specialist services contracts, -1.0 millions of euros in maintenance costs and -0.9 millions of euros in advertising costs; ANNUAL REPORT 2013 61 • The increase seen in other revenues (+13.8 millions of euros), resulting mainly from the increase contribution of 9.2 millions of euros from the interest on tariff deviation, which went from -6.5 millions of euros in 2012 (resulting from tariff deviation to be returned to tariffs) to 2.7 millions of euros in 2013 (resulting from tariff deviation to be received from tariffs); • Revenues from recovery of depreciation increased by 4.4 millions of euros (+2.5%), in line with the increase in RAB; • A 7.9 millions of euros change in the impairment of receivable debts, resulting from one impairment in 2012 (-2.6 millions of euros), and the reversal in 2013 of the impairments accumulated over previous years of 5.6 millions of euros. These positive results were partially offset by: • A decrease of 17.6 millions of euros (-6.2%) in the return on RAB, of which return on electricity assets accounted for -19.6 millions of euros (excluding land), resulting from a reduction in the base rate of return, that went from 9.55% to 8.06% (the rate of return for electricity assets is linked to the daily average of the Portuguese 5 year CDS), partially offset by an increase in the average RAB (+94.6 millions of euros; +4.8%), along with an increase in the weighting of premium assets, which went from 38% to 43% of the total in 2013; • A decrease in the remuneration of hydro land, which went from 9.7 millions of euros in 2012 to 8.3 millions of euros in 2013 (-1.3 millions of euros; -13.6%), due to the decrease in interbank swap rates11; • A decrease in the revenue from Opex (-5.7 millions of euros; -5.2%), in line with the decrease in group operational costs.

The reduction in financial income can be explained by the increase in average gross debt (necessary to ensure the display of liquidity for ratings purposes), and in spite of a reduction in the average costs of financing by 5.54% (-16 b.p.). Recurring Net Profit (i.e. Net profit less nonrecurring items) increased 0.4% (0.5 million euros). The nonrecurring items considered in 2013 and 2012 are as follows: • In 2013 – i) reversal of impairments of receivable debts registered in previous years (5.3 millions of euros; 3.8 millions of euros after tax); and ii) effect of the carry cost of the pledge to the European Investment Bank (4.6 millions of euros; 3.2 millions of euros after tax) • In 2012 – ii) correction of the surplus from the estimated income tax of -5.6 millions of euros related to the recognition as a fiscal cost of the provision of an indemnity pertaining to the litigation with Amorim Energia; and ii) registration of a provision for impairment of receivable debts amounting to 2.6 millions of euros (1.8 millions of euros after tax); and iii) effect of the carry cost of the pledge to the European Investment Bank, made in November 2012 (0.7 millions of euros; 0.5 millions of euros after tax) NET INCOME ‘13 ‘12 Var.% (Millions of euros) EBITDA 521.5 511.6 1.9% Depreciations 201.2 197.4 2.0% Financial income -142.2 -136.0 4.6% Income tax expenses 56.7 54.6 3.8% Net income 121.3 123.6 -1.8% Nonrecurring items -10.6 -3.3 n.m.

This decrease is due to the conclusion of the Sines Terminal expansion project (23.5 millions of euros) during 2012. Following the same pattern assets transferred to operations decreased by 75.6 millions of euros (-23.6%), reaching a sum of 245.0 millions of euros. In a similar way to that of capex, this drop can be explained by the start of operations at the Sines Terminal in 2012 (106.9 millions of euros). Average RAB increased by 3.2% (+108.2 millions of euros), reaching 3 488.9 millions of euros, consisting of 81.0 millions of euros in the Electricity sector and 27.2 millions of euros in Natural Gas. In electricity, the increase in average RAB occurred mainly in the categories with the greatest rate of return, wherein 139.4 millions of euros of this increase took place in electricity with premium (RoR of 9.6%), while the categories with a lower rate of return (hydro lands, RoR of 2.8%, and electricity without premium, RoR of 8.1%) saw their average RAB value reduce 12.9 millions of euros and 44.8 millions of euros, respectively.

The following activities are worthy of note: the development of the network in the Trás-os-Montes region, where 14 millions of euros was invested; the reinforcement of the network on the route of the Douro and in the Porto region, where 49 millions of euros was invested, on the coastline south of Porto (Feira) 17 millions of euros, the development of the network in the Beira Interior region (14 millions of euros) and in the Lisbon area and Setúbal Peninsula (33 millions of euros). In the gas segment, the following activities are worthy of note: the construction of the Mangualde-Celorico-Guarda gas pipeline, where approximately 19.7 millions of euros was invested in 2013, and the C6 cavern for storing natural gas, with an investment of 4.5 millions of euros. 64 MANAGEMENT REPORT MAIN PROJECTS IN 2013 ELETRICITY GAS (MAIN PROJECTS) (MAIN PROJECTS) 48.5 M€ DEVELOPMENT OF THE NETWORK IN 19.7 M€ GAS PIPELINE PORTO AND DOURO AXIS A EAS Mangualde Celorico -Guarda [REN 32.9 M€ REINFORCING THE NETWORK IN LISBON / Gasodutos] SETÚBAL PENÍNSULA AREA 4.5 M€ CAVITY 06 [REN Armazenagem] 17.2 M€ REINFORCING THE NETWORK ALONG THE 3.4 M€ OTHER Projets COAST SOUTH OF PORTO 14.1 M€ DEVELOPMENT OF THE NETWORK IN TRÁS-OS-MONTES AREA 14.2 M€ DEVELOPMENT OF THE NETWORK IN THE Beira Interior AREA 30.6 M€ OTHER PROJECTS ELETRICITY: 157.6M€ OTHER BUSINESSES: 0.4M€ gAs: 29.9M€ GROUP’S INVESTMENTS IN 2013: 187.8M€ Eletricity Investment in the electricity segment amounted to 157.6 millions of euros (+1.3%) and transfers into operation amounted to 197.3 millions of euros (-1.8%). In the Trás-os-Montes region a new 220kV connection came into operation between Valpaços and Vila Pouca de Aguiar, completing the 220 kV circuit of the mountainous axis between Lagoaça and Valdigem, in order to reinforce supply to consumers and improve power feeding conditions to the network in that area. On the route of the Douro and in the Porto area, the 400kV connections between Armamar-Recarei and Recarei-Vermoim came into operation, along with the introduction of a 400kV level at Vermoim substation. Also in the Porto area, the refurbishment to 220kV of the Maia steel plant was concluded, along with the connection that feeds it. In the southern coastal region of Greater Porto a new 400/60kV substation came into operation at Feira, supplying consumers in the municipalities of São João da Madeira, Feira and Arouca. In the Beira Interior region a second 150kV connection came into service between the Falagueira and Castelo Branco substations, offering this region the possibility to improve the supply of renewable energies and the overall safety of the network operation. In the Lisbon area and on the Setúbal Peninsula, in order to reinforce supply to consumers, it is worth noting the construction of a new 220kV underground circuit between the Alto de Mira and Sete Rios substations and the introduction of a 400kV level at the Fernão Ferro substation. Seven new transformers started operation, with a total power increase of 1,069 MVA (of which 320MVA are at the Maia steel plant substation). ANNUAL REPORT 2013 65 GROUPS MAIN INVESTMENTS ELECTRICITY Natural gas Investments in the area of natural gas stood at 29.9 millions of euros (-33.6%) and assets put into operation totalled 47.7 millions of euros (-60.1%). In 2013, REN continued with the implementation of the development and investment plan in the National Transmission Network, in the Underground Storage Infrastructures and in the LNG Terminals (RNTIAT). This plan, which includes development and expansion projects, internal reinforcement and revamping investment and connection to the RNDGN and customers. As part of the expansion of the RNTGN, REN Gasodutos put the MangualdeCelorico-Guarda gas pipeline into operation, running for almost 76km and closing the loop between lots 5 (Monforte/Guarda) and 6 (Cantanhede/ Mangualde), thereby increasing supply security and making possible a future third interconnection of the RNTGN with Spain. Along with the pipeline, four new stations also came into operation at Arcozelo, Soeiro do Chão, Celorico da Beira and Avelãs de Ambom. This project was eligible under the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) criteria. REN Armazenagem continued to construct the RENC-6 cavity, which underwent leaching operations during 2013, estimating a final volume of almost 530 000 m3. The initial natural gas filling took place at Transgás-Armazenagem’s TGC-2 cavity. 66 MANAGEMENT REPORT GROUPS MAIN INVESTMENTS – GAS 3.5.1 FUNDING AND DEBT 2013 was marked by a steady return of Portuguese issuers to global capital markets, in stark contrast to the period between April 2011 and September 2012, during which the bond markets were closed to them. This increase in the availability of international investors was, in 2013, logically accompanied by a reduction in spreads required to national issuers. This situation allied to historically low base interest rates, created ideal conditions for the success of a large number of international bond issues carried out by Portuguese issuers. REN took advantage of this situation to continue improving its debt profile, as well as its liquidity position and financial strength. The restructuring of REN’s debt focused on three main principles: • Diversifying the sources of funding and expanding the lenders base • Reducing the refinancing risk • Creating the conditions for a consistent reduction of the average cost of debt 2013 saw important challenges for the financial management of REN, especially the refinancing of the 800 million euro bond issue of 2008, which matured on December 10th. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 67 The bonds issued on the international market in January and October, for amounts of 300 million and 400 million euros respectively, and the drawdown of 100 million euros under the first tranche (400 million euros) of China Development Bank (CDB) credit facility, ensured the refinancing of the aforementioned 800 million euros bond. Due to current market conditions, the refinancing was carried out at much lower interest rates. The following funding operations were carried out in 2013: • In January, a 150 million euros bond was issued with a seven years maturity. • Also in January, a 300 million euros international bond was issued with a five years maturity. • In March, a 75 million euros international bank loan was signed with a three years maturity. • In April, a 400 million euro credit facility was signed with CDB, with a eight years maturity. This is the first tranche of 1 billion euros funding commitment, following the agreement with State Grid International Development as part of the second phase of REN’s reprivatisation. • In October, a second international bond issue was issued with an amount of 400 million euros and a seven years maturity. • In November, a 160 million euro credit facility was signed with ICBC – Industrial and Commercial Bank of China with a five years maturity. • During the year, five commercial paper programs were renegotiated, with a total value of 675 million euros, aiming to extend their maturity and to improve their financial conditions. The amount of new funding operations and renegotiations in 2013 came to approximately 2,200 million euros. REN’s debt structure was thereby profoundly reshaped, with the aim of creating conditions to comply with the principles set out by REN as part of their debt management and financial risk strategy. Thus, decisive actions included: (i) the growth and diversification of the lenders base (the current shareholder structure provided REN with funding alternantives offered by nonEuropean lenders); (ii) the extension of the average debt maturity; (iii) the smoothing of refinancing needs, and (iv) the increased flexibility of certain financial instruments.

This increase was due to a significant strengthening of REN’s liquidity position, which wascarried out to a great extent, by the accumulation of a reserve of bank deposits remunerated at lower rates than the funding obtained for this purpose. The average cost of gross debt in 2013 was 5.54%, 16 base points less than in 2012. The policy for managing interest rate risk continued to be aimed at reducing the volatility of financial costs. REN’s fixed rate debt represented 52.2% of the total debt. With regard to liquidity position, the company’s funding requirements are fully covered until the end of 2016. By the end of 2013, REN’s credit ratings with Fitch, S&P and Moody’s were BBB, BB+ and Ba1 respectively. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 69 3.6 During 2014, ERSE will set out the regulatory model for the transmission of electricity that will be in force for the next multi-year period. REN has already PERSPECTIVES begun dialogue with ERSE with the aim of ensuring that the new regulations 2014 remain stable, balanced and with adequate incentives for efficiency. The Portuguese economic outlook has shown signs of improvement, following a common trend across Euro zone members. A sign of this improvement can be seen in the national consumption of electricity, which has, since May 2013, began to show faint signs of growth, growing stronger month on month. Alongside the signs that the recession has passed its lowest point, the financial markets are beginning to regain confidence in Portugal, leading to a clear drop in the risk premiums for the country and our major companies. REN will benefit strongly from the drop in its average debt costs in 2014, all the more so given that the most costly bond issues were reimbursed in 2013. A significant challenge will be presented by minimizing any possible impact from the extraordinary contribution levied on the energy sector set out in the 2014 State Budget, which will be met through further efforts to increase operating efficiency. In 2014, the Company will remain focused on its continued efforts to improve operating efficiency, completing the streamlining of its internal organisation, which produced benefits over the last two years. These efforts will of course be carried out whilst maintaining the standards of excellence and quality of service that our customers expect and deserve. An example of this can be seen in faultless way in which REN’s grids performed during the storms of 9th February this year. Alongside the optimisation of operations in Portugal, REN will proceed with its efforts in internationalisation and the development of new lines of business started in 2012, which has already contributed, albeit only modestly, to the 2013 result by way of the dividend received from HCB in Mozambique. The REN team finds motivation in the new challenges that the future brings, and management will continue to invest heavily in the training and development of our people, which remains a primary objective. 3.7 The consolidated net profit of REN SGPS, S.A. in the 2013 financial year amounted to 121 303 275.23 euros (one hundred and twenty one million, three hundred and PROPOSED three thousand, two hundred seventy five euros and twenty three cents).

The programme consists of professional, academic and summer internships, where interns have the opportunity to work on specific projects, creating value for different areas while enhancing their own skills. With regard to professional internships in job rotation, an extra challenge is launched every year to the internship plan. In 2013, the challenge was to develop a REN building and its contents on the virtual external Talent City platform. 82 SUSTainability AT REN Witness: ‹‹A company which offers numerous learning opportunities and which focuses on the development of employees is the ideal place to start a career.

This +41 program aims to ensure ongoing learning and development for REN’s employees, in accordance with the transversal and specific needs of different areas and functions, in keeping with the company’s values and strategy. THOUSAND HOURS As an ongoing development process, REN has defined an annual training programme which includes transversal and specific actions, training funding, seminars, congresses and conferences. In 2013, there was a clear focus on the qualification level of technical employees as well as on technical and internal training. In transversal terms, of note in 2013 is the implementation of two new development programmes which are in line with our organizational strategy and are adapted to fit the needs of employees: the Energy Academy and the General Management Programme. The aim of these programmes is to develop the ANNUAL REPORT 2013 83 management and leadership skills which are vital to ensuring that REN retains and develops talent, providing experiences which inspire employees to do more and better. It is REN’s goal to expand and continue this type of programme in coming years, never forgetting the specificities and characteristics of the groups covered. Another action with company-wide impact was the holding of the Team Offsite actions. The aim of these actions is to bring teams and their leaders closer together through team building programmes which seek to strengthen team spirit and create a positive attitude among REN staff. Witness: ‹‹There was a lot of curiosity and, in general, the activities reflected personal interests and also satisfied the aim of the meeting which was to share the idea that we need to improve communication between the different departments on an ongoing basis››. Isabel Fernandes (studies and regulation) The usual REN Meetings also took place, in a conference format, with speakers of recognized academic and professional merit sharing their experience on relevant topics in a perspective of continuous learning and ongoing transformation. There was also clear focus this year on e-learning with courses covering transversal topics of interest to everyone. We opted for this format as learning can be flexible to fit in with different working hours, dates and places. All a trainee needs is a computer and an Internet connection.

Star programme – performance management In 2013, the Star Programme – Performance Management, completed its third assessment cycle, and in order to reflect the changes which have taken place in recent years in our business, management, structure, market and ambition, improvements have been introduced into the current management performance model. These improvements seek to ensure that this programme continues to be a vital instrument in the alignment of REN’s goals with those of the departments and every individual employee. It also recognizes the performance and potential of our employees. Once it has been reviewed, 2014 will see the application of the new model. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 85 Indicators Assessment Number of employees covered 723 % of assessments concluded 100% Average – final assessments 3.68 % of awards calculated as compared to the number of assessments 95% Managing knowledge The Knowledge Management Project, started in 2011, with the aim of implementing an integrated talent management programme, produced its first results in 2012, with the mapping of REN’s talent. In 2013, REN focused on retaining and developing its talent with the implementation of the training programmes Energy Academy and General Management Programme, lasting 18 and 12 months, respectively. These programmes were attended by around 60 members of staff. Networx In 2013, REN launched a new facility for multi-platform collaboration which allows REN employees to work to work from both inside and outside the company NetworX. This platform houses four main tools: BOX, a personal area to access documents and load, edit and organize files; Team Rooms, an area for sharing teamwork with online and offline access; Search, a search engine which performs searches within the platform and Lync, a unified communications platform for sending messages to any company employee, making calls or holding video conferences or virtual meetings with presentations. This function allows REN employees to work from home thus reconciling private and professional life. Benefits and social dialogue Also in 2012, REN made the decision to propose a new collective agreement model to unions. During 2013, negotiation started on the new collective agreement with eight union organizations which showed interest, of which two presented formal counter proposals. 60 negotiation meetings were held with the union organizations involved. The meetings took place within a climate of constructive dialogue with the finalising of significant agreements which allowed greater proximity in negotiations. 86 SUSTainability AT REN With the negotiation of this new collective agreement, REN’s aims are to implement a general HR policy which allows universality and equality to be expanded with regard to work organization, benefits, duties, careers and payment, with the perspective of providing greater management flexibility and fomenting a social and working environment which is favourable to the development of business thus ensuring sustainability. The following benefits were applied in 2013: Collective labour Individual Benefits agreement (ACT) work contract (CIT) Occupational accidents insurance x x Personal accident insurance x Health plan x x Life insurance Pension fund x Electricity at lower prices x Also with regard to the negotiation of the new collective agreement, REN Group workers were involved by the union organizations in the discussion through plenary meetings which were attended by significant numbers and which took place in a constructive and expectant climate with regard to the negotiations underway. During 2013, no work conflicts or strikes were seen at REN. In the management of relations with social partners, REN continues the practice of holding regular meetings with the Workers’ Commission. In 2013, 10 formal meetings and numerous informal meetings were held. Also of special note was the climate of constructive dialogue. Topics of importance for the organization which were analysed and debated with the Workers’ Commission included the implementation of new organizational structures, requesting of opinions on internal regulations and on the implementation of surveillance and control systems impacting on workers, and the presentation of new projects in the management of human resources, innovation and communication. These topics are examples of the climate of dialogue which REN promotes. In 2013, 54.6% of REN employees were covered by a collective labour agreement (ACT) and 46.3% were part of a union. ‘11 ‘12 ‘13 % union members 46.8% 47.3% 46.3% % ACT 59.3% 57.1% 54.6% ANNUAL REPORT 2013 87 4.3.1.3 Health and safety Aware that a safe and healthy environment is a decisive factor for the satisfaction of stakeholders, REN is committed to the effective management of occupational health and safety. The occupational health and safety management system is certified by an accredited entity and encompasses most of the group’s companies. Its main objective is to prevent the occurrence of work related accidents and illnesses involving Company employees as well as the employees of contractors and service providers collaborating with REN. Safety At REN, close attention is given to the management of risks with a high level of severity for the health and safety of employees and the employees of contractors and service providers. For this reason, REN is committed to developing and promoting measures to eliminate or mitigate such risks. With the aim of fighting accidents in the workplace, policies are implemented, safety procedures are followed and the best practices in this area are closely adhered to. This is achieved through numerous training courses and strict monitoring of activities so as to ensure demanding operational control. An analysis of the accidents allows an assessment to be made of the risks inherent to each activity, establishing the associated level of risk, as well as reassessment in cases of recurrence. In 2013, there were two more accidents than in 2012. In relation to the accidents seen in 2013, only five led to time off work. Moreover, more than half occurred in itinere, including the fatal accident.

Further aims were to test alarm mechanisms, improve coordination between the terminal’s first response team (FRT) and the Sines Port intervention standards team (APS). ANNUAL REPORT 2013 89 A In order to train, test emergency plan procedures, verify the suitability of means of communication and fire fighting and promote attitudes and skills in emergency response teams. Also during the year, six training exercises were held for each of the six scenarios selected from the IEP. These exercises led to internal improvements and the consolidation of emergency response capabilities at the Sines LNG terminal. On 19 December at 10 a.m., a safety drill was held at REN Armazenagem in Carriço with the aim of testing emergency response procedures and training emergency team members. The drill involved simulating an emergency requiring the implementation of defined actions in the response to such situations. This involved the first and second fire fighting interventions and technical control to re-establish normal operating conditions at the facility. Further information in this regard can be consulted on REN’s website 5. Health All contract employees at REN are covered by a health system. ABSENTEEISM RATE Ensuring good working conditions and occupational health is a constant concern 2.7% at REN. The Company conducts examinations and complementary clinical analyses in terms of occupational medicine so as to enable preventive actions with regard to employee health. Highlighted below are the most relevant aspects in 2013: • Compliance with obligatory plan of medical examinations • 415 diagnostic support tests • 445 medical acts • 415 nursing acts • Visits by doctors to places of work The absenteeism rate has been constant over recent years, standing at approximately 3%. ‘11 ‘12 ‘13 Absenteeism rate 3.1% 2.9% 2.7% ‘Saudável’ programme INITIATIVES After the launching of the Saudável Programme in 2012, with the goal of 25 promoting well-being, health and improved quality of life for employees, 2013 saw the consolidation of this programme with the challenge of maintaining the level of satisfaction achieved. This programme contributed to greater commitment by employees to the company and to an increase/improvement in the working environment, human relations and productivity and performance of duties. 5 www.ren.pt See REN>Sustainability>Stakeholders>Human_Resources>Safety 90 SUSTainability AT REN This year, there were numerous different initiatives including workshops, information provided on the Intranet and the activities which were differentiated in accordance with work places, more specifically labour fitness sessions and chair massages, which were widely attended and allowed well-being techniques to be taught but also to put these techniques into practice. Diverse and transversal topics were covered:: • Women’s health • National Breast Cancer Prevention day • Labour Fitness Sessions • Chair massages • Pediatric first-aid course • Families and new technologies • Nutrition Consultations • World Food Day • Healthy and fun cooking • Blood donation Relevant data for the ‘Saudável’ Programme 2013: Indicators ‘13 Number of initiatives 25 Number of participations 215 Satisfaction rate 91% Contacted OWNERS 4.3.1.4 Relationship with the Community 2 700 Owners Relationships with owners are of the utmost importance to REN. In 2013 REN interacted with 2 700 owners whose land was crossed by new sections of electricity transmission networks of projects underway, as part of REN’s development and investment plans. REN also acquired 23 properties to install other electricity and natural gas infrastructure. With this expansion, the database of REN owners contained around 68 000 records at the end of 2013, which itself evidences the importance of this group of stakeholders with regard to the company, especially considering Portugal’s relatively small geographical size as compared to most European countries. REN always seeks to ensure the compatibility of the installation and operation of its infrastructure with the legitimate interests of other stakeholders. Further information in this regard can be consulted on the REN website 6. Community support Aware of its responsibility in the area of corporate citizenship and committed to maintaining and perfecting a socially responsible and ethical management model, in 2013 REN supported a set of initiatives relevant to the community in diverse areas: social, cultural, environmental and sports. 6 w ww.ren.pt See REN>Sustainability>Stakeholders>Community>Land Owners and Rights of Way ANNUAL REPORT 2013 91 Of note is the development of competences through the REN Prize (reformulated in 2013 so as to cover the different areas of knowledge), which distinguishes the best Master’s theses in Portuguese universities, or the support to The Lisbon MBA, where REN is a founding member, and to the Portuguese Physics Society, through the Medea IV Project. Equally worthy of note is the partnership established with ‘The Next Big Idea’, a television programme to encourage entrepreneurs and promote innovative ideas, and to Explorers Festival, the biggest national festival on entrepreneurship, which brought together more than 1 000 participants from all over the world in Lisbon. Also within the scope of its policy of close ties with local communities where the company’s infrastructure is located, REN has sought to act as a socially responsible entity, namely in terms of preserving the environment and historical and cultural patrimony, while likewise supporting the legitimate interests of the communities in surrounding areas. This is achieved by means of support for civil society initiatives, which often depend greatly on such contributions, as well as by support and participation in conservation projects, within the scope of measures to minimise the impact on patrimony and the environment or even actions promoted by the company in the area of environmental awareness and dissemination. One example of this is the reforestation plan, where REN has already contributed by planting more than 400 000 trees in Portugal, involving, whenever possible, students from local schools. In terms of support for social causes and combating inequality and the problems affecting society the most, REN’s spirit of solidarity is reflected in diverse ways. REN has established partnerships with several institutions for social solidarity such as the Federation of Food Banks, we joined the Zero Waste Movement and, on an international level, we continued our support for the High Commissioner to the United Nations for Refugees. A further mention should be given to the support provided to the Portuguese Olympic Committee, as part of the preparation programme for the 2016 Olympic Games, and to the Portuguese Paralympics Committee as part of the preparation programme for the Rio 2016 Paralympics Games and for the preparation programme for the Ankara 2017 Deaflympics Games. Highlight also for the launching of the corporate volunteer programme Share, LAUNCHING OF THE based on three areas education, environment and solidarity and which seeks SHARE PROGRAMME to use the skills and time of REN workers to serve the community. Examples include the cleaning of the forest at Tapada Nacional de Mafra and monthly Corporate actions with Comunidade Vida e Paz. Volunteering Internally, REN has run numerous programmes with a view to developing its work environment, such as, for example, team reports transversal to all business areas, reports on employees’ lives outside work or actions to motivate employees. Further information in this regard can be consulted on the REN website 7. 4.3.1.5 Innovation, research and technology Initiatives Setting up of the Ren-State Grid Energy Research Centre In February 2013, REN Redes Energéticas Nacionais signed an agreement with CEPRI 8 China Electric Power Research Institute (representing State Grid International Development), to form a research and development centre in Portugal, dedicated to the field of energy. 7 w  ww.ren.pt See REN>Sustainability>Stakeholders>Community>scientific, cultural and social support 8 C EPRI, created in 1951, is a research institute which is a subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China. At the end of July 2008, CEPRI had 3 227 staff, including 2 344 engineers, 151 staff with PhDs, 853 with Master’s Degrees, 98 scholarships in engineering research, 373 engineers and 17 PhD supervisors. 92 SUSTainability AT REN ENERGY RESEARCH In May, the company Centro de Investigação em Energia REN-State Grid, S.A. was formally constituted and the Energy Research and Development Centre – R&D AND DEVELOPMENT Nester and its respective website were presented at a public ceremony in June. CENTRE FORMED The aim of this centre, which will be able to count on collaboration from – R&D NESTER prestigious universities in the energy sector, local industry and international R&D institutions, is to provide an international platform for knowledge, delivering innovative solutions and tools for use in the operating and planning of energy transmission networks, more specifically in four areas: power system simulation; management of renewable energy integration into networks; technologies for smart grids and energy markets and economics. Nester has been in operation since July and already has a team of 14 Chinese and Portuguese members. Focusing on the development and management innovative projects for the energy sector, the current team, led by Nuno Souza e Silva, has five full-time and five part-time researchers, working in the development of four projects: Renewable Energy Dispatch Tools Substation of the Future Energy Storage Planning Planning and Operation of large AC/DC Power Grids with Renewables Investment in R&D and applications to tax incentive programmes As a measure which is clearly identifiable with Company strategy, REN works in R&D to implement new projects to provide solutions which allow the maximization of business. As a result of activities and projects, several scientific articles have been published and/or communications made. Team members have also actively participated in international conferences and numerous working groups belonging to organizations and associations discussing subjects at the forefront of developments in the fields of electricity. Within the scope of R&D activities, and as in previous years, the REN Group has submitted three applications to the SIFIDE (Corporate R&D Tax Incentive Schemes) funding programme. These applications referred to R&D activities which took place during the financial year of 2012 at REN-Rede Eléctrica Nacional, REN Gasodutos and REN Serviços. 17 R&D projects were identified, representing Company investment of R&D PROJECTS approximately 0.9 million euros. These projects are on a national and European 17 level and aim to discover new differentiated solutions impacting on the performance of power networks. A high number of employees from numerous different areas are participating in this work. Of special note are four projects which for the first time have been the subject of application to this funding programme. They were assessed by the SIFIDE certifying commission as eligible for R&D. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 93 On an international level and within the scope of the 7th Framework Programme: 1) e  -Highway 2050 Project European Electricity Highway System 2050 Approved in 2012 by the European Commission and with expected duration of three years, the aim is to develop the basis for the modular and robust expansion of pan-European electrical power transmission networks between 2020 and 2050, focusing on the three pillars of European energy policy. 2) iTESLA Project Innovative Tools for Electrical System Security within Large Areas The aim is to develop and validate a flexible toolbox which, before 2015, will provide support for the future operation of pan-European electrical power transmission networks and increase coordination/ standardisation of operating procedures among network operators. This project started in 2012 and is expected to finish in 2015. On a national level: 3) In the area of electricity transmission network planning, the REN_EECT Project Study on Transitory Stability and Tension Control on the RNT before 2014, took place during 2012 in a partnership with INESC Porto. The basis of this project was to ensure the security and stability of the RNT and the need to provide the possibility to connect to new wind energy production centres. With this in mind, the project assessed the need to place a specific class of FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems) devices on the RNT. These devices allow the tension to be controlled and support reactive power permanently. They also provide tension support after short-circuit which may occur in the RNT. It is therefore possible to reduce or avoid cuts in wind power and improve network stability. 4) In the area of Management of Gas Transmission Network Assets, we also started in 2012 the REN-MICPC Project Model for the injection of current into a cathodic protection system. The aim of this project was to develop a mathematical model for the real time control of the entire RNTGN infrastructure, with a view to optimising the cathodic protection system, foreseeing and anticipating corrosion points. It is expected that this project will last four years. In 2013, REN maintained and expanded the REN Award, promoting the award during a roadshow to present the new regulations at six prestigious scientific and academic institutions: Higher Technical Institute, Faculty of Engineering at Porto University, Faculty of Sciences and Technology at Coimbra University, Higher Institute of Economy and Management, Higher Lisbon Institute of Engineering and the MIT Portugal Programme. It is now around 18 years since the start of the REN Award, so the company decided to reformulate it so as to renew the focus on the innovation of energy systems, as well as broaden the award to candidates from a wider range of areas. The new REN Award will not only lead to a process with greater participation, but also much more diversified in terms of fields covered. To consolidate the new REN Award, a new jury has also been formed and the regulations have been updated. As REN is so directly linked to the Portuguese scientific and technological system, this award is of strategic importance, a fact which can be seen in the high quality of the members of the jury. It is hoped that once again, the quality of higher education in Portugal will be reflected in the quality of the work presented. Partnerships with R&D institutions One of REN’s policies is to develop projects in partnerships with national and/ or international academic and R&D institutions, more specifically with entities recognized by the National Scientific and Technological System (SCTN). This approach provides an excellent opportunity for the corporate and academic worlds to share experiences and know-how. 94 SUSTainability AT REN As an example, during 2012 a partnership was established with INESC Porto (REN_EECT Project Study on Transitory Stability and Tension Control on the RNT before 2014; REN_RNT Project Power Reception at RNT hubs), with IST – Higher Technical Institute at Lisbon University (REN Smart DIP Project, stochastic forecast of the magnitude and duration of voltage sag in electrical power transmission networks), with FFUL Pharmacy Faculty at Lisbon University (REN-CEM Project electromagnetic fields) and with the Higher Technical Institute at Aveiro University (REN-PPE Project wind production forecast). Collaboration in national and international programmes for R&D and innovation In 2013, REN continued its commitment to the success of EnergyIN (Competitiveness and Technology Cluster for Energy), having re-elected its representative to the respective Governing Board. As part of REN’s participation as a member of COTEC Portugal Corporate Association for Innovation, of note last year was the Company’s representation at the COTEC Iberian meeting held in Madrid, as well as participation in one of this association’s recent initiatives in the field of knowledge management. This project follows the model of a community of practices, the main aims of which are to enable information to be shared on a critical area in the management of innovation and to start a new relationship between the association and its members. On the same theme and on a European level, REN continues to actively participate in ENTSO-E, as a member of the Research and Development Committee (RDC) and the respective Working Group MKS (Monitoring and Knowledge Sharing). Innovative Tools for Electrical System Security within Large Areas REN CONTINUES TO Participation in international working groups ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE ENTSO-S in ENTSO-E and The implementation of the 3rd EU legislative package for the energy sector has continued to entail intense cooperation and ties between REN and European ENTSO-G associations of transmission systems operators (ENTSO-E and ENTSO-G), namely by means of the participation of REN personnel in the most diverse activities of these two entities. Entso-E (european network of transmission system operators for electricity): With the framework of Regulation (EC) 714/2009, REN has continued to participate in the activities of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity – ENTSO-E – namely through a constant and active presence in various committees and groups of this institution: System Development Committee, System Operations Committee, Market Committee, Research and Development Committee and Legal and Regulatory Group. Of particular note was that REN took on the presidency of the abovementioned System Development Committee in June 2013. REN has also collaborated extensively in the preparation of the ten European network codes in the areas of planning, operation and markets, both in the commentary to the ACER guidelines but also in the drawing up of the abovementioned codes. Of special note is the 9 N  on-profit association whose main mission is to ‘promote the competitiveness of companies established in Portugal, through the development and diffusion of a culture and a practice of innovation as well as of knowledge, especially that generated in our country’. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 95 delivery to the European Commission of three codes to comitology: Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management (CACM NC), Requirements for Generator Connection (RfG NC) and the Demand Connection Code (DCC). At the same time, and as a follow up to work carried out on ENTSO-E, REN continued its pioneering role among its European counterparts disseminating the electricity network codes among the different national and regional stakeholders, driving and organising work sessions and workshops to provide clarification on the codes which are at the final stage of wording. It should also be noted that in 2013, sessions were held on Forward Capacity Allocation (NC FCA), Electricity Balancing (NC EB) and Load Frequency Control & Reserves (NC LFCR), thus concluding eight sessions for a total of 10 planned codes. Entso-g (european network of transmission system operators for gas): The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Natural Gas – ENTSO-G – continued its extensive activities during 2013 through the working groups that are part of its three main business areas, viz. Market, System Development and System Operation. In terms of the most important achievements it is possible to highlight the publication in the official journal of the Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code (CAM NC) and the approval of the Network Code on Gas Balancing of Transmission Networks (BAL NC), which is soon to be officially published. REN also reinforced its participation in ENTSO-G. The Company now has regular presence in the Liaison Group and on the Legal Team, as well as in working groups through which it takes part in the transversal and legal handing of the main topics of European energy policy impacting on gas transmission network operators. At the end of 2013, REN also joined a small ENTSO-G audit team, and appointed Company representatives to all of the business areas and working groups in this association. As a follow up to work carried out on ENTSO-G, REN also continued to disseminate the gas network codes among the different national and regional stakeholders, driving and organising work sessions and workshops to provide clarification on the codes which are at the final stage of wording. It should be noted that, in 2013, REN organized sessions on the following network codes: Interoperability (NC INT), Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (CAM NC) and Gas Balancing in Transmission Systems (BAL NC). Working groups overseen by the european commission Within the framework of legislative proposals relating to lines for implementing priority European energy infrastructure, REN continued with its active participation in the Western Europe Electricity Working Group and Western Europe Gas Working Group, both overseen by the European Commission and aimed at the ad-hoc and informal implementation of the said legislative proposals, while identifying and selecting energy infrastructure projects of common interest (PCI). As a result of this participation, REN took part in four projects – two in a cluster to reinforce internal connections and another for gas and electricity interconnections – corresponding to three PCI on the final list of projects of common interest approved by European Union legislation. Med-tso, medgrid and friends of the supergrid In 2013, REN strengthened its participation in Med-TSO and now has a seat on the Supervisory Team of this association for Mediterranean Transmission System Operators for Electricity. Ren is a founding member of this organization. REN has always been represented in the association’s Regional Group West. REN also actively participated in the preparation of the master plan for this region, which essentially seeks to strengthen the security and integration of electricity systems in the Mediterranean. 96 SUSTainability AT REN In the same year, REN continued to strengthen its participation in MedGrid, appointing a member to the Advisory Board and who is also Vice-Chairman of the association. REN also has a further two members sitting on MedGrid working groups: one in the working group on economic analysis and another in the working group on network planning. These team members will respectively work on economic studies and the network planning required to integrate the abovementioned Mediterranean electricity systems. REN also participated in the annual conference of the same society, the topic for which was, European Union / Union for the Mediterranean: common sustainable energy future. MedGrid brings together companies that generate, transmit, distribute and fund electricity infrastructure in the Mediterranean region with a view to promoting the development of links between the Northern, Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. Finally, REN also continued its participation in Friends of the Supergrid (FOSG), actively intervening in the working groups of this association responsible for communication and institutional and regulatory relations. The Company participated in the FOSG annual conference, the topic of which was, No transition without transmission. This conference covered different subjects relating to the greater integration of renewables in the EU and where the reality of the strategic environmental assessment method also came under the spotlight in a talk given by a speaker nominated by REN. FOSG is an association of companies and organizations which have a mutual interest in promoting and influencing policy and the regulatory framework required for large-scale European interconnection – the Supergrid. This association seeks to promote, develop and create the Supergrid through an association of companies from sectors which develop HVDC infrastructures and related technology, together with companies which will develop, install, own and operate such infrastructures. Economic cooperation council (cce), gas infrastructure europe (gie) and florence school of regulation (fsr): REN has maintained its participation in CCE, intervening at numerous council meetings and providing multiple contributions to the work the council does. This work focused on the areas of energy, competitiveness, large critical infrastructures and long-term financing. The CCE is a non-profit organization which acts as an advisory body to European institutions and is sponsored by the governments of the four Latin Arc countries (Spain, France, Italy and Portugal). With regard to GIE, has continued to participate and accompany this entity’s activities and attended the annual conference. The main theme of the conference was the integration of the European energy market and the financing of gas transmission infrastructures. GIE is an association representing European gas infrastructure companies at European institutions and other stakeholders. As part of the 2013 open days of the regions, REN, in partnership with Rede Elétrica de Espanha, held a workshop in Brussels with the aim of demonstrating the relevant role Portugal and Spain play in renewable energies and in European objectives for 2020. Under the topic of The Iberian Peninsula: A Platform to Successfully Generate, Integrate and Deliver Renewable Energy for Europe, this event sought to explore a strategic energy line vital for the economic development of Southern European countries. It was attended by institutional representatives of EU policies, regional and municipal entities, universities, research centres and consultants. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 97 Finally, as an FSR associate donor, REN continued to attend (both in person and through webinars) the different training courses provided by this high-level school, cooperating with the institution and sponsoring events it which it also participated. The Company also accessed the high-level studies and information produced by FSR, such as at the annual conference on EU Energy & Climate Policy: where do we go from here? REN has thus been reiterating and reinforcing its presence in diverse international forums in the electricity and natural gas sectors, participating in the definition of the policies that frame them, in technical studies and in lobbying the diverse entities promoting its activities in this area. This presence is one of the components of the Company’s strategic plans for internationalisation. 4.3.2 ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE Environmental management Minimising its environmental impact has always been a core concern at REN, both in terms of implementing new investment projects as well as with regard to its activities of operating and maintaining diverse infrastructure used to transmit electricity and to store and transport natural gas. Environmental topics mean far more to REN than just complying with legal obligations, instead they represent a long-term commitment and living in harmony with surroundings. The company’s approach in this regard can be consulted on the REN website 10. 4.3.2.1 Environmental impact assessment Detailed information on Strategic Environmental Assessment and Project Environmental Assessment can be consulted on the REN website 11. 4.3.2.2 Strategic Environmental Assessment Strategic Environmental Assessment is an environmental policy instrument (Decree-Law No 232/2007 of 15 June 2007) which seeks to ensure an assessment of the environmental consequences of specific plans and programmes and its respective prior implementation. During the operating and maintenance of the network, monitoring and supervision actions are undertaken to ensure compliance with objectives and targets defined both by REN and the Environmental Impact Declaration. REN concluded the second equivalent exercise, with the strategic environmental assessment (AAE) as part of PDIRT 2012-2017 (2022). The environmental report resulting from the new PDIRT environmental assessment, was submitted for public consultation jointly with PDIRT. 48 contributions were made at the public consultation, 43 of which were opinions from central and local administrative bodies and five participations from other entities. It was seen that most of the comments and opinions received related to ‘spatial planning’ (48%) and that 11% of comments were from private promoters in the area of special scheme production. The contributions received were considered and, whenever relevant, integrated accordingly into the final version of PDIRT. 10 www.ren.pt/sustentabilidade/abordagem_da_ren 11 www.ren.pt/sustentabilidade/ambiente/avaliacao_ambiental/ 98 SUSTainability AT REN Project Assessment Environmental Impact Assessment (AIA) is a tool which can be used on certain public utility infrastructure projects where REN is the promoter. The AIA process consists of different stages: ENVIRON ENVIRONDEFINITION -MENTAL SELECTION MENTAL PUBLIC POSTOF SCOPE IMPACT OF ACTIONS IMPACT CONSULTATION -ASSESSMENT (DDS) DECLARATION STUDY (EIS) (EID) Given the specificity of the sector, in 2008, REN drew up an AIA methodological guide for the National Electricity Transmission Network Overhead Lines. This guide was drawn up in partnership with the Portuguese Environment Agency and the Portuguese Association for Impact Assessment and is a reference document for drawing up environmental impact studies for this type of infrastructure and the respective AIA processes. Numerous entities intervening in the AIA process took park in this working group, more specifically the Portuguese Institute of Archaeology, the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Institute and the Coordination and Regional Development Commissions. Moreover, and with the aim of standardising AIA process procedures and methodologies, in 2011, REN published another methodological guide, in this case for Assessing the Environmental Impact of RNT substations.

Iberia 125 Climate Change Report 2013 In the area of preventing and controlling greenhouse gas emissions, over the course of recent years REN has been implementing an action plan to reduce its direct emissions, namely with regard to emissions of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), a gas used as an electrical insulator (dielectric) in diverse high and very high voltage equipment. In 2013, despite the increase in installed mass, a decrease was seen in leaks and, consequently, in the leak rate. The company’s efforts to reduce SF6 leakages is reflected in the evolution of the leakage rates for this gas, with results considered to be technically highly positive on an international scale.

The increase in emissions associated with sulphur hexaflouride corresponds to the aforesaid increase of sporadic leakages in some substations. In 2013, the number of videoconferences increased again significantly, by 63% as compared to the previous year, some of them at an international level and involving more than two locations simultaneously. In addition to videoconferences, from the end of 2011 onwards all employees have corporate collaboration software on their computers which makes it possible to exchange instant messages and hold video-calls. This is an important tool to reduce the company’s carbon footprint. ‘11 ‘12 ‘13 Number of train journeys (Lisbon-Porto) 780 974 1 028 Number of videoconferences 601 1 069 1 747 REN continued to encourage the use of trains as compared to light vehicles, especially for transport on the Lisbon-Porto route. In 2013, the number of train journeys increased by around 5% as compared to 2012. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 103 Main activities relating to initiatives to reduce GG emissions, particularly SF6 in 2013: 1) Preventive and improvement maintenance on circuit breakers containing SF6: In 2013, a series of FL 170 circuit breakers manufactured by Efacec were reconditioned. These circuit breakers were responsible for the majority of SF6 leaks. Reconditioning of circuit breakers includes a series of operations which seek to repair seals thus minimizing the occurrence of SF6 leaks. This increases reliability while also mitigating environmental impact. 2) Corrective maintenance by repairing leaks in three circuit breakers in operation and replacing two 60 kV circuit breaker blocks. 3) Deactivation of a series of SF6 circuit breakers replaced as part of remodelling work in accordance with technical procedures relating to endof-working-life. All operating, assembly, maintenance and deactivation work is carried out by specialized REN teams. Team members are qualified in accordance with legislation. 4) D evelopment and implementation of a pilot-project for the continuous monitoring of SF6 in armoured substation buildings (GIS): REN has always taken the security of personnel accessing GIS rooms after a leak alarm has been triggered very seriously. Although SF6 is not toxic, this gas fills breathable air space and thus presents a potential choking hazard, with serious consequences for any person involved. In order to overcome this danger, a system has been implemented which continuously monitors SF6 in GIS buildings. In 2011, contact was made with a technology startup connected to the University of Coimbra cluster. The company is called Eneida and a partnership was established to develop a system to continuously monitor rooms and galleries. Backed by REN, this company designed a pilot-project for installation in the 60 kV sector of the Ermesinde substation. The system continuously monitors for the presence of SF6 inside the substation, and should the gas be detected, visual and audible alarms are triggered at the main entrances of the affected area. A ventilation system is also activated to remove the gas from inside the substation. This is an innovative project developed by Eneida, the only company in the last four years of researching the market showed the interest and technical capability to develop this solution. As far as known, this is the first installation of an SF6 persona safety monitoring system in Portugal. Managing CO2 emissions from plants with EACS Within the scope of its regulated activity as a Commercial Agent, REN Trading is a company that plays an active role in the area of climate change, in that it is responsible for the management of plants which maintain Energy Acquisition Contracts (EAC), viz. Tejo Energia and Turbogás, which is conditioned by the rules of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). EU ETS legislation can be found in Decree-Law No 233/2004 of 14 December 2004, and later legislation which came about further to the transposition of Community Directive No 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003. For the post 2012 period, the legislative framework was amended by Directive No 2009/29/EC. In 2013, the third stage of EU ETS (2013-2020) will be started. As of this year, the electricity sector ceased to have free allocation and emission licenses equivalent to emissions seen in each year must be purchased in auction or on the secondary market. 104 SUSTainability AT REN This situation is the result of an international negotiation process which culminated in 1997 in the signing of an international treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, signed by Portugal as a member of the EU. The aim is to mitigate climate change and global warming by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. As of 2005, EU ETS has been the tool used in the UE to comply with the aims of Kyoto. Through the allocation of a price on CO2, the goal is to reduce the emissions of the main industrial facilities and covers sectors such as the production of electricity from fossil fuels, steel making, ceramics, petrol refineries and aviation (from 2012) among others. With the aim of minimizing annual expenditure on emission licenses and also total charges borne by consumers acquiring electrical power, and in full compliance with regulations published by ERSE in 2013, REN Trading acted on the market as a member of ICE (Intercontinental Exchange), the main emission license futures and derivatives market. It is REN Trading’s responsibility, in the third stage of EU ETS, to purchase CO2 emission licenses in line with the environmental requirements of the two plants, which will mean buying EUA (European unit allowance) licenses. The decision taken by REN Trading with regard to the sale of production from these plants, has always taken into account forecast emissions and the associated cost, measured through the market price for CO2emission licenses. In order to explain further, in certain circumstances the incorporation of CO2 costs into total production costs for the Pego plant (coal fired, a more polluting fuel) could alter its position in the order of merit of supply in the electricity market, making it more expensive. This would therefore require it to be replaced with a less polluting alternative such as Turbogas (natural gas fired). In essence, through this mechanism created by EU ETS, the operation of the Iberian electricity market is affected and the influence of this European mechanism on the emissions of plants and the country’s electrical power programme can be seen. In 2013, an increase in activity was seen in relation to the previous year. REN Trading purchased around 2.9 million tons of CO2 on the futures market. This increase in activity was the direct result of changes in the allocation of emissions licenses as mentioned above. Due to the adverse economic situation seen in Europe, an excess of emissions licenses was created, contributing to significant drops in market prices (around 40% between the average price in 2013 compared to 2012). In order to correct this effect, at the end of 2013, a Europe wide agreement was obtained to withdraw emissions licenses from the start of the third stage of EU ETS and their total or partial reintroduction at the end of the third stage (backloading). Thus reducing supply temporarily or permanently. It is hoped that this reduction can provided support for the market price and strengthen the good working of EU ETS, helping create an economic sign which impacts on production and investment decisions, also helping achieve the goal of a society which is less carbon intensive. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 105 Issuing entity for guarantees and certificates of origin With the publication of Decree-Law No 23/2010 of 25 March 2010 which adapts the system for cogeneration activities in Portugal establishing the respective legal and remuneratory system, the rules for issuing guarantees and certificates of origin for electricity produced by means of cogeneration are also defined. Furthermore, the competences regarding the Issuing Entity for Guarantees of Cogeneration Origin (in Portuguese EEGO) are attributed to the RNT concessionaire. During 2013, with the publication of Decree-Law No 39/2013 of 18 March 2013, REN’s competences were extended with regard to EEGO, to the production of electricity and energy for heating and cooling through renewable energy sources, namely: a) Implementation and management of a system of guarantees of origin for the electricity produced from renewable energy sources, covering the electronic registration, issue, transfer, annulment and cancellation of the respective supporting documentation; b) C  onducting audits, either directly or through external auditors and monitoring plants and equipment for producing from renewable energy sources, as well as energy measuring equipment, which enable and ensure the correct qualification of the plants and the guarantee or certification of the origin of electricity and energy for heating and cooling produced; C) Making available for public consultation, namely by means of a website, non confidential and relevant information regarding the issue of guarantees and certificates of origin. EEGO started operations in October 2012, and already has 143 cogeneration DURING 2013, FURTHER facilities registered, 40 of which have passed to the remuneratory scheme set TO THE COMPETENCES out in Decree-Law No 23/2010. In this period, 412 549 guarantees of origin were issued for the production of high efficiency cogeneration electrical power and 13 attributed within 013 certificates of origin were issued for the production of efficient cogeneration the scope of EEGO, electrical power. Every guarantee or certificate of origin corresponds to a face value of 1 MWh. REN conducted During 2013, further to the competences attributed within the scope of EEGO, 11 audits on REN conducted 11 audits on cogeneration plants cogeneration plants Intensive energy consumption With regard to measures to rationalize energy consumption implemented within the scope of SGCIE, during 2013 at REN Atlântico – LNG Terminal, it is important to note the following. In June 2013, the implementation and progress report for 2011 – 2012 was issued. In a similar manner to that seen in 2012, 2013 saw long periods of reduced NG flow and even total stoppages (zero issue) of the NG transmission network. This was mainly due to the following factors: • Significant drop in the consumption of NG for the electricity market due to the increase in production of renewable power (hydro and wind) and also as a result of the fall in competitiveness of NG with regard to other sources of energy, such as coal • High price of LNG over NG from the pipeline, a situation still relating to the Japanese energy crisis stated by the tsunami in March 2011 106 SUSTainability AT REN This situation prevented compliance with the main recommendation in the implementation and progress report for 2011-2012, which stipulated precisely an increase in the use of the facility (minimum issue of 174 000 m3(n)/h), so as to improve the plant’s energy efficiency. Even so, REN Atlântico’s commitment has been reaffirmed to continue to attempt to achieve this goal in liaison with the system’s technical manager. Should the limitations seen in 2013 be overcome, considerable improvement in energy efficiency could be seen. Measures to rationalize energy consumption were concluded in December 2013. Results are not as yet available. Only during 2014, will it be possible to present results.

Despite the constant concern with protecting and promoting biodiversity, a small percentage of REN’s infrastructure is integrated into sensitive areas in the national territory: sites that are part of the Natura 2000 Network, Special Protection Zones and other protected areas, including national parks, reserves, parks and natural monuments. 12 www.ren.pt/sustainability/environment/biodiversity_and_managing_ecosystems/ ANNUAL REPORT 2013 107 Occupation % of total Area/length in sensitive areas occupation Stations/facilities 0.37 km2 10% Extension of gas pipelines/ lines 1 202 km 12 % The occupation of these areas by REN infrastructure is essentially due to historical reasons (the integration of infrastructure was prior to the classification of these protected areas) as well as the need to enable or reinforce the channelling of renewable energy from production centres situated in these sensitive areas. Whenever these facilities are modified, such as changes in the paths of lines and gas pipelines, such changes are optimised so as to reduce the impact on biodiversity. Currently, the sites where the infrastructure of the National Transmission Network (RNT) is located are potentially the habitat for classified species on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation Nature (IUCN), in the following categories: ‘11 ‘12 ‘13 1 IUCN classification Critically threatened 3 6 4 threatened 4 4 6 Vulnerable 17 24 19 1 Includes the survey of the species that potentially exist in habitats affected by construction work underway for the Mangualde-Celorico-Guarda gas pipeline. Information on compensatory measures developed during 2013 may be consulted on the REN website13. 4.3.2.6 Flora and soil use As a result of its construction and maintenance activities, REN has a direct impact on flora and soil use. This impact occurs, for example, at the time when the line THROUGH ITS protection corridors associated with REN’s infrastructure (electricity lines and gas pipelines) are created or maintained. As a way of offsetting this impact, since REFORESTATION 2007 REN has been carrying out diverse tree planting projects within the scope of building its new facilities and in 2013, extended this methodology to lines PROGRAMME already in operation. of easements, While constructing the Mangualde-Celorico-Guarda gas pipeline REN REN has already implemented a reforestation project covering an area of 25 hectares in the Serra da Estrela forest. This measure was designed to offset the felling of holm oak planted more than and other trees. The planting of new trees far exceeds the areas affected by the 420 000 trees in construction of the gas pipeline and that required by law. During the project, best forestry and environmental practices were followed, taking into account this recent years in an sensitive location. It is a mission which will continue for the next 22 years. area greater than Through its reforestation programme of easements, REN has already planted 600 hectares. more than 420 000 trees in recent years in an area greater than 600 hectares. 13 www.ren.pt 108 SUSTainability AT REN In 2013, in addition to the project associated to the Mangualde-Celorico-Guarda gas pipeline, a total de 130 000 trees were planted in an area of more than 200 hectares, with the following infrastructures being of special note: Number Infrastructure area (ha) of trees Lares-Paraimo line 85 40 058 Macedo de Cavaleiros-Valpaços line 13 10 809 Vila Nova-Riba d’Ave line (double 150/400kV) 23 19 559 Pamela-Sines 3 line for Fanhões SS 39 32 399 Batalha-Paraimo line (operational) 21 9 168 During 2013, numerous actions were carried out for the future integrated management of vegetation on the REN Eléctrica and REN Gasodutos easements. As part of this strategy, a collaboration protocol was established with the environmental group Quercus with the aim of associating the REN reforesting programme with the Quercus Common Forest programme. Most of the native species of trees and shrubs which the Common Forest programme is seeking to promote are compatible with the safe operation of our infrastructures. This compatibility is not only in technical terms but also with regard to responsibilities required by law to defend forests against fires, bearing in mind that most of our infrastructures are located in such forests. REN is therefore facing the considerable challenge of fomenting the use of such species and best practices of sustainable forest management by land owners. The aim is to demonstrate how to obtain earnings while also creating value for everyone involved: the land owners who can earn income of land which was previously abandoned; Quercus, as it promotes the use of practices which contribute to biodiversity and producing ecosystem services; REN, as we are convinced that in time we will save resources in the management of easement vegetation and society in general, both through ecosystem services and the defence of the forest against fires. The reforesting programme or the conversion of easements is one of those examples where the usual approach is reversed. In the past, money would be spent on cutting tress and managing the wood from easements. Now we apply part of this money to changing land use or occupancy by planting trees and shrubs which are compatible with the operation of our infrastructures. Our goal is to eliminate the passive approach and instead implement a more active approach to vegetation management so as to reduce maintenance costs by increasing the time between intervention cycles and dividing responsibilities with land owners. 4.3.2.7 Birdlife Compensatory measures A very important area for REN is the implementation of compensatory measures, derived from the process of the Environmental Impact Assessment for new infrastructure. The measures underway and the main results can be consulted on REN’s website14. 14 www.ren.pt/sustainability/environment/environmental_performance/compensatory_measures/ ANNUAL REPORT 2013 109 Compatibility between REN’s infrastructures and the white stork population For more than ten years REN has monitored the nesting patterns of the white stork population in its infrastructure, creating nesting conditions for this bird in favourable habitats and installing devices that minimise the risk of accidents with an electrical origin.

(“Enondas” or “the Operator”), a wholly owned subsidiary of REN, under the terms of item 3, article 5 of Decree-Laws 5/2008 of 8 January and 238/2008 of 15 December, to operate a pilot area to produce electricity from ocean waves. 126 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS In accordance with Decree-Law 238/2008 of 15 December the concession has a period of 45 years and includes authorization to install the infrastructures to connect to the public electricity network and utilization of the public hydro resources, and monitoring of the use by third parties of the water resources necessary to produce electricity from waves, as well as competency to grant licences for the establishment and operation of the production of electric energy and related monitoring. In accordance with the concession contract and applicable legislation, REN will have the right to an adequate remuneration from the concession through recognition of the costs of the investment, operation and maintenance, provided that they are approved in advance by the Government member responsible for the energy area, after the binding opinion of ERSE. Amendments to concession contracts On February 21, 2012, the following amendments to the concession agreements in effect between the Portuguese State and the Group companies were signed, namely: i) the concession of transport activity of electricity through the National Network of Transport of Electricity signed with REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional, S.A.; ii) the concession of transport activity of natural gas through the National Network of Natural Gas Transportation, signed with REN Gasodutos, S.A.; iii) the concession activity of reception, storage and regasification of liquefied natural gas to the terminal in Sines, signed with REN Atlântico, terminal GNL, S.A.; and iv) the concession of the activity of underground storage of natural, signed with REN Armazenagem, S.A.. These concession contracts were amended with the main purposes of: i) detailing the functions of the operators of the national networks of electricity and natural gas transportation; ii) develop arrangements for monitoring and supervising the activities of dealers by the Portuguese State and iii) specify the terms applicable to provide information by each of the dealers, adapting the respective contractual clauses to the legal provisions and regulations in force, in particular Decree-Law no. No. 77/2011 and n. No. 78/2011, both of 20 June. 3 The main accounting policies used by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described below. The policies have been MAIN applied consistently in the periods presented. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 3.1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION The consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, as from the books and accounting records of the companies included in the consolidation (Note 6), maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Portugal, adjusted in the consolidation process so that the consolidated financial statements be in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union (“IAS/IFRS”), in force for the years starting on 1 January 2013. Such standards includes the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), International Accounting Standards (IAS), issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee (“IASC”) and respective SIC and IFRIC interpretations, issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) and ANNUAL REPORT 2013 127 Standard Interpretation Committee (“SIC”), that have been endorsed by the European Union. The standards and interpretations are hereinafter referred generically to as IFRS. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements in the process of adopting REN’s accounting policies, with a significant impact on the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities as well as expenses and income for the reporting period. Although the estimates are based in the best experience of the Board of Directors and their best expectations in relation to current and future events and actions, the current and future results may differ from the estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas in which the assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 5. The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of Euros tEuros. These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors at a meeting held on 6 March 2014. The Board of Directors understands that the consolidated financial statements fairly present the financial position of the companies included in the consolidation, the consolidated results of their operations, their consolidated comprehensive income, the consolidated changes in their equity and their consolidated cash flows in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union (“IFRS”). Adoption of new standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions The following standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions endorsed by the European Union are of mandatory application for the financial year ended 31 December 2013: • IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” (amendment) (to be applied for years beginning on or after 1 January 2013) – This amendment includes the following: (i) the items that comprise the Other Comprehensive Income and that in the future will be recognized in the income statement should be presented separately; and (ii) the Statement of Comprehensive Income should be designated Statement of Profit and Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. The presentation of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income has been amended in accordance with the new wording of IAS 1, including the comparative period. The retrospective application of this amendment had no impact on the level of comprehensive income. • IFRIC 20 “Stripping Cost in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine” (new) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2013) – This interpretation provides guidance on how and when to recognize certain stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine. This change did not result in any impact on the consolidated financial statements of REN. • IAS 12 “Income Taxes” (amendment) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2013) – This change introduces a presumption that investment properties at fair value in accordance to IAS 40 are recovered 128 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS entirely through sale, unless the entity has clear evidence that recovery will occur in another manner. This change did not result in any impact on the consolidated financial statements of REN. • IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurements” (new) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2013) – This standard sets out a single IFRS framework for measuring fair value and provides comprehensive guidance on how to measure the fair value of both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. IFRS 13 applies when another IFRS requires or permits fair value measurement or disclosures about fair value measurements, thus it does not set out requirements on “when to” apply fair value measurement. From the adoption of this standard did not result significant impacts on the consolidated financial statements. • IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures (amendment) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2013) This change introduced a series of additional disclosures for financial instruments, namely, information regarding those subject to similar compensation agreements. From the adoption of this amendment did not result significant impacts on REN´s consolidated financial statements. • IFRS 1 “First Time Adoption of IFRSs” (amendment) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2013) – IFRS 1 was subject to two changes: (i) exemption for entities that are operating in a hyper inflationary economy and adopting for the first time IFRS, allowing the use of fair value as cost considered on the items of the opening financial statement under IFRS. Additionally there is a change in the reference date for transition; and (ii) creates an exception to the retrospective application of resources defined in IAS 20 for application to government loans at below market interest rates. From this amendment no impacts on REN´s consolidated financial statements occurred. • Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards (cycle 2009-2011) (amendment) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2013) Improvements that are intended to clarify and simplify the implementation of international standards are introduced cyclically. Specifically for the current year changes were made, namely in IAS 1 (comparative information), IAS 16 (service equipment), IAS 32 (tax effect of the distribution of equity instruments), IAS 34 (segment information) and IFRS 1 (repeated application of the standard). From this change no significant impacts on the consolidated financial statements of REN occurred. • IAS 19 “Post-Employment Benefits” (amendment) (to be applied for years beginning on or after 1 January 2013) – This amendment introduces some changes related with defined benefits plans, namely: (i) actuarial gains and losses are totally recorded in reserves (eliminate the corridor method); (ii) only one interest rate is applied for the determination of the defined benefit obligation and to the plan assets. The difference between the actual return on plan assets and the unique interest rate is regarded as an actuarial gain/ loss; (iii) expenses recorded in the profit and loss statement correspond only to the service cost and to the net interest costs; and (iv) introduction of new disclosure requirements. The retrospective application of the amendments to IAS 19 in the year 2012, resulted in an increase in the captions “Personnel costs” in the consolidated income statement and the caption “Retained earnings” in the amount of 331 thousand Euros. This impact refers to the application of a single interest rate to the obligations and assets of the plan. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 129 The following standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions have been endorsed by the European Union with mandatory application in future economic exercises: • IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” (new) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2014) This standard establishes the grounds for presenting consolidated financial statements, replacing on these matters IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC 12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. This standard introduces as well new rules for determining control and consolidation perimeter. From the future adoption of this standard it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. • IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” (new) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2014) This standard supersedes IAS 31 and SIC 13 – Jointly Controlled Entities and mainly address: (i) the definition of “jointly arrangements” empathizing the rights and obligations instead of its legal form; (ii) reduces the types of jointly agreements prevailing the following: “joint operations” and “joint ventures”; and (iii) eliminates the possibility of using the proportional consolidation model for “joint ventures”. From the future adoption of this standard it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. • IFRS 12 “Disclosure of interests in other entities” (new) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2014) This standard provides expanded disclosures requirements relating to entity’s interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements. From the future adoption of this standard it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. • IAS 27 “Separate financial statements” (amendement) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2014) This amendment was reviewed following the emission of IFRS 10, and contains the recording principles and disclosures for investments in associates in the separate financial statements. From the future adoption of this change it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. • IAS 28 “Investments in associates and joint ventures” (amendement) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2014) IAS 28 was reviewed following the issue of IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 and provides guidance on accounting for interests in associates and joint ventures in accordance with equity method. From the future adoption of this change it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. • IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ (amended) (to be applied to years beginning on or after 1 January 2014). This amendment clarifies the requirements that could allow an Entity to compensate financial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position. From the future adoption of this change it is not expected a significant impact on REN´s consolidated financial statements. • IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 (amendment) (to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014) Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 to clarify the rules of the transition to those standards. The future adoption of these standards is not expected to have significant impacts on the consolidated financial statements of REN. • IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 (amendment) (to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014) Amendment to IFRS 10 clarifies, on one hand, the business model of investment entities (“Investment Entities”) and, on the other hand, requires that its subsidiaries are measured at fair 130 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS value through profit or loss, thereby creating an exception to the application of consolidation procedures. Consequently, IAS 27 and IFRS 12 standards are changed accordingly, being eliminated the option to measure at cost or fair value (established in IAS 27) and created a set of specific disclosures for investment entities (through IFRS 12 ). • IAS 36 “Impairment of assets” (amendment) (to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014) This amendment eliminates the disclosure requirements of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit with goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to periods when it was not recorded any impairment loss or reversal of impairment. Introduces additional disclosure requirements for assets for which it was recorded an impairment loss or reversal of impairment and the recoverable amount of these aids has determined based on fair value less costs to sell. From the future adoption of this standard is not expected significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of REN. • IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement“ (amendment) (to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014) This amendment will allow, under certain circumstances, the continuation of hedge accounting when a derivative designated as a hedging instrument is modified. From the future adoption of this standard is not expected significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of REN. The Company did not use any early adoption option of any of the above standards in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013. The following standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions, with mandatory application in future years, were not, until the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, been endorsed by the European Union: Applicable for financial years beginning on or Standard after Resume This standard sets out requirements for the classification and IFRS 9 Financial instruments (2009) n/a mensuration of financial instruments. These improvements involve the revision of several standards, Annual improvements to IFRS (2010 2012 cycle) Several (01-Jul-14) including IAS 16, IFRS 3 and IFRS 8. These improvements involve the revision of several standards, Annual improvements to IFRS (2011 2013 cycle) Several (01-Jul-14) including IAS 40, IFRS 1 and IFRS 13. Provides guidance on when to recognise a liability for a levy imposed by a government, both for levies that are accounted for IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’ 1-Jan-14 in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and those where the timing and amount of the levy is certain. This amendment clarifies the circumstances on which employee IAS 19 Employee benefits (Defined benefit plans: employee 1-Jul-14 contribution plans for post-employment benefits are a reduction in contributions) the cost of short-term benefits. These standards and interpretations issued by the IASB, were not yet endorsed by the European Union and consequently REN has not adopted them on the 31 December 2013 consolidated financial statements. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 131 3.2 CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES The consolidation methods used by the Group are as follows: a) Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which REN has the power to govern their financial and operating policies generally associated with direct or indirect control of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are excluded from the consolidation as from the date that control ceases. The net income of the subsidiaries acquired or sold during the period is included in the consolidated financial statement from the date of acquisition or until the date it has been sold. Subsidiaries are included in the accompanying financial statements in accordance with the full consolidation method. Equity and net profit for the year corresponding to third party participation in subsidiaries are reflected separately in the consolidated statement of financial position and income statement in the caption “Non-controlling interests”. The comprehensive income is attributable to the company’s shareholders and to the non-controlling interests, even if that results in a negative balance of the noncontrolling interests. Whenever necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries for them to be consistent with Group’s accounting policies. Transactions (including unrealized gains and losses on sales between Group companies), balances and dividends distributed between Group companies are eliminated in the consolidation process. The entities that qualify as subsidiaries are listed in Note 6. b) Investments in associates and joint-ventures Associates Investments in associates (companies in which the Group has significant influence but does not have control or joint control through participation in the company’s financial and operating decisions, normally where it holds between 20% to 50% of the share capital) are recorded in accordance with the equity method. In accordance with the equity method investments are recorded at cost and subsequently, adjusted by the Group’s share of the investee’s post acquisition changes in net equity (including net result) of the associated company by corresponding entry to the income statement. Additionally, dividends received are recorded as a decrease on the carrying amount of the associate, and proportional portion in the equity variations is recorded as a variation in the Groups equity. The excess of cost in relation to the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the associated company at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill and included in the value of the investment. If the difference between cost and fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is negative, it is recognised as a gain in the period. 132 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS Valuations are made of investments in associates when there are facts that might indicate that the participation is impaired, being recorded an impairment losses in the income statement, if exists. When the Group’s share of the accumulated losses on an Associate exceeds the book value of the participation, the participation is recorded at zero, except where the Group has assumed commitments to cover losses of the Associate, in which case the Group recognise a liability. If subsequently, the associate reports profits, the Group records its share in the profits only after its profits share be equal to the portion of non-recognized losses. Unrealised gains and losses on transactions with associates are eliminated in proportion to the Group’s interest in the associate, by corresponding entry to the investment in the associate. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, only if the loss doesn´t result from the transferred asset being impaired. The interests in associates are detailed in Note 10. Joint ventures Investments in joint ventures are included in the consolidated financial statements by the equity method. The Group’s share of the earnings or losses of the joint venture is recognized in the income statement as operating income and the share of movements in reserves of the joint venture, if any, is recognized in reserves. The unrealized gains and losses on transactions with jointly controlled entities are eliminated in proportion to the Group’s interest in the jointly controlled company, against the investment in the entity. The accounting policies of joint ventures are standardized, when necessary, to ensure that they are consistently applied in the consolidated financial statements. Investments in joint ventures are detailed in Note 10. Associates with no significant influence Investments in associates (companies in which the Group does not have significant influence or control, normally where it holds less than 20% of the share capital) are recorded at cost, since the companies are not listed in any stock exchange and the fair value cannot be measured with reliability. The investments in associates are classified as assets available-for-sale in accordance with IAS 39, being presented as non-current assets when considered strategic to the Group. Associates with no significant influence are presented in Note 13. c) Goodwill Differences between the cost of acquisition of investments in subsidiaries and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of these companies as of the date of the acquisition or during a period of 12 months after that date, if positive, are recorded as goodwill (in the case of subsidiaries). If this difference is negative, they are immediately recorded in the consolidated profit and loss statement. Goodwill generated on acquisitions after 1 January 2004 (date of transition to IFRS) is not amortised, but is subject to impairment tests at least annually to verify the existence of impairment losses. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 133 Goodwill impairment test is based on the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit, comparing it to the recorded amount, including the Goodwill of that unit. If this amount exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment provision is recorded immediately in the consolidated financial statements, reducing the asset value and considering a cost in the consolidated income statement which is not reversible. The recoverable amount is determined based on the use value of the cash generating unit, being this value calculated by discounting the future cash flows, considering the business risks, the temporal value as well as market conditions. 3.3 BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY Items included in the financial statements of each of the REN Group entities are recorded using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’), the Euro. The consolidated financial statements including these notes are presented in thousands of Euros, unless otherwise indicated, the Group’s functional currency. Foreign currency transactions are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from translation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the year-end exchange rates are recognised as financial costs in the statement of profit and loss if relating to borrowings and in other operating income and costs in the case of all the other balances/ transactions. The foreign currency exchange rates used for the translation of the foreign currency balances are as follows: Currency ‘13 ‘12 US Dollar (USD) 1.38 1.32 Swiss franc (CHF) 1.23 1.21 Pound sterling (GBP) 0.83 0.82 Real Brazilian (BRL) 3.26 2.70 Japan (Yen-JPY) 144.72 113.61 3.4 INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated amortization / depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes the cost of assets considered as of the transition date to IFRS and the acquisition or construction cost of assets acquired/constructed after that date. Acquisition or construction cost includes the purchase price of the asset and costs incurred directly to prepare the asset to start operating. Borrowing costs incurred during the construction phase are recognised as acquisition/ construction costs. Financial expenses incurred during the construction period with loans obtained are recorded as a component of the acquisition/ 134 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS construction cost of the asset, being amortized over the useful life period of the correspondent asset. Subsequent costs, including renewals and major overhauls, that extend the useful life of the assets is recognised as cost of the asset, after write off of the component replaced. Current maintenance and repair costs are expensed in the year they are incurred. The fixed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated period of useful life of the assets, from the moment they are available for use in the necessary conditions to operate in accordance with management objectives. Whenever there are impairment indicators of fixed assets, impairment tests are made to estimate the recoverable amount of the asset and impairment losses, if any, are recorded. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher amount between the net sale price of an asset and its value in use. The value in use is calculated based on a discounted future cash flows resulting from continued use of the asset and its sale at the end of its useful life. The useful life of the assets are reviewed at the end of each year so that the depreciation or amortization recorded is in accordance with the consumption standards of the assets. Changes in useful life are treated as changes in accounting estimates and are applied prospectively. Gains and losses on the sale of intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment are determined by the difference between the sale amount and the carrying amount of the asset, being recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Concession/Regulated Assets – IFRIC 12 – Service Concession Arrangements The Group has: (i) four concessions for the operations and development of the National Transmission Network, for the global management of the national electric system, as well as utilization and development of the National Natural Gas Transport Network, of the Liquid Natural Gas terminal, the underground storage of natural gas and global management of the natural gas system and (ii) a concession to explore a pilot zone for the electricity production from ocean waves. The assets acquired / constructed by REN under these concession contracts are referred to below as assets relating to the concession. IFRIC 12 – Service Concession Arrangements was issued by the IASB in November 2006, for application in years starting on or after 1 January 2008. IFRIC 12 was endorsed by the European Union on 25 March 2009, being of mandatory application for years beginning on or after 1 January 2010. IFRIC 12 applies to public service concession contracts in which the conceding entity controls/regulates: • The services to be rendered by the operator (through utilization of the infrastructure), to whom and at what price; and • Any residual interest over the infrastructure at the end of the contract. IFRIC 12 applies to infrastructures: • constructed or acquired by the operator from third parties; • already existing to which the operator is given access. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 135 Therefore, considering the above the REN Group’s concessions are covered by this IFRIC for the following reasons: (i) the REN Group companies ( REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional, S.A., REN Gasodutos, S.A., REN Armazenagem, S.A., REN Atlântico, Terminal de GNL, S.A. and Enondas, Energia das Ondas, S.A.) have a public service concession contract signed with the Portuguese State (“Conceding Entity”) for a predefined period; (ii) the companies render public transport services, reception and storage of gas and transmission of electricity through utilization of gas pipelines, branches and underground tanks, in the case of gas, and lines, stations and substations in the case of electricity; (iii) the conceding entity controls the services rendered and the conditions under which they are rendered, through the regulator ERSE; and (iv) t he assets used to render the services revert to the conceding entity at the end of the concession contracts. This interpretation establishes the general principles for the recognition and measurement of the rights and obligations under the concession contracts with the features mentioned earlier and define the following models: (i) F inancial asset model – when the operator has the unconditional contractual right to receive cash or other financial asset from the conceding entity, corresponding to specific or determinable amounts, the operator must record a financial asset (receivable). In this model the conceding entity has few or no discretionary power to avoid the payment, as the agreement is usually legally binding. (ii) Intangible asset model – when the operator receives from the conceding entity the right to collect a tariff based on use of the structure, it must record an intangible asset. (iii) Bifurcated/mixed model – this model applies when the concession includes simultaneously commitments of guaranteed remuneration by the conceding entity and commitments of remuneration dependent on the level of utilization of the concession infrastructures. Considering the nature of concession of the REN Group, as regards the legal nature of its concessions, REN decided that the best model for its business case is the intangible model due essentially to the risk of changes in the tariff regulation imposed by the regulator ERSE. In this respect and in relation to the residual value of the assets relating to the concession (in accordance with the concession contracts, REN has the right to be reimbursed at the end of the concession contract for the net book value of the conceded assets), they were also considered as part of the intangible assets. The residual value of the conceded assets was not significant as of 31 December 2013. Attending to the above, concession assets (intangible assets) are valuated at its acquisition cost or production cost which include financial costs incurred during the construction period. The revaluations that were recorded in the concessions assets on the date of transition to IFRS are part of its cost. For amortization purposes of the concession assets, REN Group follows IAS 38 – Intangible assets, that states in paragraph 98 that: “ A variety of amortization methods can be used to allocate the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life. These methods include the straight-line method and production unit method. The method used is selected based on the expected consumption model of future economic benefits included in the asset and is applied consistently from period to period, unless there is a 136 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS change in the expected consumption model of these future economic benefits”. Therefore considering this, REN understands that the amortization method that best reflects the expected standard of consumption of future benefits of this asset is amortization based on the rate of amortization of the gas and electricity infrastructures approved by the regulator ERSE, as this is the basis of its annual income, that is the conceded assets are amortized based on the remuneration model underlying the Tariff Regulations. Therefore, in accordance with IFRIC 12 the right granted under the concession contract consists of the possibility of REN charging tariffs based on the costs incurred with the infrastructures. However, considering the methodology for determining REN’s tariffs, the remuneration base is determined considering each concession asset, specifically, which implies the need to componentize the right. Consequently, in the case of REN’s concessions it is considered that the right is componentized by separate parts as the various remuneration bases are established. Therefore the intangible asset is: (i) increased as the various projects relating to the concession are concluded (increase in the concession rights), being recorded based on cost; and (ii) decreased as the future economic benefits are consumed. In accordance with IFRIC 12 construction of the infrastructure by the operator is a service that it provides to the conceding entity, distinct from the operation and maintenance service and, as such, will be remunerated by it. However, in applying IFRIC 12 the REN Group assumes that there is no margin in the construction but only in the operation business. Nevertheless, construction costs and income relating to construction are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the year, considering the requirements of IFRIC 12 in the captions “revenue from construction of concession assets” and “costs with construction of concession assets”. The REN Group makes impairment tests of the assets relating to the concessions whenever events or circumstances indicate that book value exceeds its recoverable amount, being that difference, if any, recorded in the statement of profit and loss. The cash generating units defined for the purpose are directly associated with each concession contract, considering that the conceded assets relating to them belong to the same cash generating unit. Lands relating to the electricity producing plants are covered by the Concession Contracts entered into between REN and the Portuguese State and are remunerated based on its amortization, not being disassociated, as such from the other assets of the concession, being an integral part of a common cash generating unit. Investment grants relating to assets are recognized in the statement of profit and loss at the same rate as amortization of the assets. IAS 20 in paragraphs 24 and 25 states that: “Government grants relating to assets, including non-monetary grants at fair value must be presented in the statement of financial position considering the grant as deferred income or deducting the grant to the cost of the asset”. Therefore given the existence of these two alternatives for the presentation of grants in the financial statements and IFRIC 12 not mentioning the treatment of investment grants received, REN maintained the grants recorded as liabilities. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 137 Considering this, and as a result of applying IFRIC 12, the REN Group classifies assets relating to the concessions in accordance with the intangible asset model, being amortized on a straight line basis as from the date in which they become available for use in accordance with the expected consumption of future benefits model, which corresponds to the regulatory period defined by ERSE and considering that at the end of the concession the Group has the right to receive the net book value of the assets. Intangible assets in progress reflect the concession’s assets still under construction, being recorded at cost less any impairment losses, being amortized as from the time the investment projects are completed or available for use. 3.5 LEASES Classifying a lease as finance or an operating lease depends upon the substance of transaction rather than the legal form of the lease arrangement. Leases, in which REN has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, are classified as finance leases. Agreements in which an analysis of one or more of the conditions of the contract point a finance lease are also classified as such. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Finance lease contracts are initially recognized at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets or the present value of the minimum lease payments, determined at the inception date. The lease liability is recognized net of interest costs in the caption Borrowings. Interest costs included in the lease payments and depreciation of the leased assets are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period they refer to. The assets acquired under finance lease contracts, are depreciated by the lower period between the useful life period of the asset and the maturity of the lease contract, when the company don`t have a purchase option on the maturity date, or by the useful life period estimated, when the Company has the commitment to acquire the asset by the end period of the contract. In operating lease contracts, the lease payments due are recognized as expenses in the statement of profit and loss, on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 3.6 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Financial Assets The Board of Directors determines the classification of financial assets at the time of initial recognition, in accordance with the purpose for which the financial assets are acquired. Financial assets may be classified under the following categories: a) fi  nancial assets at fair value through profit or loss – includes non-derivative financial assets held for short-term trading and assets designated at fair value through profit and loss at the inception date; b) loans granted and receivables – includes non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not listed in an active market; 138 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS c) investments held to maturity – includes non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities, that the entity intends and has the capacity to hold until the maturity date; and d) a  vailable-for-sale financial assets – includes non-derivative financial assets designated as available-for-sale at the inception date or other financial assets not classified in any of the other financial asset categories. Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised as non-current assets unless management intends to sell them within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Purchases and sales of investments in financial assets are recognized on the transaction date – the date on which REN commits itself to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Such assets are subsequently adjusted to fair value, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value being recognised in the statement of profit and loss caption “Financial costs” for the period in which they arise, which also includes interest income and dividends received. Available-for-sale assets are initially recognised at fair value including transaction costs. In subsequent periods these assets are adjusted to fair value, the changes in fair value being recognised in a fair value reserve within Equity until the investment be sold or received or until the fair value of the investment be below the acquisition cost on a longstanding perspective, situations on which the loss is recorded in the statement of profit and loss. Dividends and interest income from available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss caption financial income for the period in which the right to receive them is established. The fair value of listed investments is based on current market prices (“bid”). If the market for a financial asset is not active, REN establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent transactions, provided that they are at market prices, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis when information is available, making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. In the situations where the investments are equity instruments not valued under active market quotations, and for which is not possible to estimate with reliability its fair value, these investments are measured at the acquisition cost deducted of impairments losses, if any, being the impairment losses recorded in the profit and loss statement of the year. Financial assets held to maturity are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Loans and receivables are classified as “Trade and other receivables” in the statement of financial position, are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of the transactions that gave rise to the receivables, which are recorded in statement of profit and loss in caption “Impairment of trade receivables”. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 139 Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire or are transferred, as well as all the risks and rewards of ownership. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, bank deposits, other shortterm highly liquid investments with initial maturities of up to three months, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are presented in the “Borrowings” caption in current liabilities in the statement of financial position, and are included in the consolidated statement of cash flows, as cash and cash equivalents. Financial Liabilities A financial instrument is classified as a financial liability when a contractual obligations exists to the issuer to liquidate capital and/or interests, by the delivery of cash or other financial asset, independently on its legal form. IAS 39 establishes the classification of financial liabilities in two categories: i) financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss; ii) other financial liabilities. The caption other financial liabilities includes “Borrowings” and “Trade and other payables”. Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost, the difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value being recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss over the term of the borrowings, using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless REN has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date, in which case they are classified as noncurrent liabilities. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the related obligations are extinguished through payment, are cancelled or expire. Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value at the date of the transaction being subsequently measured at fair value. The method of recognising fair value gains or losses depends on the designation made of the derivative financial instruments. If they are designated as derivative financial instruments for trading, gains or losses resulting from fair value changes are recognized in the statement of profit and loss caption “Finance income” or “Finance costs”. If they are designated as hedging derivative financial instruments, gains or losses resulting from fair value changes depends on the nature of the hedged item, which can be a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. 140 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS The fair value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to its market value. In the absence of market value, the fair value is determined by external independent entities, thought valuation techniques accept in the market. Derivative financial instruments are recognized in the caption “Derivative financial instruments”, and if they have a positive or negative fair value they are recorded as financial assets or liabilities, respectively. Derivative financial instruments are classified as non-current when their remaining period to maturity exceeds twelve months and they are not expected to be realized or settled within twelve months. Hedge accounting Within the scope of the Group risk polices of interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management, the Group contracts a series of financial derivative instruments, namely swaps. The criteria for applying hedge accounting are the following: • Adequate documentation of the hedge; • The risk to be covered is one of the risks described in IAS 39; • It is expected that the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, attributable to the risk covered, are virtually offset by changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument. At the inception of the hedge operation, the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, its risk management objectives and strategy for managing the risk. Additionally, the Group assess, at the inception of the hedge and as of the reporting date, if the derivative financial instruments designated as highly effective in the compensation of changes in the fair value or cash flows of the corresponding items hedged. The fair value of the derivative financial instruments contracted and the movements in hedge reserves are disclosed in Note 16. In the fair value hedge of an asset or liability, the book value of the asset or liability, determined based on the accounting policy used, is adjusted so as to reflect the variation of its fair value attributable to the risk hedged. Variations in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognized in the statement of profit and loss together with variations in the fair value of the assets or liabilities hedged attributable to the risk hedged. In a hedging operation of the exposure to variations of high probability in future cash flows (cash flow hedge) the effective part of the fair value variation of the hedging instrument is recognized in hedging reserves, being transferred to the statement of profit and loss in the period the item hedged affects results. The ineffective part of the hedge in recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Any amount recorded in the caption “Reserves Hedging reserve” is only reclassified to profit and loss when the hedged item affects results. When the hedged item consist in a future transaction and is not expected to occur, any amounts recorded in “Reserves Hedging reserve” is immediately reclassified into results. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 141 Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Company revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 3.7 BORROWING COSTS Financial costs related to borrowings are generally recognised as expense as incurred. Borrowing costs related directly to the acquisition, construction or production of tangible and intangible assets are capitalised as part of the cost of the qualified asset (assets that need a substantial period of time to be prepared for its envisage use). Borrowing costs are capitalised from the time of preparation of the activities to construct or develop the asset to the time the production or construction is completed or when the project is suspended. Any eventual financial income derived from a loan obtained earlier and allocable to a qualifying account, are deducted from the financial expenses that qualify for capitalisation. 3.8 GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND OTHERS These refer to grants received for investment in intangible assets and are recorded as deferred income in the caption “Trade and other payables”. Grants received from the Portuguese State and the European Union are recorded when there is reasonable certainty that the grant will be received. Operating assets delivered to REN by new producers connected to the National Transmission Network or others are also recorded as grants received. Grants are subsequently recorded to the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis in accordance with amortization of the related assets. Exploration grants are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which the related costs are incurred. 3.9 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, EXCEPT GOODWILL Financial Assets The Group evaluates at each reporting date, if there are indicators that a financial asset or a group of financial assets, have any impairment, namely from which results an adverse impact on the estimated cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, and always if it can measured reliably. For financial assets measured at amortized cost, the impairment loss to be recognized corresponds to the difference between the carrying amount and its present value on the reporting date of the new future cash flows discounted at the respective original effective interest rate. In the case of financial assets classified as “held for sale”, a significant and longstanding decrease of its fair value below the acquisition cost is considered 142 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS an indicator that the financial asset is impaired. If evidence of impairment on the financial asset held for sale exists, the accumulated loss is determined by the difference between the acquisition cost the actual fair value, less any impairment losses previously recorded is transferred from the fair value reserve in equity into profit and loss of the period. Impairment losses of equity instruments recorded in profit and loss are not reversible. Non-financial assets Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicates that the amount by which the asset is recorded may not be recovered, impairment tests are undertaken in order to determine the recoverable amount of the asset, and when necessary an impairment loss recorded. An impairment loss is considered by the excess of the carrying amount of an asset when compared with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher amount between the asset’s net selling price and value in use. The net selling price is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm’s length transaction less the costs of disposal. Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Group REN undertakes impairment tests for the concession assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, in which case the difference, if any, is recognized in the income statement. The cash generating units were identified considering the concession agreements in place, considering that all assets belonging to these agreements are to be included in the same unit. Assets with undefined useful life are not subject to amortization but are subject to annual impairment tests. Assets with useful life are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in the conditions indicate that the carrying amount may not be recovered. This way whenever fair value is below the carrying amount of the assets, the Group should evaluate if this situation will be permanent in which case an impairment loss should be recognized. If it is assessed that the situation is not permanent the reasons that support such judgment should be disclosed. Non-financial assets, except Goodwill, for which impairment losses have been recognized are reviewed at the end of each period evaluating the possibility of its reversal. Reversal of impairment losses recognized in prior years is recorded in the consolidated profit and loss statement. However, the reversal of an impairment loss is recognized to the extent it does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciations) had no impairment loss been recognized for that asset in prior years. The amortization and depreciation of the assets are recalculated prospectively in accordance with the recoverable amount adjusted by the impairment recognized. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 143 3.10 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS REN grants supplementary retirement and survivor pension (hereinafter referred to as pension plan), provides its retirees and pensioners with a medical assistance plan and grants other benefits such as long service bonuses, retirement bonus, early-retirement and death subsidy. i) REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional, S.A. pension plan The supplementary retirement and survivor pensions granted to employees consist of a defined benefit plan, with an autonomous plan assets established, to which all the liabilities are transferred and contributions are made to cover the liabilities which are vested on each period. Employees that fulfil certain predefined conditions of age and length of service and choose to take an early retirement, as well as those that agree with the Company to take pre-retirement are also included in the plans. This liabilities assumed by the Group are annually estimated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit liability is determined by discounting future payments of the benefits using the appropriate discount rate. The liability is recognised, when applicable, deducted from the past service costs. The source used to determine the annual discount rate, was based on the high quality risk bonds (Aa risk notation from Bloomberg). The credit risk notation is attributed by four rating agencies being its approach consistent with yeld curve model for each maturity group. The discount rate used results from the conversion of the interest rate curve in to a spot interest rate. The liability for retirement benefits recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position corresponds to the present value of the liability for the benefits as of the reporting date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with any adjustments for past service costs, if applicable. Actuarial gains and losses yearly determined, for each plan of benefits granted, resulting from adjustments to actuarial assumptions, experience adjustments or in the benefits scheme are recorded directly in equity. The cost with retirement benefits is determined taking into account: i) current service costs, which corresponds to the increase in the present value of the liability resulting from employee service in the current year; ii) past service cost, change in the actual responsibility for employee service in prior periods (as a result of changes to the plan or significant reduction in the number of employees covered by the plan “curtailments”); iii) any gain or loss on settlement; and iv) net interest on the liability (assets) net of defined benefit, applying a discount rate to the net liabilities of the plan. ii) REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional, S.A. health plan and other benefits The liabilities assumed relating to healthcare are not funded, being covered by a specific provision. Measurement and recognition of the liability for healthcare are the same as those for retirement supplements referred to above, except as regards assets of the plan. 144 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS REN recognises all the actuarial gains and losses on all the plans directly in equity. iii) Life Insurance Contracts The Group companies provide their employees life insurance benefits. The costs are recognized during the period in which they render services to each company. This liability is covered by a specific provision. Actuarial gains and losses determined in the year are recognized directly in equity. 3.11 PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Provisions are recognised when the Group has: i) a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; ii) it is more likely than not that an outflow of internal resources will be required to settle the obligation; and iii) the amount can be reliably estimated. When one of these criteria is not fulfilled or the existence of the liability is dependent upon the occurrence (or not) a future event, REN discloses it as a contingent liability, except if the outflow of resources to settle it is considered to be remote. Restructuring provisions are recognised by the Group when there is a formal and detailed restructuring plan and that such plan has been communicated to the involved parties. In the measurement of the restructuring provision, are only considered the expected outflows that directly result from the implementation of such plan, not considering, the current activities of the Group. Provisions are measured at the present value of the estimated outflows required to settle the liability using a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the discount period and the risk of the provision. Contingent assets are possible assets which probability of becoming certain depend of the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events that are not fully controlled by the Company. The probability of the inflow of the economic benefit is subject to the occurrence of such events. The Group discloses contingent assets when it is estimated as probable the inflow of the corresponding economic benefit. However in exceptional circumstances on which REN estimates as virtually certain the probability the revenue is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 3.12 INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Inventories include materials used in internal maintenance and repair operations. Inventories are initially recorded at cost, which includes purchase cost and all the expenses relating to their acquisition. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. Gas in the gas pipelines and gas stored in the LNG terminal and underground tanks, is property of the infrastructure users. The REN Group does not buy, sell or hold any gas inventories. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 145 3.13 CAPITAL AND OWN SHARES Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares or options are shown net of tax, as a deduction in equity from the amount issued. Own shares acquired through contract or directly on the stock market are recognised as a deduction in equity. In accordance with Portuguese Commercial law, REN SGPS must ensure at all times that there are reserves in Equity to cover the value of treasury shares, constraining the amount of reserves available for distribution. Own shares are recorded at cost if they are acquired in a spot transaction or at estimated fair value if acquired in a deferred purchase. 3.14 INCOME TAX REN is taxed based on the special regime for the taxation of group companies (“RETGS”), which includes all REN group companies located in Portugal, and which REN owns directly or indirectly at least 90% of the share capital and equally, being resident in Portugal and taxed in terms of Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”). Income tax for the year includes current income tax and deferred income tax. Income tax is recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except when it relates to items recognised directly in equity. The amount of income tax payable is determined based on net profit before tax, adjusted in accordance with tax rules for the entities included in the consolidation perimeter. The taxable profit differs from the net profit determined by accounting rules, as several costs and revenues are excluded, that will only be deducted or taxed in future periods, and costs and revenues that will never be considered for tax purposes in accordance do the tax law in place. Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method based on the statement of financial position considering the temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates in force or substantially enacted at the statement of financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be used. Deferred tax liabilities are provided for on every temporary tax difference, except those relating to: i) the initial recognition of goodwill; or ii) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in transactions that do not result from a business combination and at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. However, taxable temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries should not be recognised to the extent that: i) the parent company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and ii) it is probable that the temporary difference will not revert in the near future. 146 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 3.15 ACCRUALS BASIS Revenue and expenses are recognised in the period to which they relate, independently of the date they are received or paid, in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting. Differences between the amounts received and paid and the related income and costs are recognised as assets or liabilities, if they qualify so. 3.16 REVENUE Revenue is measured by the fair value of the benefit received or be received. Revenue is deducted by the amount from devolutions, discounts and other rebates and it does not include VAT or other taxes related to the sale. The revenue from the sale of goods is recorded when all the following conditions are met: • The significant risks and rewards related with the property were transferred to the buyer; • The Group does not maintain any control on the goods sold; • The amount of revenue can be reliably measured; • It’s probable that future economic benefits related with the transaction will flow to the Group; and • The expenses incurred or to be incurred with the transaction can be reliably estimated. Revenue from services of non-regulated activities is recognized, by the percentage of completion of the respective transaction or services at the reporting date, when all the following conditions are met: • The amount of revenue can be reliably measured; • It’s probable that future economic benefits related with the transaction will flow to the Group; •T  he expenses incurred or to be incurred with the services can be reliably estimated; and •T  he stage of completion of the transaction/service rendered can be reliably measured. The revenue from interests is recognized using the effective interest method, provided that it is probable that economic benefits flow to the Group and its amount can be reliably measured. The revenue from dividends are recognized when it is established the right of the Group to receive the correspondent amount. Revenue from services rendered on the Group regulated activities are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in accordance with the criteria defined in IFRIC 12, described in greater detail in Note 3.4 – Intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment, and in accordance the description of each business segments. Electricity segment Revenue recognition for concession activities is determined based on information of the electricity transmitted to distributors and the implicit services provided, considering the tariffs defined annually by the regulator, for transmission of electricity and global management of the system. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 147 The “Commercial Agent” activity, carried out by the group company REN Trading which is responsible for the management of the electricity produced under the two PPA’s (power purchase agreements) that have not been terminated (Tejo Energia and Turbogás), is remunerated through an incentive mechanism. To stimulate the “Commercial Agent” activity, in the beginning of 2008 ERSE established a mechanism to optimise management of the PPA’s, a mechanism to optimise the management of carbon emission licences, as well as the parameters to be in place for calculating the incentives established. Revenue obtained by use of these mechanisms, is the main part of the results obtained from the “Commercial Agent” activity. Revenue obtained from these activities is regulated by ERSE, the Portuguese electricity regulator. In accordance with the regulatory terms and conditions, the tariffs to be charged to final customers (domestic consumers, industry customers and others), are determined annually for each component of the system, such as: generation, transmission and distribution. REN – Rede Eléctrica Nacional, S.A. income relates mainly to electricity transmission and global management of the electricity system. The tariff for electricity transmission aims to recover: (i) amortization of the concession assets classified as electricity transmission equipment; (ii) a return on the average net book value of the assets relating to this activity, in accordance with the rates determined annually by the regulator; and (iii) operating costs (relating to the activity, payroll and others), less the results obtained from electricity transmission charged to third parties. The tariff for global management of the system aims to recover: (i) a mortization of the concession assets relating to global management of the system; (ii) a mortization of the concession assets relating to the generating station sites; (iii) a return on the average net book value of the generating station sites (land); (iv) a  return on the average net book value of the assets relating to this activity, in accordance with the rates determined annually by the regulator; (v) operating costs (relating to the activity, payroll and others); and (vi) operating costs of the regulator; Gas segment Revenue from gas concession operations is determined based on: i) information relating to the gas units unloaded and re-gasification of gas units in the LNG terminal, ii) the gas units injected, stored and extracted in the underground tanks; and iii) the used capacity and gas units transmitted through the high pressure transmission network. Revenue is calculated in accordance with the tariffs determined by the regulator as from 1 of July 2007. Up to 30 June 2007, revenue was determined in accordance with the transition agreements signed with Transgás the main user of the gas capacity of the gas assets owned by the REN Group. 148 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS Telecommunications segment Revenue from the telecommunications segment results from services rendered by the group company RENTELECOM, through the lease of fibre optics capacity, benefiting from the excess capacity of the telecommunications equipment installed. In this area services relating to management of private voice networks are also rendered. Revenue is recognised in the period the services are rendered, based on the percentage of the stage of completion of each specific transaction, valued considering the actual services already rendered and the total services to be rendered. Tariff deviations The Tariff Regulations for the electricity and gas business, issued by ERSE, define the formula for calculating the revenue cap for the regulated activities and consider in the calculation formula, the determination of the tariff deviations that are recovered up to the second year after the date in which they were generated, the period on which the tariff deviations are recovered. In this way the REN Group determines at each reporting date, in accordance with the criteria defined by the tariff regulations published by ERSE, the deviations determined between the revenue cap defined and actual revenue. Considering the legislation and the regulatory environment in force, the tariff deviations determined by REN each year comply with a series of characteristics (measurement reliability, right of recovery, transmissibility, identification of the debtor and interest base) that support their recognition as revenue and as an asset, in the year in which they are determined, as being reliably measurable and for it being virtually certain that the financial benefits relating to the transaction(s) will flow to the Company. This rationale is also valid when negative tariff deviations are determined, which are considered as liabilities and revenue deduction. Despite the IFRS don’t cover the recording of tariff deviations, paragraph 12 of IAS 8 and the SFAS 71 – Accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation, strengthen the position of recording assets and liabilities tariff deviations under conditions on which the electricity and gas regulations are established for REN. The Decree-law n.º 165/2008 dated 21 August for the electricity segment and the Decree-Law 87/2011 dated 18 July for the gas segment, reinforce the exposed, establishing the applicable regime to the recognition and transmission of tariff deviations, within the scope of the Concession contracts held by the Group. 3.17 SEGMENT REPORTING An operational segment is a component of an entity which; a) d evelops business activities from which can obtain revenue and incur in expenses (including revenue and expenses related with transactions and other components of the same entity); b) o perating results are regularly reviewed by the main responsible for the operational decision making process of the entity of for the purpose of decision making regarding the recourses imputation to the segment and the evaluation of its performance; and c) the financial data available is distinct. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 149 The operating segments are reported consistently with the internal model of management information made available to the main responsible for the operational decision making of the Entity. REN identified the Executive Committee as the entity responsible for the operating making decisions. The Executive Committee reviews the information prepared internally so as to assess the Group’s performance and the allocation of resources. The REN Group is organized in two main business segments: Electricity and Gas and one secondary segment, the telecommunications. The Electricity segment includes the transmission of very high tension electricity and overall management of the public electricity supply system and management of power purchase agreements (“PPA”) not terminated on 30 June 2007, as well as the management of the Concession pilot zone for electricity production based on sea waves. The Gas segment includes the transport of very high pressure gas and overall management of the national natural gas system, as well as operation of the LNG regasification terminal and underground storage of natural gas. The telecommunications segment is presented separately although it does not qualify for disclosure. The column “Others” includes the operations of REN SGPS, REN Serviços and REN Finance, BV. Financial information relating to income of the identified business segments is included in Note 7. 3.18 CASH FLOW STATEMENT The cash flow statement is prepared under the direct method, being presented the collections and payments in operational activities, investment activities and financing activities. The Company classifies interests and dividends received as investment activities and interests and dividends paid as financing activities. As of 31 December 2013, the captions of Receipts and Payments related to Financial investments in the cash flow statement in the amounts of 207,264 thousand Euros and 210,000 thousand Euros respectively, include, essentially amounts related to financial applications whit maturity above three months. 3.19 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT The benefits granted under the medium-term variable remuneration policy are recorded in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment (“IFRS 2”). The payments settled in cash or cash equivalents (“cash settled”), which are based on the company shares quotation, give rise to the recognition of a liability initially measured at fair value, determined on the date on which the corresponding benefits are awarded. The benefits are recorded as personnel costs against liabilities, as the beneficiaries rendered the service. The fair value of the liability is reviewed at each reporting date, with the effect of any changes recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. 150 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS The share-based payments are not material for the purpose of disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 3.20 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Events that occur after the statement of financial position date that provide additional information on conditions that existed at the date of the statement of financial position (“adjusting events” or events after the statement of financial position date that lead to adjustments) are recognized in the financial statements. Events that occur after the statement of financial position date that provide information on conditions that exist after that date (“non-adjusting events” or events after the statement of financial position date that do not lead to adjustments) are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if material. 4 Financial risk management policies are also described in a specific section for this matter in the Management report. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 4.1 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS POLICIES The Group’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks: including credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk relating to interest rate, among others. The Group has developed and implemented a risk management program that, together with permanent monitoring of the financial markets, aiming to minimise potential adverse effects on the REN Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by the financial management department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The financial management department identifies, assesses and realises operations to minimise the financial risks, in strict cooperation with REN’s operating units. The Board of Directors defines the principles for overall risk management and policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivatives and other non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of liquidity excess. i) Foreign exchange rate risk REN has limited exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. The risk of fluctuation of foreign exchange rates on the bonds totalling 10,000 million Yens (“JPY”) is fully hedged by a cross currency swap of the same notional amount. An increase of 5% in the exchange rate of Euro/JPY, all other factors remaining constant, would lead to a decrease on equity in the amount of 836 thousand Euros as of 31 December 2013 (1,126 thousand Euros as of 31 December 2012), while a decrease of that exchange rate would lead to an increase on equity in the amount of 928 thousand Euros as of 31 December 2013 (1,243 as of 31 December 2012). ii) Credit risk REN’s exposure to credit risk is not significant, since a substantial portion of services rendered are recorded through amounts invoiced to electricity and natural ANNUAL REPORT 2013 151 gas distributors in regulated markets. In addition, in general, contracts with clients establish guarantees (Note 33.4), to cover the collection and default risk. The Group’s counterparty risk on bank deposits, financial applications, and financial derivative instruments is mitigated by the selection of top rating international institutions with solid credit ratings and well known national institutions. iii) Liquidity risk REN’s liquidity risk management is carried out through the dynamic and flexible management of commercial paper programs, with subscription guarantee, as well as by negotiating credit limits that enable it, not only to ensure that the current treasury needs of the REN Group are met, but also provide some flexibility. For that effect we highlight the 545,000 thousand Euros available in commercial paper programmes (from which 475,000 thousand Euros with subscription guarantee), 150,000 thousand Euros available in a credit line with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the financing line available with the China Development Bank in the amount of 700,000 thousand Euros (Note 20). The following table shows the Group’s liabilities by intervals of residual contracted maturity and includes derivative financial instruments whose financial liquidation of the related flows is made at the net amount. The amounts shown in the table are non-discounted cash flows contracted and include future interests; as so, do not correspond to the respectives carrying amounts: 31 December 2013 Less than 1 5 years Over 5 years Total 1 year Borrowings: Bank borrowings 91,694 436,321 439,449 967,463 Bonds 230,351 1,046,814 661,791 1,938,957 Commercial paper 39,271 210,038 249,309 Others 795 1,768 2,563 362,110 1,694,941 1,101,240 3,158,292 Derivative financial instruments 4,916 (2,033) (7,544) (4,661) Trade and others payables 595,861 28,058 623,919 152 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 31 December 2012 Less than 1 5 years Over 5 years Total 1 year Borrowings: Bank borrowings 79,912 273,792 427,457 781,161 Bonds 951,898 815,521 87,291 1,854,710 Commercial paper 253,052 93,966 347,018 Others 695 771 1,466 1,285,558 1,184,050 514,748 2,984,356 Derivative financial instruments 9,151 22,752 31,903 Trade and others payables 309,074 6,822 315,896 The following table shows the derivative financial instruments, financial settlement of which is made at gross amounts: 31 December 2013 Less than 1 5 years Over 5 years Total 1 year Cross currency interest rate swap Outflows (4,169) (16,686) (83,446) (104,301) Inflows 1,873 7,490 79,398 88,761 (2,296) (9,196) (4,048) (15,540) 31 December 2012 Less than 1 5 years Over 5 years Total 1 year Cross currency interest rate swap Outflows (4,169) (16,686) (87,359) (108,214) Inflows 2,385 9,541 103,525 115,452 (1,783) (7,144) 16,166 7,238 ANNUAL REPORT 2013 153 iv) Interest rate risk The risk relating to interest rate variation has two major impacts on REN’s financial statements: remuneration of the company’s assets, in accordance with the tariff regulations, and interest on the borrowings. Since a significant part of the REN Group’s assets have a guaranteed return through the tariffs, definition of which depends in part on market rates of interest, its operating cash flows are significantly affected by changes in the market interest rates. Increases in the interest market rates, generates significant increases in cash flows and vice-versa. In terms of financial liabilities, REN is exposed to interest rate risk, mainly due to borrowings. Borrowings at variable interest rates expose REN to cash flow risk resulting from changes in interest rates. Borrowing at fixed rates exposes the REN Group to fair value risk, as a result of changes in interest rates. Risk management is performed centrally aiming to avoid volatility in financial costs, using simple derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps. In this kind of operation REN Group exchanges with banking counterparties in specific dates and with defined maturities, the difference between the fixed interest rates and the variable rates with reference to the notional amounts contracted. All operations undertaken with this purpose can, mostly, be considered perfect interest rate hedging operations. A sensitivity analysis was made based on the REN Group’s total debt less applications in funds and cash and cash equivalents as of 31 December 2013 and 2012, with the following assumptions: • Changes in market interest rates affecting interest income and costs of variable financial instruments; • Changes in market interest rates affecting only results or equity in relation to fixed interest rate financial instruments if they are recognized at fair value (or when the carrying amount was adjusted by the interest rate risk in a fair value hedge); • Changes in market interest rates affecting the fair value of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities; • Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated discounting future cash flows, using market rates at the year end. Using these assumptions a 0.25% increase in market interest rates for all the currencies in which the Group has borrowings or derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2013 would result in a decrease of profit before tax of, approximately, 3,221 thousand Euros, from which 360 thousand Euros correspond to the impact on financial instruments (as of 31 December 2012 the impact was 1,941 thousand Euros). The increase in equity resulting from an increase in interest rates of 0.25% would be, approximately, 1,550 thousand Euros, this impact entirely attributed to derivatives (on 31 December, 2012 corresponded to an increase of 1,778 thousand Euros). 154 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS The sensivity analysis is merely projected, and do not represent any present real gain or loss, neither other real variations in the net results nor in equity. v) Price risk REN’s exposure to price risk results essentially from its investment in REE and Enagás. A variation of 10% in the price of shares of REE and Enagás at 31 December 2013 would have an impact on equity of 11,102 thousand Euros (8,904 thousand Euros in 2012). vi) Regulated activity risk Gains recognized by REN in each period result directly from the assumptions considered by the regulator, ERSE, in defining the regulated tariffs for the electricity and gas sectors. 4.2 CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The REN Group’s objective relating to the capital management, which is a broader concept than the equity disclosed on the face of the statement of financial position, is to maintain an optimal equity structure, through rational use of debt. The necessity of debt increases are analysed periodically considering the Group financing needs and its liquidity position. REN also monitors its total capital based on the gearing ratio, which is calculated as net debt over the total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position), adjusted by the amounts of cash and cash equivalents and hedge derivatives. Total capital is calculated as equity (as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position) plus net debt. The Group’s Gearing ratio comfortably meets the limits set by contract, being on 31 December 2013 above the minimum in 86% (on 31 December 2012 was 76% above the limit). 5 The estimates and assumptions with impact on REN’s consolidated financial statements are continuously evaluated, representing at each reporting date MAIN the Board of Directors best estimates, considering historical performance, past ESTIMATES AND accumulated experience and expectations about future events that, under the circumstances, are believed to be reasonable. JUDGEMENTS The intrinsic nature of these estimates may cause different impacts on financial statements from those previously estimated. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: Significant accounting estimates 5.1 PROVISIONS The REN Group periodically analyses the existence of possible liabilities resulting from past events that should be recognized or disclosed. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 155 The subjectivity inherent to the determination of the probability and amount of the resources necessary to settle these liabilities may result in significant adjustments, due to variations in the assumptions used or because previously disclosed contingent liabilities may have to be recognised as provisions. 5.2 ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS Determination of the liability for retirement pensions and healthcare plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates of a demographic and financial nature, which may significantly affect the liability calculated at each reporting date. The most sensitive assumptions refer to: the discount rates used to update the liability, the return on plan assets and the mortality tables. 5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Determination of the periods of useful life of the assets, as well as the amortization and depreciation method to be used are essential for determining the amount of amortization and depreciation to be recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for each year. These two parameters are defined in accordance with Management’s best judgement for the assets and business. 5.4 IMPAIRMENT The recognition of possible impairment loss may be identified by the occurrence of events, many outside the control of the REN Group, such as: Future availability of financing; the cost of debt; or maintenance of the current market regulatory structure, as well as other changes of the REN Group, both internal and external. The identification of impairment indicators, the estimate of future cash flows and the determination of the fair value of assets imply a high degree of judgement by the Board of Directors, as regards the evaluation of impairment indicators, estimated cash flows, discount rates used, useful lives and residual values. In REN’s specific activities there are other factors to consider in impairment testing, since commitments to increase the network of infrastructures, changes in expected tariffs, or changes in the strategy of the shareholders of REN, which together with other factors can result in changes in the future cash flow trends and amounts. 156 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 6 The following companies were included in the consolidation perimeter as of 31 December 2013 and 2012: CONSOLIDATION PERIMETER ’13 ’12 % 0wned % 0wned Designation / adress Activity Group Individual Group Individual Parent company: REN Redes Energéticas Nacionais, SGPS, S.A.

The electricity segment includes the transmission SEGMENT of electricity in very high voltage, overall management of the public electricity REPORTING system and management of the power purchase agreements (PPA) not terminated at 30 June 2007 and the pilot zone for electricity production from sea waves. The gas segment includes high pressure gas transmission and overall management of the national natural gas supply system, as well as the operation of regasification at the LNG Terminal and the underground storage of natural gas. Although the activities of the LNG Terminal and underground storage can be seen as separate from the transport of gas and overall management of the national natural gas supply system, since these operations provide services to a single user, which is also the main user of the high pressure gas transport system, it was considered that it is subject to the same risks and benefits. The telecommunications segment is presented separately although it does not qualify for disclosure. Management of external loans are centrally managed by REN SGPS, S.A. for which the Company choose to present the assets and liabilities separate from its eliminations that are undertaken in the consolidation process, as used by the main responsible operating decision maker.

This is the hedging of the interest rate risk on payments of interest at variable rates on recognized financial liabilities. The risk covered is the variable rate indexer to annual report 2013 183 which the borrowing interest coupons relates. The objective of this hedging is to convert loans at variable interest rates to fixed interest rates, the credit risk not being hedged. The fair value of the interest rate swaps at 31 December 2013 was 18,338 thousand Euros negative (27,958 Euros negative at 31 December 2012). In addition, the Group hedges its exposure to cash flow risk on its bond issue of 10,000 million JPY resulting from foreign exchange rate risk, through a cross currency swap with the main features equivalent to the debt issued. The same hedging instrument is used to hedge the fair value of the exchange rate risk of the bond issue through the forward start swap component which will only start in June 2019. The variations in the fair value of the hedging instrument are also recognized in hedging reserves. As from June 2019 the object will be to hedge exposure to JPY and the interest rate risk, transforming the operation into a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the debt issued resulting from the risks covered becoming recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The credit risk is not hedged. The amounts resulting from the hedging instrument are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the transaction hedged affects results for the year. The fair value of the cross currency swap at 31 December 2013 was 10,847 thousand Euros negative (6,853 thousand Euros positive at 31 December 2012). The underlying exchange variation (borrowing) for 2013, in the amount of, approximately, 18,921 thousand Euros, was offset by a similar variation in the hedging instrument in the statement of profit and loss. The inefficient component of the fair value hedge amounted to 926 thousand Euros negative (156 thousand Euros positive at 31 December 2012). The amount recorded in reserves relating to the above mentioned cash flow hedges was 23,362 thousand Euros (35,431 thousand Euros in December 2012).

To manage the fair value floating of this issue debt, the company contracted two swaps on which REN pays a variable rate and receives a fixed rate, with a notional amount of 400,000 thousand Euros. The risk covered is the fixed rate index to debt issued. The covered risk is related with fair value floating of the debt issues according to the interest rate fluctuations. The objective of this hedging is to convert loans at fixed interest rates to variable interest rates, the credit risk not being hedged. The fair value of these interest rate swaps at 31 December 2013 was 7,476 thousand Euros negative. 184 consolidated accounts Changes in the fair value of the debt issued resulting from the interest rate risk are recorded in the income statement to offset changes in the fair value of the hedge instrument recorded in the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2013, the debt fair value changes related to the interest rates risk recorded in the income statement was 8,159 thousand Euros (positive), resulting in an inefficient component of 368 thousand Euros (positive).

In the event of ratings below the levels specified, REN can be called to provide a guarantee acceptable to EIB (Note 33.3). 188 consolidated accounts Following the legal standards and usual market practices, contractual terms and free market competition, establish that neither REN nor its counterparts in borrowing agreements are authorized to disclose further information regarding the content of these financing agreements. REN and its subsidiaries are a part of certain financing agreements and debt issues, which include change in control clauses typical in this type of transactions (including, though not so expressed, changes in control as a result of takeover bids) and essential to the realization of such transactions on the appropriate market context. In any case, the practical application of these clauses is limited to considering the legal ownership of shares of REN restrictions. The exposure of the Group’s borrowings to changes in interest rates on the contractual re-pricing dates is as follows: ‘13 ‘12 6 month or less 1,081,350 1,482,241 6 12 month 150,000 281 1 5 years 1,288,500 1,031,500 Over 5 years 166,882 172,962 2,686,732 2,686,984 The effect of the foreign exchange rate exposure was not considered as this exposure is totally covered by the hedge derivate in place.

The Group also grants BENEFITS their employees life assurance plans. There were no changes in relation to 31 December 2012 in the benefits granted to the employees. Following the adoption of IAS 19 Employee Benefits amendment, the applicability of which is mandatory for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2013 (Note 3.1), the reported amounts of 31 December 2012 have been restated, due to the use of a single discount rate in accordance with the new IAS 19, resulting in an increase in the caption of “Personnel costs” in the consolidated income statement for 2012 (and as such a reduction net profit for the financial year 2012) and the caption “Retained earnings” in the amount of 331 thousand Euros. At 31 December 2013 and 2012 the Group had the following amounts recorded relating to liabilities for retirement and other benefits: ‘13 ‘12 Liability on the Balance Sheet Pension plan 90,579 68,208 Healthcare plan and other benefits 35,514 37,477 Life assurance plan 138 123 126,231 105,808 During the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012, the following operating expenses were recorded regarding benefit plans with employees: ‘13 ‘12 Charges to the statement of profit and loss (note 28) Pension plan 4,742 2,064 Healthcare plan and other benefits 1,838 1,005 Life assurance plan 5 15 6,585 3,084 190 consolidated accounts The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the post-employment benefits, which are considered by the REN Group and the entity specialized in actuarial studies to be those that best meet the commitments established in the pension plan and related retirement benefit liabilities, are as follows: ‘13 ‘12 Annual discount rate 3.25% 3.25% Expected percentage of serving employees elegíble for early retirement (more than 60 years of age and 36 years in service) by Collective Work Agreement 20.00% 20.00% Expected percentage of serving employees elegíble for early retirement Management act 20.00% 20.00% Rate of salary increase 3.30% 3.30% Pension increase 1.70% 2.00% Future increases of Social Security Pension amount 2.00% Inflation rate 2.00% 2.00% Medical trend 3.50% 3.50% Management costs (per employee/year) 219€ 215€ Expenses medical trend 2.00% 2.20% Retirement age (number of years) 66 65 Mortality table TV 88/90 TV 88/90 The actuarial valuation of 31 December 2013 reflects the changed assumption of retirement age by the Social Security from 65 years to 66 years of age in accordance with Decree-Law No. 167-E/2013 of 31 December and Ordinance 378-G/2013 of 31 December. The annual discount rate of 3.25% used in the valuation of liabilities, was obtained through an analysis of rates of return on bonds considered appropriate and in line with the duration of the liabilities associated with different benefit plans (see discount rate determination in note 3.10). Sensitivity analysis In the scenario where a discount rate of 4.25% and 2.25% have been considered in determination of the responsibilities with pension plan and medical & other benefits plan, the following variations would occur: Discount rate for sensitivity analysis 2.25% 3.25% 4.25% Pension plan Liabilities 145,702 133,883 123,815 Impact on liabilities 11,819 (10,068) Healthcare plan Liabilities 23,699 20,445 17,857 Impact on liabilities 3,254 (2,588) Other benefits Liabilities 18,148 15,069 12,721 Impact on liabilities 3,079 (2,348) annual report 2013 191 The evolution of the eligible population for the pension plan and the healthcare and other benefits plan is as follows: ‘13 ‘12 Active 376 434 Early retirees 195 159 Retirees 592 581 21.1 PENSION PLAN To cover its liability for supplementary retirement pensions, REN contributes to an autonomous pension fund.

The company became the shareholder of OMIP – Operador do Mercado Ibérico de Energia (Portuguese Pole), which function is the management of the derivatives market in MIBEL and Omiclear – Sociedade de Compensação de Mercados de Energia, S.A., a company owned by the OMIP and which has the corporate object of clearing futures and options operations. b) 1 0% interests in the share capital of OMEL Operador do Mercado Ibérico de Energia, S.A., the spanish pole of the Sole operator. c) A  participation representing 5.45% of the share capital in Medgrid, SAS; and d) A participation of 7.5% of the share capital of Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa, S.A. (“HCB”). The accompanying financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors meeting of 6 March 2014. However, they are still subject to approval by the Shareholders’ Meeting under the terms of current Portuguese legislation. The Board of Directors believes that the financial statements fairly reflect the Company’s financial position, the results of its operations, changes in its equity and its cash flows. 2 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Decree-Law 158/2009 of 13 July, and the conceptual ACCOUNTING framework, accounting and financial reporting standards and interpretations FRAMEWORK FOR applicable for the year ended 31 December 2013 (generally accepted accounting principles in Portugal). THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL The accompanying financial statements are presented in thousands of Euros. STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT 2013 215 3 The main accounting policies used to prepare these financial statements are as follows: MAIN ACCOUNTING 3.1 Bases of presentation POLICIES The accompanying financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis from the accounting records of the Company, maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Portugal. The accompanying financial statements reflect only the Company’s individual financial statements, prepared as required by law for approval by the Shareholders’ Meeting. As explained in Note 3.2 investments are stated in accordance with the equity method. In accordance with Decree Law 158/2009 of 13 July, the Company also prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union (“IFRS”), for approval in separate, which reflect, as of 31 December 2013, in relation to the accompanying individual financial statements, the following differences: Total net assets (1,154,741) Total liabilities (1,233,325) Net profit for the period (5,232) Total revenue (525,377) Total equity 78,584 As of 31 December 2013, the differences between net profit and equity (individual and consolidated financial statements) results essentially from: (i) the fact that the subsidiaries record actuarial gains and losses relating to employee benefits in accordance with the “corridor” method, this effect being reflected by the Company in applying the equity method to value investments in subsidiaries, while in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, actuarial gains and losses are recorded directly in equity; and (ii) the fact of the investment held in OMIP SGPS in the IFRS consolidated financial statements, have been revalued in 2011, in the sequence of the loss in control, when OMIP became an Associate. 3.2 Investments in subsidiaries and associates Investments in subsidiaries and associates are recorded based on the equity method, under which they are initially recorded at cost and then adjusted based 216 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS on the post-acquisition changes in the Company’s share of the net assets of these companies. The Company’s results include the proportion of the results of these entities. In addition dividends received from these companies are recorded as decreases in the amount of the investments. The excess of cost in relation to the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of each entity acquired on the acquisition date is recognized as goodwill and is maintained in the amount of the investment. If the difference between cost and the fair value of assets and liabilities is negative, it is recognized as income for the year. A valuation of investments is made when there are indications that an asset can be impaired, any impairment losses being recognized as cost in the statement of profit and loss. When the Company’s proportion on the accumulated losses of a subsidiary or associate exceeds its book value, the investment is recorded at a nil amount, except when the Company has assumed commitments to cover the losses of the subsidiary or associate, when the additional require the recognition of a liability. If these companies subsequently report profits, the Company only starts recognizing its share of those profits after its share of the profits equals the losses not recognized. Unrealized gains on transactions with subsidiaries and associates are eliminated in proportion to the Company’s interest in them, by corresponding entry to the caption investment. Unrealized losses are also eliminated but only up to the point that such loss does not result in the transferred asset being impaired. 3.3 Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the purchase price of the assets, costs directly attributable to their acquisition and costs incurred to prepare the assets to start operating. Current repair and maintenance costs are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the period in which they are incurred. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated period of useful life, as from the date they are ready for use. The estimated periods of useful life of tangible fixed assets are as follows: Years Transport equipment from 4 to 6 years Administrative equipment from 3 to10 years The useful life of the assets is reviewed annually. Changes in useful life’s are treated as changes in accounting estimates and are applied prospectively. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 217 Gains and losses on the sale of assets are determined by the difference between the proceeds of the sale and the book value of the asset, these being recorded in the statement of profit and loss in the year of sale. 3.4 Leases Classifying a lease as finance or an operating lease depends upon the substance of transaction rather than the form of the lease arrangement. Leases, in which REN has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, are classified as finance leases. Agreements in which an analysis of one or more of the conditions of the contract point a finance lease are also classified as such. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Finance lease contracts are initially recognized at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets or the present value of the minimum lease payments, determined at the inception date. The lease liability is recognized net of interest costs in the caption Borrowings. Interest costs included in the lease payments and depreciation of the leased assets are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period they refer to. Tangible fixed assets acquired under finance lease contracts, are depreciated by the lower period between the useful life period of the asset and the maturity of the lease contract, when the company doesn`t have a purchase option on the maturity date, or by the useful life period estimated, when the Company has the commitment to acquire the asset by the end period of the contract. Under operating lease contracts, the lease payments due are recognized as expenses in the statement of profit and loss, on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 3.5 Financial assets and liabilities The Company chose to apply in full IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures, in accordance with paragraph 2 of the NCRF 27. The Board of Directors decides upon the classification of financial assets at the time of their initial recognition in accordance with the purpose of their acquisition. Financial assets Financial assets may be classified into the following categories: (i) Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss – includes nonderivative financial assets acquired for short-term trading and assets designated at fair value through profit and loss at the inception date; (ii) Loans granted and receivables – includes non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not listed in active market; (iii) Investments held to maturity – includes non-derivative financial assets 218 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities, that the entity intends and has the capacity to hold until the maturity date; and (iv) A  vailable-for-sale financial assets – includes non-derivative financial assets designated as available-for-sale at inception date or other financial assets not classified in any of the other financial asset categories. Availablefor-sale financial assets are recognized as non-current assets unless management intends to sell them within 12 months of the statement of financial position date. Purchases and sales of investments in financial assets are recognized on the transaction date – the date on which the Company commits itself to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are initially recognized at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the statement of profit and loss. Such assets are subsequently adjusted to fair value, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value being recognized in the statement of profit and loss caption net financial costs for the period in which they arise, which also includes interest income and dividends received. Loans and receivables are classified as “Trade and other receivables” are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment loss. An impairment loss of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of the transactions that gave rise to the receivables which are recorded in the statement of profit and loss in the caption “Impairment loss of trade receivables”. Financial assets held to maturity are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Available-for-sale financial assets are initially recognized at fair value including transaction costs. In subsequent periods these assets are adjusted to fair value, the changes in fair value being recognized in a fair value reserve within Equity until the investment be sold or received or until the fair value of the investment be below the acquisition cost on a longstanding perspective, situations on which the loss is recorded in the statement of profit and loss. Dividends and interest income from available-for-sale financial assets are recognized in the statement of profit and loss caption other financial income for the period in which the right to receive them is established. The fair value of listed investments is based on current market prices (“bid”). If the market for a financial asset is not active, the Company establishes fair value through valuation techniques. These include the use of recent transactions, provided that they are at market prices, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis when information is available, making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. In the situations the investments are equity instruments not valued under active market quotations, and for which is not possible to estimate with reliability its ANNUAL REPORT 2013 219 fair value, these investments are measured at the acquisition cost deducted of impairments losses, if any, being the impairment losses recorded in the profit and loss statement of the year. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire or are transferred, as well as all the risks and rewards of their ownership. Impairment of financial assets Financial assets included in the category “at cost or amortized cost” are subject to impairment tests at each financial statement date. Such financial assets are impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more happenings that occur after their initial recognition, their estimated future cash flows are affected. Impairment losses to be recognized on financial assets measured at amortized cost corresponds to the difference between the book value of the asset and its present value as of the date of reporting the new estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. Impairment losses to be recognized on financial assets measured at cost correspond to the difference between the book value of the asset and the best estimate of the fair value of the asset as of the financial statement date. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss caption “Impairment losses” in the period they are determined. If subsequently the impairment loss decreases and such decrease can be objectively related to an occurrence that happened after recognition of the loss, this must be reversed to the statement of profit and loss. The reversal must be recognized up to the amount that would have been recognized (amortized cost) if the loss had not been initially recognized. The reversal of impairment losses is recognized in the statement of profit and loss caption “Reversal of impairment losses”. In the case of financial assets classified as “held for sale”, a significant and longstanding decrease of its fair value below the acquisition cost is considered an indicator that the financial asset is impaired. If evidence of impairment on the financial asset held for sale exists, the accumulated loss is determined by the difference between the acquisition cost and the actual fair value, less any impairment losses previously recorded is transferred from the fair value reserve in equity into profit and loss of the period. Impairment losses of equity instruments recorded in profit and loss are not reversible. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, bank deposits, other shortterm highly liquid investments with initial maturities of up to twelve months. These assets are measured at amortized cost. Usually, the amortized cost does not differ from the nominal amount. 220 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS Financial liabilities A financial instrument is classified as a financial liability when a contractual obligation exists by the issuer to liquidate capital and/or interests, by the delivery of cash or other financial asset, independently on its legal form. IAS 39 establishes the classification of financial liabilities in two categories: I) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss; and II) Other financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities include “Borrowings” and “Trade and other payables”. Trade and other payables are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently adjusted to amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. Loans obtained are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction incremental costs incurred. The subsequent measurement of these loans are made at amortised cost, being the difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value recognised in the in profit and loss statement over the loan maturity, using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities are classified as current, except when the Company has an unconditional right to defer the payment of the correspondent liability for, at least, 12 months after the reporting date, being this liability, in these circumstances classified as non-current. Financial liabilities are derecognized when the related obligations are settled, cancelled or expire. 3.6 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value at the date of the transaction being subsequently measured at fair value.. The method for recognizing gain and loss in fair value depends upon the designation made of the derivative financial instruments. If they are trading financial derivative instruments, gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss captions financial costs or income. When they are designated as hedging derivative financial instruments, the recognition of gains and losses depends on the nature of the item hedged, it being a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. The fair value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to its market value. In the absence of market value, the fair value is determined by external independent entities, through valuation techniques accept in the market. Derivative financial instruments are recognized in the caption “Derivative financial instruments”, and if they have a positive or negative fair value they are recognized as financial assets or liabilities, respectively. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 221 A derivative financial instrument is recorded as non-current if its remaining period to maturity is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realized or settled within 12 months. Hedge accounting In hedging its interest rate and exchange rate risk the Company contracts a series of derivative financial instruments, namely swaps. The criteria for applying hedge accounting rules are: • Adequate documentation of the hedge; • The risk to be covered is one of the risks described in IAS 39; and • It is expected that the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, attributable to the risk covered, are virtually offset by changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument. At the inception of the hedge operation, the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, its risk management objectives and its strategy for managing the risk. Additionally, in the beginning of the operation and at each reporting period it is assessed the effectiveness of the hedging instrument to offset variations in the fair value and cash flows of the item hedged. The fair value of the derivative financial instruments contracted and the movements in hedge reserves are disclosed in Note 10. In the fair value hedge of an asset or liability (fair value hedge), the carrying amount of the asset or liability, determined based on the accounting policy used, is adjusted so as to reflect the variation of its fair value attributable to the risk hedged. Variations in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognized in the statement of profit and loss together with variations in the fair value of the assets or liabilities hedged attributable to the risk hedged. In a hedging operation of the exposure to variations of great probability in future cash flows (cash flow hedge) the effective part of the fair value variation of the hedging instrument is recognized in hedging reserves, being transferred to the statement of profit and loss in the period the item hedged affects results. The ineffective part of the hedge in recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Company revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any amount recorded as “Other reserves – hedge reserves” is only reclassified to the statement of profit and loss when the hedged position affects results. When the hedged position relates to a future transaction which is not expected to occur, any amount recorded as “Other reserves – hedge reserves” is immediately reclassified to the statement of profit and loss. 222 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS 3.7 Revenue Revenue includes the fair value of the income received or receivable from services rendered, net of tax and discounts, returns and other deductions. Revenue relating to services rendered refers to charges to subsidiaries corresponding to management costs. Revenue relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates is recognized in accordance with the equity method. Interest revenue is recognized in accordance with the effective interest method provided that it is probable that economic benefits flow to the company and they can be reliably measured. The revenue from dividends is recognised as gain in the year they are assigned to the shareholders. 3.8 Critical accounting judgments and main sources of uncertainties relating to estimates When preparing the accompanying financial statements, value judgments and estimates were made using assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the amounts recorded relating to gains and losses of the period. The estimates and underlying assumptions were determined with reference to the reporting date based on the best knowledge available as of the date of approval of the financial statements, of the events and transactions in process, as well as experience of past and/or current events. However, situations can occur in subsequent periods that were not predictable as of the date of approval of the financial statements and so were not considered in the estimates. Changes in the estimates that occur after the date of the financial statements will be corrected on a prospective basis. Therefore, given the degree of uncertainty, actual results of the transactions can differ from the corresponding estimates. Significant accounting estimates 3.8.1 Provisions Provisions are recognized when REN SGPS has: I) a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; II) it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and III) the amount can be reliably estimated. When one of these criteria is not fulfilled or the existence of the liability is dependent upon a future event, REN SGPS discloses it as a contingent liability, except if the outflow of resources to settle it is considered to be remote. Provisions for restructuring expenses are recognised by the Company when there is a formal and detailed restructuring plan and that such plan has been communicated to the involved parties. In the measurement of the restructuring ANNUAL REPORT 2013 223 provision, are only considered the expected outflows that directly result from the implementation of such plan, not considering, the current activities of the Company. Provisions are measured at the present value of the estimated expenditure required to settle the liability using a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the discount period and the risk of the provision. 3.8.2 Fair value The fair value of listed investments is based on current market prices (“bid”). If the market for a financial asset is not active, REN SGPS establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent transactions, provided that they are at market prices, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis when information is available, making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on its market value. In the absence of market value, the fair value is determined by external independent entities, through valuation techniques accepted in the market. 3.9 Income tax Income tax for the year recognized in the statement of profit and loss includes current income tax and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognized in the statement of profit and loss, except when deferred tax relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is also recognized in equity. Current tax payable is computed based on the Company’s taxable profit. Taxable profit differs from the accounting profit because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. Deferred tax refers to temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the temporary differences revert, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted on the date of the financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized, or temporary taxable differences that revert in the same period as the deductible temporary differences. At the end of each reporting period a revision is made of the deductible temporary differences and they are adjusted based on the expectation of their future utilization. 224 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS 3.10 Foreign currency transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated to Euros, the functional currency, using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the year-end exchange rates are recognized as “finance costs” in the statement of profit and loss if relating to borrowings and in “other operating income and costs” in the case of all the other balances/ transactions. 3.11 Accrual basis of accounting The Company records income and expenses on an accruals basis, under which income and expenses are recorded in the period to which they relate, independently of when they are received or paid. Differences between the amounts received and paid and the related income and expenses are recorded as assets or liabilities. 3.12 Distribution of dividends The distribution of dividends to shareholders is recognized as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period the dividends are approved by the shareholders and up to the time of their payment. 3.13 Capital and Own shares Ordinary shares are classified in equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares or options are shown net of tax, as a deduction in equity from the amount issued. Own shares acquired through contract or directly on the stock market are recognized as a deduction in equity. In accordance with the Portuguese Commercial Company Code REN SGPS must ensure at all times that there are reserves in Equity to cover the value of own shares, limiting the amount of reserves available for distribution. Own shares are recorded at cost if they are acquired in a spot transaction or at estimated fair value if acquired in a deferred purchase. 3.14 Cash flow statement The caption cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, bank deposits, other short-term highly liquid investments with initial maturities of up to three months, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown in the current liabilities “Borrowings” caption on the statement of financial position, and are included in the statement of cash flows as cash and cash equivalents. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 225 The cash flow statement is prepared under the direct method, being presented the collections and payments in operational activities, investment activities and financing activities. The Company classifies interests and dividends received as investment activities and interests and dividends paid as financing activities. 3.15 Borrowing costs Borrowings costs are recognized as costs in the period they are incurred. 3.16 Financial risk management policies Financial risk factors REN’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks: including credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk relating to interest rate, among others. REN has developed and implemented a risk management program that, together with permanent monitoring of the financial markets, seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the REN`s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by the financial management department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The financial management department identifies, assesses and realises operations to minimise the financial risks. The Board of Directors defines the principles for overall risk management and policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivatives and other non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. I) Foreign exchange rate risk REN has limited exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. The risk of fluctuation of foreign exchange rates on the bonds totalling 10,000 million Yens (“JPY”) is fully hedged by a cross currency swap of the same notional amount. An increase of 5% in the exchange rate of Euro/JPY, all other factors remaining constant, would lead to a decrease on equity in the amount of 836 thousand Euros as of 31 December 2013 (1,126 thousand Euros as of 31 December 2012), while a decrease of that exchange rate would lead to an increase on equity in the amount of 928 thousand Euros as of 31 December 2013 (1,243 thousand Euros as of 31 December 2012). II) Credit risk REN’s exposure to credit risk is not significant, since the services rendered are invoiced to group companies. REN’s counterparty risk on bank deposits, financial applications, and contracting of derivative instruments is mitigated by the selection of top rate institutions with solid credit rating. 226 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS III) Liquidity risk REN’s liquidity risk management (except for REN Atlântico) is made by the central treasury management. All the liquidity excess and needs of each group company are transferred to REN SGPS, which manages the consolidated balances with financial institutions. In order to guarantee the current treasury needs of the Group and to have the necessary dynamic and flexible to fulfil the current liquidity needs, the Company, as of 31 December 2013, has credit lines contracted and not used in the amount of 71,500 thousand Euro and six commercial paper programmes, in the amount of 775,000 thousand Euros, being available 545,000 thousand Euros and used as of 31 December 2013, 230,000 thousand of Euros. From the total amount of commercial paper programmes, 675,000 thousand Euros have subscription guarantee. The following table shows the Company liabilities by intervals to residual contracted maturity and includes derivative financial instruments whose financial liquidation of the related flows is made at the net amount. The amounts shown in the table are non-discounted cash flows contracted, including future interests, as so, do not correspond to its carrying amounts: 31 December 2013 Less than 1-5 Over 1 year years 5 years Total Borrowings: Bank borrowings 74,584 308,201 297,746 680,531 Bonds 238,519 1,138,513 718,342 2,095,374 Commercial paper 40,732 250,355 291,088 Others 186 305 491 354,022 1,697,374 1,016,088 3,067,483 Derivative financial instruments 4,916 (2,033) (7,544) (4,661) Trade and others payables 61,862 61,862 TOTAL 420,800 1,695,340 1,008,544 3,124,684 31 December 2012 Less than 1-5 Over 1 year years 5 years Total Borrowings: Bank borrowings 68,469 226,769 325,644 620,882 Bonds 951,898 815,521 87,291 1,854,710 Commercial paper 253,052 93,966 347,018 Others 145 338 483 1,273,564 1,136,594 412,935 2,823,093 Derivative financial instruments 9,151 22,752 31,903 Trade and others payables 79,745 79,745 TOTAL 1,362,459 1,159,346 412,935 2,934,740 ANNUAL REPORT 2013 227 The following table shows the derivative financial instruments, financial settlement of which is made at gross amounts: 31 December 2013 Less than 1-5 Over 1 year years 5 years Total Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap Outflows (4,169) (16,686) (83,446) (104,301) Inflows 1,873 7,490 79,398 88,761 (2,296) (9,196) (4,048) (15,540) 31 December 2012 Less than 1-5 Over 1 year years 5 years Total Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap Outflows (4,169) (16,686) (87,359) (108,214) Inflows 2,385 9,541 103,525 115,452 (1,783) (7,144) 16,166 7,238 IV) Interest rate risk The Company presents exposure to interest rates risk mainly on borrowings. Borrowings at variable interest rates expose REN to cash flow risk resulting from changes in interest rates. Borrowings at fixed rates expose REN Group to fair value risk, as a result of changes in interest rates. Risk management is performed centrally aiming to avoid volatility in financial costs; using simple derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps. In this kind of operations REN exchanges with banking counterparties in specific dates and with defined maturities, the difference between the fixed interest rates and the variable rates with reference to the notional amounts covered. All operations undertaken with this end can, mostly, be considered perfect interest rate hedging operations. 228 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS A sensivity analysis was made based on REN`s total debt less applications in funds and cash and cash equivalents as of 31 December 2013 and 2012, using the following assumptions: •C  hanges in market interest rates affecting interest income and costs of variable financial instruments; •C  hanges in market interest rates affecting only results or equity in relation to fixed interest rate financial instruments if they are recognized at fair value (or when the carrying amount was adjusted by the interest rate risk in a fair value hedge); •C  hanges in market interest rates affecting the fair value of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities; and •C  hanges in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated discounting future cash flows, using market rates at the year end. Using these assumptions, a 0.25% increase in market interest rates for all the currencies in which the Group has borrowings or derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2013 would result in a decrease of profit before tax of, approximately, 3,374 thousand Euros, from which 360 thousand Euros correspond to the impact on financial instruments (as of 31 December 2012 the impact was 1,941 thousand Euros). The increase in equity resulting from an increase in interest rates of 0.25% would be, approximately, 1,550 thousand Euros, this impact entirely attributed to derivatives (on 31 December, 2012 corresponded to an increase of 1,778 thousand Euros). The sensivity analysis is merely illustrative and not represent an actual gain or loss neither other variations in the income statement or in equity. 3.17 Share-based payment The benefits granted under the medium-term variable remuneration policy are recorded in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment (“IFRS 2”). The payments settled in cash or cash equivalents (“cash settled”), which are based on the share quotations, give rise to the recognition of a liability initially measured at fair value, determined on the date on which the corresponding benefits are awarded. The benefits are recorded as personnel costs against liabilities, as the beneficiaries rendered the service. The fair value of the liability is reviewed at each reporting date, with the effect of any changes recognized in net income. The share-based payments are not material for the purpose of disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.

Following a joint agreement of technology partnership between REN – Redes Energéticas Nacionais and the State Grid International Development (SGID), it was incorporated in May 2013, an R&D center in Portugal, dedicated to power systems designed – Centro de Investigação em Energia REN – STATE GRID, SA (“Centro de Investigação”) jointly controlled by the above mentioned two entities. The Research Centre aims to become a platform for international knowledge, a catalyst for innovative solutions and tools, applied to the planning and operation of transmission power. The investment in the subsidiary REN Atlântico, includes a goodwill in the amount of 3,744 thousand Euros. The “Goodwill” represents the difference between the amount paid on the acquisition of the participation in subsidiaries and the fair value of the equity of REN Atlântico, S.A. on the acquisition date, under the natural gas business unbundling process. At 31 December 2013 and 2012 goodwill included in the caption “Investments Equity method” was made up as follows: Percentage interest held Entity Year of acquisition Acquisition cost % Amount ‘12 ‘13 REN Atlântico , Terminal de GNL, S.A. 2006 32,580 100% 28,806 3,774 3,774 Goodwill impairment test REN made an impairment test of goodwill at 31 December 2013, in terms of the cash generating unit to which REN Atlântico belongs. The business of REN Atlântico is subject to a concession contract and regulated tariffs so that the recoverable amount was determined based on value-in-use calculations. The cash flow projections considered the expected regulatory terms in place for the remaining term of the concession (concession for a period of 40 years beginning on the 26 September 2006), which cash inflows correspond to the regulated remuneration obtained over the net book value of the corresponding regulated assets which will have a negative trend in the projections after the period ended 2014, and until the Concession maturity period. The cash flow was discounted considering an average market pre-tax interest rate, adjusted for the natural gas regasification activities risk, of 7.98% (post-tax discount rate of 5.79%, 5.68% in 2012). Assumptions Cash generation unit Method Cash flow Growing factor Discounted rate Operating cash flows The rate decrease DFC (discounted 7,98% (before taxes) REN Atlântico, Terminal de GNL, S.A. projected to the remaining according of average rate cash flow) 5,79% (after taxes) concession period of assets depreciation 234 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS In accordance with the assumptions used no impairment losses were identified. The Group made sensitivity analysis considering a variation of 10% on the discount rate of the remunerations of the assets and no impairments were noted. 8 The companies belonging to the REN group are taxed based on the special regime for the taxation of group companies (“RETGS”). Consequently, estimated INCOME TAX income tax, tax amounts withheld by third parties and corporate income tax paid in advance are recorded in the statement of financial position as accounts payable to and receivable from REN SGPS. In accordance with current legislation, tax returns are subject to review and correction by the tax authorities for a period of four years (five years for social security), except when there are tax losses, tax benefits granted or tax inspections, claims or contestations in progress, in which case the period can be extended or suspended, depending on the circumstances. Consequently, the Company’s tax returns for the years from 2010 to 2013 are still subject to review. The Company’s Board of Directors understands that any correction to the tax returns resulting from tax reviews /inspections carried out by the tax authorities will not have a significant effect on the financial statements as of 31 December 2013 and 2012. The Company is taxed in Corporate Income Tax rate of 25%, increased by: (i) municipal surcharge up the maximum of 1.5% over the taxable profit; (ii) a state surcharge of an additional 3% of taxable profit between 1,500 thousand Euros and 7,500 thousand Euros, and (iii) an additional 5% over the taxable profit in excess of 7,500 thousand Euros, which results in a maximum aggregate tax rate of 31.5%. The deferred taxes, as of 31 December 2013, were updated considering the new rates established under the Law n. 2/2014 of 16 January, which establishes a Corporate Income Tax rate of 23% and a municipal surcharge up to a maximum of 1.5% of taxable profit, and a State surcharge of an additional (i) 3% of taxable profit between 1,500 thousand Euros and 7,500 thousand Euros, (ii) of 5% over the taxable profit in excess of 7,500 thousand Euros and up to 35,000 thousand Euros; and (iii) 7% for taxable profits in excess of 35,000 thousand Euros. The referred tax rates are applicable for taxable profits generated on periods after the period started on 1 January 2014. Consequently, the tax rate used in the valuation of temporary taxable and deductible differences as of 31 December 2013, were calculated using the average tax rate expected in accordance with future perspective of taxable profits of the Company recoverable in the next periods.

This is the hedging of the interest rate risk on payments of interest at variable rates on recognized financial liabilities. The risk covered is the variable rate index to which the borrowing interest coupons relates. The objective of this hedging is to convert loans at variable interest rates to fixed interest rates, the credit risk not being hedged. The fair value of the interest rate swaps at 31 December 2013 was 18,338 thousand Euros negative (27,958 Euros negative at 31 December 2012). In addition, the Company hedges its exposure to cash flow risk on its bond issue of 10,000 million JPY resulting from foreign exchange rate risk, through a cross currency swap with the main features equivalent to the debt issued.

The fair value of the cross currency swap at 31 December 2013 was 10,847 thousand Euros negative (6,853 thousand Euros positive at 31 December 2012). The underlying exchange variation (borrowing) for 2013, in the amount of, approximately, 18,921 thousand Euros, was offset by a similar variation in the hedging instrument in the statement of profit and loss. The inefficient component of the fair value hedge amounted to 926 thousand Euros negative (156 thousand Euros positive at 31 December 2012). The amount recorded in reserves relating to the above mentioned cash flow hedges was 23,362 thousand Euros (35,431 thousand Euros in December 2012). The movements recorded in the hedging reserve were as follows: Fair Deferred taxes Hedging value impact reserves 1 January 2012 (14,793) 4,290 (10,503) Changes in fair value and ineffectiveness (20,638) 4,529 (16,109) 31 December 2012 (35,431) 8,819 (26,612) 1 January 2013 (35,431) 8,819 (26,612) Changes in fair value and ineffectiveness 12,069 (3,445) 8,624 31 December 2013 (23,362) 5,373 (17,989) Fair value hedge During the year 2013, the company issued debt in the amount of 400,000 thousand Euros at a fixed rate. To manage the fair value floating of this issue debt, the company contracted two swaps on which REN pays a variable rate and receives a fixed rate, with a notional amount of 400,000 thousand Euros. The risk covered is the fixed rate indexer to debt issued. The covered risk is related with fair value floating of the debt issues according to the interest rate fluctuations. The objective of this hedging is to convert loans at fixed interest rates to variable interest rates, the credit risk not being hedged. The fair value of these interest rate swaps at 31 December 2013 was 7,476 thousand Euros negative. Changes in the fair value of the debt issued resulting from the interest rate risk are recorded in the income statement to offset changes in the fair value of the hedge instrument recorded in the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2013, the debt fair value changes related to the interest rates risk recorded in the income statement was 8,159 thousand Euros (positive), resulting in an inefficient component of 368 thousand Euros (positive).

PART I 6.1.1 VOTING RIGHTS I. Capital Structure 6.1 I.1. Voting rights (capital, number of shares, distribution of capital among INFORMATION shareholders, etc.), including information on shares not admitted to trading, ON VOTING different categories of shares, inherent rights and duties and percentage of capital which each category represents (Art. 245(A)(1)(a). RIGHTS, The share capital of REN – Redes Energéticas Nacionais, SGPS, S.A. (REN or ORGANIZAthe company) in the amount of €534 000 000 is represented by 534 000 000 shares with a face value of €1.00, in the form of nominative book-entry shares, TION AND divided as follows: CORPORATE a) 4  75 260 000 (four hundred and seventy five million, two hundred and sixty GOVERNANCE thousand) class A shares, corresponding to 89% of REN’s share capital; b) 5  8 740 000 (fifty eight million, seven hundred and forty thousand) class B shares, corresponding to 11% of REN’s share capital. Class A shares are ordinary shares that do not grant special rights to their holders, beyond the general rights inherent as a shareholder, under the terms of legislation. Class B shares, which are not admitted to trading, are shares to be privatized (code PTRELXAM0009) held by Parpública–Participações Públicas (SGPS) S.A. and the Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. and the only special entitlement they have is that they do not subject holders to the voting limitation stipulated in Article 12(3) of the Articles of Association. In turn, in accordance with Article 4 of the Articles of Association, the transfer of Class B shares to non-public entities, pursuant to the conclusion of a phase of REN’s privatization process, determines the automatic conversion of Class B shares into Class A shares. This conversion does not require the approval of the holders or deliberation by any of the company’s bodies. On 31 December 2013, all of REN’s class A shares, corresponding to code PTREL0AM0008, were admitted to trading on NYSE Euronext Lisbon (Eurolist by Euronext), with the exception of 213 600 000 shares held by State Grid Europe Limited and Mazoon B.V. 264 corporate governance VOTING RIGHTS 5.9% 5.0% 8.4% 5.0% STATE GRID OF CHINA 0.7% OMAM OIL EDP ENERGIAS DE PORTUGAL, S.A.

Restrictions on the transferability of shares, such as consent clauses for disposal, or limitations on ownership of shares (Art. 245(A)(1)(b). There are no limitations and no measures have been taken by REN which restrict the transferability of shares representing REN capital, which are freely tradable on the regulated market, without prejudice to the legal limitations (lock up) established within the scope of the second stage of REN privatization and applicable to shareholders who acquire their holdings in such a context. With respect to ownership limitations on shares, in accordance with legislation, no entity, including entities which conduct business in the respective sector in Portugal or abroad, can have direct or indirect holdings greater than 25% of REN equity capital1. These limitations on the ownership of REN shares were introduced further to the transposition of community directives applicable to the electricity and natural gas sectors with regard to the legal and ownership separation between the transmission operator using those assets and the operators who conduct other activities in each of the sectors. The aim of these directives is to promote competition in the market and equal access by operators to the transmission infrastructures. Therefore, limitations on the transferability and ownership of shares are exclusively due to legal requirements, and the CMVM Corporate Governance Code does not apply. As such, recommendation I.4. of the CMVM Corporate Governance Code has been complied with. With regard to limitations on voting rights, see I.5 below on the limitations expressed in the Articles of Association arising from the legal system applicable to the electricity and gas sector. 1  f. Article 25(2)(i) of Decree-Law No 29/2006 of 15 February (with its current wording), and Article 20(A) C (3)(b) and Article 21(3)(h) of Decree-Law No 30/2006, of 15 February (with its current wording) ANNUAL REPORT 2013 265 I.3. Number of own shares, percentage of corresponding capital and percentage of voting rights to which own shares would correspond (Art. 245(A)(1)(a). REN has 3 881 374 own shares, with a face value of 10 728 000.00 euros, representing 0.7% of its capital. These shares would correspond to 0.7 % of voting rights. I.4. Significant agreements to which REN is a party that would come into force, be amended or terminate in the event of a change in control over the Company, as the result of a takeover bid, as well as the respective effects, except if, due to their nature, the disclosure of which would be seriously prejudicial for the Company, except if the Company is specifically required to disclose this information due to other legal requirements (Art. 245(A)(1)(j). REN and its subsidiaries are party to a number of financing contracts and debt issues which include clauses on change in control which are typical of such transactions (covering, although not expressly stated, changes to control arising from takeover bids) and essential for carrying out such transactions on the market. However, the practical application of these clauses is limited, considering the legal restrictions on the ownership of REN shares as explained in I.2. There are no significant agreements to which REN is a party that would come into force, be amended or terminate in the event of a change in control over the Company or as the result of a takeover bid. In summary, REN has not adopted any measures aimed at requiring payment or the taking on of charges by the Company in the event of changes in control or to the composition of the Board of Directors and which would be liable to prejudice the free transferability of shares or the free appreciation by shareholders of the performance of members of the Board of Directors, and CMVM I.5 has thus been complied with. I.5. System which is subject to renewal or repeal of defensive measures, particularly those which limit the number of votes liable to be held or the exercising by a sole shareholder in an individual manner or jointly with other shareholders The only provision in the REN Articles of Association which limits votes liable to be held or the exercising by a sole shareholder in an individual manner or jointly with other shareholders, is Article 12(3). Therefore, this Article stipulates that the votes attached to class A shares shall not be counted if issued by any shareholder, on his behalf or as representative of another shareholder, which exceed 25% of the total votes corresponding to REN share capital. Considered for this purpose are the rights to vote inherent to Class A shares which, pursuant to Article 20(1) of the Securities Code, are attributable to them. Article 12(3) of the Articles of Association is the result of the legal requirement set out in I.2. and does not seek to limit voting rights, but rather to ensure the existence of a penalty system for breaching the legal limit on the ownership of the abovementioned shares. As such, there is no mechanism in the Articles of Association to renew or repeal this statute, as it exists in compliance with legal requirements, so recommendation I.4. of the CMVM Corporate Governance Code has been complied with. There are no other defensive measurements. 266 corporate governance I.6. Shareholder Agreements which the company is aware of and which could lead to restrictions with regard to the transfer of securities or voting rights (Art. 245(A)(1)(g). The Board of Directors is not aware of any shareholders agreements in relation to REN that may result in any restrictions to the transfer of securities or exercising of voting rights. II. Holdings and bonds held II.7. Identification of natural or legal persons which, directly or indirectly, own qualified holdings (Art. 245(A)(1)(c) and (d) and Art. 16, with detailed information on the percentage of capital and attributable votes and the source and causes of such attribution.

Possible restrictions with regard to voting rights, such as limitations on exercising voting rights depending on the ownership of a number or percentage of shares, times imposed for exercising voting rights or systems for detaching ownership content (Art. 245(A)(1)(f) Following best practices on shareholder participation in the general meetings of companies with shares admitted to trading in a regulated market, REN’s Articles of Association set out the principle of ‘one share one vote’. 20 Cf. section III, p. 3 and section VI, p.5. 270 corporate governance Without prejudice to that referred to in I.2. and I.5., there are no restrictions on voting rights, such as limitations on exercising voting rights depending on the ownership of a number or percentage of shares. Owners of one or more shares on the ‘Record Date’ may attend, participate in and vote at the REN General Meeting, as long as they comply with the following requirements: a) S hareholders wishing to participate in the General Meeting should express this intention in writing to the Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting and the financial intermediary, with whom they have opened the relevant individual securities account, up to the day before the ‘Record Date’.

This communication may be sent by e-mail22. Shareholders with voting rights may be represented at a General Meeting by means of a person with full legal capacity, by written document addressed to the Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting, communicating the name(s) of the representative(s), under the terms of law and of the notice to convene. This communication may be sent by e-mail23. REN’s shareholders who hold shares on a professional basis in their own name but on behalf of clients, may cast votes as required with their shares, as long as they submit this fact to the Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting before the ‘Record Date’ and using proportional and sufficient proof: (a) the identification of each client and the corresponding number of shares that will be voted on his behalf; (b) the specific voting instructions on each of the items on the agenda as provided by each of their clients.

Article 12(5) of the Articles of Association. 25 Cf. Article 12(5) and (6) of the Articles of Association. 26 w ww.ren.pt ANNUAL REPORT 2013 271 There are currently no plans for the implementation of voting by electronic means, as REN considers the participation of its shareholders to be fully ensured through vote by correspondence and methods of representation (as outlined above). Moreover, REN considers that voting by electronic means would not represent added value to its shareholders, especially taking into account its voting rights, the reduced breakdown of capital and the fact that REN has not received a single vote by correspondence in its recent general meetings. In summary, REN considers that it provides all the necessary mechanisms to encourage its shareholders to participate and vote in general meetings. REN’s articles of association do not provide for any systems for detaching ownership content and there is no mechanism in place to cause any conflict between the right to receive dividends or the underwriting of new securities and the principle of ‘one share, one vote’. I.13. Information on the maximum percentage of voting rights that can be exercised by a sole shareholder or by shareholders with whom they maintain a relationship pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 20. As referenced above in I.5, the maximum percentage of voting rights that can be exercised by a sole shareholder or by shareholders with whom they maintain a relationship pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 20 of the Portuguese Securities Code, on his behalf or as representative of another shareholder, is 25% of the votes corresponding to REN share capital. I.14. Identification of shareholder resolutions that, in accordance with Articles of Association, shall only be passed with a qualified majority, aside from those legally provided for, and indication of these majorities. In accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 11 of the Articles of Association, the attendance or representation of shareholders holding at least 51% of capital is essential in order that the General Meeting can be held and can deliberate on the first call. In accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the Articles of Association, the quorum for adopting resolutions on amendments to the Articles of Association, splits, mergers, transformation or dissolution of the company shall be two thirds of the votes issued, both for the first call and the second. Furthermore, in accordance with No 3 of the same Article in the Articles of Association, resolutions for changes relating to Articles 7(A), 12(3) and 11 of the Articles of Association require the approval of three quarters of the votes issued. The aim of this requirement for such majorities is to ensure adequate representation of shareholders in light of the nature of the activities carried out by the Company and its voting rights. II. Management and supervision (Board of Directors, Executive Board of Directors and General and Supervisory Board) a) Composition II.15. Identification of the model of governance adopted REN has adopted a corporate governance model based on an Anglo-Saxon model which consists of the following corporate bodies elected by the General Meeting27: (i) a Board of Directors, responsible for the management of the Company’s business, which delegates the day-to-day management of the Company to the Executive Committee28 , and (ii) an Audit Committee and 27 Cfr. alínea b), do n.º 2, do artigo 8.º do Contrato de Sociedade. 28 Cfr. n.º 1, do artigo 8.º, do regulamento do Conselho de Administração. 272 corporate governance the Statutory Auditor, as supervision bodies.

Statutory rules relating to the procedural requirements and applicable provisions for the appointment and substitution of members of, where appropriate, the Board of Directors, Executive Management Board and General and Supervisory Board (art. 245 A, paragraph 1, h). In accordance with the legislation and the Articles of Association30, the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Directors is the responsibility of the General Meeting, being carried out through lists of candidates selected by the nominating shareholder(s). With these lists being put to the vote, the shareholders assume a very important role in the respective candidate selection process, without any interference from the directors in this process. It is also the responsibility of the General Meeting to elect the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors. According the Articles of Association31, a minority of shareholders who voted against the winning proposal may appoint at least one director, provided that this minority represents at least 10% of the Company’s share capital. CSC rules apply32 with regard to the substitution of members of the Board of Directors, given that neither the Company’s Articles of Association, nor the Board of Directors or Audit Committee Regulations have special rules on this matter. The Board of Directors of the Company will only participate in said process in the event of replacement by co-option of missing directors, as described below. In this case, since it is non-delegable competence of the Board of Directors. All Directors are involved in the resolution of co-option, except in the event of conflicts of interest. The Company’s Articles of Association33 state that the unjustified absence of any director at more than half of the ordinary meetings of the Board of Directors during one financial year, whether consecutive or non-consecutive absences, equates to the permanent absence of said director. Permanent absence must be declared by the Board of Directors, and they must also substitute the director in question. 29 Cf. Article 3(3) of the Audit Committee regulations. 30 C  f. Article 8(2)(b), and Article 14(3), both in the Articles of Association; and Article 2(1)of the , Board of Directors Regulations. 31 Cf. Article 14(2). 32 Cf. Article 393(3). 33 Cf.

Composition of the Board of Directors, Executive Management Board and General and Supervisory Board, with indication of the minimum and maximum members and duration of term of office in accordance with the Articles of Association, number of full members, date of first appointment and date of termination of term of office of each member The Board of Directors, including the Audit Committee, consists of a minimum of seven and maximum of fifteen members, as determined by the General Meeting that elects said members34. Currently, The Board of Directors consists of 15 members, including a total of 12 non-executive members. At 31 December 2013, the REN Board of Directors consisted of the following members, who have been appointed for the 2012-2014 term of office: name Position Year of first Year of ending appointment of Term of Office Rui Cartaxo Chairman of the Board of Directors 2007 2014 and the Executive Committee Gonçalo Morais Soares Executive Director 2012 2014 João Faria Conceição Executive Director 2009 2014 Guangchao Zhu (em representação da State Grid International Development Limited) Vice-Chairman 2012 2014 Mengrong Cheng Director 2012 2014 Haibin Wan Director 2012 2014 Hilal Al-Kharusi Director 2012 2014 Aníbal Santos (indicado pela Parpública Participações Públicas (SGPS), S.A.)

Articles 8(2)(b) and 14(1) of the Articles of Association. 35 Cf. Article 27(1). 274 corporate governance II.18. Distinction of the executive and non-executive members of the Board of Directors and, with regard to the non-executive members, identification of the members who can be considered independent, or, if applicable identification of the independent members of the General and Supervisory Board The Board of Directors shall include a number of non-executive members ensuring effective ability to supervise, monitor and assess the activity of the executive members, particularly bearing in mind the voting rights and breakdown of REN capital. Therefore, on 31 December 2013 and on this date, 12 of the 15 members of the REN Board of Directors were non-executive directors. Taking into account the assessment criteria on independence laid down in paragraph 5 of article 414(5) of the Portuguese Companies Code with regard to members of the Audit Committee, and in 18.1 of Regulation 4/2013 of the Portuguese Securities Market Commission, and based on internal assessments, the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee consider the following non-executive directors to be independent: name position José Luís Alvim Chairman of the Audit Committee José Frederico Jordão Member of the Audit Committee Emílio Rui Vilar Member of the Audit Committee José Luis Arnaut director Furthermore, all non-executive members of the Board of Directors (in addition, naturally, to the directors that are also members of the Audit Committee) would comply, if applicable, with all incompatibility rules stipulated in paragraph 1 of article 414-A of the Portuguese Companies Code, save as provided for in sub-paragraphs b) and h). Taking into account the governance model adopted, the size of the Company, its voting rights and the respective free float (of only 18.9% of capital), REN considers that the proportion of independent directors is suitable given the number of executive directors and the total number of directors. In light of the above, REN fully complies with Securities Market recommendations II.1.6 and II.1.7, as the Board of Directors consists of an adequate number of non-executive members and, among these, independent members. Moreover, Article 7(A) governs the special system of incompatibilities applicable to the performance of duties at any REN corporate body. The aim of this new proposal is to establish a system of incompatibilities relating to the potential conflicts of interest arising from the direct or indirect exercising of activities in the electric or natural gas sectors, either in Portugal or abroad. It should be noted that the system established in this provision would not apply to the members elected at the same General Meeting. It will only be fully applied for the election of members of future corporate bodies. Accumulation of the positions of chairman of the board of directors and chairman of the executive committee Rui Cartaxo is Chairman of both the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. According to the Board of Directors Regulations, this corporate body established efficient mechanisms for the coordination of the work of its members having ANNUAL REPORT 2013 275 non-executive functions, in particular in order to facilitate the exercising of their right to information, as follows36. a) W  ithout prejudice to the exercising of powers not delegated to the Executive Committee, Company directors having a non-executive function assume a supervisory role of executive management; b) In order to make independent and informed decisions, the directors with non-executive functions may obtain the information they deem necessary or appropriate to perform their roles, powers and duties (in particular, information relating to the powers delegated to the Executive Committee and its performance), by requesting such information from any member of the Executive Committee, and the answer should be provided in an adequate and timely manner; Whenever they consider it necessary or convenient, directors with non-executive duties also hold ad hoc meetings with the aim of analysing company management. In addition, all supporting documentation for meetings of the Board of Directors will be provided in a timely fashion to the non-executive members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee’s resolutions shall be always available for consultation37. Therefore, through the mechanisms described above, all the conditions are established in order for the directors with non-executive functions to discharge their functions in order to make independent and informed decisions.

Identification of committees set up within, where appropriate, the Board of Directors, the General and Supervisory Boards and the Executive Management Board, and place where the operating regulations may be found The REN Board of Directors does not see as suitable to its specificities nor necessary, the ‘formal setting up’ of specialist committees with Competences in performance assessment and corporate governance, or otherwise, particularly due to: (i) the composition of the management body, with only three executive members in a total of fifteen members; (ii) the model of corporate governance implemented, integrating an Audit Committee within the Board of Directors composed exclusively of independent members; and (iii) the company’s shareholder structure, with the presence of several shareholders with knowledge of the sector and with the vocation of strategic partners. Furthermore, it has been our position that the setting up of specialist committees is not justified, bearing in mind the supervisory activity carried out by the Audit Committee and the nonexecutive members of the Board of Directors. In 2013, Company Non-Executive Directors monitored issues relating to: (i) the model and principles of Company governance; (ii) the assessment of the overall performance of the Board of Directors and the analysis of the appropriate profile to perform the functions of a REN director; as well as (iii) the assessment of the performance of the Executive Directors, supporting the Board of Directors and the Remuneration Committee in the exercising of their duties. Likewise, Non-Executive Directors monitor the global performance of the Board of Directors and analyse the functioning of the corporate governance system. 50 None of the companies identified belong to the REN Group. 51 J  osé Luis Arnaut was appointed to the international advisory board of Goldman Sachs in January 2014. 290 corporate governance Moreover, as referred to above52, executive directors shared among themselves the responsibility and the monitoring of specific areas of operation.

III.38. Other functions of the supervisory bodies and, where applicable, the Financial Matters Committee The Audit Committee is, alongside the Statutory Auditor, a supervisory body, consisting of non-executive directors. It is, therefore, an integral body of the Board of Directors, whilst consisting exclusively of independent members. The Audit Committee supervises and oversees management activity in an independent and autonomous manner. The dual capacity of its members, as members of both the supervisory body and the management body, renders the control process even more transparent, notably due to the special access afforded to the members of the Audit Committee to information and decisionmaking processes. The Audit Committee, as a supervisory body, has the powers and the duties stipulated by law and in the REN Articles of Association, therefore being particularly responsible for58: a) S upervising the management of the Company and compliance with the law, the Articles of Association and principles of governance; b) Drawing up an annual report on their supervisory action and issue an opinion on the report, accounts and proposal to distribute profits presented by management; c) S upervising the effectiveness of the risk management, internal control and internal audit systems; d) V  erifying the accuracy of books, accounting records and documents they use as support; e) V erifying, when and in the manner they see fit, cash in all its forms and stocks of any type of assets or values belonging to REN or received by REN as a guarantee, deposit or in other form; f)V erifying if the accounting policies and the valuation criteria adopted by REN lead to a correct evaluation of property and results; g) V  erifying the accuracy of the accounting documents prepared by the Board of Directors and overseeing the respective review; h) Supervising the preparation and disclosure of financial information; i) R  eceiving whistle blowing communications submitted by shareholders, company employees or third parties; j) Proposing to the General Meeting the appointment of the Statutory Auditor (being therefore responsible for proposing the External Auditor and the respective remuneration); k) Inspecting the independence of the Statutory Auditor, more specifically with regard to the provision of additional services; l) Inspecting the review of accounts in accounting documentation; m) C  ontracting the services of experts who will assist one or several of its members in exercising their duties; n) C  onvening the General Meeting whenever the Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting fails to do so, despite this obligation. 58 Cf. Article 6 of the Audit Committee Regulations. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 293 The Audit Committee draws up an annual report on its supervisory activities (including references to any detected constraints), further submitting an opinion on the management report of the Board of Directors, the financial statements, as well as on the Corporate Governance Report, which are available together with the accounting documents on the REN website59 and which remain available for five years. The Audit Committee is the Company’s main discussion partner and the first recipient of reports from the Statutory Auditor and external auditor, representing it in relation to the Statutory Auditor and seeking to ensure that, within the Company, suitable conditions are provided for them to carry out their work. The Audit Committee is responsible for regularly monitoring the activities of the external auditors and the Statutory Auditor by analysing their periodic reports and overseeing the audit and review processes. It also assesses any changes in procedures recommended by the external auditors or the Statutory Auditor60. REN has adopted a corporate governance model based on an Anglo-Saxon model and the supervisory body consists of non-executive directors who are on the Board of Directors, so in addition to the competences referred to above, the Audit Committee, acting as supervisory body, also has the general competences of the non-executive directors.

III. Internal control and risk management III.50. People, bodies or committees responsible for internal audit and/or for the implementation of internal control systems The management and supervisory bodies of the Company have attributed growing importance to the development and improvement of the internal control and risk management systems, with a significant impact on the activities of the Group’s companies. This approach has been in line with national and international recommendations, the Company’s size and business and the complexity of the associated risks. The Executive Committee and, ultimately, the Board of Directors, are responsible for creating and managing the internal control and risk management systems, including the setting of objectives. 65 Cf. Article 383 of the CSC. 66 Cf. Article 11 of REN’s Articles of Association. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 297 The Audit Committee is responsible for assessing the Executive Committee in the analysis of the integrity and efficiency REN’s internal control and governance and risk management systems, including the introduction of resolutions to improve operations and amendments in accordance with REN’s requirements67. Therefore, in its action plan for to be carried out in 2013, the Audit Commission considered carrying out of a range of investigations and assessments into the operation and suitability of the internal control and governance and risk management systems, having carried out various meetings with the statutory auditor and external auditor and with the heads of various departments, namely: information systems; procurement, management planning and control, accounts, research and regulation, operation services, quality, environment and safety. The external auditor verifies the efficiency and operation of the internal control mechanisms, as part of its legal review of financial statements, and reports any significant deficiencies to the Audit Committee. On 13 May 2009, the Executive Committee passed a resolution to set up GSADAI (Internal Audit), with the mission of supervising the creation, operation and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management control model and internal control and governance systems, through objective, independent and systematic monitoring. Of note, among GSAD-AI’s various tasks are the following: • Review of risk management and internal control policies in force; • Assess the degree of implementation of internal control (organizational structure and governance, delegation of powers, ethics and code of conduct, policies and procedures); • Implementation of financial, IT, operational and management audits in the various areas of the REN Group, confirming compliance with the policies, laws and regulations (compliance services); • Define, jointly with the various areas, corrective measures for any weaknesses and non-compliances identified during audits; • Monitoring the implementation of corrective measures, through follow-up reports; • Support high-level management in defining and/or implementing control and governance measures. In addition, the mission of the Risk Management Committee, created in 2011, is to support the Board of Directors in monitoring the Group’s risks, as well as ensuring the enforcement of risk management policies common to the entire REN Group and the internal disclosure of best practices for Risk Management. To carry out this mission, the Risk Management Committee’s main functions are to: • Promote the identification and systematic assessment of business risks and their impact on REN’s strategic objectives; • C ategorize and prioritize the risks to be addressed, as well as the corresponding preventive opportunities identified; • Identify and define the persons responsible for risk management; • Monitor significant risks and REN’s general risk profile; • Approve regular risk reporting mechanisms by different businesses areas. • Approve, or submit to the Executive Committee, recommendations for prevention, mitigation, sharing or transfer of material risks. 65 Cf. Article 3(6)(a) of the Audit Committee regulations. 298 corporate governance In 2013, the Risk Management Committee continued to support the Board of Directors in monitoring the Group’s risks, as well as ensuring the enforcement of risk management policies common to the entire Group and the internal disclosure of best practices for Risk Management. III.51. Demonstration through inclusion of flowchart, of operational and/or reporting hierarchy in relation to other Company bodies or committees In operational terms, GSAD-AI reports to the Audit Committee, notwithstanding its administrative relationship with the Company’s Executive Committee. As part of its supervisory function and the competences expressly prescribed in the internal regulations, the Audit Commission supervises the internal audit procedure, namely through the introduction of resolutions to improve their operation 68 . To this effect, the Audit Committee carries out an appraisal of the work plans and resources put in place, I, supervises the activity and has access to all reports prepared by the GSAD-AI including, amongst others, articles relating to accounts, potential conflicts of interest and the detection of possible irregular practices. The Risk Management Committee is coordinated by Gonçalo Morais Soares, an executive director, and is responsible for the first line of defence, reporting to the Executive Committee. III.52. Existence of other functional areas with competences for risk control No other functional areas with competences for risk control exist beyond those referred to in III.50. III.53. Identification of the main types of risk (economic, financial and legal) to which the Company is exposed when conducting business When conducting business in all of its areas of operation or those of its subsidiaries, REN is subject to multiple risks. These have been identified with the aim of mitigating and controlling them. The ‘appetite for risk’ reflects the amount of risk the company is willing to take on or to retain in pursuing its goals. REN adopts a prudent position with regard to its appetite for risk. In 2013, the Risk Management Committee, with support from ‘risk owners’, reviewed the various risks to which REN is exposed, thereby updating the Group’s risk profile. 68 Cf. Article 3(6)(a)(b) and (m) of the Audit Committee regulations. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 299 The most serious risks for the REN Group are shown in detail below, with their category and subcategory: # Category Subcategory nature risk Change to the regulatory model and 1 Regulatory parameters surronding External 2 environment context Evolution of REN’s rating Financial Markets 3 Evolution of interest rates 4 Business Interruption Occurrence of a general incident 5 Non approval of investment plans Investment Projects No transfer of assets into operation on 6 schedule 7 Health and Safety Occurrence of serious work accidents Processes Operacional 8 Information Technology Unavailability of information systems 9 Investment Projects Insolvency of suppliers 10 Assets Safety Critical nature of the installations Changes to the regulatory model and parameters The risk of changes to the regulatory model and/or regulator decisions may affect the company’s ability to run its business efficiently and is linked to the fact that the activity carried out by REN is a regulated activity. REN manages such risk by systematically monitoring the progress of the regulatory strategy as well as European regulatory trends in relation to activities carried out by REN. Evolution of ren’s rating Changes to REN’ rating could have an impact in terms of access to financing as well as the cost of such financing. REN manages this risk by building a position of sound liquidity and through efficient management of its financing needs combined with effective initiatives for communicating with both the market and the various financial agents. It should be noted that the company’s rating may be affected by any deterioration in Portugal’s rating. Evolution of interest rates The fluctuation of interest rates can have an impact on remuneration from regulated assets and on servicing REN’s debt. A change to relevant benchmarks of market interest rates could result in higher financing expenses for the REN Group. REN manages exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates by contracting financial derivatives, in order to achieve a balanced ratio of fixed and variable interest rate and to minimize financial burdens in the medium and long-term. 300 corporate governance Occurrence of a generalized incident The company’s performance could be influenced by the occurrence of events causing an interruption in the electricity and/or gas supply service and by any difficulty in restoring the service in a timely manner. The infrastructures supporting REN’s operations are exposed to a series of conditions (pollution, atmospheric conditions, fires, birds, among others), which could cause interruptions to the service. The plan for restoring service following a generalized incident implemented by REN and the organization of drills to test the ability to restore the service in the event of an incident, are some of the initiatives adopted for managing this risk. Non-approval of investment plans The existence of delays in the approval of investment plans by the Regulator or by other authorities can cause significant delays in implementing new infrastructures and/or loss of the investment made, with an impact on the quality of the service provided. REN has adopted procedures for managing this risk that involve monitoring actions by the regulatory authority with approval responsibilities and other competent entities in the process of authorizing the investment to be made. Non-entry into operation of assets within planned deadlines Economic and financial conditions together with the difficulty in obtaining financing to allow providers of services and suppliers to do business, and also other factors of an operational nature including processes for environmental licensing/authorization, may compromise the entry into operation of assets within planned deadlines. REN carries out a series of actions which allow the ongoing monitoring and mitigation of all factors which could increase this risk. Occurrence of serious work accidents Non-compliance with safety and operational procedures for equipment could result in the occurrence of serious work accidents with damage to people and property during work organized by REN. REN manages this risk through the safety management system, with specific training for operations involving risks and training for employees of REN’s service providers on safety awareness. Unavailability of information systems REN’s activities rely heavily on the information systems and technologies used within the Group. Therefore, the availability of information systems and their capacity to meet Company needs are crucial to REN’s good performance. To manage this risk, REN maintains its communication systems and the respective support services up to date by performing periodic inspections of the configurations of network and security equipment. At the same time, security measures are in place for systems deemed to be critical, such as the existence of redundant communications and the shielding of such systems from potentially dangerous traffic. Insolvency of suppliers The unavailability or untimely or inefficient availability of resources/services provided by third parties may influence REN’s ability to achieve its objectives. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 301 Therefore, it has become necessary to improve the model for supplier assessment and qualification and to put mechanisms in place to continually follow and monitor the performance of the contractors and service providers throughout the execution of projects, so that REN can ensure its clients’ needs are met and achieve the key performance indicators of quality, cost and time. The key tools to manage this risk are the supplier qualification and assessment system implemented at REN, the financial assessment of suppliers and contract workers during the market consultation process and the monitoring of corporate information on suppliers and service providers. Critical nature of the installations Protection and efficient asset management has always been REN’s priority, and has become an ever more crucial factor in the pursuit of its activities in order to ensure service quality and value creation. To manage this risk, REN has developed new methodologies that pave the way for increased efficiency in asset management as well as guaranteeing their physical protection, through the implementation of integrated security systems for installations, in order to avoid unforeseen circumstances or incidents that may put the integrity of infrastructures or equipment at risk. III.54. Description of the risk identification, assessment, monitoring, control and management process It is considered that a risk management and internal control system – as implemented by REN should meet the following objectives: • Guarantee and supervise compliance with the objectives previously set by the Board of Directors; • Identify the risk factors, the consequences of the occurrence of risk and the mechanisms for dealing with and minimizing risk; • Align admissible risk with REN Group strategy; • Ensure that information is reliable and complete; • Ensure the complete, reliable and timely preparation and reporting of financial and accounting information and apply an appropriate management information system; • Guarantee the safeguarding of assets; • Ensure prudent, appropriate valuation of assets and liabilities; • Improve the quality of decisions; • Promote the rational and efficient use of resources. As such, in pursuing the objectives stated above, REN’s Risk Committee is responsible for the identification and evaluation of the inherent risks involved in REN’s activities stated in III.53., whilst also supporting the monitoring of significant risks and the general risk profile of REN. That is to say that, at the first stage, the Risk Committee, with the collaboration of its members who are the heads of various departments and with the assistance of all other department heads within the Company, analysed any aspects related to REN’s business that could constitute a risk to its activity. 302 corporate governance The Risk Committee then assesses existing risks (severity and probability of occurrence for each potential risk) and classifies them by order of importance and by categories and subcategories. The assessment of risks inherent to REN’s activities, as well as the Internal Control System, are carried out according to the following principles: • To strengthen and improve effectiveness and efficiency in the use of resources; • Safeguarding assets; • To analyse the information processing system; • Checking of the reliability and accuracy of financial, accounting and other kinds of information; • To prevent and detect fraud and errors; • To check for compliance of the Group’s operations and business with applicable legal and regulatory provisions, as well as with general policies and Company regulations; • To promote operational effectiveness and efficiency. Following the identification and assessment of inherent risks, the Risk Committee identifies the relevant measures to eliminate, mitigate or control the risks and reports the result of the analysis to the Board of Directors. The Risk Committee further seeks to apply preventive and protective measures, through the formulation of a priority matrix, and communicates risk management best practices internally. Risk assessment is reviewed regularly in order to ensure that it is always up to date. As such, the following activities were carried out in 2013 as part the REN Group risk management system: • Review and updating of risk models and the respective processing files; • Review and updating of the list of greatest risks; • Definition of the action plan to mitigate the greatest risks; • Definition of the Key Risk Indicators (KRI); • Development and entry into operation of the do Risk Management Portal. As part of risk monitoring, control and management, it should be noted that, on 8 November 2012, REN’s Board of Directors approved the review of the regulations ‘Appreciation and Control of Transactions with Related Parties and Prevention of Conflicts of Interests’ and ‘Procedures Applicable to the Processing of Whistleblowing Communications and the Inspection of Irregularities’. Moreover, it should also be pointed out that REN has implemented a series of changes to its internal control and risk management systems, involving the components provided for in CMVM Recommendations, and in terms of risk management, it has also been guided by the norms of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). 2013 saw a continuation of the application of a standardised and integrated corporate risk management strategy, transversal throughout the organisation, aligned and structured based on the priorities and specific characteristics of each area of the business. III.55. Main elements in the internal control and risk management systems implemented at the Company with regard to the financial information disclosure process (Art. 245(A)(1) (m) REN regularly provides management information, to strictly monitor its operations. In this regard, all management information provided both for internal use and for disclosure to other organizations, is prepared on the basis of sophisticated IT systems. REN carries out initiatives that seek to continually ANNUAL REPORT 2013 303 improve the support information processes and systems that produce financial and management information. It is the Audit Committee’s responsibility to supervise the process for the preparation and disclosure of financial information; As such, the Audit Committee held meetings to monitor these processes with the members of the Executive Committee, the Statutory Auditor and external auditor and with those responsible for accounts and management planning and control.

Description of the remuneration policy for management and supervisory bodies as referred to in Article 2 of Law No 28/2009 of June 19 2009 As an issuer of shares admitted to trading on the regulated market, REN is subject to Law No 28/2009 of June 19 2009 as well as to CMVM recommendations; Therefore, on one hand, in the interest of transparency and legitimacy of the setting of remuneration policy (according to the principle of say-on-pay, internationally recognized with regard to good corporate governance) and, on the other hand, for purposes of compliance with the legal provisions and recommendations described above, the Remuneration Committee submits for the appraisal of the Annual General Meeting, a declaration on the remuneration policy for corporate bodies for the 2012-2014 term of office, the terms of which were subject to prior resolutions by this Committee. The conclusion of the second stage in the REN privatization process reduced the state’s holdings in Company capital, meaning that REN went from being a public company to an invested company and as such, the system for state companies with its specificities and limitations, ceased to apply to the company in most circumstances; Given that REN is a company of mostly private capital and issues shares admitted to trading in the regulated Euronext Lisbon market, the Remunerations Committee carried out an in-depth review of the remunerations policy and conditions applicable to members of the REN Board of Directors, Audit Committee and Board of the General Meeting, for the term of office underway corresponding to the three-year period of 2012-2014; For this purpose, the abovementioned Committee conducted several joint studies with specialized and independent consultants, more specifically with regard to market analyses and a study of the legal recommended framework applicable to remunerations; 308 corporate governance Further to these checks, the REN Remunerations Committee approved a new remuneration policy which has been in effect since 1 June 2012. On 30 April 2013, a declaration by the Remunerations Committee on the remuneration policy for members of corporate bodies was unanimously approved at the General Meeting. This declaration includes the information set out in Article 2 of law No 28/2009 of 19 June 2009. In accordance with CMVM recommendation II.3.3, the abovementioned declaration also contains: (i) identification and explanation of the criteria to determine the remuneration to be awarded to members of corporate bodies; and (ii) information on the enforceability or non-enforceability of payments for the dismissal or termination of duties of directors. The remuneration policy for Executive Directors follows the guidelines set out below: • To be simple clear, transparent and aligned with REN culture; •T o be suitable and fitting to the size, nature, scope and specificity of REN’s business; •T o ensure total remuneration which is competitive and equitable and in line with the best practices and latest trends seen nationally and in Europe, particularly with regard to REN’s peers; •T o incorporate a fixed component which matches the duties and responsibility of the directors; •T o incorporate a variable component which is reasonable overall in relation to the fixed remuneration, with one short-term component and another medium-term component, both with maximum limits; •T o establish a variable remuneration indexed to individual performance assessment and that of the company, in accordance with achievement of specific quantifiable aims which are in line with Company and shareholder interests; and •T o establish a variable remuneration component based on the mediumterm indexed to the evolution of the REN share price, thus ensuring that the remuneration of executive directors is bound to the sustainability of results and the creation of wealth for shareholders. Based on these principles, the remuneration of executive directors is mainly determined based on four general criteria: (i) competitiveness, taking into consideration the practices of the Portuguese market; (ii) equity, in that remuneration must be based on uniform, consistent, fair and balanced criteria; (iii) assessment of performance, in accordance with duties and the level of responsibility of the person in question, as well as the assumption of suitable levels of risk and compliance with the rules applicable to REN business; and (iv) alignment of directors’ interests with the Company’s and its sustainability and creation of long-term wealth. The remuneration of the executive directors includes a fixed component and a variable component. The variable component consists of a parcel which seeks to remunerate short-term performance and another with the same objective based on medium-term performance, as described in further detail below. The members of the Audit Committee, the non-executive directors and the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors are entitled to fixed monthly remuneration, defined in line with the best practices observed at large-scale companies in the Portuguese market. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 309 The remuneration of the members of the Board of the General Meeting corresponds to an annual fixed sum. There are no approved variable remuneration plans or programmes that consist of the allocation of shares, options to acquire shares or other incentive schemes based on a variation of the price of shares for members of the management or supervisory bodies (or persons discharging managerial functions, within the meaning of Article 248(B)(3) of the Portuguese Securities Code), without prejudice to the method of calculating medium-term variable remuneration (MTVR) Furthermore, there is no system of retirement benefits for the members of the management or supervisory bodies (or persons discharging managerial functions, within the meaning of Article 248(B)(3) of the Portuguese Securities Code). III.70. Information on how remuneration is structured so as to allow alignment of the interests of members of the management body with the Company’s long-term interests, as well as how it is based on performance assessment and discourages taking on excessive risk As mentioned in III.69, non-executive directors’ remuneration (including the members of the Audit Committee) consists exclusively of a fixed component, paid in 12 monthly instalments over the year, and is not connected to the performance or value of REN, meeting the applicable recommendations on this matter. The remuneration structure of executive directors consists of a fixed component and a variable component. There is an adequate proportionality between both components, as explained in III.69. In accordance with the remuneration policy approved for the three year period of 2012-2014 and described in the Remuneration Committee declaration approved by the Annual General Meeting of 2013, the variable component of remuneration for 2013 may include a short-term parcel (‘STVR’) and a medium-term parcel (‘MTVR), both based on a performance assessment with weighting on key individual performance indicators of the director and the performance of the Company itself. Such indicators, described in more detail in III.71, seek to bring the interests of the executive directors closer to the long-term interests of REN and its shareholders. Particularly, MTVR has the following characteristics which contribute to the alignment of the interests of REN executive directors with those of the Company and shareholders: • MTVR is set in Remuneratory Units (RU) which refer to every financial year in the term of office in which each executive director has performed duties; •E  ach Remuneratory Unit has a value corresponding to the REN share price at the date the MTVR is set and this value evolves in a manner equal to that of the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for REN shares; The main aims of the proportionality between the fixed and variable components and the limits to variable remuneration (i.e. between 20% and 120% of fixed remuneration, in a gradual manner, without prejudice to the evolution in RU) are to discourage taking on excessive risk and to stimulate the adoption of a suitable risk management strategy. III.71. Reference, if applicable, to the existence of a variable remuneration component and information on possible impact of performance assessment on this component As has already been mentioned, the remuneration structure of the Executive Committee consists of fixed and variable components, and in accordance with the remuneration policy approved for the 2012-2014 term of office and described in the Remuneration Committee declaration approved by the Annual General 310 corporate governance Meeting of 2013, the variable component of remuneration for 2013 may include short and medium-term parcels – STVR and MTVR74. The awarding of STVR and MTVR is subject to the following common requirements: •The awarding of the variable component of remuneration only takes place after approval of the accounts for each financial year, after the performance assessment for the year to which the payment refers and only when predefined objectives have been complied with, measured with individual and company performance indicators indexed to targets in the REN strategic plan. •The degree of achievement of defined goals is measured through an annual performance assessment, based on a predefined model Therefore, if compliance with goals falls below 80% (minimum performance level), no payment of variable remuneration takes place. However, if compliance with goals lies between 80% and 120% or greater, the corresponding total variable remuneration will equate to between 20% and 120% of the fixed remuneration. The abovementioned annual performance assessment, for purposes of awarding STVR and MTVR during the term of office, is carried out based on the following REN Key Performance Indicators (KPI) on a consolidated basis (weighting of 80%) and the individual performance assessment (weighting of 20%), which, if negative, will result in the non-awarding of short-term variable remuneration: i) Average cost of debt; ii) Return on invested capital; iii) EBITDA abroad; iv) Earnings per share (compound annual growth rate – CAGR); v) EBITDA CAGR. Short-term variable remuneration a) S  hort-Term Variable Remuneration (STVR) is paid in cash, depending on the annual performance assessment, with the sum being paid varying in accordance with the degree of achievement of goals relating to Key Performance Indicators. b) T  herefore, if the annual performance assessment falls below 80% (minimum performance level), no payment of STVR takes place. However, if the annual performance assessment lies between 80% and 120% or greater, the corresponding STVR will equate to between 10% and 60% of the fixed remuneration. Medium-term variable remuneration a) Medium-Term Variable Remuneration (MTVR) aims to strengthen the alignment of the interests of REN executive directors with those of the Company and shareholders. This payment will vary depending on the annual performance assessment (already described in the previous point) and will follow the same model as that for STVR. III.72. Deferral of the payment of the variable remuneration component, with mention of the deferral period The awarding of STVR will correspond to a sum of up to 50% of total variable remuneration awarded with regard to each financial year in question. 74 Cf. points III.69. and III.70. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 311 In turn, STVR is set in RU which refer to every financial year of the term of office and is structured to ensure deferral of payment and is conditioned to continued positive performance, through the following channels: • Each RU has a value corresponding to the REN share price at the date the MTVR is set and this value evolves in a manner equal to that of TSR for REN shares; •T  he entitlement executive directors have to convert their RUs is attained on a successive basis. The units are broken down into thirds and the first 1/3 is consolidated at the end of the first financial year while the remaining 2/3 are consolidated at the end of subsequent financial years, provided that the director performs executive duties in the respective financial year (except if termination occurs as a result of acquisition of a controlling position in REN); •R Us will be automatically converted into cash or, should the REN General Meeting come to deliberate (and in accordance with the terms thereby established), into REN shares, either partially or totally, when three years have elapsed since the date on which they were awarded. Bearing in mind the above, payment of MTVR for 2012 is awarded in 2013 and deferred for a period of three years. III.73. Criteria on which the awarding of variable remuneration in shares is based, as well as on the maintaining, by the executive directors, of these shares, on possible signing of contracts which refer to the shares, more specifically hedging contracts or risk transfer contracts, the respective limit, and their relation to the value of total annual remuneration At present, no plans to award variable remuneration in shares exist, and as such REN considers that CMVM recommendation III.6. does not apply. Therefore, despite the remuneration policy approved by the Remuneration Committee for the term of office determining that, within the scope of MTVR, RU can be converted into REN shares, either partially or totally, should the REN General Meeting so deliberate, this has not as yet taken place. Should the General Meeting make such a decision, this deliberation shall govern the conditions for awarding the shares in question, including the potential requirement to maintain the shares or part of them until the end of the term of office. Furthermore, bearing in mind the objectives sought through the remuneration model stipulated herein, executive directors of the Company shall not take out contracts either with the company or with third parties, designed to mitigate the risk inherent to the variability of their remuneration. III.74. Criteria on which the awarding of variable remuneration in options is based and indication of the deferral period and the price There are no variable remuneration plans or programmes that consist of the allocation of shares, options to acquire shares or other incentive systems based on a variation of the price of shares for members of the management or supervisory bodies or persons discharging managerial functions, within the meaning of Article 248-B(3) of the Portuguese Securities Code. III.75. Main parameters and basis of any system of annual bonuses and any other non-monetary benefits In 2013, Executive Directors were entitled to the use of a car and a mobile telephone, for the performance of their duties, plus health insurance, life insurance and personal accident insurance. It is estimated that the value of these benefits is € 20 000/director. 312 corporate governance There is no system of annual bonuses or any other non-monetary benefits, beyond the variable component of remuneration described above and in the previous paragraph. III.76. Main characteristics of the complementary pensions or early retirement schemes for directors and the date on which they were approved at the General Meeting, in individual terms There is no system of retirement benefits or pensions for the members of the management and supervisory bodies.

V. Agreements with remuneration implications V.83. Contractual limitation for compensation to be paid for unfair dismissal of a director and its relation to the variable remuneration component In accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the Remunerations Committee with regard to the financial year of 2013, in the event of termination of management duties through agreement or unfair dismissal, no compensation will be paid, beyond that legally required, if the termination or dismissal is due to the unsuitable performance of the director. The legally owed compensation, in the case of unfair dismissal, corresponds to the compensation for damages suffered, yet must not exceed the amount of compensation that they would otherwise received up to the end of their elected term. 314 corporate governance V.84. Reference to the existence and description, with the amounts involved indicated, of agreements between the Company and the members of the management body or other officers, in the meaning of Article 248(B)(3) of the Portuguese Security Code, that would award compensation in the event of resignation, unfair dismissal or termination of the employment relationship, following a change in control over the Company.

Control mechanisms and procedures I.89. Mechanisms implemented by the Company for purposes of controlling transactions with related parties (please see the concept resulting from IAS 24) So as to facilitate control by the Audit Committee of transactions concluded or to be concluded by REN or its subsidiaries with related parties and the methodology to be adopted in the event of potential conflict of interests, the REN Audit Committee proposed internal regulations to the Board of Directors for the Analysis and Control of Transactions with Related Parties and Prevention of Conflict of Interest, which were approved by the Board of Directors on 8 November 2012. In accordance with the internal regulations on Analysis and Control of Transactions with Related Parties and Prevention of Conflict of Interest, which ANNUAL REPORT 2013 315 are in line with IAS 24 and CMVM recommendation V.2, transactions conducted between a related part75 and REN or its subsidiaries, which are covered by the following situations, shall be submitted by the management body for prior opinion by the Audit Committee76: •T  he purchase and/or sale of goods, provision of services or contract work valued at over €1 000 000; • The acquisition or disposal of shareholdings; •N  ew loans, financing and subscription of financial investments resulting in an overall annual indebtedness exceeding €100 000 000, except when dealing with a simple renewal of existing circumstances or operations undertaken within the framework of pre-existing contractual conditions. •A  ny transaction which, though not covered by the above criteria, has a value that exceeds €1 000 000 or must be considered relevant for this purpose by the Board of Directors, by virtue of its nature or its particular susceptibility to giving rise to a conflict of interests. In turn, any business between a Related Party and REN or one of its Affiliates, which does not fall into any of the above circumstances, must be submitted by the management body to the Audit Committee for its consideration77. If the Audit Committee issues an unfavourable prior expert opinion, approval of the transaction by the Board of Directors must be particularly well-grounded so as to demonstrate that the completion of the transaction is in line with pursuing the corporate interest of REN or of its Affiliates and that the resulting advantages for them outweigh in a positive manner the disadvantages identified by the Audit Committee78 . Finally, the Audit Committee also submits recommendations to the Board of Directors with regard sto measures to prevent and identify conflicts of interest . Moreover, in accordance with the Board of Directors internal regulations, transactions with related parties for sums exceeding €500 000 or, regardless of the sum, any transaction which may be considered as not being executed under market conditions are matters which may not be delegated to the Executive Committee.

The procedures and criteria outlined herein are applicable to transactions with the holders of qualified shareholdings or entities with which they are in any relationship pursuant to Article 20 of the Portuguese Securities Code, given that these are by definition considered to be related parties in accordance with the internal regulations for the ‘Analysis and Control of Transactions with Related Parties and Prevention of Conflict of Interest’. II. Information relating to business II.92. Indication of the location of accounting documents providing information regarding business with Related Parties, in accordance with IAS 24 or, alternatively, reproductions of this information Point 34 of the Appendix to the financial statements of the 2013 Management Report, in accordance with IAS 24, includes a description of the principal elements of business with Related Parties, including business and operations carried out between the Company and holders of qualified shareholdings or associated entities. Business between the Company and the holders of qualified shareholdings or entities with which they are in any relationship pursuant to Article 20 of the Portuguese Securities Code was conducted under normal market conditions, during normal REN business, and was largely a result of regulatory obligations, and as such, CMVM recommendation V.1. was adopted. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 317 1. Identification of the model of corporate PART II governance adopted 6.2 The Corporate Governance Code to which the company is subject or has decided voluntarily to abide by should be identified, under the terms and ASSESSMENT pursuant to Article 2 of these regulations. OF CORPORATE The place where the texts of the Corporate Governance Code to which the GOVERNANCE Company is subject are made available to the public should also be indicated ((Article 245(1)). In 2013, the regulatory and advisory framework for matters of corporate governance was subject to a major overhaul. Under the terms of this overhaul, and as a Company issuing shares that were admitted for trading on the Euronext Lisbon regulated market, REN finds itself subject to, in matters of disclosure of information relating to corporate governance, to the regime established by the Portuguese Securities Code, in Law 28/2009, of 19 June, and the Securities Market Commission regulations 4/2013 (the latter was approved in 2013 and is applicable to governance reports referred to in this exercise). Amongst the many amendments to the Securities Market Commission regulations 4/2013, it is worth noting the possibility for issuing companies to opt for the adoption of the CMVM governance code or an alternative code issued by a dedicated entity. Also in this respect, and in an advisory sense, the Securities Market Commission and the Portuguese Institute for Corporate Governance (IPCG) approved, respectively, in 2013 and 2014, new corporate governance codes, the outcome of a long process of discussion and consultation with various players in the market. Considering this lengthy period for reflection in 2013 and given the fact that 2014 sees the end of the current mandate of the Company’s corporate bodies, during 2013 REN referred to the Securities Market Commission’s Corporate Governance Code, in light of which the current governing bodies have come to put their operating principles. Therefore, in 2014 REN will consider the eventual adoption of an alternative code, in that this may result in a strengthening of the corporate governance model, especially considering the IPCG initiative. In any case, the Company understands that the current model and principles of corporate governance are already in line with a significant number of the recommendations included in the IPCG’s Governance Code. In summary, for the purposes of this report, REN took the decision to adopt the recommendations laid out in the Corporate Governance Code of the Securities Market Commission, approved in 2013, which can be viewed at www.cmvm.pt. 2. Analysis of compliance with the model of corporate governance adopted Pursuant to Article 245-A(1)(a) a statement should be included on the acceptance of the Corporate Governance Code to which the issuer is subject, stating any divergence from said code and the reasons for said divergence. 318 corporate governance The information submitted should include, for each recommendation: a) Information that enables the verification of compliance with the recommendation or referring to the part of the report where the issue is discussed in detail (chapter, title, paragraph, page); b) grounds for the non-compliance or partial compliance thereof; c) In the event of non-compliance or partial compliance, the details of any alternative mechanism adopted by the company for the purpose of pursuing the same objective of the recommendation. As discussed above, REN took the decision to adopt all recommendations laid out in the Corporate Governance Code of the Securities Market Commission, approved in 2013. Therefore, REN hereby declares that it fully adopts all the abovementioned CMVM recommendations on corporate governance laid down in said Code, except for Recommendations I.1. (partially), I.2., II.1.4. and II.3.3. (partially), which are not complied with for the reasons given below. The chart below identifies CMVM recommendations and individually mentions those that have been fully adopted by REN and those that have not. Also indicated are the chapters in this report where a more detailed description of measures taken for their adoption may be found with the aim of complying with the said CMVM recommendations. Indication on the adoption Chapter Recommendation / Chapter (80) of the Recommendation of the Report I. Voting and Company control I.1. Companies shall encourage shareholders to attend and Partially adopted Part 1, chapter B.I.12. vote at general meetings and shall not set an excessively large (Electronic voting is not possible at present number of shares required for the entitlement of one vote, and as REN considers that the participation implement the means necessary to exercise the right to vote of shareholders at General Meetings by mail and electronically. is fully provided for through vote by correspondence and representation mechanisms as described above in the respective chapter. Furthermore, bearing in mind particularly its shareholder structure, the reduced dispersion of capital and the fact no correspondence votes have been received at recent General Meetings, REN considers that electronic voting would not provide any benefits for shareholders. In summary, the Company considers that correspondence vote and the possibility of representation are sufficient mechanisms to comply with the aim of this recommendation to promote active shareholder participation at General Meetings.) 80 Chapter’ refers to CMVM’s Corporate Governance Code. ANNUAL REPORT 2013 319 Indication on the adoption Chapter Recommendation / Chapter (80) of the Recommendation of the Report I.2. Companies shall not set a resolution-fixing quorum that Not adopted Part 1, chapters outnumbers that which is prescribed by law. (The quorum required to constitute at first B.I.14. and C.I.48. call, is 51% of capital. Moreover, the quorum for adopting resolutions on changes to the Articles of Association, merger, demerger, transformation or dissolution is two thirds of votes issued, whether at first or second call. The aim of the mechanisms set out in Art.11(1) and (2 ) of the Articles of Association is to ensure adequate representation of shareholders in light of the nature of the activities carried out by the Company and its voting rights. In accordance with No 3 of the same Article, resolutions for changes relating to Articles 7(A), 12(3) and 11 of the Articles of Association require the approval of three quarters of the votes issued. In summary, the rules in the Articles of Association in question are best suited to the specificities of the Company, bearing in mind the underlying aim of this recommendation and that this is related to a matter which is strictly within the realm of shareholder decision.) I.3. Companies shall not establish mechanisms intended to cause Adopted Part 1, chapter B.I.12. mismatching between the right to receive dividends or the subscription of new securities and the voting right of each common share, unless duly justified in terms of long-term interests of shareholders. I.4.

Independent verification of sustainability information included in the Annual Report 2013 of REN Redes Energéticas Nacionais, SGPS, SA (Free translation from the original in Portuguese) Introduction In accordance with the request of the board of Directors of REN Redes Energéticas Nacionais, SGPS, S.A. (REN), we performed an independent verification of sustainability information included in the Annual Report 2013 (Report), in particular the chapter 4. Sustainability at REN and respective GRI Index . Independent verification was performed according to instructions and criteria established by REN, as referred in the Report, and according to the principles and extent described in the Scope below. Responsibility REN’s Board of Directors is responsible for all the information presented in the Report, as well as for the assessment criteria and for the systems and processes supporting information collection, consolidation, validation and reporting. Our responsibility is to conclude on the adequacy of the information, based upon our independent verification standards and agreed reference terms. We do not assume any responsibility over any purpose, people or organization. Scope Our procedures were planned and executed using the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) and having the Global Reporting Initiative, version 3 (GRI3) and AA1000APS Accountability Principles Standard 2008 as reference, in order to obtain a moderate level of assurance on both the performance information reported and the underlying processes and systems. The extent of our procedures, consisting of inquiries, analytical tests and some substantive work, was less significant than in a full audit. Therefore, the level of assurance provided is also lower. For the GRI3 and AA1000APS standard, our work consisted on the verification of the management’s self declaration on the application level of the GRI3 and level of adherence to the AA1000APS principles. The following procedures were performed: (i) Inquiries to management and senior officials responsible for areas under analysis, with the purpose of understanding how the information system is structured and their awareness of issues included in the Report; (ii) Identify the existence of internal management procedures leading to the implementation of economical, environmental and social policies; PricewaterhouseCoopers & Associados Sociedade de Revisores Oficiais de Contas, Lda.

Data and information analyzed include, beside the contents of the Report, information referred on the Report and available at the 2013 Annual Report. Independence We develop our work in line with standard ISAE 3000 independence requirements, including compliance with PwC's independence policies and code of ethics of the International Ethics Standards Board of Accountants (IESBA). Conclusions Based on our work described in this report, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that internal control related to the collection, consolidation, validation and reporting of the performance information referred above is not effective, in all material respects. Based on the assumptions described on the scope, we conclude that the Report includes the data and information required for level A, according to GRI3. Comments/Remarks During the verification process, we identified areas and opportunities for improvement, which will be included in a report to management. Notwithstanding the above findings, we believe that the REN should consider the following comments, which aim to improve the sustainability reporting of REN:  It stands out as a positive aspect the new Sustainability Information System, implemented in 2012 by REN, for collecting, monitoring and reporting the sustainability information. It is recommended to ensure the collection and reporting of sustainability information with the periodicity established in the system, as well as the maintenance of evidence that supports the data reported, in order to allow regular and systematic monitoring of REN in this matter.  Principle of inclusivity: REN revised in 2013 the stakeholder mapping and conducted a consultation process in terms of sustainability. The results will be considered in the review of the strategic sustainability priorities, to be reported in the sustainability report of 2014. Additionally, REN has several periodic or continuous communication/engagement mechanisms with its stakeholders, thus ensuring regular interaction with them. REN Redes Energéticas Nacionais, SGPS, S.A. PwC 2  Principle of materiality: REN periodically reviews the relevant sustainability issues in which focus its management and communication, using objective criteria and processes for the purpose. REN conducted in 2013 a new stakeholder consultation, whose results should be included in sustainability reporting 2014.  Principle of responsiveness: REN seeks to address the information needs and concerns of their stakeholders and define sufficient mechanisms for this purpose. The adoption of international standards and guidelines of reference in its management and reporting of information ensures the comprehensiveness and relevance of sustainability information managed and communicated. It is recommended a greater alignment of sustainability reporting with the issues identified as relevant in this matter. Lisbon, March 21, 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers & Associados SROC, Lda.
