Executive Vice President, Downstream achieve as efficient operations as possible. What other initiatives and investments are in place to improve Downstream efficiency? Regarding the future, what does What are the impacts of these trends from the European perspective? We are continuously searching for new and profitable business all this mean for MOL Group Downstream in general? The 2000-2008 period was the ’golden-age’ of European refining because feedstock prices and production operating opportunities and we are ready to start newly investing to We always strive for excellence in our core business by optimising costs were favourable and global and European crude oil consumption and the demand for oil products increased strengthen our captive markets further, tighten the integration operations to maximise the profitability of current production continuously which improved the utilisation of European refineries. Starting in 2009, things drastically changed of our business and broaden our product portfolio. The most assets. In addition, we concentrate on customer orientation and compared to the ‘golden age’. Not only did all profitability vanish but in 2011, almost all European refineries found important of these are some new investments and asset portfolio efficiency improvement in all areas of Downstream operations and themselves on the negative side; they were simply losing money. In 2013, due to an increase in refining efficiency, optimisations. MOL Group has decided to build a new LDPE unit so we are planning to launch the next generation of the efficiency some refineries managed to stop generating losses. But today, we can’t really say that the European refining industry is at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery to underpin its competitiveness improvement programme from 2015 onwards that will bring us maximising profits, it is merely minimising its losses. The European downstream business is still kept under pressure by with a larger higher-quality petrochemicals product portfolio. The the desired result: increased competitiveness in the coming years. the worldwide trends I mentioned just now and is still not supported by local governments and regulations. We here in 220 kt/year capacity unit is planned to start operations from the Regarding our investments, our new petrochemicals units, the Europe are struggling more and more to adapt to all this increasing international competition. In the meantime, we are end of 2015 thus enabling a higher naphtha off-take from our Slovnaft LDPE unit and the TVK butadiene unit, are expected to faced with ever more layers of costly regulations in Europe and significantly distorted energy markets. refineries.

In the Matjushkinsky Block, production decreased to 3.9 mboepd, 7% lower than 2012. This was mainly a consequence of lower than expected flow rates of new wells set up in 2012, stronger than expected natural depletion of existing wells and the number of producing wells being changed from 59 to 55 by the year end, as 4 new wells were drilled and 8 wells transformed to water injection wells.

A quarterly Financial Risk Report is submitted to the senior management. As a general approach, risk management considers the business as a well-balanced integrated portfolio. MOL actively manages its Foreign Currency Risk Management Financial Statements report commodity exposures for the following purposes only: At group level, the Group has a net long USD, EUR, RON, and net short HUF, HRK, RUB operating cash flow position from ecoCorporate Level Objectives – maintenance of financial ratios and targeted financial results, protection against large cash transaction nomic point of view. exposures etc. , Business Unit Objectives – To reduce the exposure of a Business Unit’s cash flow to market price fluctuations in case of changes When MOL is in high gearing status, the Group follows the basic economic currency risk management principle that the currency mix from the normal course of business (e.g.: planned refinery shutdowns) of the debt portfolio should reflect the net operating cash flow position of the Group (‘natural hedge’). MOL follows two different strategies based on the level of Net Gearing. In the two scenarios, Risk Management focuses on the followings: In a High Gearing situation, the primary objective of risk management is to reduce the probability of breaching debt covenants, The Group may use cross currency swaps to adjust the currency mix of the debt portfolio. As of 31 December 2013 and 2012 there where a breach would seriously impair the company’s ability to fund its operations. were no open cross currency transactions. In Low Gearing status, the focus of risk management shall be directed more toward to the protection of shareholder value by maintaining discipline in CAPEX spending, ensuring risk-aware project selection. The Group has two long-term international gas transit agreements (expiring in 2017 and 2019) under which consideration is calculated in SDR.

This derivative has been separated from the underlying contract and designated as a cash flow hedge to the underlying gas transit conIn line with MOL’s risk management policy, no speculative transactions are allowed. Any derivative transaction the company may enter tract. The fair value of the embedded SDR derivative is a net receivable of HUF 864 million (HUF 700 million net of deferred tax) as of 31 is under ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements and Hungarian law governed Dealing Master Agreement December 2013 (see Note 12). The corresponding figure as of 31 December 2012 was HUF 2,434 million net receivable (HUF 1,972 million in the Hungarian Market. net of deferred tax). The decrease in the fair value of this instrument has been recognized in other comprehensive income.

The inputs to the model were as follows: scheme programme, HUF 296 million has been recorded as an expense with the corresponding increase in the equity. 2013 2012 Weighted average exercise price (HUF / share) 18,412 15,083 Details of the share-settled incentive scheme during the year were as follows: Share price as of 31 December (HUF / share) 14,426 17,749 2013 2012 Expected volatility based on historical data 31.80% 44.18% Number of shares vested 13,500 13,500 Expected dividend yield 2.82% 2.61% Share price at the date of grant (HUF / share) 17,914 17,765 Estimated maturity (years) 2.54 2.77 Risk free interest rate 4.44% 0.15% Performance Share Plan for top and senior management Other part of the Long Term Incentive Plan for the top and senior management is the Performance Share Plan that was introduced in 2013 replacing the previous Profit Sharing Plan. The Performance Share Plan is a three-year cash based programme using the Comparative Share Price methodology with following characteristics: Programme starts each year on a rolling scheme with a three-year vesting period. Payments are due after the third year. Target is the development of MOL’s share price compared to relevant and acknowledged regional and industry specific indicators (the CETOP20 and Dow Jones Emerging Market Titans Oil&Gas 30 Index). Basis of the evaluation is the average difference in MOL’s year-on-year (12 months) share price performance in comparison to the Notes to the Consolidated benchmark indices during three years. Payout rates are defined based on the over / underperformance of MOL share price. The rate of incentive is influenced by the individual short-term performance. Financial Statements report As the previous 1-year based Profit Sharing incentive was replaced by the 3-year based Performance Share Plan, a 1-year based incentive was introduced for 2013 and a 2-year based incentive was introduced for 2013-2014 to ensure continuity. No payment is expected with respect to 2013 based on this new incentive form. Share Incentive scheme for the members of the Board of Directors According to resolution of the 2012 Annual General Meeting of the parent company, in case of the members of Board of Directors, the former profit sharing incentive programme had been replaced by a new, share-settled incentive scheme exclusively for the members of the Board of Directors ensuring their interest in the long-term increase of MOL share price. The members of the Board of Directors become entitled to defined annual amount of MOL shares based on the number of days spent in the position. 100 shares per month are granted to each director, the Chairman of the Board is entitled to an additional amount of 25 shares per month. If an executive director is in charge as a Chairman of the Board then this additional amount of shares should be granted to the non-executive Deputy Chairman. The new incentive system ensures the interest of the Board of Directors in the long-term increase of the MOL share price as 2/3 of the shares vested in the year are under transferring restriction for one year. 160 The notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements MOL Group Annual Report 2013 161 Historical Summary Financial Information (IFRS) › Consolidated Income Statements for the Years Ended 31 December 2009 2010 2010 2011 2011 2012 2012 2013 2013 Restated Restated Restated Restated Restated Restated Restated HUF HUF USD HUF USD HUF USD HUF USD million million million* million million*** million million***** million million******* Net revenue and other operating income 3,364,460 4,324,548 20,781 5,366,485 26,712 5,536,986 24,565 5,476,113 24,480 Total operating expenses 3,115,889 4,079,070 19,601 5,113,303 25,452 5,331,691 23,654 5,494,741 24,563 Profit from operations 248,571 245,478 1,180 253,182 1,260 205,295 911 (18,628) (83) Profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent 115,796 103,958 500 153,925 766 151,484 672 21,442 96 Consolidated Balance Sheets as at 31 December 2009 2010 2010 2011 2011 2012 2012 2013 2013 Restated Restated Restated Restated Restated Restated Restated Historical Summary FinanHUF HUF USD HUF USD HUF USD HUF USD million million million* million million*** million million***** million million******* Non-current assets 3,073,859 3,153,234 15,152 3,367,070 13,989 3,170,278 14,352 2,802,642 12,993 cial Information (IFRS) Current assets 1,093,748 1,332,495 6,403 1,626,714 6,758 1,595,929 7,225 1,838,246 8,522 Total assets 4,167,607 4,485,729 21,555 4,993,784 20,747 4,766,207 21,576 4,640,888 21,515 Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent 1,294,005 1,435,070 6,896 1,652,438 6,865 1,699,116 7,692 1,687,739 7,824 Minority interest 535,647 539,407 2,592 591,203 2,456 547,205 2,477 473,517 2,195 Non-current liabilities 1,272,925 1,392,867 6,693 1,344,992 5,588 1,146,314 5,189 1,078,925 5,002 Current liabilities 1,065,030 1,118,385 5,374 1,405,151 5,838 1,373,572 6,218 1,400,707 6,494 Total equity and liabilities 4,167,607 4,485,729 21,555 4,993,784 20,747 4,766,207 21,576 4,640,888 21,515 Consolidated Stetements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended 31 December 2009 2010 2010 2011 2011 2012 2012 2013 2013 Restated Restated Restated Restated Restated Restated Restated HUF HUF USD HUF USD HUF USD HUF USD million million million* million million*** million million***** million million******* Net cash provided by operating activities 397,891 378,886 1,821 372,950 1,856 454,033 2,014 614,685 2,748 Net cash provided by / (used in) investing activities (266,658) (279,475) (1,343) (198,709) (989) (298,509) (1,324) (124,994) (559) Net cash provided by / (used in) financing activities (169,713) 24,764 119 (188,903) (940) (148,992) (661) (239,251) (1,070) (Decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents (38,480) 124,175 597 (14,662) (73) 6,532 29 250,440 1,120 * 2010 average HUF/USD 208.1 ** 2010 year-end HUF/USD 208.7 *** 2011 average HUF/USD 200.9 **** 2011 year-end HUF/USD 240.7 ***** 2012 average HUF/USD 225.4 ****** 2012 year-end HUF/USD 220.9 ******* 2013 average HUF/USD 223.7 ******** 2013 year-end HUF/USD 215.7 162 MOL Group Annual Report 2013 163 Key Group operating data › Upstream Proved reserves Natural gas Crude oil Combined MCM Bcf kt million bbl million boe The tables presented below provide supplementary information for the Group upstream activities.

Here, 3.2 Environment we continued to carry out projects in order to reduce our emissions to the environment. In the oil and gas industry, flaring means the controlled burning of unused hydrocarbon for technical or safety reasons. The gas flared General aim: Reduce environmental footprint in Upstream is ´associated gas´ and in Downstream some of the gas generated during the refining process is flared for reasons of safety. The amount of gas that is flared represents only a small fraction of the total amount produced and processed but it is not insignificant. Achievements: CO2 generated from flaring accounts for around 2.5% of the total direct GHG emissions of MOL Group. The amount of gas flared from our activities is shown in the tables below: The number of spills with HC content greater than 1 m3 was Flaring in Upstream (where MOL Group is operator) [GRI OG6, EN16] reduced to 18 in 2013 (from 21 in 2012) and the volume to 133 m3 (321 in 2012).

Two main reasons explain this increase: performance • At Rijeka Refinery between 2011-2012 a new Hydrogen Generation Unit (HGU) and a new turbo generator were put into operation, hence water withdrawals increased by 27% compared with 2010. • Compared with 2012 when a general turnaround took place in the refinery, in 2013 the level of production was higher. Various initiatives continue being implemented in order to keep the Group on the right track to achieving its targets: • In Rijeka Refinery in 2013 total water withdrawal was reduced by 2.85% when compared with 2012 and the water intensity indicator was improved from 18.6 m3/t raw material to 15.78 m3/t raw material.

SLOVNAFT ’s focus was on increasing the awareness of local stakeholders of MOL as a socially responsible company. As part of its commitment to operating in a transparent way, SLOVNAFT started a new communication campaign in 2013 called “Responsible neighbour”. This campaign provides local communities with information about its activities.

Therefore, for each and every production activity we perform an environmental impact assessment (according to local regulations), and often a social impact assessment as well.

This goal has been achieved since the 2013 Annual Communications Plans has been prepared based on our new Social Engagement Handbook which has been issued Group-wide. This describes detailed ways of identifying issues and relevant stakeholders and then preparing an issue mapping matrix to support prioritisation of local communications needs. The activities derived from the matrix thus create the individual company-level Social Engagement strategies and plans. MOL Group and its member companies engage with local stakeholders in several different ways. The most common ways are making site-level connections, holding public hearings and undertaking joint activities with stakeholders. Naturally, we maintain ongoing communications with authorities and official bodies related to the regulatory environment and our license to operate.

However, together with other players in the energy industry, through royalties or production-sharing agreements, it may contribute a significant amount of the revenue of a government. As a result, MOL Group considers observance of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) principles and criteria for financial reporting to be key to good corporate governance and transparency in the oil and gas industry. MOL Group started to support EITI at an international level in 2013 and has been cooperating with EITI in the countries that are implementing the EITI. MOL Group has operations in two EITI compliant countries: in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and in Kazakhstan. Our activities are in the exploration phase in both countries. Indirect Economic Impact MOL Group operates in an industry that is capital and knowledge intensive, but not labour intensive. This means that the impacts on employment of its operations are typically limited, particularly at the country level. We do not think that our employment of people distorts the local labour market significantly. Employing local people, as well as hiring local contractors when it is possible, is beneficial to the local economy as the incomes generated increase the purchasing power of typically low-income communities. Some good example of when we hired local employees and also invested further in their education can be read in the chapter “University partnerships in MOL Group”. In the countries where we have upstream and midstream operations the most significant indirect impact of MOL Group on the economies of the countries of its main operations is through the energy it supplies. Click here to read detailed information about this topic. Another area where we can make a significant positive impact on the societies of host countries is by improving access to infrastructure and energy as a result of our operations. As a good example for this from 2013 MOL Pakistan has managed to meet the needs of domestic households and improve their livelihoods4 by increasing production of LPG. MOL Pakistan constructed a new gas processing facility (Makori GPF) in the Tal Block to extract LPG and process oil/condensate and natural gas. Makori GPF has a processing capacity of 150 MMscfd Gas, around 30,000 bbl/day of oil/condensate and can produce around 425 MT/day of LPG. Moreover, MOL Pakistan has played a leading role in providing financial aid by helping in the construction of a new Khushal Garh bridge which will provide a better (and therefore safer) connection between two main provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab which will result in numerous socio-economic and environmental benefits. By making it possible to use larger capacity tankers (378 bbls capacity), the efficiency of logistics will increase which will result in a substantial reduction in diesel consumption (app. 1,400 tonnes/ year) and consequently also of CO2 emissions (app. 4,300 tonnes of CO2/year), along with associated financial savings. 95% of the project was completed in 2013 and the project will be finalized in Q1, 2014. Sustainability: non-financial performance 4) Data from the middle of the last decade collected across 110 countries (World Bank, LPG report) show that in 30% of the countries surveyed, more than half of all households (most of which were upper-middle income households) reported to using LPG as a primary cooking fuel. In Pakistan, 66 % of urban households use LPG and they consume 60% more than rural households. 220 MOL Group Annual Report 2013 221 Sustainability data (Performance table) › Definitions of the indicators used below can be found on our website.
