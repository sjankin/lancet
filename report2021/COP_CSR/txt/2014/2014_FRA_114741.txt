They will need clean and affordable energy and efficient transportation. Current transport and energy infrastructures will need to change to avoid long-term impacts on the environment, health and climate change. All parties involved in economic development are aware of this fact. Operating at the heart of these issues, Alstom contributes to Sustainable Development through a socially responsible model, first by deploying the means to create the sustainable power generation, transmission and transport technologies of tomorrow, secondly, by integrating environmental and social concerns in all of its business operations and in its interaction with its stakeholders. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ALSTOM’S SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ALSTOM’S CONTRIBUTION TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: A PROACTIVE POLICY OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Addressing global challenges as strategic It is clear that the world is facing growing environmental and social opportunities challenges: yy the world’s population is expected to reach over 9 billion people in In October 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2050. As a consequence, global demand for energy and infrastructure (IPCC) demonstrated how human activity is affecting climate. The IPCC will grow. By 2035, the global energy demand is anticipated to rise by report and three more to come, increase the pressure on negotiators to more than one-third, while 60% of the infrastructure which will supply deliver a new global agreement in 2015, starting with the attendees of the world’s electricity are yet to be built (3); the COP19 (2) in 2013.

In that way, pursuing a CSR policy is therefore critical to anticipate and proactively manage the risks and opportunities they entail.
