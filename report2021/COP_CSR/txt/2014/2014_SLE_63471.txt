UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2013 UN GLOBAL COMPACT – COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2013 MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER KJAER GROUP A/S is committed to the principles articulated in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), which we joined November 2003. In 2007 KJAER GROUP A/S further confirmed our support for a cleaner environment by joining UN’s environmental initiative, Caring for the Climate. The UN’s principles for sustainability (the UN Global Compact) are an important point of reference for all activities and incorporated in the company’s governance framework: The KJAER GROUP Way of Management (KWOM). The KJAER GROUP Way of Management was introduced in 2008, and hereby the principles of the “Triple Bottom Line” whereby social and environmental targets and results are pursued in the same way as financial targets. In 2013, we continued the intensive work of implementing an integrated Quality, Environmental and Health and Safety Management system (HSEQ) in accordance with the international standards; ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. The benefits for the employees in reducing risk and creating a healthy work environment are indeed supporting the principles of the Global Compact Principles. Further, the reduction of negative effects and impacts on environment (pollution prevention; reduction of waste) will be of inspiration for other businesses and we will by example advocate a precautionary approach to environmental management in the society that we operate. The HiPO (High Performance Organization) survey measures areas that are essential drivers for developing the organization and the people and therefore closely connected with the Group’s activities in the area of CSR and the UN Global Compact commitment. Thus, on behalf of KJAER GROUP’s employees, I reaffirm our commitment to compliance with the 10 Principles of the Global Compact. We hope you will find this Communication on Progress informative and I invite you to view the KJAER GROUP website www.kjaergroup.com and our Annual Report 2013. Per S.
