Donating to support local UK community renewable energy projects and combining with traditional offsetting to achieve carbon neutral status, confirms them as innovative leaders setting a clear benchmark for the legal sector. Their considerable pro bono legal support for local renewable energy projects also continues to set new precedents and push PURE Leapfrog projects the community energy sector forward.” We continue to support Pure Leapfrog, a charity Robert Rabinowitz, CEO, PURE Leapfrog founded in 2006 by one of our partners, Steven McNab. It is a unique business-led charity that channels free professional advice into carbon reduction projects. In 2013, our London Real Estate and Projects departments advised PURE Leapfrog on debt finance and a complex lease structure for a large scale roll out of solar PV for 25 schools across Staffordshire. This is the UK’s largest community energy led programme which will deliver hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of free electricity and financial benefits for schools.

The brief set out international human rights and humanitarian law concerns and considerations connected to a proposed legislative reform to the military justice system. Shortly prior to the submission of the brief, the Colombian Constitutional Court ruled that the constitutional amendment by which the law had been enacted was invalid, and accordingly the law fell away. However, the debate over military jurisdiction in Colombia continues, and it is expected the Colombian Parliament will seek to a further iteration of the law, raising similar human rights issues. Our work with AB Colombia builds on our growing pro bono expertise connected to human rights and to Colombia.
