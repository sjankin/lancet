Avon Metals United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress Covering Calendar Year 2013 20th November 2014 To our Stakeholders: Avon Metals has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2007, and we continue to align our operations and strategies with its ten principles in the four key areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti‐corruption. Signing the Global Compact affirms our long‐standing commitment to strive to conduct business responsibly, and where possible, we actively encourage our business partners and other key stakeholders to join the initiative. Our Communication on Progress (COP) is made available to stakeholders through the UN Global Compact website (www.unglobalcompact.org) and our own corporate internet site (www.avonmetals.com). EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Avon Metals is a metals recycling company whose main activity is the production of 15,000 metric tonnes per annum of primary and secondary (scrap) based aluminium alloys in ingot form. These ingots are used by producers of aluminium products to ultimately make a wide range of everyday products. These include; beverage cans; pie case foil; car engines & wheels; aircraft engines and landing gear; building products ‐ such as door and window frame extrusions and curtain walling. The Company is also an important physical trader of various other primary, secondary (scrap) and specialty minor metals (including titanium and tungsten). Following a major restructuring and an increase in international trade, the company has prospered into a dynamic, forward thinking business that has been recognised in local and national business awards, including a Queen’s Award for Enterprise in Sustainable Development in 2009 for our 20/20 Vision CSR initiative, a Queen’s Award for Enterprise in International Trade in 2012 and a Major Commendation in the 2010 prestigious Business Commitment to the Environment (BCE) Environmental Leadership Awards. In addition a number of other awards have been awarded in the period up to 2012. Avon Metals has demonstrated that a pragmatic approach to investing in our people, and protecting the environment through sustainable development, can be commercially viable. In 2013 and continuing into 2014 we are re‐looking at our 20/20 Vision Sustainability Report in relation to the new GRI‐4 format and we will be working with the Minor Metals Trade Association MMTA to develop a new reporting system in 2014/2015 and it is expected that this will be available for use as an industry sector template in the future. We expect to implement the new reporting system in 2015. This further emphasises our commitment to Avon Metals Corporate Social Responsibility Activities to our Stakeholders’. Avon Metals MISSION STATEMENT To maximise shareholder value through the manufacture and timely supply of high quality, ethically produced, eco‐friendly innovative metals and alloy products and services to our global customers, whilst inspiring a safe, dynamic and challenging environment that enriches the lives of our employees and the communities within our sphere of influence.

In the past reporting period 2013, Avon Metals has not been subject to any investigations, legal cases, incidents or breaches of Avon's Code of Business Conduct, and in particular none related to human rights abuses. OHSAS 18001 Standard & Investors In People Standards are in development Avon has acknowledged the Securities and Exchange Commission final rule pursuant to section 1502 of the Dodd‐Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer protection Act relating to the use of conflict minerals, related to Tantalum and Tungsten in Avon's case. Avon has developed a Conflict Minerals Policy which was implemented companywide in 2013 and is available to the public on our website at the following address. http://www.avonmetals.com/conflict‐minerals/4571125000 The text of the policy is shown below. AVON METALS LTD STATEMENT ON CONFLICT MINERALS Summary of the Conflict Minerals Issue The Democratic Republic of the Congo (“DRC”) is a Central African country with vast mineral wealth, including reserves of cassiterite (source of Tin), columbite‐tantalite (aka coltan – source of Tantalum), wolframite (source of Tungsten) and Gold. For many years, armed groups have fought to control mines within the DRC; those armed groups have been cited for committing violent crimes against locals, including murder, rape and forced labour. Armed groups controlling mines smuggle minerals out of the DRC and the proceeds are used to further finance conflict and perpetuate criminal behaviour; hence, cassiterite, coltan, wolframite and Gold are considered conflict minerals. Avon Metals The elements Tantalum, Tin, Tungsten and Gold are metals used in many manufactured goods across many industries, including the aerospace, appliances, automotive, electronics, jewellery, medical and tool & die industries. Significant proportions of Tantalum and gold is used in electronic and electrical products. Similarly, a significant proportion of the global Tin supply is used in electronic solders. A small portion of the world’s Tungsten supply is used in electronic products as counter weights in cell phone vibrator bobs and in the manufacture of integrated circuits. The Dodd‐Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed into law in July 2010, contains requirements that U.S. companies report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on the origin of conflict minerals or their derivatives and show due diligence if conflict minerals are sourced from the DRC or an adjoining country. The goal of the act is to cut direct and indirect funding of armed groups engaged in conflict and human rights abuses. The SEC published regulations implementing Dodd‐Frank Section 1502 on August 22, 2012 which will form the basis of Avon Metals Ltd policy on Conflict Free Minerals. Avon Metals Ltd Approach on Conflict Minerals Avon Metals Ltd acknowledges the Securities and Exchange Commission final rule pursuant to section 1502 of the Dodd‐Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer protection Act relating to the use of conflict minerals as summarised below. Avon Metals Ltd is not involved in any way with the processing of Conflict Minerals . The Conflict Minerals Statutory Provision defines the term “Conflict Mineral” as cassiterite, columbite‐tantalite, Gold, wolframite, or their derivatives, or any other minerals or their derivatives determined by the Secretary of State to be financing conflict in the Covered Countries. This includes metals smelted from the above mentioned ores including Tantalum, Tungsten and Tin. Avon Metals Ltd does not source any material from the following countries as defined by EICC/GeSI Conflict Free Smelter Program Supply Chain Transparency Smelter Audit Protocol for Tin, Tantalum and Tungsten rev 21 December 2012:‐ Level 2 Countries Level 2 countries are defined as they are known or plausible countries for the smuggling, export out of region or transit of Tin/Tantalum/Tungsten containing mineral. ¾ Kenya ¾ Mozambique ¾ South Africa Avon Metals Level 3 Countries Level 3 countries are defined as the DRC and its nine adjoining countries, as outlined in section 1502 in the Dodd Frank Act. ¾ Angola ¾ Burundi ¾ Central African Republic ¾ Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) ¾ Republic of the Congo ¾ Rwanda ¾ South Sudan ¾ Tanzania ¾ Uganda ¾ Zambia Secondary materials are considered conflict free, according to the final ruling of the Securities and Exchange Commission final rule pursuant to section 1502 of the Dodd‐Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer protection Act. Furthermore, whilst secondary materials are currently exempt from the conflict mineral interpretation from all Country levels, Avon Metals Ltd only currently sources it's materials from Level 1 Countries defined as those countries with known active Tin/Tantalum/Tungsten ore production that are not identified as conflict regions or plausible areas of smuggling or export from these regions of Tin/Tantalum/Tungsten containing minerals as denoted above in Level 2 and Level 3 countries.

Tin Does not currently deal with or process Tin Gold Does not currently deal with or process Gold. Class 7 Transportation Statement Tantalum and niobium minerals, namely columbite‐tantalite and Tin Slags, often contain somewhat elevated levels of naturally occurring thorium and uranium, usually high enough for them to be classified as radioactive for handling and transport requiring adherence to international transportation regulations (class 7). Avon Metals Ltd does not trade these minerals and therefore has no obligations to meet the requirements of these regulations for the products it trades.

Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Avon Metals is a forward thinking, environmentally conscious company, and we have made a pledge to reduce our carbon footprint an ultimate target of becoming “carbon neutral”. Following the recent economic downturn, our carbon neutral target has been revised to 2020. Being carbon neutral involves calculating the total climate‐damaging carbon emissions, reducing them where possible, and then balancing the remaining emissions, often by purchasing a carbon offset e.g. paying to plant new trees or investing in “green” technologies such as solar and wind power. Avon Metals core business is centred about the procurement and recycling of scrap metals predominantly Aluminium, but also a whole host of other metals. Many of these secondary materials are reprocessed into new alloys for onward use in a vast range of industries or refined or traded on to be incorporated into new alloys or parts. Together with this sustainable business plan Avon has also committed to minimise the impact on the environment as much as possible. Avon Metals Avon Metals is aiming to implement the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 guidelines to measure and report environmental impacts in a number of areas including raw material use, energy consumption, greenhouse gas generation, emissions, water use and discharge and waste generation and disposal. This is planned to commence in 2015. Avon Metals have ISO 14001 environmental management system certification in place which is accredited by ABS Quality Evaluations, Inc. An independent accreditation body. The Company is also an active member of the Climate Change Levy scheme operated by the DTI. In 2013, work continued to lower processing temperatures and improve cycle time to minimise kW/hrs per tonne. In the reporting period 2013 Avon Metals continued to make improvements in sound abatement to the local area. The movement of scrap metal around the plant can be very noisy. A number of initiatives have been implemented to minimise the escape of noise from the site. These have included the installation sound dissipation vents, acoustic dampening roller doors, trees around the site boundaries to absorb noise and we have restricted our scrap movement hours from 7:00 hrs ‐ 22:00 hrs to 7:00 hrs ‐ 19:00 hrs. Avon Metals continues to source aluminium packaging waste, foils, cans, food containers etc for remelting into new alloys. This in the first instant, stops this material going for landfill disposal and secondly reduces the requirement for primary aluminium which is significantly more energy dense due to the energy required to smelt aluminium ore. Avon Metals continues to be an important corporate sponsor of two local wildlife organisations, Slimbridge Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust. Avon Metals STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT’S CEO WATER MANDATE Water is essential for sustaining life. However, this valuable resource is distributed unevenly throughout the world and is also often used wastefully and polluted. This is resulting in severe ecological damage, disease, food shortages and violent conflicts. By developing and promoting solutions to support efficient and responsible consumption of water, Avon Metals is committed to conserving one of the most crucial of all raw materials. A commitment to protecting water quality and reducing water consumption has long been part of Avon Metals company policy.” Drinking water is a resource in scarce supply. A mere 2.5 percent of all the water on Earth is freshwater – and most of that is either contained in ice, or is present as groundwater and therefore difficult to access. According to estimates by the United Nations, water shortages will assume critical levels in numerous regions over the course of the next few decades. Today, over a billion people already have no access to clean water. As the world’s population continues to grow and consumption habits change, the amount of drinking water needed, and the volume required for sanitary and hygienic purposes and especially for food production, will continue to increase. Increased urbanization is intensifying the pressure on local water resources and, particularly in the emerging countries, water pollution is on the increase. In some areas, climate change will exacerbate the situation still further due to decreased precipitation and rising sea levels. Efficient water usage and water pollution control are key issues when it comes to sustainable development. Agriculture has a crucial role to play in this respect, as the majority of the water consumed in the world (around 70 percent) is used in the cultivation of foodstuffs. As an active UNGC signatory, Avon Metals are also part of the CEO Water Mandate which focuses on achieving more sustainable consumption of this essential resource. By joining the CEO Water Mandate, Avon Metals commits to setting meaningful water reduction targets and tracking and reporting water usage, and has indicated its commitment to adhere to a comprehensive approach to water management. The Mandate is broken into six key areas: direct operations; supply chain and watershed management; collective action; public policy; community engagement; and transparency. Each key area concludes with a pledge for signers to commit to a number of related actions. Steven Munnoch, Managing Director Avon Metals Future Plans Avon Metals continues to assess projects that have the potential to reduce our environmental impact. A planned power correction upgrade for the electric induction furnaces has been rescheduled for reassessment in 2015. The cost is over £100k and in the current economic climate this is difficult to justify, however it has the potential to save in excess of 1000 tonnes per annum of CO² emissions alone so will remain on the carbon footprint reduction list. Work will in 2014/2015 to assess how we can utilise the plant site infrastructure to reduce our Carbon Footprint. Rain water capture and recycling and flue heat recovery system have been identified as possible initiatives to save or recover valuable resources. Avon Metals will be assessing moving to the GRI G4 reporting model to monitor and report its performance with a plan to start this in 2015. Avon Metals will continue to support and fund Slimbridge Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust. Avon Metals Anti‐Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery In an effort to combat global corruption, the World Economic Forum Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) was formally launched by CEOs from the Engineering & Construction, Energy and Metals and Mining industries in January 2004. PACI is business driven global initiative with commitment from the top. The PACI is the only global business‐driven, anti‐corruption initiative; it commits corporate leaders to action. It brings together companies in multiple industries from all over the world, regardless of their membership in the World Economic Forum or the size of their company. By signing the PACI Principles, signatory companies like Avon Metals commit to having a zero tolerance policy towards bribery and to developing and implementing or maintaining a broad‐ based, anti‐corruption programme to guide the behaviour of their employees. The PACI's mission is to develop multi‐industry principles and practices that will result in a competitive level playing field, based on integrity, fairness and ethical conduct. The PACI Principles for Countering Bribery, create a common language on corruption and bribery valid for all industries firmly believing that corruption cannot be countered without leadership and commitment from the top. These principles also apply to key business relationships with controlled subsidiaries, joint ventures, agents and other intermediaries, as well as contractors and suppliers. Effectiveness is ensured by a self‐assessment process, which allows for companies to receive expert feedback on their anti‐corruption programmes. The PACI places the private sector in a unique position to guide governments' and international organizations' strategies and policies on anti‐corruption and has built strong relationships with the key players and institutions from the global anti‐corruption landscape.
