Each risk is doubly monitored by a working-level department and an enterprise risk management department. Financial risks like exchange rate fluctuations, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, raw material increase, and credit risk are regularly measured and managed according to the periodical risk management plan (short, mid, and long term). Non-financial risk management is also being reinforced through regular diagnosis by an in-house expert. The operational risks, such as the government policies and regulations, product quality management, protection of patents and trading rights, and protection of personal information and external image, and the hazardous risks, such as fire, safety and health, natural disasters, and corruption, are being monitored and addressed initially by an associated functional organization. * Comment: Please refer to the homepage for detailed information about integrated risk management.

From 2013, the Council for Information Security, chaired by the CSO, has been holding meetings on a quarterly basis to discuss the issue of enterprise security. It is being systematically undertaken under the information protection policy established in compliance with the international standards as well as the domestic regulations.

Constant gathering of stakeholder feedback and stakeholder communication is a part of our operation at respective departments at LG H&H. Our CSR team undertakes its own stakeholder engagement process annually through the materiality test. Six stakeholder groups of customers, shareholders-investors, employees, government-public institutes-associations, business partners and local communities are surveyed and interviewed to identify their expectations and requirements. This is followed by consultations with working-level departments to define future improvement plans for enhanced stakeholder satisfaction. This year’s stakeholder survey was conducted of 34 CSR issues in accordance with stakeholder interest and their impact on our business, and its outcomes were reflected in the materiality test results.

[2013 Sales by Business Segment] [2013 Operating Income by Business Segment] (Unit: KRW billion) Refreshing Refreshing Healthy 105.1 Healthy 1,222.2 1,442.4 158.2 4,326.3 496.4 Beautiful Beautiful 233.1 1,661.7 2013 Business Status Walking in step with the trend of consumption polarization in our “Beautiful” market, we focused on both highand low-priced cosmetics and enhanced our market leadership in each business segment. We also concentrated on channels with high growth potentials, like duty-free, online, and brand shops, as a preemptive move against channel diversification, which resulted in the achievement of higher growth in comparison with the current market tendency. In our “Healthy” business, we unveiled innovative products in hair, oral, and body care, whose market trends rapidly become premium and differentiated, so that we also obtained good results in this area. As for our “Refreshing” business, the business continued to bear good fruit due to the growth of carbonated drinks with strong brand power, new-products release, and differentiated marketing.With these successful experiences as a stepping stone, we have made an attempt to extend our operation to the broader global market. We have extended our bases to the North American region, the world’s largest market, as well as to the Chinese, Japanese, and Southeast Asian regions. We have accelerated our business growth with these bases as the center. In 2013, the overseas sales of household goods and cosmetics reached around KRW669 billion, up more than 50% from the previous year. The proportion of sales also expanded to 15% in 2013 from 11% in 2012. Meanwhile, the expansion of the overseas market has been accompanied by our continuous endeavor to secure a new growth engine for each business segment: strengthening the dietary supplement business in our “Healthy” business, investing in a THEFACESHOP overseas base in our “Beautiful” business, and preparing to produce functional beverage and dairy products in our “Refreshing” business. These are combined with our unceasing efforts to selectively develop new businesses that are expected to create synergy with our existing businesses. In so doing, compared with 2012, our company’s sales has increased to KRW 4,326.3 billion, up by 11% and operating incomes increased to KRW 496.4 billion, up by 11.4%, respectively. 16 Company Creation of Economic Value Overseas Businesses LG H&H is operating three production subsidiaries in China and Vietnam and one sales subsidiary each in China, USA, and Taiwan to carry out its household goods and cosmetics business. The company has exported major products to 22 countries, including the above-mentioned countries plus Russia, Iran, etc. Our cosmetics brand entered the Japanese market through Ginza Stefany, the Japanese cosmetics provider, which we acquired in 2012. In newly explored markets like Colombia, the sales generated by the exportation of goods like raw materials were up 10% from 2012. Our activity boundaries in the overseas markets have been enlarged in a sustained manner. Our strategically focused cosmetics brand is ‘Whoo’, which is being advertised in the local market to enhance its brand awareness. The first shop was launched in a premium department store in Hong Kong in 2013, receiving positive responses from the customers. As for BELIF, it was first launched in Singapore with the natural-herb concept, and after that, we made every effort to open a brand shop and to enter a department store in Indonesia, Taiwan, and others. BEYOND provides good-quality products at low prices and with its cute animal shape and the spirit of anti-animal testing, the brand is expected to appeal to the overseas consumers as the representative brand in the lowand middle-priced markets. THEFACESHOP, recognized as a practical and low/middle-priced brand in the home market, has a differentiated positioning strategy for each nation. [2013 Sales Ratio of Each Major Cosmetic Brand in the Overseas Markets] In 2013, THEFACESHOP established a subsidiary in China and Singapore, WHOO where an exclusive operation system had been used, to gain a foothold 16% for business expansion in such countries. Additional launching of other THEFACESHOP brands, such as belief and VDL, has been being done since the founding of 61% SOORYEHAN the Singapore subsidiary in April 2013. In September, a joint venture was 8% established in Guangzhou, China and the acquisition of exclusive sales entities was completed, equipped with a direct management system to Others develop various business activities. In Canada, the management systems of 15% three F&P shops taken over inJuly 2013 was changed into the direct control system, which leads to big achievements. The number of directly controlled shops will continue to grow for business expansion in Canada. In terms of household goods, we have focused on raising oral and detergent brands. We have finished our entry into strategicfocus regions, including western Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, with the oral care brand PERIOE and are tightening marketing activities. We have concentrated on selling quality products to the consumers in Russia and Columbia, with the enriched detergent brand TECH. In Japan, the fabric softener brand Saffron has expanded its detergent product range, unveiling new products as a result of product renewal tuned to consumer needs. To improve the brand awareness, we plan to develop branding campaigns for large channels and customized promotions for small channels. In the local subsidiaries in China, Vietnam, and Taiwan, the number of local employees will continue to increase in an attempt to enhance customer satisfaction through a rapid and detailed grasp of the local consumers’ needs and its application to our products. Furthermore, considering the geographic conditions of the competitive local suppliers with quality subsidiary materials and competitive production costs, the ratio of local purchase has grown continually, accounting for 72% in 2013 (excluding THEFACESHOP).

While cosmetics companies, including foreign corporations which had carried out their business mainly through department stores, are expected to reinforce the WEB sales channel, Ginza Stephany has recruited new customers while systematically caring for its existing customers, enlarging the people’s awareness of Ginza Stephany and its branding image exposures to consolidate the cosmetics sales. In 2013, the acquisition of EVERLIFE, the premium health functional food company, followed in a bid to expand the business scale of health functional foods. Using the premium branding image of EVERLIFE, we plan to enter Taiwan and China. As for household goods, our major fabric softener/ detergent brand has been distributed through our agency in Japan and has aggressively knocked on the doors of previously unreached distribution channels to expand its market coverage. Chinese Market For the last five years, the Chinese cosmetics market has experienced average 15% continuous growth annually, and especially, the premium cosmetics sales have been expanded in a sustained manner. In accordance with this market growth trend, we have focused on cosmetics distribution in the premium market, including department stores. Shop opening targeting prestige department stores with high potentials located in major cities has been pursued to enhance the premium image through the new shop interior added to the existing interior operated in South Korea. Unlike the drastically growing cosmetics market, the growth rate of the household market in the last few years has decreased to around 6% from approximately 10% due to the global economic recession. In view of the economic growth in China, however, the purchase rate of household items in small and medium-sized cities has been gradually rising, and many multinational competitors leading the household market are moving from big cities to small and medium-sized cities. In addition, with the continual sales expansion of online distribution, LG H&H currently invests more in online sales than in offline sales. THEFACESHOP has experienced rapid growth in the Chinese market for three years, recording a 21.5% average annual growth rate. Thanks to the establishment of a subsidiary in Shanghai, China, the company entered the online market successfully, and in 2013, the offline business operated as two exclusive entities was taken over by the newly founded Guangzhou subsidiary, which is expected to enable both the online and offline businesses to expand into an integrated system controlled by the head office. As for our online business, we plan to increase its market share by actively advancing into the new online home shopping channel in addition tothe existing Internet business. As for our offline business, we aim to aggressively expand our business capacity by renewing the existing shops acquired through joint venture establishment. Furthermore, for both our online and offline channels, we plan to equalize the product prices, secure the same VMD(Visual Merchandising) images, and come up with a manual containing the sales method, pursuing the strategic reinforcement of the company’s global brand image. 18 Company Creation of Economic Value Summary of Financial Information Financial Statement (Unit: KRW million) LG H&H LG H&H Coca Cola Beverage THEFACESHOP HAITAI Beverage [consolidated] [non-consolidated] [consolidated] [consolidated] [non-consolidated] 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 I.

CSR Team operates CSR meetings to deal with various social, environmental, and economic issues of sustainability systematically. Vision and Mid-Long Term Strategy The vision of LG H&H is to grow as the best life culture company dedicated to realizing our customers’ beauty and dream. For this, the company pursues four core values: customer-oriented operation, unceasing pursuit of innovation, a professional mindset, and one-step-ahead customer response. Since its founding in 1947, LG H&H has walked together with its customers towards realizing a healthy and beautiful life. Beyond the mere provision of household goods, cosmetics, and beverages, we have made every effort to enable our customers to enjoy a more “Healthy,” “Beautiful,” and “Refreshing” life. To realize our vision, we have strategically sought to tighten our product portfolios, to expand our product distribution coverage, and to ensure sustainability on a mid-long term basis. In 2013 alone, we devoted ourselves to expanding our globalization, developing value-creating brands, maximizing customer satisfaction, and strengthening our company’s risk resistance. •Becoming the best life culture company dedicated to realizing our customers’ Vision beauty and dream ong Mid-tl rategy e r m s • Strengthening our product portfolio t s • Expanding our distribution coverage value Core • Establishing sustainability • Consumer focus • Innovation • Professionalism • Speed CSR Vision and Core Fields LG H&H has established a CSR vision in relation to its business vision, and implements a sustainability strategy led by CSR Team.

LG H&H’s materiality test process was developed using the materiality test principles and process suggested by GRI’s (Global Reporting Initiative) G4, the global sustainability report guideline and the five-part materiality test methodology of Account Ability. The materiality test process was conducted from March to April 2014, in three stages: Identification of prioritized issues, evaluation of relative priority, and assessment of effectiveness. The materiality test process is expected to be continually upgraded, and, in this regard, LG H&H’s materiality test process is considered as an ongoing improving process. As stated, LG H&H targets three business areas: household goods, cosmetics, and beverages. Accordingly, all the business features of LG H&H have been considered at all stages of the materiality test process as well as at the stage of analyzing their correlations. [Materiality Test Process] STEP 1 STEP 2 STEP 3 STEP 4 Identification of Priority test Validity test Process review issues Materiality Test Criteria LG H&H developed standards for the judgment of relative priority, from the points of view of the stakeholder and the business, and applied these. The materiality has been analyzed through media research (seven daily newspapers), a key stakeholder survey (746 stakeholders, including customers, business partners, and the local community), and expert panel meeting (six experts) from the stakeholder perspective, and through financial influence, strategy & in-house management system, level of competitors’ countermeasures, and employee interview and survey from the business perspective. Especially, the employee interview was conducted targeting four executives, TFT members, and staff in direct contact with the key stakeholders, and a total of 271 employees participated in the employee survey, offering their opinions. With the weighted values added, the materiality of the stakeholder perspective and that of the business perspective were finally compounded to draw the relative priorities among the issues.

The stakeholders have a tendency to consider such issues essential in decision-making. LG H&H has reviewed the propriety of the selected key issues in view of the company’s vision, strategic system, business, and operation. For the approval of the issues, the issues were discussed by the management at the CSR meetings, went through the process of readjustment and grouping through the analysis of the correlation of each issue to the others, and were finalized. The CSR meeting is the supreme venue for decision-making, responsible for LG H&H’s sustainability management. The total number of selected key issues was 34, classified as Priority I, II, and III according to the materiality. The test results were referred to in determining the report formation and reporting items and level. They will also be used as basic information in the process of improving the company’s sustainability management strategy and system, and of reviewing the related achievements.

Participants: 6 experts in sustainability management and an LG H&H executive in charge of CSR 2. Major discussion agenda 1) Discussion on the materiality test process and results 2) The recent trend and recommendations in relation to LG H&H’s sustainablility management 3) Suggestions for improving CSR Report 3. Date & time: 14:00-17:00, April 15, 2014 (Tuesday) 4. Place: Meeting Room, 10th floor, Gwanghwamun Bldg., LG H&H ❶ ❷ ❹ ❻ ❼ ❸ ❺ ❶ Hee-sang Park, Head of Labor Corporation Ilwoo In terms of CSR management, the current government labor policy is adjudged to be focused on family-friendly management (work-family coexistence), gender equality, industrial safety, and better treatment of temporary employees. LG H&H has achieved fine results in these areas, but ongoing efforts to comply with the policy are required. Internally, the fosterage of female management class is regarded as a major issue. Most leading companies tend to meet all the legal requirements in the area of human labor rights specified by the existing labor laws, but we have to closely determine if the actual in-house practice is as excellent as it appears externally, and if LG H&H has no exceptions. For example, it should be determined how well the employees recognize the guidelines for the company’s declaration of human rights (ethical management) and how they are practiced in real life. In addition, it is a trend now to check the labor practice and human rights issues of the partner companies. ❷ Young-woo Kim, Research Fellow of National Commission for Corporate Partnership (NCCP) NCCP unveils the win-win growth index of major companies on an annual basis. In 2013, 108 large companies were targeted, and LG H&H was one of the targeted companies. The company was also targeted, when 73 companies were the target of the assessment. The level of the company in terms of shared growth was evaluated as more than average. In the case of CSR Report, more concrete and precise contents are adjudged to be required. For instance, the detailed description of the KRW30 billion usage allocated for win-win growth could raise the report’s credibility. It is our desire that you show more interest and take part in the benefit-sharing scheme operated by our committee. Meanwhile, only three technology escrow cases are being supported by LG H&H, which is regretful considering that there are approximately 10,000 escrow cases registered with Large & Small Business Cooperation Foundation. As the system requires lower cost and serves to protect the small/medium company’s own technologies, it seems that more active support is needed. Meanwhile, CSR Report published in South Korea seems to be just going through the motions. Something should be done about the fact that similar contents are mechanically listed every year. One of the main purposes of CSR Report is to enhance the company’s image, but we should go beyond this by creating social issues and boosting our business by employing a more strategic approach. ❸ Sang-kyu Hwang, Head of SR Korea Stakeholder engagement is essential, and this kind of panel meeting, where experts in each area intensively discuss issues, would be a good strategy for such. Experts tend to consider their own interests as most significant, but during the discussion, they listen to one another, ask questions, and can conclude which issue should be given priority. Rather than simply accepting the consequences, through communication and involvement, the stakeholders walk together in the process, which enables a deeper understanding of the issue. The stakeholders’ involvement could be vitalized with the recognition of the fact that the result of the materiality test could be wrong. It is true that there is a disjunction among most of the South Korean companies’ materiality test methods and outcomes, and in the stakeholders’ recognition of such. This is why the process is more crucial than the consequences. As far as possible, the management should join the process with empathy, selecting major issues and helping draw conclusions. The world is changing and advancing. Facing new environments, we are required to cope with the rising issues and to discover new problemsolving methods. As for the reporting format and contents, they should be designed in such a way as to boost the readers’ understanding. The way of sharing the report should be diversified; use various channels, like the internet and Facebook, as well as printed copy. Through online communication, the person in charge can update the information from time to time, enabling real-time interaction with the stakeholders. 2013 LG H&H CSR Report 25 (The 3rd CSR Panel Meeting) ❹ Tae-hyoung Lim, Director of Community Relations Center The social contribution activities that LG H&H has conducted so far are adjudged to be remarkable in terms of their positive influence and transformational effect on the society. The company’s various kid-targeted campaigns, such as PERIOE Kids School, are desirable in view of their correlation with the company’s business and capabilities, but the anti-animal testing campaign should be approached cautiously as it is like two sides of the same coin. In a certain aspect, it could run counter to the consumer safety issue, leading to a negative impact on such. Thus, rather than completely opposing animal testing, it is recommendable to advocate only the reduction of animal testing while increasing the measures taken to ensure consumer safety so as to gain consumer trust. Company A, belonging to the same industry as LG H&H, once declared that it would use only palm oil for its products, which resulted in its contribution to the destruction of the tropical rainforests for the planting of numerous palm trees for money. Please refer to such case. As for CSR Report, I suggest a more concise and sophisticated use of text and transformational-results/outcomes-oriented presentment rather than merely pointing out how many social contribution activities have been undertaken and the efforts that went into such activities. ❺ Sung-rak Son, Head of Korea Consumer Agency, Seoul Considering the features of LG H&H’s products, the most sensitive issue as far as the consumers are concerned would be product safety. For example, a number of consumers have raised complaints to the Korea Consumer Agency about the allergic reaction they developed to certain cosmetics produced by LG H&H and about the heavy metal contents and defective disposable nappy of LG H&H’s household goods and cosmetics. As for the beverage business, a number of consumers complained about the breakage of beverages while in motion. It is highly recommendable for the company to take active measures against these kinds of issues. Collaboration with its business partners is also very important for its consumer-oriented management. There have also been positive opinions, though. For example, the continuous use of eco-friendly raw materials and packaging materials is very desirable considering the recent consumer demands. Lastly, if I have to pick out one matter requiring improvement compared with developed countries, it would be the product safety signs. As for the issue of safety, making every effort to provide detailed information even about negligible parts is essential. ❻ Young-chul Chang, Professor of School of Management, Kyung Hee University/ Co-head of Peter Drucker Society Young-chul Chang, Professor of School of Management, Kyung Hee University/ Co-head of Peter Drucker Society Based on LG Group’s own principles and creeds aimed at making the company the leader in Jeong-do management, the company seems to have a strong will to carry out ethical management in compliance with the international standards and principles. To be specific, the establishment and operation of an organization dedicated to Jeong-do management, the pledge of practicing it, the ethics hotline system, and the training extended to the stakeholders are noticeable. I suggest that indicators showing the effectiveness and concrete outcomes of these systems be drawn. For example, the reporting of how a relevant matter to the ethics hotline was dealt with and what its ripple effect was, and what actual fruits the Jeong-do and ethical management education produced will enable the more transparent reporting of the company’s development goals and progress. In addition, I suggest that the number of field-oriented instruction and reflection training sessions where ethics dilemmas, law-abiding behavior, and the successes and failures of the company’s ethical management are discussed be increased. ❼ Heung-sik Kim, CSR Executive, LG H&H/ CHO Care Customer LG H&H’s employees dream of providing our customers with healthy, beautiful, and refreshing values as the best life culture company dedicated to realize their beauty and dream. We believe that true-value creation for our customers can happen only if we take full responsibility for our products and exert unwavering efforts to improve them. Based on this belief, LG H&H will constantly endeavor to earn the trust of its customers and to create a sustainable future with them. 2013 LG H&H CSR Report 27 Customer-oriented Management and Sustainable Products Since its establishment, LG H&H has focused on product development prioritizing consumer health and safety. In 2010, the company came up with its “Guideline for Developing Sustainable Products” in pursuit of customer health and safety, and invested in the development of sustainable products in the spirit of carrying out its economic and social responsibility. [Sales of Sustainable Products: 2010-2013] (Unit: KRW billion) 185.6 143.4 8.3% ※ Sales of sustainable products account for 8.3% of the total sales of LG H&H. 118.9 Definition of LG H&H’s 105.2 sustainable products: products that will promote consumer health and safety, and constant profit generation in the spirit of carrying out the company’s economic and social responsibility 2010 2011 2012 2013 Product development prioritizing consumer health and safety has been at the top of LG H&H’s agenda, and the company has emphasized it most since its establishment. Through this, LG H&H has won customer credit and has grown much. LG H&H will endeavor to contribute to its customers’ well-being by constantly promoting customer health and safety. Consumer safety as the top priorities and product responsibility LG H&H thoroughly inspects all its products and even its raw materials for any possible harmfulness to the human body, in an attempt to secure product safety and improve its products’ eco-friendliness. A strict standard has been applied to hazardous-substance management items to secure the safety of the company’s products and raw materials. Ever since LG H&H banned animal testing of all its products in its cosmetics development, the company has continually researched on alternative methods for years to ensure its products’ harmlessness to the human body. As a result, we have continually ensured our products’ harmlessness to the human body through the use of alternative methods, including immune cell cultivation, immune cell cultivation method, and alternatives to animal experiments (HETCase: HAN.IP, a safe liquid detergent with a half-dose CAM). Alternative methods are used to verify the toxicity and harmfulness of our products The number of consumers expressing concern and their raw materials to the human body. about the safety of the detergents used for On the raw material level, preliminary tests washing clothes directly touching the skin has on possible toxicity are conducted through been rising of late due to the continuous dwelling skin cell experiments and allergy testing on by the media on the household goods safety issue. the skin. On the product level, various kinds of To address the consumers’ concerns, LG H&H was tests, such as the product patch test, sting test, required to develop a mild detergent with safe and cumulative stimulation test, are performed image that is truly safe. Accordingly, LG H&H developed the liquid detergent HAN.IP using only to identify any factor causing skin irritation and a half-dose. To produce a clean detergent, we used other side effects in advance. plant based natural surfactants while In the development and production of maintaining the product’s outstanding cleaning household goods, the company monitors power. With the application of a surfactant independently developed by LG possible hazardous substances real-time to H&H, we have enhanced the solubility of materials with poor waters prevent the emergence of safety and olubility, resulting in the maximization of the product transparency, which environmental issues, exerting its best efforts served to consolidate the effective and clean image of our liquid detergent. to promote consumer safety. In addition, The results of our consumer monitoring after the product release were it strictly abides by the limit on the use of highly satisfactory in the areas of washing power, emotional image, and legally restricted substances, and by the legal fragrance. standards for banned substances. 28 Care Customer Customer-oriented Management and Sustainable Products Eco-friendly Product Innovation (Low-Carbon Product Development) LG H&H has been striving to develop and produce products with minimal environmental impact, considering every stage, from pre-manufacturing to after-usage, living up to the consumers’ demand for eco-friendly products through Eco Mark and Carbon Footprint Labeling Certification. The effort to reduce the company’s greenhouse gas emission through carbon footprint labeling certification was selected as an excellent case, and representing the South Korean companies, LG H&H shared it at the International Carbon Footprint Seminar. We will continue our relentless pursuit of low-carbon green management.

As part of these efforts, in 2013, its dishwashing detergent (Jayeonpong Sulip), shampoo (Elastin), and powder detergent (Super Ti) obtained low-carbon product certification, the first in South Korea. Furthermore, we are 454g for Jayeonpong in the process of establishing a preliminary verification system for 500ml carbon footprint labeling, in addition to the acquisition of carbon footprint labeling certification, in a bid to increase the number of products with carbon-footprint-labeling certification and to ensure the effective management. 2013 LG H&H CSR Report 29 Product Packaging and Resource Saving LG H&H has been doing its best to develop packaging materials to reduce environmental impact based on three principles: packaging material minimization, plastic usage reduction, and recyclability improvement. The efforts to develop a resourcesaving packaging structure, to change the package type, to control the use of synthetic materials, and to develop technologies for reducing the weight of plastics have succeeded in saving resources, reducing wastage, and improving recyclability. In 2013, we reduced our plastic material usage by around 264 tons per annum through the use of various methods such as weight rationalization, pearl color removal, and usage of recycled plastic containers for our household goods, Saffron, and our paper usage by 533 tons per annum, by changing the materials used for cosmetic sets.

Furthermore, the development of the in-vitro test, replacing the animal test, enables the exclusion of experimental animal use in the safety test of cosmetics and household goods on the human body. In particular, for cosmetics, animal testing has not been done for a long time for the end products, but for the raw materials, animal testing was conducted until 2011 to comply with the strict standard of the EU Guideline. In 2012, however, the ‘in-vitro toxicity evaluation method’, which evaluates the toxicity of raw materials through the skin cell cultivation, replaced the existing cytotoxicity evaluation method used for cosmetics raw materials, and the ‘immune cell cultivation method’, which measures the contents of the materials causing skin allergy reaction, replaced the then-existing allergy test, enabling the complete exclusion of animal testing. Case: ‘BEYOND’ Eco Value 10 LG H&H’s ‘BEYOND’ was unveiled in 2005 under the brand philosophy of eco-friendliness and anti-animal testing. It is a differentiated brand that succeeded in completely removing animal testing of cosmetics end products and raw materials in 2008. Especially, Beyond declared “Beyond Eco Value 10” under the brand philosophy pursuing “eco-friendly total beauty”: eco-friendliness, fair trade, no chemical preservative, no artificial figment, anti-animal-testing, skin safety test, chemical composition minimization, waste minimization, use of recyclable packaging materials, and fossil fuel reduction.

Use only such raw materials that have passed the analysis of residual pesticides(177), heavy metals(8), dioxin, and formaldehyde. A BEYOND’s specialized research institute where an organic and eco-friendly eco-beauty research is carried out in compliance with its own standards, which are stricter than those set by organic guidelines.

Release only such products that have passed the 3S testing: Satisfaction, Safety and Stability Implement a cleaning process to prevent possible cross-contamination and a separate manufacturing practice such as marking of ‘in course of organic cosmetics manufacturing’. Establish a separated management Exclude the use of non-recyclable containers which produce and storage system for the organic environmental hormone. Use biomass containers made from raw materials corn to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Increase the soybean oil printing and minimize the packaging volume. At the end of 2012, we established “Save Us Fund,” and we are currently in the process of augmenting such fund. As part of this effort, we donated a part of our earnings to an animal protection organization. We also continued to release collaboration products to support “Jedoli Project,” in partnership with Korean Animal Welfare Association, and to protect endangered animals. In 2013, we participated in various animal protection activities, including donating an R&D fund to the National Park Research Centre, where research on habitat restoration for endangered animals such as lightning bugs is being conducted. (The lightning bug is one of the 246 endangered wild animals and plants designated by the Ministry of Environment.) 2013 LG H&H CSR Report 31 (A palm plantation view) RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) Certification Majority of the world’s palm oil is produced in Indonesia. Palm Oil Industry Corporation run by the Indonesian government has burned a considerable portion of Indonesia’s tropical rainforests and has built palm oil plantations in such spots to meet the drastically increasing global demand for palm oil, which has resulted in serious deforestation and in the threat of orangutan extinction. Local labor exploitation in the poor work environment is also coming to the fore as a serious issue. In a bid to address this issue, a number of companies and private environmental organizations jointly established RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) in 2013. RSPO introduced an environmental and social certification system for sustainable palm oil production, making a significant contribution to the promotion of environmental and social human rights. RSPO certification is designed to ensure that palm oil providers produce palm oil products in the right way; while meeting the social demand, they can still protect the environment by conducting best-management practice in operating their plantations and factories, and by protecting natural resources and preserving the environment and the biodiversity of species. Only those plantations and refineries that satisfy all the set standards could obtain RSPO certification. RSPO targets not only palm oil plantations and refineries but also all the stakeholders throughout the entire supply chain. RSPO exists to promote sustainable palm oil products production and usage through the active involvement of all the stakeholders. The palm plantations and oil factories which received RSPO certification through this can have appropriate benefits. In addition, in the case of the sale of RSPO-certified products, a certain amount of support will be offered by LG H&H to RSPO in proportion to the sales volume. For a company like LG H&H, which makes products using palm oil, a natural fermented ingredient, to receive RSPO certification, the company not only should purchase RSPO-certified raw materials, but also should be equipped with either a segregation grade system to segregate the non-RSPO-certified ingredients’ mixture, or a mass balance grade system to control the volume in & volume out recording. In the area of the raw material business, with the Onsan plant producing surfactants in the center, LG H&H has set aside a budget for RSPO certification beginning in 2013, and is currently preparing for this task, with the aim of joining RSPO’s initiatives for sustainable palm oil production and consumption, which will enable the company to conduct business while being committed to its social and environmental responsibility. 32 Care Customer Customer Satisfaction and Quality Management Customer Satisfaction and Quality Management With the aim of achieving customer satisfaction and value management, LG H&H has strategically pursued the follow-ing goals: listening to the customers’ opinions and strengthening the communication with the customers, preventing the recurrence of customer complaints, establishing enterprise-wide quality management standards, enhancing the company’s development quality management capacity, reinforcing mass production quality management, managing the company’s patent rights, and jointly developing products utilizing outstanding external resources (open innovation).

We have classified customer complaints that could occur throughout the whole stage from manufacturing to usage by products and complaint types, and have analyzed and managed them for active improvement. In 2103, we received a complaint about the leakage of our household cleaners when it was transported while in a shopping cart, due to the pressure exerted on it by the other products on top of it. In response, we altered the container design to prevent any leakage, and we reflected instructions on the storage and usage of the container to avert the possible leakage of the liquid through a customer’s carelessness during product transport. 2013 LG H&H CSR Report 33 Enhancing the Company’s Development Quality Management Capacity LG H&H has implemented various quality management reinforcement measures, such as the establishment of the qualitybased new-product development process and the preliminary quality management guidelines in 2012, to produce best-quality products. In 2013, the company set up Q-Library, systematizing the cases of failure to consolidate the newproduct development capacity. Q-Library is a DB system that gathers the worst practices that have caused massive complaints or the voluntarily retrieval of stocks from the list of cases that led to quality upgrade due to complaints since 2006. Through Q-Library, a product developer can verify the compatibility between the product’s contents and container, and can refer to the standard and in-house standards available in terms of product development. In addition, using Q-Library, we have introduced “the preliminary customer complaints forecast system for new products,” designed to automatically inform us of the past failure cases of our products under similar conditions as our newly developing products, contributing to the risk inspection of our products under development, to the prevention of product failure recurrence, and to the timely release of products. Reinforcing the Company’s Mass Production Quality Management Capacity LG H&H has adopted both own and OEM production methods. In this regard, the quality management of business partners producing LG H&H’s products using the OEM method is considered as important as that of LG H&H. In 2013, our company enacted quality management guidelines for the equal quality management of our products produced by our business partners and shared them. The guidelines described all the details of the quality management method being used as well as the requisites of the comprehensive product range provided by LG H&H such as household goods, cosmetics, beverages, and health functional foods by its business unit, considering the regulations, product features, and manufacturing conditions for each product line. Furthermore, a checklist has been provided to our business partners for the performance of self-diagnosis of their meeting requirements, making it easy for them to carry out onsite quality management. Managing the Company’s Patents for Quality Management LG H&H is striving to develop products providing new functions even before the consumers recognize the necessity for such, in addition to improving our product quality simply to resolve consumer complaints. Furthermore, cost reduction efforts have been exerted to provide reasonable prices to the consumers. LG H&H has systematically managed its R&D results through domestic and overseas patent applications, which has resulted in the protection of its own technologies and the differentiation of its products, providing the consumers price and functional values. In particular, we filed for patents for the leading technology in the area of next-generation skin protection materials, a highly functional cleansing emulsion technology, and a recombinant cell-cultivation to consolidate our product differentiation.

Through i-CONNECT (iconnect.lgcare.com), the online site that we established in 2009, as well as through our continuous exchanges and networking with R&D institutes, universities, ventures, technical trading institutes, and raw material providers at home and abroad, approximately 100 patent technology and business cooperation proposals are reviewed and reflected in our product releases annually. In 2013, in collaboration with the Mondavi family, the world-renowned wine provider, the company launched the antioxidant cosmetics brand Davi, and in collaboration with LG Life Sciences Ltd., the company developed the professional derma cosmetic brand Dermalift. Case: Open Innovation A Antioxidant Cosmetics Brand DAVI LG H&H unveiled the new antioxidant cosmetics brand DAVI in cooperation with the Mondavi family, the world’s bestquality wine provider. In pursuit of antioxidant ingredients, the fundamental solution to wrinkles and aging skin, the company has taken notice of grapes and wine, which are famous for their antioxidant function, initiating joint research and development of new antioxidant cosmetics with the Mondavi family, the world-renowned premium-quality wine provider, and found “Phyto-meritage,” the core ingredient with a superior antioxidant effect. DAVI is a premium cosmetics brand boasting an enriched antioxidant effect, enabled by the additional development of a variety of natural plant components with “Phyto-meritage”, the core antioxidant component of DAVI. The premium skincare image has been secured through the realization of the world premium winery’s philosophy and story, and through the recognition of its value due to its scarcity; it is available only in the world’s premium hotels and the first-class cabin. B Professional Derma Cosmetics Brand Dermalift Dermalift is a professional derma cosmetics brand aimed at “derma lifting,” containing ingredients cohered from both the beauty technology of LG H&H and the biotechnology of LG Life Sciences (hereinafter, “LG LS”). The major component is NecroXTM, developed by LG LS for the first time in the world, new component patented in the home country and in the U.S. caring for damaged skin and making it healthy by keeping down the active oxygen, the major cause of aging. While LG LS has performed clinical trials for this component for medical purposes for around 10 years, through open innovation, the two companies’ officers in charge of R&D jointly reviewed the possibility of using it as a raw material for cosmetics. After that, LG H&H confirmed NecroXTM’s safety and effectiveness on the skin and applied it to Dermalift, releasing the product in the steeply rising derma cosmetics market. The human test results confirmed its outstanding skin damage defense effect against external stimuli such as UV and SLS. Its excellent quality and specialty made this product differentiated and greatly well received by the consumers. *Derma Cosmetic: A compound word formed from the words “dermatology”and “cosmetic” Care Our Employee Our employees are the foundation of the future of LG H&H as the best life culture company walking together with its customers.

To enhance employee health, we continue to carry out health promotion programs including an No-smoking campaign, the “Salt Down” (low-sodium diets) campaign, physical testing and health clinic operation by hiring a sports curer at each plant, and gradually expand the target of our comprehensive health check-up program. As for comprehensive health check-up, extra examinations such as female cancer screening and special medical check-up are conducted for female employees and the employees handling chemical substances, respectively. Further, counselling is provided based on the result of the examination, demonstrating our sustained commitment to the improvement of our employee health. LG H&H is ensuring injury-free worksite activities and traffic accident prevention during the transport of its goods all year round. To eliminate any harmful hazardous factor at a production site, an environment safety audit is conducted monthly, contributing to the constant removal of unsafety elements. Coca Cola Beverage Company exerts continual efforts to prevent musculoskeletal disorders at all its logistics centers. In 2013, the company verified the possible causes of musculoskeletal disorders, and the company is currently in the process of classifying and improving the work process that may cause the disease. It also draws attention to precautions by coming up with a signboard illustrating detailed information on heavy weights and on precautions, and put it up at the place where heavy weights are treated. As for the beverage business, which requires much transport logistics, traffic accident prevention education has been given to the employees handling vehicles (3,300 employees annually) in collaboration with the Road Traffic Authority and an insurance company. A promotion activity was held to prevent drunk and drowsy driving, which included making a poster and a banner and putting them up at the whole worksite. Case: emergency drill for accidents prevention LG H&H has conducted an emergency drill more than once a year, in partnership with external governmental institutes, to ensure its preparedness for the possible impact of safety incidents on the local community. In May 2015, to prepare itself for a variety of disasters, such as storms and floods, earthquakes, and man-made disasters, the Yangsan plant implemented “Safe Korea Exercise for Disaster Response,” a comprehensive disaster response drill designed to improve the nation’s disaster response capabilities, hosted annually by the National Safety Management Commission and the National Emergency Management Agency. Approximately 200 people participated in all, including the employees of Yangsan City Hall, Yangsan Fire Station, Yangsan Police Station, the army, Yangsan Disaster Network, and Coca Cola Yangsan plant Self-Defense Fire Service of the Special Force Veterans Association. The scenario was an assumed sulphuric-acid leak from the sulphuricacid storage tank of the Yangsan plant. The Self-Defense Fire Service of the Yangsan plant took charge of the initial reaction and employee evacuation, and the other institutes, including Yangsan Fire Station, City Hall, and Police Station, took charge of the follow-up measures.

Creating a Leading Organizational Culture A company’s organizational culture is the driving force of its growth, and it is essential to create a system and an environment in which each employee can display his/her ability creatively. LG H&H continually strives to foster an organizational culture in which employees can work creatively and effectively. Our adherence to an eight-hour work time, the removal of unnecessary meetings, the flexible-time system, and decision-making led by the person in charge regardless of his/her position have been evaluated as making up the leading organizational culture and have accordingly been benchmarked by other companies. Through the flexible-time system, LG H&H allows its employees to go to work between 7:00 and 9:00, and to leave work between 16:00 and 18:00, at 30-minute intervals, to promote their work-life balance. In 2013, the company implemented a company-wide simultaneous holiday system consisting of more than one day per month (15 times per annum), allowing its employees to enjoy holidays without having to read the countenance of their colleagues and boss. Case: Successful introduction of Smart Station in 2013 LG H&H introduced the “smart station” system in 2013 in a bid to promote the job efficiency of its salespersons with extensive field service by reducing their Customer travel time. The company came up with a field workspace without designated Customer seats for its salespersons in seven different places within the metropolitan Customer-oriented, area, which allowed them to increase their communication and networking contact point expansion time with their customers by deviating from the desk-job-oriented business pattern. If the salespersons need to deal with administrative tasks, they work at the nearest smart station according to their own schedule and moving line. The measure enabled the company’s salespersons to directly go to the field and to directly leave the workplace after their work hours, serving to promote an environment where the company salespersons can work efficiently, without wasting time, and can enjoy balanced lives. Seongsu SS More meetings with customers, more frequently The 7 SS established in the first half of the year 2013 are evenly distributed Hapjeong SS Gwanghwamun SS throughout the metropolitan area. The location is selected considering the users’ convenience, including customer accessibility, traffic convenience to Yeouido SS reduce the travel time (connectivity with public transport modes such as the Samsung SS subway and main roads), level of building deterioration, and amenities. Based on SS, our company is located in the vicinity of our customers and accounts, Incheon SS Suwon SS with higher accessibility to them than any of our competitors, enabling us to extend field service and to rapidly read any slight change in our customers and cope with these faster than anyone else can. 2013 LG H&H CSR Report 39 Operating a job-specifically differentiated HR system The representative feature of LG H&H’s HR system would be the job-specifically differentiated recruitment and compensation system. The operation of an HR system differentiated by duty served to enhance job efficiency and employee satisfaction. In particular, an average of KRW 9 million is invested in hiring one new recruit to ensure the employment of the most appropriate manpower for a particular duty using the method consisting of overseas study, seminar, and academy, which results in a dramatic decrease in the early resignation rate of talented individuals (below 5% per annum; average rate of a large company: 15%). In 2013, we hired 24 new marketers through a marketing seminar, and 45 new recruits through our sales academy. We believe that differentiated fair compensation is the basic motivation for our employees and can enhance their satisfaction, serving to enable value management through work immersion. For this reason, LG H&H has continued its endeavor to offer differentiated compensation by person and by duty. In 2012, we abolished the regular salary adjustment system implemented across the board and at the same time, and allowed the line managers to take charge of the annual salary adjustment and year-round promotion, at their own discretion. In 2013, the individual compensation management system implemented for marketing people was extended to the company-wide office workers. Reinforcing the Employees Global Capabilities We have undertaken the acquisition of global companies and the establishment of joint ventures, and we systematized our HR strategy for our overseas subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries would be led by their local employees, who have a higher understanding of the local culture and the market. Accordingly, the local employment ratio is steadily being increased, and the efficient role division of our South Korean headquarters and subsidiaries is being implemented through the early hunting and cultivation of local leaders.

The education courses are designed to develop language skills, increase the understanding of local cultures and characteristics, and build social networks. In 2013, the 2nd Global Expertise Course aimed at the acquisition of language skills and global business capabilities were operated to produce 32 graduates so far. Besides, the English Coaching class [2013 Global Education providing an opportunity for one-hour one-to-one communication with an English Program Trainees] coach once a week, has been opened for all the employees with administrative and technical posts, serving to equip them with global manners and language capabilities. 40 Care Our Employee Employee Satisfaction Management and Value Management Trust-based labor-management relations To establish trust-based labor-management relations, LG H&H has been committed to smooth in-house communication and employee welfare. To resolve possible employee issues at work promptly, we use various communication channels. The issues raised in discussion meetings and open-up meetings operated by the concerned business units are rapidly resolved in labor-management discussion meetings of each business unit, Employee Council meetings, and regular meetings with the staff in charge of the company’s organizational culture.

The company also runs the defined benefit retirement pension system and the defined contribution retirement pension system so that the retirees can select between receiving their retirement pay in lump sum or as pension. In addition, the company is running a job transfer program for the retirees. 2013 LG H&H CSR Report 41 Respect for Diversity LG H&H’s respect for diversity is embedded in its management process, which is continually being improved. When the relevant regulation is revised, the revised items are instantly applied to the in-house guides and instructions. Especially, to protect the human rights of the minor groups in the workplace, such as women and the disabled, and to respect their diversity, we have done our best to create a female-friendly working environment and abide by the Act on Employment Promotion for Disabled Persons. When hiring new employees, we apply separate screening processes and give additional marks to people with disabilities. Furthermore, to create indirect employment of the handicapped, a linked employment promotion system for the disabled in association with welfare facilities taking care of severely disabled persons has been operated. In 2013, three social welfare facilities (Boram Labor Center, Ewha, and Chunsungwon) worked with us in terms of employment for the disabled, and we paid them KRW 560 million in all. Case: Fostering a female-friendly working environment (Opening a workplace daycare facility) LG H&H has been continually increasing its female employment. In 2013, its female workforce rate was 53.5% of all the employees (based on LG H&H). They can freely apply for maternal and parental leave. In 2013, in pursuit of maternity protection, LG H&H opened a workplace daycare facility in its head office, which served to alleviate the pressure of child care on the part of the employees, and which allowed them to maintain a work-life balance.

This is our way of respecting the rights of the current and future generations. 2013 LG H&H CSR Report 45 Green Management To address environmental issues systematically, LG H&H manages the environment issue within the integrated ESH (environment, safety, and health) system, together with the worksite safety issue. Our green management strategy in relation to our plant operation includes enterprise-wide ESH system establishment, climate change response, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. Especially, LG H&H’s climate change response system was built and is being operated in line with LG Group’s green management strategy. The goal of green management is to reduce our GHG emissions by 40%, and our water usage by 30%, by 2020, against the 2009 base year, under the BAU (business as usual) scenario. To attain this goal, we are planning to invest KRW 51 billion in green management by 2020. KPI(Key Performance Indicators) [GHG emissions] [Water usage] 2.34 2.28 2.23 GHG emissions (ton CO2e) 0.081 Water usage (m3) 0.077 3,446,027 Intensity (ton CO2e/ 0.069 Intensity (m3/ 3,263,602 2,979,410 product-ton) product-ton) 106,737 106,526 105,823 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 Climate change and water shortage are the representative environmental issues that need to be addressed for sustainable development, and are very highly related to the features of LG H&H’s products and operation. While the regulation on climate change is being toughened up, the GHG emissions attributed to energy usage is an essential issue that must be addressed in relation to climate change. As for water, the effective resolution of the water issue in relation to water usage in the beverage business as well as in the process conveys the most significant meaning. These issues should be addressed in the long term, and LG H&H has exerted its best enterprise-wide efforts at the entire group level to achieve long-term success in business while contributing to sustainable development.

The company strives to apply consistent environmental policies and management standards to LG H&H’s plants, global plants, and subsidiaries. LG H&H’s current ISO 14001 certification status can be found in the Appendix. LG H&H reviews its green management policy, process, and outcomes for the efficient operation of its environmental management system. For example, internal diagnosis is conducted annually, targeting selected production plants and logistics centers, to ensure that the company complies with the policy and process, and to undertake improvements. Moreover, corrective measures are taken after the diagnosis, and the actual improvement practices are monitored and managed as the outcome. In 2013, the completion level of the corrective measures taken after the the local regulation, and is managed at an appropriate level. Management of Climate Change Response and GHG Emission Reduction LG H&H’s operation is to cause GHG emissions in most of its energy uses due to its operational features. Therefore, increase in energy efficiency has direct, [GHG emission] significant impacts on the reduction of GHG emitted by the company’s (unit: ton CO2e) business activities. To decrease our GHG emissions and to improve our energy efficiency at the Direct same time, we have endeavored to undertake energy consumption diagnosis, emissions: to continually introduce facilities with high efficiency and to optimize the 41,724 driving conditions. For instance, we undertook an energy consumption (39%) diagnosis of the Cheongju worksite’s production facilities, utility facilities, and power substation for two weeks in November 2013, and we drew six 106,526 improvement tasks therefrom, which resulted in an around 9.5 TJ reduction per annum. At the Ulsan worksite, the installation of an inverter for the distillation process has saved around 2.7 TJ per annum, and at the Indirect emissions: Yangsan worksite, the replacement of the aging oil immersed transformer 64,802 with a transformer with low noise and high efficiency has reduced the power (61%) consumption, saving around 0.8 TJ per annum. At the Gwangju worksite, the installation of four Demand Controllers enabled automatic control of the chiller and heater at the time of maximum power load, resulting in an approximately 0.3 TJ reduction per annum. In 2013, the energy consumption (domestic standard) increased to 2,139 TJ, up 16.3%, and the GHG emission (domestic standard) decreased to 106,526 ton CO2e, down 0.2% from the previous year. Water Usage LG H&H promotes a variety of activities to save and protect precious water. It is essential for the beverage manufacturing business, which handles a great amount of water, to pay attention to its possible environmental influence on the water catchment zone, and to manage it. It also affects the company’s relationship with the local community and the company’s reputation in the community. For instance, Coca Cola Beverage undertook a source water vulnerability assessment (SVA) and came up with a source water protection plan (SWPP) according to Coca Cola Global’s policy. SWPP is an approval process developed by Coca Cola Global in response to the worldwide water shortage issue, which enables the local Coca Cola brand manufacturer to figure out its water usage status and the relevant risk. The plan is to be reestablished at five-year intervals. The SVA and SWPP are being implemented at the Yeoju, Yangsan, Gwangju, Cheonan, Pyeongchang, Namwon, Cheolwon, and Uiwang worksites. Pollutant Emission Management LG H&H strives to reduce the environmental impact of the air and water pollutants emitted from its plant. Its strict management of its pollutant emissions is very important considering the impact of such emissions on the surrounding normally functioning ecosystem, and on the local community. Realizing this, LG H&H established an internal standard that is stricter than the external regulation on pollutant emissions, and applied it. The standard is revised in compliance with the local regulation, and is managed at an appropriate level. 2013 LG H&H CSR Report 47 1) Water pollutants LG H&H appropriately deals with the wastewater generated by its industrial process through the wastewater treatment facilities at the plant or the jointly operated wastewater disposal facilities. When LG H&H has to treat wastewater directly, the company does it in compliance with its internal management standard, which is stricter than the external standard. The company also tries its best to effectively treat its wastewater through the constant maintenance of its waste disposal facilities, the preparation of standby facilities so it would be prepared for a possible breakdown, reinforced monitoring, and analysis of the water pollutants. For example, in 2013, the company conducted a risk analysis of the environmental pollutant emissions and installed a discharge detection facility at its final discharge pond, which has the highest emission risk, allowing constant monitoring. 2) Soil quality management LG H&H figures out and manages in advance the possible soil-contaminating substances generated by its production activities. At our plant, the appropriate storage of products and liquid materials is regarded as most important. They are stored inside the tank, and oil-retaining walls have been installed around the tank yard so that in the event of a leakage, soil contamination can be prevented. The facilities are improved whenever required. For example, approximately KRW100 million was invested in coating the oil-retaining walls and in replacing the deteriorated hydrochloric acid storage vessel. 3) Hazardous substance management LG H&H has carried out a variety of activities for hazardous substance management, which involves substance reduction, removal of possible risks in the handling process, and crisis management procedure and emergency preparedness. In 2013, at our Cheongju plant, to eliminate the treatment risk of hazardous chemicals, we replaced some hazardous chemicals with non-hazardous raw materials, and in the case of the non-replaceable hazardous chemicals, we strengthened the treatment facilities. At our Onsan plant, we have restored the storage facilities for toxic agents and hazardous substances, with the aim of reinforcing our preventive management system against chemical accidents. Furthermore, at our Gwangju plant, we have undertaken facility maintenance activities, such as the replacement of the aging facilities and the installation of a secondary contamination-preventive hump. We have also come up with an emergency contact system and a task division system with the relevant institutes in the vicinity of the worksite and with the local community to prepare for emergencies; such systems will be reviewed and upgraded every year for effective response to emergency situations. Eco-friendly Logistics LG H&H recognizes that the appropriate integration of our logistical infrastructure and our existing-process innovation can create various opportunities to decrease our logistics expenses and our environmental impact. As such, we have endeavored to realize eco-friendly logistics through logistics rationalization, including logistics process innovation, logistics center integration and transportation capacity improvement, and in-house communication vitalization. 1) Logistics process innovation The representative cases of logistics process innovation are the establishment of a joint delivery system and the expansion of cross-docking among our production bases. In the case of the joint delivery system, it was implemented in Busan and Jeju in 2010, using the logistics base between THEFACESHOP and LG H&H, which was gradually extended to the nationwide logistics bases, creating synergy effects on our logistics. In 2013, the joint delivery system establishment was completed in all our logistics bases by extending the system to the western and eastern parts of the metropolitan area. The system helps reduce our environmental impact, and for THEFACESHOP, its logistics cost was decreased by 17% per annum. Meanwhile, the expansion of cross-docking among our production bases also served to reduce our logistics cost and environmental impact. For example, LG H&H promoted cross-docking, the practice of unloading the incoming materials from the production storage and subcontractors/OEM companies to the central logistics center, and loading the goods directly into a distribution vendor’s logistics center, which resulted in the reduction of the transport distance. As for the beverage industry, we have rationalized the transport route by allowing the direct transport of the beverage Vio Soonsoo from our Cheolwon plant to the local base. Besides, the practice of transporting the goods produced in the plant to our accounts via our logistics center was improved, resulting in transport distance reduction. The beverages produced in the Cheonwon plant of HAITAI Beverage Company, used to be transported first to Yeoju Mega Center and then distributed to the nationwide regional bases, but beginning in September 2013, they were directly transported to each 48 Care Environment Green Management regional base. This transport route rationalization resulted in the 415-fold reduction of the 14-ton truckload, and the 8.5% reduction of the transport distance. In addition, the reduction of the goods transport stage (plant/logistics/accounts>plant/accounts) resulted in the 1,563-fold decrease of the 14-ton truckload per annum. 2) Logistics center integration The effective integration of logistics centers is expected to create great synergy effects. In 2013, HAITAI Beverage Company conducted logistics center integration. As a result, the Ulsan logistics center of HAITAI Beverage Company and the Ulsan logistics center of Coca Cola Beverage were integrated, and the Jinju and Tongyeong logistics centers of HAITAI operated in the same business zone were likewise integrated. 3) Transport capacity improvement and eco-friendly vehicle introduction LG H&H has enlarged its goods transport vehicle and has upgraded its load efficiency in a bid to improve its goods transport capacity. The company has also improved its old vehicles and has introduced eco-friendly vehicles and equipment to reduce its environmental impact. In 2013, along with the company’s transport business partners, the usage ratio of vehicles over 14 tons increased by 10%, and the usage ratio of the 26-ton trucks in the beverage section rose by 5% compared to the previous year, which led to a fuel consumption reduction, and a consequent 35 ton CO2e and a 104 ton CO2e GHG emission reduction respectively. Efforts at replacing our old vehicles and introducing eco-friendly vehicles have been steadily made. In 2013, we replaced our old diesel cars, changed our gasoline cars to LPG, and replaced our existing forklifts with electronic forklifts to reduce our environmental impact. We also continued our “Eco-Driving Campaign” to take part in the low-carbon, green-logistics practice. 4) ESH Council operation with our business partners LG H&H holds regular meetings between the head of its logistics centers and the presidents and related managers of its business partners to share the domestic and overseas regulations on environment, and safety and health, and its eco-friendly logistics practice measures, and to receive the requests from its business partners.

The project is aimed at helping each household become self-sustainable by providing them with mango tree seedlings and education on how to plant them and make them grow. Through this project, 10,000 mango trees are planted in the country yearly. Mango trees are seen as very effective tools in addressing the poverty and hunger issue in the region as they bear fruit when they turn 4 years old, and their fruits can be harvested twice a year. Their fruits are very good for children with malnutrition as they provide enriched vitamins A, C, and D and can live up to 100 years even under the poor conditions in Africa. Furthermore, in 2012, LG H&H purchased mango extracts cultivated in Sudan for its Mango Seed product line, a highly moisturized cosmetic line composed of seven varieties, which fetched approximate KRW 20 billion in sales in 2013. We call it “Himango Circulation Circle,” targeting economic and educational self-subsistence. The circle will go around as a certain portion of the product sales proceeds is reinvested in the planting of mango trees. In 2012, our commitment to this project produced tangible fruits through the establishment of Himango Village, a comprehensive education and culture center designed to provide the foundation for the self-reliance of the people in Tonj. There, the males receive vocational training in carpentry and construction, and the females, sewing and English. A preschool was built to offer education to the children.

Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the data and information are not presented appropriately. 2013 LG H&H CSR Report 73 ● Inclusivity Inclusivity is the participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to sustainability. LG H&H is developing and maintaining stakeholder communication channels in various forms and levels in order to make a commitment to be responsible for the stakeholders. The assurance team did not find any critical stakeholder group left out during this procedure. ● Materiality Materiality is determining the relevance and significance of an issue to an organization and its stakeholders. A material issue is an issue that will influence the decisions, actions, and performance of an organization or its stakeholders. LG H&H is determining the materiality of issues found out through stakeholder communication channels through its own materiality evaluation process, and the assurance team did not find any critical issues left out in this process. ● Responsiveness Responsiveness is an organization’s response to stakeholder issues that affect its sustainability performance and is realized through decisions, actions, and performance, as well as communication with stakeholders. The assurance team did not find any evidence that LG H&H’s counter measures to critical stakeholder issues were inappropriately recorded in the Report. In addition, the assurance team checked that the LG H&H complied with the GRI G3.1 in preparing the Report, and that the Report fulfills the requirements of GRI application level ‘A+’. Recommendation for improvement We hope the Report is actively used as a communication tool with stakeholders and recommend the following for improvements. ● W e recommend LG H&H develop more systematic internal assurance process so as to enhance reliability of data and information. Our independence With the exception of providing third party assurance services, KMAR is not involved in any other LG H&H business operations that are aimed at making profit in order to avoid any conflicts of interest and to maintain independence. 30 June 2014 Korea ,Management, Association Registration CEO Ki Ho Park 74 Appendix Global Business & Contact us Global Business & Contact us ● Production Corporation ● Sales Corporation New York California Beijing Tokyo Shanghai Nanyang Fukuoka Hangzhou Taiwan Vietnam LG H&H’s Overseas Corporations China Vietnam Taiwan Corporation in China LG-VINA J/V Taiwan LG HOUSEHOLD & HEALTH CARE TRADING(Shanghai) LG VINA COSMETICS CO., LTD LG HOUSEHOLD & HEALTH CARE (TAIWAN), LTD.
