Nippon Paper Group Sustainability Report 2014 5 The Sustainable Business Model of a Comprehensive Biomass Enterprise Effectively Applying Sustainable Resources to Contribute to the Sustainable Development of Society In addition to preventing global warming and protecting watersheds, forests perform a wide variety of functions such as providing shelter for diverse living creatures. As a comprehensive biomass enterprise, the Nippon Paper Group practices sustainable forest management, while also making full use of and recycling the precious resources forests represent. Benefits for the fight against global warming, protection of biodiversity, and prevention of resource depletion Three Cycles Contributing to 1 Sustainable Forest Sustainable Development Management 206,000 hectares of company-owned forests worldwide — CO2 sequestered in wood roughly equivalent to the entire area of Tokyo Prefecture After harvesting, steps are taken to regenerate forests through replanting and coppice Harvesting and use regeneration, which entails the growth of shoots that sprout from stumps into new trees. In this manner, every effort is being made to ensure a permanent source of forests. Biodiversity conservation Nippon Paper Industries has designated 1 approximately 20% of its Japanese forest as “environmental forest areas.” In these areas, logging for commercial purposes is prohibited and forest biodiversity and water resources are protected. These environmental forest Photosynthesis Sustainable Forest areas include national park lands in Akan, Nikko, and other places as well. Management Afforestation Environmental forest areas: 18,000 hectares About 20% of forests owned in Japan 2 CO2 Carbon Neutrality Nurturing 2 (Preventing Global Warming through the Carbon Cycle) CO2 absorption and sequestration CO2 sequestered in company-owned Carbon Neutrality forests worldwide: 34 million tons (Carbon Cycle) Using photosynthesis, plants absorb CO2 from the CO2 absorption atmosphere. Combusting biomass fuels, therefore, from the growth of emits CO2 that is offset by the CO2 absorbed when plants and trees the plants were growing. That means there is no net increase in atmospheric CO2. This concept, described as being “carbon-neutral,” is why it is said that biomass fuels do not promote global warming and are a fuel with a low environmental burden. 6 Nippon Paper Group Sustainability Report 2014 Making full use of and recycling trees as a biomass resource Cascade use of trees The Nippon Paper Group uses trees in a cascade of applications that contributes to greater resource usage efficiency by employing every bit Cascade use of wood of every tree. Unprocessed wood Prevention of resource depletion Of the energy used by the Nippon Paper Group, 45% is comprised of black liquor from the pulp-making process, wood construction waste and other biomass fuels, and fuels derived from discarded tires, RPF, and other waste materials. Use as a material As well as using biomass fuel, the Group is making advances in the development of biomass Paper and construction materials and materials that can be used in place of various other products CO2 emission petrochemical products. from burning Non-fossil energy* as a percent of total energy usage: Use as a fuel Black liquor, construction waste, 45% logging residue, and other forms of biomass fuel * Non-fossil energy = biomass energy+ waste energy Use 3 Recycling of Separation and collection 3 Recycling Products of Paper Production of recycled paper Paper Products Recycled paper utilization rate Paper 39% Paperboard 90% Waste-paper pulp production The Nippon Paper Group is working diligently to increase the waste paper collection rate with the support of customers and the general public. In addition to bolstering its recycled paper processing capabilities, the Group is striving to improve the quality of pulp made from recycled paper and to increase the number of applications.

Black liquor has long been burned in boilers at paper mills to produce steam and electricity. Our plans for the future call for further expansion of our energy business by leveraging the expertise we have developed in power plant fuel procurement and management. Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd., for example, is progressing with the installation of a 5,000 kW biomass power generation facility at its Yatsushiro Mill. This facility, which will be fueled solely with domestic unused wood resources, is scheduled to begin supplying power in March 2015. The wood to be used as fuel will be stably sourced from within a 50 km radius of the Yatsushiro Mill by employing a collection network already in place for gathering woodchips used as a raw material for making paper. Power from this new facility is expected to bring in annual revenues of about 1.3 billion yen. Biomass boiler already in operation (No. 3 Biomass Boiler at Nippon Paper Industries’ Fuji Mill) TOPICS 2 Cellulose Nanofiber The term “cellulose nanofiber” (CNF) refers to ultrafine fibers that are isolated from wood fiber and as small as 4 nanometers (billionths of a meter) in width. Their dimensional change in response to temperature changes are as small as those of glass fiber, they are stronger than steel but as light as paper, and they excel in transparency and oxygen barrier properties. They also demonstrate uniquely high viscosity in water. CNF is expected to fulfill various roles in industrial materials, such as reinforcement of resins used in automobiles and electronics, and in additives for foods and cosmetics. Transparent sheet made from cellulose nanofiber In October 2013, the Group established Japan's first production demonstration facilities (with minimum 1 1 1 1,000 1,000 1,000 production capacity of 30 tons per year) for CNFs at the 20m Iwakuni Mill. At present, we are distributing sample 20μm 20nm products to potential customers in a range of industries to support application development, while we work to Wood Woodchips Wood fiber Cellulose establish the mass-production technology and reduce (Pulp) nanofiber production costs. TOPICS 3 Health Care Products Nippon Paper Crecia has installed a new production line for its Poise® incontinence products and is aggressively promoting sales in television and other advertising media. Year-on-year sales growth of around 30% was achieved in fiscal 2013, and the Health Care Product Sales Division has been newly established to pursue further business expansion. Expanding production facilities further, while extending the product line with offerings such as Poise® Liner Attach Guard incontinence products for men, Nippon Paper Crecia is Poise® Pad Poise® Liner prepared to vigorously invest business resources in both sales and R&D.

As such, we have a social responsibility to contribute to the sustainable development of society by making effective use of wood resources, which are renewable. With proper forest management, forests can be used as a sustainable resource, and forest ecosystems and biodiversity can be protected. Because forests act to sequester CO2, using wood resources actually helps to prevent global warming. At the Nippon Paper Group, therefore, we treat the sustainable procurement of raw materials as one of our highest priorities.

Under the FM certification system, a third party certifies that the management of forests is being undertaken in a sustainable manner based on various objective benchmarks including (1) compliance with regulatory requirements and system frameworks, (2) maintenance and conservation of forest ecosystems and biodiversity, (3) respect for native and local resident rights, and (4) maintenance and improvement of forest productivity. CoC certification is a system covering all operators engaged in the processing and distribution of timber materials. In addition to certifying that products (certified woodchips) are managed based on the forest certification standard in each process including processing and distribution, CoC certification confirms that a risk assessment of all noncertified woodchips has been undertaken. Products display a certification mark in the event that all operators have acquired CoC certification across all processes.
