New rules have been introduced for reporting workplace injuries. In the event of a serious accident, the CEO must be contacted within 24 hours. LTIF is measured and evaluated continuously for the entire Group. This indicates the number of accidents per million hours worked. In 2013, the LTIF was 12.3 and the long-term target is for the LTIF to be 0. Business ethics Work regarding business ethics is described in detail in Lindab’s Code of Ethics and the recently updated anti-corruption policy. Lindab has zero tolerance with regard to corruption. In 2013, all managers signed a document to indicate their support for the anti-corruption policy and in all business units, a risk assessment has been conducted to indicate the current status. In addition, a review was undertaken for all of Lindab’s partners. Climate and environmental impact Lindab is continually working to enhance the efficiency of its own production, purchasing organisation and supply chain. This applies to all aspects such as time, materials and energy. The introduction of Lean throughout the organisation is an important step in this process and contributes to lower resource consumption thereby reducing the environmental impact. The Group’s streamlining work meant that emissions of greenhouse gases per tonne continued to decrease in 2013 despite an increase in emissions in absolute terms as a result of newly acquired production units. Energy efficiency In its product development, Lindab always strives to help simplify construction in every phase of the construction process, in terms of the design phase as well as the actual product, its installation and delivery. The focus is primarily on developing new solutions for better indoor climate and energy consumption for both renovation and new builds. In 2013, a number of new successful solutions have been launched such as InDomo, EcoBuild and Lindab Solo. 41 l i ndab | GR I i n dex The information presented relates to the calendar year for 2013 GRI Index and, unless otherwise speciﬁed, extends to all operating subsidiaries that were included from the start of the year.
