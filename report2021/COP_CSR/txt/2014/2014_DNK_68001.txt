Introduction BALL GROUP hereby publishes a report covering the status on the company’s CSR initiatives and results for year 2013. It follows up on last year’s report and covers the activities from March 2013 to February 2014. In 2011, BALL GROUP joined the United Nations Global Compact initiatives. BALL GROUP are still a part of the UN Global Compact, and are supporting the initiatives and policy hereof. BALL GROUP believe in achieving goals through responsible business practices following the stance that you should treat others as you yourself would like to be treated. This report aims to highlight the working areas of focus in the CSR Committee of BALL GROUP. The primary CSR objective of 2013 has been to structure our CSR work, and shed light on the areas in which BALL GROUP can make the biggest impact, in the everyday business practices. These areas will receive particular focus in 2014. As a foundational part of our CSR strategy, we aim to ensure that our suppliers are in compliance with Global Compact’s 10 principles and we support initiatives that seek to advance human rights, labor rights and working conditions, environmental impacts and ethical business practices. We are proud of being part of the United Nations Global Compact initiative and recognize that there will always be potential in further developing and improving our combined efforts of raising the bar for responsible business practices. 3 2. CEO Statement of Continued Support in 2013 2013 has been a challenging year in the textile business and the swells of the economic crisis has put a lot of pressure on the entire industry. Despite of that, we have seen more companies joining the UN Global Compact and, by doing that, helping to build an even stronger cooperation towards a joined CSR effort. At Ball Group we have continued our work to improve the principles of UN Global compact within our own company, but even more by working closely together with our partners around the world in order to gain better conditions for human rights, labor rights and the environment. Our basic values are still based on the assumption that we must seek to treat others as we would expect others to behave towards us. This is a fundamental part of our Code of Conduct, which has been upgraded during the past year. An upgrade we expect to continue in the years to come. We are very proud that our suppliers have adopted our point of view, and are working towards the same goals as ourselves. Some of these suppliers have reached higher improvements than others, but all of them are working proactively towards the principles of UN Global Compact. Besides the basic values of our work, our Code of Conduct has been strengthened in regards to specific recruitments to the behavior of our suppliers. In the past year issues on animal welfare, use of chemicals, and anti-corruption has been addressed, and very specific tolerances has been agreed. All these initiatives are supportive in the aim of meeting the objectives of the UN Global Compact. Looking into 2014 we see a lot of new challenges, but we believe that we, in a joined effort with our suppliers, can achieve even more. We are therefore very proud to continue to be a part of UN Global Compact, and we are looking forward to keep contributing to a further development of these principles. Ole Holm CEO, BALL GROUP 4 3. about BALL GROUP 3.1 History As presented in the first annual report, the company we today know as BALL GROUP was founded in 1988. The primary idea was to provide fashionable clothing at reasonable prices while relying on strong business acumen. This was the beginning of the business concept as we know it today. BALL GROUP stays true to this concept, but the targeted customer segment has been broadened.  2000 – In August, the brand Zizzi arose from a desire to offer fashion clothes in so-called plus sizes (42-56). Zizzi became an immediate success and the concept has since been elaborated on with a well-established store concept.  2004 – In August, the brand Culture were established with its first collection  2007 – In August, PULZ Jeans were launched. Today, BALL-GROUP stands strong in its two main segments: Regular sizes (size 36 to 42)  Culture is sold and marketed in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, The Netherlands, Germany, England, Spain and Singapore.  Pulz is sold and marketed in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Iceland, England and the Faroe Islands. Plus sizes (size 42 to 56)  ZIZZI CONCEPT currently holds a total of approx. 130 stores located in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Finland and Estonia. Half of these stores are operated by franchisees. Zizzi is also sold in leading multi-brand stores in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, The Netherlands, Finland, England, Iceland, France, Belgium, Latvia and Estonia. BALL GROUP is today known as a company that continuously delivers the latest trends, where service, flexibility, business acumen and value for the money are key aspects. With our current position in both the regular size and the plus size segment, we are thus well equipped to continuously expand this exciting and ambitious company. 5 3.2 Values, Vision & Mission The following core values represent the foundation of BALL GROUP’s success (that we think go hand in hand with UN Global Compact’s principles): Dedication We walk the extra mile Courage We dare to make a difference Team Effort We achieve more together Drive We keep moving Closeness WE CARE Common Sense We focus on results BALL GROUP wishes to create new opportunities in fashion, challenging the limitations of conventional thinking. Therefore, our vision is: “Eliminating boundaries in fashion” We believe that people are the key to success, and it’s our mission to support and advance them. Therefore, BALL GROUP pursues its vision by the mission: “We empower people to succeed!” 6 4. CSR approach 4.1 CSR Committee CSR has always been a natural part of BALL GROUP’s business approach, rooting in the general maxim that you should treat others as you yourself would like to be treated. The CSR Committee is headed by Conni Schrøder (Supply Chain Manager) and further consisting of Ole Holm (Chief Executive Officer), Peter Møller (Chief Financial Officer), Lisbeth Kjerulf Mikkelsen (Brand Manager) and Janni Nansen Schmidt (Assistant to the Management). The Committee continues to convene once a month, initiating short-term and long-term actions and defining goals to pursue. In the following, the activities initiated and undertaken from March 2013 to February 2014 are being presented. 4.2 Code of Conduct As elaborated on in the report from 2011, BALL GROUP revised its Code of Conduct in the beginning of 2012. It was sent out to all first tier suppliers in March 2012 and has since been available on our extranet. The current Code of Conduct describes the core values and ethical principles and behavior that BALL GROUP wishes to promote throughout the supply chain. It incorporates Global Compact’s 10 principles and one additional animal welfare principle. All suppliers have with their signature warranted to commit to and comply with this Code of Conduct. 4.3 Internal Analysis of BALL GROUP – Materiality Matrix The United Nations Global Compact initiative targets human rights, labor rights and working conditions, environmental impacts and ethical business practices. By joining the UN Global Compact, we aim to communicate on our social commitment within a widely accepted and recognizable framework. In August 2013 the CSR committee had a meeting with advisor Dorte Gram Nybroe from UN Global Compact. The meeting was centered on BALL GROUP’s work with CSR, and how to structure and aim for a better outcome of our CSR related initiatives. On the basis of this meeting the CSR committee completed UN Global Compact’s Self-Assessment Tool which revealed the strengths and weaknesses of BALL GROUP from a CSR perspective. With a starting point in the results from the Self-Assessment Tool, we undertook a materiality analysis (see figure 1) of the CSR initiatives in BALL GROUP. The materiality matrix is measured on the initiatives’ “importance for BALL GROUP”, as well as our “bargaining power” in relation to our suppliers. The CSR areas were chosen based on the importance of the areas in the fashion industry, combined with the Self-Assessment tool;  Animal Welfare  Anti-Corruption  Chemicals 7  Employment Issues  Environmental Concern We weighted the areas in relation to the importance for BALL GROUP, and rated them hereafter based on our expected performance level. The result of the materiality analysis can be seen in figure 1. The analysis shows that “chemicals” is the most important subject for BALL GROUP currently, and the subject we expect to get the best outcome of. Figure 1: Materiality Analysis Materiality Analysis 1,2 1 Importance for BALL GROUP 0,8 Animal welfare 0,6 Anti-corruption Chemicals 0,4 Employment issues Environmental concern 0,2 0 0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1 1,2 The Bargaining Power of BALL GROUP 4.4 Supplier Survey In September 2012, a Supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaire (See appendix 1) was sent out based on Global Compact’s 10 principles. Data on the CSR performance of the majority of BALL GROUP’s suppliers was collected, registered and evaluated. This survey has been updated in 2013, including all new suppliers, as well as the suppliers who did not respond to the survey in 2012. The collected data, together with our materiality analysis, builds the groundwork for our current and near future CSR focus. The survey has revolved around 5 different CSR related subjects, which we have found to be very important that all our suppliers meet, as a starting point for our cooperation. Referring to figure 2-6, the higher the scores on the X-axis the better the performance, the Y-axis is showing how many respondents scored points for their answers in the particular topic. As the figures show, the environment seems to be the area of the worst performance among our suppliers. This 8 corresponds well with our materiality analysis, which showed that chemicals should be our area of focus in 2014. Not only do we believe that chemicals and the environment are the areas where we currently can make the biggest positive impact, it is also the area in which our suppliers are making the least effort in their daily routines and production processes. Therefore, our focus in 2014 will be on improving the environmental initiatives among our suppliers, with a special focus on the reduction of chemicals in production.

This decision will hold stand, until tracking of animals used in production is fully available and valid at our suppliers’ productions facilities. Year 2014 will be the first year; where collections without fur will be sold to the end-consumers. In the fall 2013, an intense focus from the European media on a terrible and inhuman production method of angora wool, appeared. A documentary about Chinese production methods of angora wool, disclosed how living rabbits are being plucked instead of sheared. From BALL GROUP’s point of view, this method violates against every fair behavior and is a direct cruelty to animals, and is contrary to our Code of Conduct. In order to underline our view on animal cruelty, and in particular the angora wool case, we send a letter to all our suppliers, highlighting our requirements for treatment of animals used in production, referring to article 11 in our Code of Conduct: 11. Animals should be treated humanely according to animal welfare laws and international recommendations In businesses where animals are used in labor and/or in the production (fur, wool, etc.) such animals must be fed and treated with dignity and respect, and no animal must deliberately be harmed nor exposed to pain in their lifespan. Taking the lives of animals must at all times be conducted by using the quickest, least painful and non-traumatic method available, approved by national and acknowledged veterinarians and only conducted by trained personnel. All suppliers were asked to give their consent by signature to article 11 in our Code of Conduct, and our requirements for treatment of angora rabbits used in production. 5. BALL GROUP staff 5.1. The Under-Represented Gender One of the bearing beams of the UN Global Compact is the wish for equality across genders, races and religions. As Ball Group has adapted to the UN Global Compact, the board decided in March 2013 to establish a target for underrepresented gender in the top management. The following target has been agreed upon: “20% of the top management in Ball Group seeks to consist of female’s pr. 2017, which also include a minimum of 1 female board member.” Furthermore, the top management has developed a policy for increasing the amount of the underrepresented gender in other management bodies. The following policy has been enforced: 11 “One of the bearing beams in the UN Global Compact is the wish for equality across genders, races and religions. We have integrated this on our recruitment policy, so that professional and social competencies solely are being used as basis of evaluation. Everyone is thereby guaranteed equal and open possibilities for being a part of Ball Group, and hereafter making use of own possibilities and competencies in the best possible way. The above mentioned basis of evaluation will likewise be used in connection with recruitment for open positions in Ball Group’s top management.” 5.2 Trainees with special needs We have entered cooperation with an educational arrangement for young people with special needs. It is primarily pointed at young people who find it too challenging to begin, and complete, an ordinary education. The apprenticeship runs for 3-4 years, shifting between school and practice. The subjects and teaching is planned in cooperation with the educational supervisor, the trainee and the hosting company. Currently, we have two trainees following such a course – a business trainee and a warehouse trainee. The reason for entering this cooperation is based on a wish for supporting young people in the aim for an education. We are very pleased with our trainees, who are both enthusiastic and talented within their fields. 5.3 Working Conditions Figure 7 illustrate that we are an expanding company that mostly attracts women – due to our position in women’s fashion industry.

We believe that it should be fun, instructive, safe and satisfying to be at work. We also believe that certain diversity in gender, age, education, attitude and outlook on life creates a good and prosperous work environment. BALL GROUP offers all employees a pension and health care scheme. For a small monthly fee there is free access to tea, coffee, water, fruits and luncheon – consisting of a warm dish, bread and a salad bar. The food is being delivered from an external caterer that has in the course fully implemented a healthy lifestyle approach. Beyond that, we continue substituting the majority of sodas, candy, chocolate and other sugary treats with water and fruits. Furthermore, a massage therapist offers her services during work hours three to four times a month. The treated employees receive full payment for the duration of the treatment. As Figure 7 shows, we have many employees of the childbearing age. In 2013 we had 13 employees on maternity leave. Currently, there are 7 colleagues on maternity leave. We are very happy that everything has gone well for our employees and that healthy children were born. However, pregnancies are one of the reasons for our relatively high sickness absence in 2013 (see figure 8): Figure 8: Sickness Absence Sickness absence 2011 1.9% 2012 3.3% 2013 3.3% If we subtract absence due to pregnancy from figure 8, we come down to 3.0%, and if we further abstract from injuries or disease that does not repeatedly occur (e.g. knee surgery), sickness absence is down to 2.1%. Unfortunately we see a slight increase in sickness absence, compared to previous years. Unfortunately, we recorded 1 working accident in 2013. An employee at the warehouse scratched his cornea, when handling some plastic band during unwrapping of goods. The accident caused a sickness absence of 3 days, and was reported to the National Board of Industrial Injuries. A workplace evaluation has been undertaken in 2013, and the results reflect a rather positive picture of the work environment in BALL GROUP. The primary issues regarding the work environment, is concentrated around the indoor environment. Solutions to all issues has been found, and actions taken in cooperation between the responsible top managers and employees in each department. Over all the annual staff development interviews, reveals that our employees are healthy and happy to come to work. 13 5.4 Employee Satisfaction Survey Besides BALL GROUP’s own workplace evaluation, an external survey regarding employee satisfaction in BALL GROUP was undertaken on the basis of Danish Venture Capital Association. The survey compares BALL GROUP and the Danish labor market. Figure 9 shows the results of BALL GROUP divided in to the following areas: 1. Reputation 2. Tasks 3. Professional and Personal Development 4. Working Conditions 5. Colleagues and Team Work 6. Immediate Superior 7. Top Management 8. Changes and Readjustment 9. Customer Orientation Each area has been rated on a scale from 1-7, with 7 as the most positive score. Figure 9 – Employee Satisfaction Survey 2013 14 As figure 9 shows, BALL GROUP equal, or above, on all parameters compared to the Danish labor market. The result of this survey corresponds well with BALL GROUP’s own staff development interviews, which also revealed that the employees are satisfied with their jobs and organization in BALL GROUP. 15 6. Anti-Corruption BALL GROUP believes in fair competition and we are dedicated to work against corrupt practices in all operations linked to our business. In October 2013 one case of corruption between a former employee and supplier were disclosed. As we take all cases of corruption highly serious in Ball Group, the cooperation with the supplier in question was immediately closed, as well as the former employee was reported to the police. Even though we do have clear and strict policies in regards to unfair competition and corruption, which all our suppliers has warranted to commit to, we must admit that a persistent focus on the issue is needed. Consequently, the following anti-corruption paragraphs were incorporated in the employee manual according to what we consider to be a proper business conduct:  It is expected that suppliers display the highest level of ethical integrity when dealing with workers, subcontractors, second tier suppliers and BALL GROUP employees. They should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.  Any monetary incentive or encouragement of BALL GROUP employees is prohibited. Furthermore, BALL GROUP personnel are not permitted to accept gifts of greater value except in case of special anniversaries, weddings, etc. In case of doubt, management should be contacted for assessing individual cases. 7. Environmental Impact We have in 2013 continued collecting paper, cardboard and plastic for recycling. We collected a total of 3.810 kg waste paper in 2013, compared to 1.356 kg in 2012. The rather large amount of paper is caused by delivery of old accounts. In the future most of our reporting will be moved to digital media, and thereby reducing our paper waste. The warehouse has isolated collected 24.630 kg of cardboards and plastic, compared to 22.157 kg in 2012. As stated in the report from 2012, we have in 2013 aimed for improvement of our shipment efficiency and emission reduction. Throughout 2013, we have been working on the implementation of a new warehouse system in BALL GROUP. With the new system we will, among other things, be able to wrap more goods together, and as a result be shipping fewer boxes to our customers. We will thereby decrease our use of cardboards, as well as the Co2 emission via shipment of our goods, as the frequency of delivery will be reduced. 16 8. Conclusion Year 2013 has primarily been focused on internal analyses of BALL GROUP, with the aim to develop a clearer and more structured strategy for the future work with CSR in the organization and with stakeholders. The conclusion of the internal analyses, UN Global Compact’s self-Assessment Tool, a materiality matrix as well as a survey among our suppliers, have revealed that the next step for BALL GROUP in year 2014 is to put emphasize on the optimization of environmental initiatives, including the use of chemicals in our products, in cooperation with our suppliers. Regarding animal welfare, 2013 has been the year where fur was excluded from BALL GROUP’s collections, and in 2014 the first fur-free collection will enter the stores. In 2013 an employee satisfactory survey was undertaken in BALL GROUP. The results of the survey revealed a very positive picture of BALL GROUP as an appreciated working place. BALL GROUP scored equal or above on all parameters in the survey, compared to the Danish Labor Market. Moreover, we have adopted a policy about the underrepresented gender in BALL GROUP, with the target of the top management consisting of 20% females, and a minimum of one female in the board, by 2017. In 2012 we made an objective of finding new ways of reducing our paper waste and Co2 emissions in 2013. A new warehouse system has been implemented, which among other things, support this objective by providing a better way of handling goods, which means that more goods will be shipped together in fewer boxes. The system thereby has a positive impact on both waste management, as well as the reduction of co2 emission. The agenda and strategy for the 2014 CSR initiatives in BALL GROUP has been developed through our work in 2013. We therefore believe that the CSR work in 2014 will result in more measureable initiatives, compared to 2013 where the focus has been on developing a clear CSR strategy through clarification of BALL GROUP’s current situation within the field of CSR, as well as the potential and possibilities for improving our CSR situation. 17 APPENDIX I 1.
