These new projects already ensure the meeting of the Company’s expansion targets over the next two years; ɇɇ Investment of R$ 1 billion in the construction projects that are part of the Transmission Projects in Operating Facilities General Plan (PGET) for maintaining the efficiency and robustness of the Furnas system, essential to 18 CONSTRUCTION AT THE HPP TELES PIRES-PA/MT STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT the success of the major sporting events to be held in Brazil; ɇɇ Obtaining of project funding carrying lower costs and longer payment terms; ɇɇ Market perception of Furnas’ strategic direction, which made it possible to raise funds at lower rates, reducing the average cost of capital; ɇɇ Completion of the HPP Simplício, HPP Batalha and the Madeira-Porto Velho-Araraquara Connection, which transmits the power produced by the Madeira River plants in the north of the country to the Southeast Region; ɇɇ Reduction in operating costs, besides those obtained through staff departures already achieved through the PREA, especially due to the improvement and simplification of processes, shared services in the operating areas and the streamlining of the organizational structure; and ɇɇ Increased dividend flow and higher operating efficiency of the SPEs resulting from the strong performance posted in the management of partnerships. New business As a mixed economy company and seeking full transparency in its prospecting and market growth actions, Furnas started to use the Public Call for New Business Opportunities, designed to select potential partners in new business. In December 2013, the active asset portfolio consisted of 76 investors interested in partnerships for transmission and generation auctions of various different energy sources, and 316 entrepreneurial ventures, among which 147 wind projects. In total, there are about 16,000 MW projects registered to participate in hydroelectric, conventional thermal, biomass thermal, wind, solid waste and solar generation auctions.

In the preparation of environmental studies, the company detected the presence of approximately 400 families residing in the vicinity of the projects who could possibly be impacted by the use of the machinery and equipment and the chance of electric shocks. In partnership with the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic Analyses (Ibase), Furnas prepared a project that includes observation of the locations, identification of families subject to risk — with higher or lower risk according to the location and stage of the project — dissemination and clarifications, and a plan for fostering recreational, leisure and cultural activities. At those times when increased movement of machinery occurs and cables are being strung the families participate in activities away from their homes, returning late in the afternoon.

Constantly improving, the system issues various control reports and a list of procedures about the status and terms of each license or permit, facilitating the management of the ongoing processes. To comply with Order 421 of the Ministry of the Environment (MMA) of October 26, 2011, Furnas signed a commitment with IBAMA in 2013 for legalization of the environmental license for 65 transmission lines established prior to the enactment of the National Environmental Policy.
