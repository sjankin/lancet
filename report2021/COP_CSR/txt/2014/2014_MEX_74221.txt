A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and at January 1, 2012 and for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (Thousands of Mexican pesos) (1) Reporting entityGrupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. (the “Company”), is a company located in Mexico, which trade shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange. The Company’s registered office is at Calzada San Bartolo Naucalpan No. 360, Col. Argentina Poniente, Mexico, D.F., C.P. 11230. The Company’s consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2013 include the Company and its subsidiaries (jointly referred to as the “Group” and “Group entities” individually) and the Group’s share on related entities and jointly controlled. The Company is a 51.0% subsidiary of Hechos con Amor, S. A. de C. V., which is empowered to lead its operations. The Group is mainly engaged in the manufacture, purchase, distribution and marketing of canned and packed food products in Mexico, as well as food products targeted at the Mexican food segment within the United States of America (USA). The entities of Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. manufacture and commercilize products under the following trademarks: Aires de Campo, Barilla, Búfalo, Carlota, ChiChi’s, Del Fuerte, Don Miguel, Doña María, Embasa, Herdez, La Victoria, McCormick, Wholly, Yemina and Nutrisa, among others. For such purposes, Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. have forged alliances with leading companies worldwide, such as: McCormick and Company Inc., Hormel Foods Corp., Barilla GeR Fratelli S.p.A. and Grupo Kuo, S. A. B. de C. V. (Grupo Kuo). (2) Basis of preparationThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). On March 11, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. In accordance with the Mexican Corporations Law (LGSM by its Spanish acronym) and the bylaws of Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V., the stockholders are empowered to modify the consolidated financial statements after issuance. The accompanying consolidated financial statements will be submitted to the next Stockholders’ Meeting for approval. (a) Measurement basisThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for following significant items included in the statement of financial position: • The defined benefit asset is recognized as plan assets, less the present value of the defined benefit obligation and is limited as explained in note 3(i) (ii). • Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value with effects applied either to income for the period or comprehensive income. GRUPO HERDEZ 51 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) • The items of property, machinery and equipment recorded at their assumed cost as at the date of the transition to IFRS, which corresponds to the carrying values recognized in accordance with Mexican Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS), which include the effects of accumulated inflation as at December 31, 2007, based on the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) issued by Banco de México (Central Bank). The assumed cost of the Chiapas plant machinery and the land of the Mexico distribution center corresponds to fair values as per appraisals conducted at the date of transition to IFRS. • Bank loans and notes payable are recognized at their amortized cost. (b) Functional and reporting currencyThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Mexican pesos, which is the company’s functional currency. All the information is presented in thousands of pesos and has been rounded to the nearest unit, except when otherwise indicated. In the case of the foreign entities of the joint venture in the U.S., their financial statements are presented in the local currency which is their functional currency and they are converted to Mexican pesos allowing the Company to recognize their participation in such entities. Until December 17, 2013, the subsidiary in Spain converted its financial statements from the local currency to its functional currency, which is Mexican peso. The Spain subsidiary’s activity is considered an extension of the reporting entity, being the collections of royalties generated by Mexican companies its only activity, having as basis of calculation for said royalties the Mexican peso. This Spanish subsidiary decided to transfer its business address to Mexico, adopting for such effects the Mexican nationality and the figure of corporation with variable capital, as well as the Company’s name of “MARCAS HERDEZ “. (c) Use of estimates and judgmentsThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires that management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts for assets, liabilities, informed income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The relevant estimates and assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis. The reviews of the accounting estimates are recognized in the period on which they were reviewed and in any other affected future period. Information about critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect over the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment in the next financial year are described below: 52 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT (i) Consolidation of entities on which there are no majority shareholding The Group analyzes the existence of control over those entities on which it does not has majority shareholding, evaluating if it is exposed or has rights to the variable yields from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect yields through its power over the entity. If as a result from the analysis, the Group determines that it exercises control of these entities, they are consolidated within the Group. If there are no signs of the existence of control on the entities, the investment in those associated companies is recognized by the equity method. (ii) Fair values determination The Group applies the guidelines of IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement (“IFRS 13”) to determine the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value. IFRS 13 not requires fair values in addition to those required or allowed by other IFRS and is not required to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. Under IFRS, the fair value represents the “Selling Price”, which would be received from selling an asset or would be paid for transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as at the date of valuation, considering the credit risk of the counterparty in the valuation. The concept of selling price is based on the assumption that there is a market and participants in such market for the specific asset or liability. When there is no market and/or participants to form the market, the IFRS 13 establishes a fair value that organizes the entry data in the valuation techniques used to determine fair value. The hierarchy of highest priority is unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority is that of the calculations that have to do with entry data that are significant but unobservable (level 3 measurement). The three levels of hierarchy are as follows:  Level 1 data are active market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets and liabilities that the Group has the ability to negotiate on the measurement date.  Level 2 data are different from market prices, but are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability.  Level 3 data are those that are unobservable for the asset or liability. (iii) Fair value of derivative financial instruments The fair values of derivative instruments traded on recognized markets are determined based on quotations issued by these markets. In those cases in which the instruments are traded on OTC market (“Over The Counter”), the fair value of the financial instruments is estimated on the basis of valuation technical models recognized in the financial arena, mainly using that relating to expected future cash flows discounted at present value and based on market information available at the valuation date. In determining the fair values, conditions and assumptions are used, mainly based on TIIE 28, the Mexican Average Interbank Interest Rate (TIIE per its Spanish acronym) and exchange rate available at the valuation date. GRUPO HERDEZ 53 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) The Company has conducted the effectiveness tests required to comply with hedge accounting, which fall within the ranges allowed under IFRS. (iv) Useful lives and fair value of property, machinery and equipment The Group determines the useful lives of its assets based on their best estimate of the periods during which economic benefits are expected to be obtained derived from said assets. Only for IFRS adoption purposes for those assets measured at fair value, when there is a market value, the Company evaluated whether or not said market value met the conditions agreed among interested and willing parties in a free competition transaction, which will allow for considering the market value as a proper reference of fair value; otherwise, the fair value of the assets is estimated on the basis of technical valuation models recognized in the financial scope. (v) Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with undefined useful lives In the case of goodwill and intangible assets with undefined useful lives, the impairment test is performed annually on the same dates. In evaluating the value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted at their present value, using a discount rate before taxes that reflects the market evaluations of the value of the money over time, taking into account the specific risks inherent to the asset. For impairment testing purposes, assets that cannot be tested individually are integrated in smaller groups of assets that generate cash inflows from on-going use and that are, for the most part, independent from the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash generating unit”). For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is distributed to the group of cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of such combination. This distribution is subject to operating segment ceiling testing and reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses recorded with respect to the cash generating units are distributed first to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill distributed to the units and subsequently to reduce the carrying value of other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis. No goodwill-related impairment loss is reverted. (vi) Determination of employee benefits Direct benefits are applied in the income statement as they arise and the related liabilities are stated at their nominal value, due to their short-term nature. The Group’s net obligations with respect to defined benefit pension plans are calculated separately for each plan, estimating the amount of the future benefit earned by employees in return for their services in the current and past periods; this benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is calculated on the basis of zero coupon government bonds with maturity term resembling those of the Group’s obligations and that are determined in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary, using the projected unit credit method. 54 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT (vii) Impairment of accounts receivable On each reporting date, the Group evaluates whether or not there is objective evidence that its accounts receivable are impaired, which includes defaulting or late payment by a debtor, or the restructuring of an amount due to the Group. The Company considers evidence of impairment of accounts receivable at both the specific asset level and collective. All accounts receivable considered significant individually are evaluated for possible specific impairment. All accounts receivable evaluated that are not specifically impaired are subsequently evaluated collectively to identify impairment that may have occurred and, that has not yet been identified. Accounts receivables not significant individually are evaluated collectively for possible impairment, by grouping the accounts showing similar risk features. In evaluating collective impairment, the Group uses the historical trends of the likelihood of default, timing of recoveries and losses incurred, adjusted as a result of the analysis conducted by Management to determine whether or not current economic and credit conditions are such, that actual losses are likely to be higher or lower than those the historical trends suggest. (d) Changes in accounting policiesExcept for the changes included below, the Group has consistently applied the accounting policies described in note 3 to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any amendment resulting to other standards with initial application date as at January 1, 2013. a. Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendments to IFRS 7). b. IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”. c. IFRS 11 “Joint Agreements”. d. IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities”. e. IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”. f. Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (Amendments to IAS 1). g. IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” (2011). h. Disclosure of the Recoverable Amount of Non-Financial Assets (Amendments to IAS 36) (2013). The nature and effects of these amendments are explained below. (i) Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities As a result of the amendments to IFRS 7, the Group has expanded its disclosures about offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. (Note 5). GRUPO HERDEZ 55 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) (ii) Subsidiaries As a result of the adoption of IFRS 10 (2011), the Group has changed its accounting policy relating to the determination of whether or not it has control over its investees and accordingly, whether or not to consolidate them. IFRS 10 (2011) introduces a new control model that focuses on whether the Group has power over an investee, the exposure or the rights to variable yields from its involvement with the investee and the ability to use its power to influence the amount of yields. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 10 (2011), the Group reassessed the conclusion of its investees control as at January 1, 2013. As a result, the Group has changed its control conclusion for its investment on Herdez Del Fuerte, S. A. de C. V. and subsidiaries (HDF), which was previously consolidated in proportion. Although the Group owns half of the voting power of the investee, Management has determined that the Group has de facto control over the investee since its incorporation on January 1, 2008, as the Group has significantly maintained influence on HDF in relation to the relevant activities and exposure of the same to variable returns. Accordingly, due to the ineffectiveness to recognizing the effects since the aforementioned date, the Group applied business acquisition accounting as at January 1, 2012, and recognized at fair value the amounts as if the investee had been consolidated from that date. The quantitative impact of the amendment is included in the summary of impacts section (see note 2(e)). (iii) Joint agreements As a result of the adoption of IFRS 11, the Group has modified its accounting policy related to its interests in joint agreements. Under IFRS 11, the Group classifies its investments in joint agreements as either joint operations (if the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities associated with an agreement) or joint ventures (whether the Group has rights only on net assets of an agreement). In making this assessment, the Group considers the structure of these agreements, the legal form of any separate vehicle, the contractual terms of the agreements and other facts and circumstances. Previously, the structure of the agreement was the only point to be considered for the classification. The Group has re-evaluated its participation in joint agreements and has also reclassified investments from entities jointly controlled to the joint venture; recognizing such investments retrospectively through the equity method. (iv) Disclosure of interests in other entities As a result of IFRS 12, the Group has expanded its revelations about its interests in associated parties and joint ventures (see note 13) and investments accounted for under the equity method (see note 12). (v) Fair value measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value and making disclosures about fair value measurements when these measurements are required or permitted by other IFRS. It unifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid for transferring a liability in a performed transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It replaces and expands the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements included in other IFRS, including the IFRS 7. As a result, the Group has included additional disclosures in this regard (see note 5). 56 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 13, the Group has prospectively applied the new guidelines for measuring fair value and has not provided comparative information for the new disclosures. Nevertheless, the amendment has not had a significant impact on the measurements of assets and liabilities of the Group. (vi) resentation of other comprehensive income items As a result of the amendments to the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, the Group has modified the presentation of other comprehensive income items in its income statement of other comprehensive income, in order to present separately the items that would be reclassified to income of those that would never be reclassified. The comparative information has been modified in accordance with this change in the presentation. (vii) Post-employment defined benefit plans As from January 1, 2013, based on the amendments to IAS 19: a) the same rate is used for the determination of the expected return on plan assets and the discount of the employee benefits liabilities to present value; b) a net financial cost is recognized on the net liability for pension funds (liability minus plan assets), instead of a financial cost on the liability and an expected return on separate assets, as it was determined until December 31, 2012; and c) all actuarial gains and losses for the period are recognized as part of other comprehensive income or loss, thereby eliminating the option to defer the recognition of gains and losses, known as the “corridor approach”, which was not applied by the Group. Until December 31, 2012, the expected rates of return on plan assets were determined based on market prices prevailing on the calculation date, applicable to the period over which the obligation was expected to be settled. As a result of the adoption of the amendments to IAS 19 on January 1, 2013, the Group restated its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 and its consolidated income statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. The effects were not significant. (viii) Disclosure of the recoverable amount of non-financial assets The Group has early adopted the amendments to IAS 36 (2013). As a result, the Group has expanded its related disclosures to the recoverable amounts when based on fair values less costs of disposal and value impairment is recognized (see note 11). (e) Quantitative impacts summaryThe impacts of these changes on the financial position, the comprehensive result and the cash flows of the Group are summarized below. The impacts are related to the consolidation of HDF (see note 2 (d)(ii)) and the changes related to employe defined benefit plans (see note 17). As a result of the adoption of the IFRS 10 which Grupo Herdez performed as from January 1, 2013, it started to retrospectively consolidate the financial statements of Herdez Del Fuerte, S. A. de C. V. and its subsidiaries (“HDF”) as from January 1, 2012, instead of proportionally consolidating as it was done until December 31, 2012. GRUPO HERDEZ 57 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) HDF is a company which shareholders are Grupo Herdez and Grupo Kuo, S. A. B. de C. V., each with a shareholding of 50%. In this sense, the initial agreement between shareholders remains unchanged. HDF was incorporated in Mexico on December 14, 2007, located on Calzada San Bartolo Naucalpan No. 360, Col. Argentina Poniente, Mexico, D.F., C.P. 11230. HDF’s main activities are the manufacture, purchase, distribution, and marketing of canned and bottled packed food products in Mexico, as well as of food products targeted at the Mexican food segment in the United States of America (USA). HDF produces and sells products under the following trademarks: Aires de Campo, Chi-Chi’s, Del Fuerte, Don Miguel, Doña Maria, Embasa, Herdez, La Victoria, Wholly, among others. For this purpose HDF has formed a partnership in the U.S. with Hormel Foods Corp. Arising from the adoption of IFRS 10, the Group applied the IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” as required by IFRS 10, in order to appraise HDF’s business at fair value.

(a) Consolidation basis(i) Businesses combinationsBusinesses combinations are recorded using the purchase method to the acquisition date, i.e., the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The control is based on whether the investor has 1) power over the entity invested on; 2) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement in the entity invested on, and 3) the ability to use its power over the entity invested on in order to affect the amount of returns. The Group recognizes goodwill at the acquisition date as:  The fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the recognized amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired company, plus if the business combination is carried out in stages, the fair value of existing equity interests in the acquired company, less the net amount recognized (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and the assumed identifiable liabilities. When the excess is negative, a gain on sale on favorable terms is recognized immediately in the income statement. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. These amounts are recognized in the income statement. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, incurred by the Group in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Some contingent payable considerations are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. In other cases, subsequent changes in fair value in the contingency shall be recognized in the income statement. (ii) Non controlling interestFor each business combination, the Group measures any non-controlling interest in the investee at:  Fair value.  The proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired company, which are generally at fair value. Changes involving Group interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as such. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount GRUPO HERDEZ 65 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) of the net assets of the subsidiary. No adjustments are made to goodwill nor any gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. (iii) SubsidiariesSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the control begins until termination of the same. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over such investee. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date in which control cesses.

(iv) Loss of controlWhen loss of control occurs, the Group removes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, the non-controlling interest and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any gain or loss resulting from the loss of control is recognized in the income statement. If the Group retains any interest in the former subsidiary, it shall be appraised at its fair value at the date when control is lost. (v) Investments in associated entities and jointly controlled entities (equity method)The associated entities are those entities in which the Group has a significant influence, but not control or joint control of its financial and operating policies. The joint ventures are those entities in which the Group has joint control over its activities, through which the Group is entitled to the net assets of the agreement and not entitled to its assets and obligations for liabilities, established by contractual agreement and unanimous consent to take financial decisions and strategic operations. The investments in associates entities and joint venture are recognized by the equity method and are initially recorded at cost. The investment cost includes the transaction costs. 68 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT The consolidated financial statements include the interest of the Group in the profits or losses and other comprehensive income of investments accounted by the equity method, after performing the adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence and the joint venture begins and until these are finished. When the portion of losses of the Group exceeds his interest in an investment recognized by the equity method, the carrying amount of that interest, including any long-term investment, is reduced to zero and the recognition of more losses is discontinued except if the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the company it participates in. (vi) Transactions eliminated in the consolidationThe intercompany balances and transactions and any income or derecognized expense arising from group intercompany transactions are eliminated while preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized profits arising from transactions with companies which investment is recognized by the equity method are eliminated from the investment in the proportion of the Group’s participation in the investment. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealized profits, but only to the extent there is no evidence of impairment. (vii) Discontinued operationsA discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has been set and which operations and cash flows may be clearly distinguished from the rest of the group:  It represents a line of business or geographical area, which is significant and can be considered apart from the rest.  It is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a line of business or geographical area of the operation that is meaningful and can be considered apart from the rest.  It is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resell it. The classification of a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale, if this occurs earlier. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of comprehensive income is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year. (b) Foreign currency(i) Foreign currency transactionsForeign currency transactions are converted to the respective functional currency of the Group entities at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. GRUPO HERDEZ 69 GRUPO HERDEZ, S.

However, foreign exchange differences arising from retranslation operations of the following items are recognized in other comprehensive income:  Equity instruments available for sale (except for impairment when the foreign currencies differences that had been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement).  A financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation when coverage is effective.  Qualified cash flow hedges when coverage is effective. (ii) Foreign operationsAssets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into Mexican pesos at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Mexican pesos at the exchange rate at the date of transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in foreign currency (translation reserve) on the stockholders’ equity. However, if the operation is not wholly owned by the Group, the share corresponding to the difference is assigned to the non-controlling interest. When the foreign operation is eliminated or significant influence or joint control is lost, the corresponding amount in the cumulative translation effects is transferred to income as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When there is partial elimination of a subsidiary including a foreign operation but retaining control, the relevant proportion of the accumulated amount of the non-controlling interest is reallocated. When the Group disposes only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation but retains significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the total amount is reclassified to income statement. When the settlement of a monetary receivable or payable item in a foreign operation arising from it, which settlement is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, the gains and losses of foreign currency are considered as part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognized directly in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the cumulative adjustment accounts. (c) Financial instruments(i) Non-derivative financial instrumentsInitially, the Group recognizes loans and accounts receivable on the date on which they are generated. All the other financial assets (including assets designated at fair value with changes in income) are initially recognized on the transaction date when the Group becomes a party to the instrument’s contractual provisions. 70 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT The Group eliminates a financial asset when the contractual rights to cash flows derived from the asset expire, or when it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows from the financial asset in a transaction on which all risks and benefits from ownership of the financial asset are substantially transferred. Any share in the transferred financial assets created or retained by the Group is recognized as a separate liability or asset. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends to settle the net amount or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group has the following non-derivative financial assets: loans and accounts receivable. Loans and account receivables Loans and accounts receivable are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not traded in an active market. Said assets are initially recognized at fair value, plus any transaction cost directly attributable. After their initial recognition, loans and accounts receivable are measured at their amortized cost using the effective interest method, less impairment losses. Loans and accounts receivable include client accounts receivable and other accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances and deposits with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition subject to exchange effects in fair value and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments. (ii) Non-derivative financial liabilitiesInitially, the Group recognizes the debt securities issued at the date on which they are generated. All the other financial liabilities are initially recognized on the contracting date on which the Group becomes a party to the instrument’s contractual provisions. The Group eliminates a financial liability when its contractual obligations are cancelled, or expired. The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities in the category of other financial liabilities. These financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable. Following the initial recognition, these financial liabilities are valued at their amortized cost using the effective interest method. Other financial liabilities consist of notes payable, suppliers and other accounts payable and stock market certificates. GRUPO HERDEZ 71 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) (iii) EquityCommon sharesOrdinary shares are classified in stockholders’ equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to issuance of ordinary shares and stock options are recognized as a deduction of stockholders’ equity, net of any tax effect. Repurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (treasury shares)When stock equity recognized as stockholders’ equity is repurchased, the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, net of any tax effect, are recognized as a stockholders’ equity deduction. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the reserve for own shares. When treasury shares are sold or subsequently reissued, the amount received is recognized as an increase in share premiums. Capital stock, the reserve for the purchase of shares, the legal reserve, the premium on the subscription of shares and accrued profits are stated as follows: i) movements made as from January 1, 1998 at their historical cost, and ii) movements made prior to January 1, 1998 at their restated historical values by applying factors derived from the NCPI until December 31, 1997. (iv) Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accountingThe Group has derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk of foreign currency and interest rates. Similarly, the Group uses derivatives to hedge the price of the raw materials (Commodities), which are designated in a formal hedging relationship. In the initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and the item(s) covered, including the risk management objectives and strategy when entering the hedging transactions, as well as the methods to be used in assessing the effectiveness of the hedge relationship. The Group conducts an evaluation at the outset of the hedge operation (prospectively) and subsequent on-going evaluations (retrospectively), if the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective to offset the changes in fair value of the primary positions during the period for which the hedge is designated, and if each hedge’s actual results are within a range of 80-125 percent. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value; any cost attributable to the transaction are applied to income as they are incurred. Following their initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and changes in said value are recognized as follows: Cash flow hedgesWhen a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument in the variety of cash flows attributable to a particular risk, relating to a recognized asset or liability or a potential highly projected transaction that could affect the income for the period, the 72 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in the comprehensive income account and is presented as a component of stockholders’ equity. Any ineffective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative is immediately applied to the income statement. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount accrued in the stockholders’ equity is maintained in other comprehensive income and it is reclassified to in the same period when the hedged item affects the income statement. In other cases, the amount accrued in stockholders’ equity is reclassified to the income in the same period when the hedged item affects the income. If the hedge instrument no longer complies with the hedge accounting criteria, it expires or it is sold, suspended or executed, or the designation is revoked, this hedge is prospectively discontinued. If the transaction is no longer expected to take place, the balance of other comprehensive income items is immediately applied to the income statement. Embedded derivativesEmbedded derivatives are separated from the main contract and recorded separately if:  The characteristics and risks of the main contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related.  A separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative could meet the characteristics of a derivative.  The combined instrument is not measured at fair value through with changes in income. Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedgingWhen a derivative financial instrument is not designated for a hedging qualifying relˆationship all changes in fair value are immediately recognized in income. (d) Property, machinery and equipment(i) Recognition and measurementProperty, machinery and equipment items are valued at cost less accrued depreciation and impairment losses. The Group opted to apply the optional exemption provided by IFRS 1, to use the book value as per MFRS as the assumed cost as at January 1, 2011, date of transition to IFRS, except the Chiapas plant machinery and the land pertaining to the Mexico distribution center, which assumed cost was determined at fair value on the basis of appraisals conducted at the date of transition to IFRS. The cost includes expenses directly attributable to acquisition of the asset. The cost of assets built by the entity include the following:  The cost of materials and direct labor.  Any other costs directly attributable to making the asset suitable to a working condition for its intended use. GRUPO HERDEZ 73 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos)  When the Group has an obligation to remove the asset or restore the site, an estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site where they are located.  The capitalized loan costs The costs may also include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualified cash flow hedges for acquisitions of property, machinery and equipment. Acquired software, which is part of the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of such equipment. When parts of an item of property, machinery and equipment have different useful lives, they are registered as separate items (major components) of property, machinery and equipment. Gains or losses on the sale of a property, machinery and equipment item (determined as the difference between the profit obtained from the sale against the book value of such item) are recognized in the income. (ii) Subsequent costsSubsequent expenditures are capitalized only when future economic benefits associated with the expenditure are likely to flow to the Group. Continuous repairs and maintenance are expensed in income as incurred. (iii) DepreciationItems of property, machinery and equipment are depreciated from the date on which they are installed and ready for their use or in the case of assets internally built, from the date on which the asset is completed and ready to be used. Property, machinery and equipment elements are depreciated on a straight-line basis according to the estimated useful life of each element. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods of the significant items of property, machinery and equipment are summarized as follows: YEARS Buildings 20 33 Machinery and tools 10 14 Fishing equipment 17 Furniture and office equipment 12 Stowing and transportation equipment 4 10 Electronic data processing equipment 4 The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each period and adjusted, if necessary. 74 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT (e) Intangible assets and goodwill(i) GoodwillGoodwill resulting from the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. With respect to the valuation of goodwill in the initial recognition, see note 3(a) (i). (ii) Subsequent measuresGoodwill is valued at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. With respect to the investments recognized by the equity method, the book value of goodwill is included in the book value of the investment, and any impairment loss is distributed to the book value of the investment recognized by the equity method as a whole. (iii) Intangible assets with defined lifeIntangible assets acquired by the Group consisting of non-competition agreements, developed technology and customer relationships that have defined useful lives are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. The aforementioned does not refer to intangible assets internally developed, they arise from acquisitions made. (iv) Intangible assets with undefined useful livesIntangible assets with undefined useful lives correspond to patents and trademarks, involving no legal, regulatory, contractual, economic or other factors that might limit their useful lives, and which are expected to generate future cash flows, which are not conditioned to a limited period of time, and are thus subject to annual impairment testing under IFRS. (v) Subsequent disbursementsSubsequent disbursements are capitalized solely when they increase the future economic benefits comprised in the specific asset related to such disbursements. All other disbursements, including those to internally generate trademarks and goodwill are applied to income as they are incurred. (vi) AmortizationAmortization is based on the cost of the asset less its residual value. The intangible assets are amortized to income on the straight-line basis during the estimated useful life of the intangible assets, except goodwill, as from the date when they are ready to use. The estimated useful life for current and comparative periods are in the next page. GRUPO HERDEZ 75 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) YEARS Non-competition agreements 2-3 Developed technology 8 20 Customer relationships 13 20 The amortization, useful lives and residual values methods are reviewed at the year-end close and adjusted, if necessary. (f) Leased assetsDetermining whether an agreement contains a lease At the beginning of the agreement, the Group determines whether the agreement is or contains a lease. The Group separates payments and other consideration required by the agreement, at the beginning of it or after making the proper review, between those derived from the lease and those derived from other elements, based on their relative fair values. If the Group concludes for a finance lease that it is impracticable to separate the payments on a reliable basis, it will recognize an asset and a liability at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset identified. Then, the liability will be reduced as payments are made, recognizing the imputed financial burden on such liability by using the incremental interest rate of the buyer’s debt. Leased assets Assets held by the Group under leases which substantially transfer to the Group all the risks and advantages related to ownership are classified as financial leases. Leased assets are initially measured at an amount equal to the lowest value between fair value and present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to such asset. Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognized in the statement of financial position of the Group. Lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognized in lineal income throughout the lease term. Lease incentives received are recognized as an integral part of the total lease expense during the lease term. Minimum lease payments made under financial leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of liability balance. The financial burden is allocated between the periods that constitute the lease term, so that a constant interest rate in each period on the balance of the outstanding debt is obtained. 76 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT (g) InventoriesInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in-first-out method and includes disbursements incurred for the acquisition of inventories, production or manufacturing costs and other costs incurred to transport them to their site and current conditions. In the case of manufactured inventory stock and inventory in progress, the costs include a portion of production overhead based on the regular operating capacity. The cost of inventory may also include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on the rated flow hedges of inventory purchases in foreign currency. Net realizable value is the estimated sale price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and the estimated necessary costs to close the sale. (h) Impairment(i) Non-derivative financial assetsA financial asset that is not recognized at fair value with changes in income, including a participation in an investment accounted for under the equity method, is evaluated on each date of the statement of financial position to determine objective evidence of impairment thereof. A financial asset is impaired if there is objective evidence that indicates that a loss event has occurred after initial recognition of the asset, and that said event had a negative effect on that asset’s future cash flows and that can be reliably estimated. Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes default or non-compliance of a debtor, restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will declare bankruptcy, adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers in the Group, economic conditions that relate to non-compliance or the disappearance of an active market for an instrument and observable data indicating a decrease in future cash flows of financial assets. In addition, for an investment in an equity instrument, a significant or prolonged decrease in items fair value below cost represents objective evidence of impairment. The Group finds that a reduction of 20 percent is significant and a period of nine months is extensive. (ii) Financial assets measured at amortized costThe Group considers evidence of impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost (loans and receivables and financial assets held to maturity) both at specific and at collective level. All receivables and investment securities held to maturity individually significant are assessed for specific impairment. Those who are not specifically impaired are evaluated for collective impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified. Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping assets with similar risk characteristics. In assessing collective impairment the Group uses historical trends of default probabilities, timing of recoveries, and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for Management’s judgments regarding whether the current credit and economic conditions make it likely that actual losses are greater or lesser than those suggested by historical trends. GRUPO HERDEZ 77 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) An impairment loss relating to a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. Losses are recognized in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account against loans and receivables or investment securities held to maturity. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognized. When an event occurring after the impairment is recognized it causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease is reversed in income. (iii) Non-financial assetsThe book value of the Group’s non-financial assets, excluding employee benefits, inventories and deferred tax assets, is tested for impairment on each reporting date. If signs of impairment are identified, the recovery value of the asset is estimated. The recovery value of goodwill and intangible assets with undefined useful lives are estimated yearly. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recovery value of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greatest value between its value in use and its fair value, less costs incurred for its sale. In evaluating the value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted at their present value, using a discount rate before taxes reflecting current market evaluations of the value of the money over time, taking into account the specific risks inherent to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For impairment testing purposes, assets that cannot be individually tested are integrated in smaller groups of assets that generate cash inflows from on-going use and that are, for the most part, independent from the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets. For the purposes of impairment testing of goodwill, goodwill acquired in a business acquisition is distributed to the group of cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The Group’s corporate assets do not generate cash inflows separately. If there is any indication that a corporate asset may be impaired, the recovery value of the cash-generating unit to which the corporate asset pertains is then determined. Impairment losses are recognized in income. Impairment losses recorded with respect to the cash generating units are distributed first to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill distributed to the units (group of units) and subsequently to reduce the book value of other assets in the unit (group of units) on a prorate basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if there had been any recognized impairment loss. (i) Employee benefits(i) Short-term benefitsLiabilities for employee short-term benefits are undiscounted measures and are recognized as an expense as the related service is provided. An obligation is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under the short-term cash bonus or participation plans of employees in profits if the Group has a current legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of service provided by the employee in the past and the obligation may be estimated reliably. 78 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT (ii) Defined benefit plansThe net obligations with respect to defined benefit pension plans are calculated separately for each plan, estimating the amount of the future benefit earned by employees in return for their services in the current and past periods. This benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The costs for prior services not yet recognized and the fair value of plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is calculated on the basis of zero-coupon government bonds with maturity term resembling those of the company’s obligations and that are determined in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary, using the projected unit credit method. When the result of the calculation is a benefit for the Group, the asset recognized is limited to the net total of prior-service costs not yet recognized and the present value of the economic benefits available, in the form of future reimbursements of the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. In calculating the present value of the economic benefits, the minimum funding requirements applied to any of the Group’s plan. The resulting increase in labor cost of the benefit obligation and expenditure by employees in the year are recognized in operating expenses. The financial cost associated with increased liability over time, as well as the expected return on the period of plan assets are recognized in the financial results. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or liquidation of the obligations of the plan. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized in income using the straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits are delivered. To the extent that the benefits are immediately delivered, the expense is immediately recognized in income. The Group recognizes the actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in another comprehensive income and all expenses related to the defined benefit plans in the expenses for benefits to the employees in income. When having reductions or settlements in a defined benefit plan, the Group shall recognize gains or losses arising therefrom. These gains or losses shall include any change that could result in the present value of the defined benefit obligations incurred by the entity, and any changes in the fair value of plan assets, any gains and losses and past service costs that had not been previously recognized. (iii) Termination benefitsThe benefits at the end of the employment relationship not associated with a restructuring event, such as severance payments are recognized in the income statement as incurred. (j) AllowancesAn allowance is recognized if, it is a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or assumed obligation that can be reliably estimated, and will probably require the use of economic resources to settle the obligation. The long-term allowances are determined by discounting future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market evaluation of the book value attributable to the time factor and risks specific to the liability. The effect of the discount is recognized as a financial cost. GRUPO HERDEZ 79 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) RestructuringThe Group recognizes allowances for restructuring, when restructuring plans have been properly completed and approved by the administration, and have been reported to the third parties involved and/or affected before the date of the financial statements. Contingencies and commitmentsObligations or losses related to contingencies are recognized as a liability when there is a present obligation resulting from past events and it is likely that the effects will materialize and can be measured reliably; otherwise they are qualitatively disclosed in the financial statements. The effects of long-term commitments established with third parties, as in the case of supply contracts with suppliers or customers, are recognized in the financial statements considering the substance of the agreements based on what was incurred or accrued. Relevant commitments are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. No income, profits or contingent assets are recognized. (k) RevenueSale of goodsIncome from the sale of goods during the course of ordinary operations is recognized at the fair value of the counter entry received or receivable, net of returns, commercial and volume discounts. Income is recorded when the risks and benefits inherent to ownership of the goods have been transferred to the client, recovery of the consideration is probable, incurred costs and the possible return of the goods can be reliably estimated and the company does not keep any implication in the current management of the sold goods. If discounts are likely to be granted and the amount can be reliably determined, the discount is then recognized as a reduction of income when sales are recognized. The opportunity of the transfer of risks and benefits varies according to the individual terms of the sales agreement. Generally, the transfer takes place when the product is received at the customer’s warehouse. (l) DonationsTo the extent the Group donations to social programs benefit the community in general, they are applied to income as incurred. (m) Financial income and financial costsFinancial income includes interest income on invested funds, income earnings and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through income, as well as exchange gains. Interest income is recognized at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. Income earnings are recognized in income on the date on which the Group’s right to receive payments is established, on the date when the aforementioned instruments corresponds to the date of income payment. 80 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Financial costs comprise the interest expense on loans, exchange losses, changes in the fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through income and impairment losses recognized on financial assets. Costs of loans that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that qualifies, are applied to income by the effective interest method. Gains and losses on foreign currency for financial assets and financial liabilities are presented offsetting the corresponding amounts as income or financial costs depending on whether foreign currency movements are in a position of net profit or loss. (n) Income taxThe tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. Current taxes and deferred taxes are recognized in income as far as they are not related to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income (i) Current taxCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income for the year, using approved tax rates or nearly approved at the statements of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax receivable also includes any tax liability arising from declaring dividends. (ii) Deferred taxDeferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are not recognized for:  The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that did affect neither the accounting or fiscal gain or loss;  The differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to the extent that the Group can control the timing of the reversion of the temporary differences and it is likely that they will not be reversed in the near future; and  The taxable temporary differences arising on initial recognition of goodwill. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets shall reflect the fiscal consequences that would follow from the manner in which the entity expects, at the end of the reporting period under review, to recover or settle the book amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured at the tax rates expected to apply to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on laws that have been approved or almost approved at the statements of financial position date. Assets and liabilities in deferred taxes are adjusted if there is an exigible legal right to adjusting liabilities and assets for current tax, and are related to the income taxes imposed by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or different GRUPO HERDEZ 81 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) entities tax, but intend to settle the liabilities and assets for current tax on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax loss carryforwards, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable gains will be available against which they can be used. The deferred tax assets are reviewed at the statements of financial position date and are reduced to the extent that it is not likely that the related tax benefit will be realized. The effects of income taxes for uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on its technical merits and assuming that the authorities will review each position and have full knowledge of the relevant information. These positions are valued based on an accumulated probability model. Each position is considered individually, without considering its relation to other fiscal procedure. The indicator of more likely than not a statement from management that the Group is entitled to the economic benefits of the tax position. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, the benefits of the position are recognized. The Group recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized fiscal benefits as part of the expense for income taxes in the consolidated income statements. (o) Earnings per shareThe Group presents information on basic Earnings per Share (EPS), and the diluted earning per share corresponding to its ordinary shares. Basic EPS are calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the holders of ordinary shares by a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, adjusted by own shares held (see note 25). Provided there are no dilutive effects, the basic earning per share and diluted earning is the same. (p) Segment reportingSegment results that are reported to the Group General Manager (highest authority in making operating decisions) include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets (primarily the Company’s headquarters), the cost of the central office, and tax assets and liabilities. (q) Comprehensive incomeComprehensive income is comprised of net income, the valuation of derivative financial instruments, the effects of translation and the results from actuarial losses on employee benefit obligations, which are reflected in stockholders’ equity, but which do not constitute capital contributions, reductions and/or distributions. (4) New standards and interpretations not yet adoptedA number of new standards, amendments to or interpretations of standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and have not been applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. Those which may be relevant to the Group are set out below. The Group does not plan to adopt these standards early. 82 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT (a) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2010), IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2009)During 2012 and 2013, the IASB issued IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: classification and measurement (“IFRS 9”), which reflects the first part of Phase 1 of the IASB’s project to replace IAS 39. In subsequent phases, the IASB will address the impairment methodology, hedge accounting and derecognizes its financial assets. IFRS 9 requires an entity to recognize a financial asset or financial liability, only until such time that the entity is part of the contract of the instrument. On initial recognition, the entity must value the financial asset or financial liability at fair value, plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not recognized at fair value through income, direct transaction costs associated with the acquisition of the asset or the liability issuance. IFRS 9 is effective as from January 1, 2015, with early application permitted. The Group believes that the current IFRS 9 will have a significant impact on the classification and valuation of assets and liabilities of the Group. However, the Group will assess the impact and quantify the effects insofar be issued and the following phases are known to present a complete diagnosis. (b) Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendments to IAS 32)In December 2011, the IASB amended IAS 32 to include disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position. The amended standard requires entities to disclose both amounts, on gross and compensated base on instruments and transactions for offset in the balance sheet as well as instruments and transactions subject to an offsetting agreement. The scope includes derivative instruments, agreements of purchase and sale and purchase agreements and sale and leaseback, and securities loan agreements. The amendments to IAS 32 are effective as from January 1, 2014 and retrospective application is required. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the amended IAS 32. However, the Group does not anticipate that the adoption of this amended IAS has a significant impact on its financial statements. (5) Financial instrumentsThe Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, the risk of interest rates and the risk of fluctuation in the prices of raw materials), credit risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. The overall risk management program considers the volatility of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on financial performance of the Group. The Group uses derivatives financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Financial risk management is carried out in the Planing and Finance Office, in accordance with policies approved by the Boards of Directors. The entity identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with its subsidiaries. The Boards of Directors have approved general written policies regarding the management of financial risks, including the risk of prices of certain raw materials and exchange rate risk. All derivative financial instruments contracted by the Company, are formally designated as hedging on the date of hiring under the cash flow model. GRUPO HERDEZ 83 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V.

More quantitative disclosures are included in the various sections of these consolidated financial statements. 88 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Risk management frameworkThe Board of Directors has established the Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring risk management policies of the Group. This committee usually reports its activities to the Board of Directors. The Group’s risk management policies were established in order to identify and analyze the risks to which the Group is exposed, to establish the proper limits and risk controls, and monitor risks and enforce restrictions. The risk management policies and systems are periodically reviewed to reflect the changes in market conditions and in the Group’s activities. Through its standards and administrative procedures, the Group intends to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment that will allow for all employees to understand their roles and obligations. The Group’s Audit Committee supervises the manner in which management monitors compliance with risk management policies, procedures and inspections are in line with the risk management framework, in terms of the risks the Company are exposed to. The Group’s Audit Committee receives supervision support from the internal audit area. Internal audit conducts both routine and special inspections of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. Credit riskThe credit risk is the risk of financial loss for the Group, if a costumer or counterparty of a financial instrument defaults on its contractual obligations, and arises mainly from the client accounts receivable and the investment instruments of the Group. Accounts receivable The credit risk represents the risk of financial loss for the Group, if a customer or counterparty of a financial instruments defaults on its contractual obligations, and arises mainly from the client accounts receivable. The Risk Management Committee has implemented a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually in terms of solvency before being offered the Group’s standard terms and conditions for payment and delivery. The Group’s revision includes external opinions, when available, and in some cases, bank references. For each customer, purchase limits are established, that represent the maximum open amount that does not require approval from the Risk Management Committee. These limits are revised quarterly. Customers failing to meet the Company’s credit reference requirements can only conduct operations with the Group through upfront payments. In monitoring customers’ credit risks, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, which include whether the customer is an individual or an entity, a wholesaler, retailer or final user, geographical location, industry, years in business, maturity and existence of prior financial difficulties. Accounts receivable from clients and other accounts receivable correspond mainly to the Group’s wholesale customers. Customers classified as “high risk” are included in a list of restricted customers and they are monitored by the Risk Management Committee. GRUPO HERDEZ 89 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V.

The purpose of risk management is to manage and control exposure to market risks within acceptable parameters, while at the same time, optimizing profitability. The Group buys and sells derivatives, and it also incurs in financial obligations, to manage market risks. All these transactions are valued according to the guidelines established by the Risk Management Committee. Generally, the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting to mitigate volatility in results. 92 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT It is noteworthy that Grupo Herdez also has the risk of price changes in raw materials which is why the Company operates with future derivatives. Currency riskThe Group is exposed to exchange risk on sales, purchases and loans denominated in a currency other than its functional currency, which is the Mexican peso. The foreign currency in which said transactions are mainly denominated is the U.S. dollar (US$). Through hedging, the Group protects of its estimated exposure to variations in exchange rates with respect to purchases projected with suppliers, denominated in foreign currency. The Group uses exchange rate “forwards” to hedge against the exchange risk, most with maturities of less than one year as from the reporting date. With respect to other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept at an acceptable level through the purchase and sale of foreign currencies at exchange rates of transactions in cash or “spot” to cover incidentals in the short term. During the year, the following significant exchange rates were applied: EXCHANGE RATE AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE DECEMBER 31, 2013 2012 2013 2012 U.S. dollar $ 12.7700 13.1742 13.0652 12.9880 GRUPO HERDEZ 93 GRUPO HERDEZ, S.

Capital is comprised by total stockholders’ equity, minus the accrued amounts in the equity related with hedging of cash flow. The Board of Directors also monitors the capital return and dividends distributed to the stockholders of ordinary shareholders. 96 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT The Group monitors capital using a debt-equity adjusted index, which adjusts net debt to adjusted equity. For this purpose, adjusted net debt is defined as total liabilities (including interest-bearing loans and obligations under finance leases) plus dividends proposed unearned, less cash and cash equivalents. The adjusted equity includes all components of equity other than amounts recognized in equity relating to cash flow hedges, less proposed unearned dividends. During the reporting periods, there were no changes in the approach to the Group’s policies on capital management. The Company and its subsidiaries are not subject to externally tax capital requirements. Periodically, the Group purchases its own shares in the market; the timing of said purchases depends on the market prices. The decisions to buy or sell are made by Management. The Group has no specific plan to repurchase shares. Company Management has established the following rules for management of financial and capital risks: –– The debt with cost must not exceed 100% of consolidated stockholders’ equity. –– Not to reduce capital stock to under $5,000,000. –– Debt with a cost must cash net must not exceed three times the EBITDA (1). –– Not to reduce interest hedge (EBITDA/net financing expenses) to less than 3 times. All of these rules were duly complied with at December 31, 2013 and 2012. (1) EBITDA = Operating Income plus Depreciations and Amortizations GRUPO HERDEZ 97 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V.

The key assumptions used in calculating value in use in 2013 are as follows: NATIONAL SEGMENT Gross margin 31.00% Long-term growth rate 3.90% Discount rate 9.90% The key assumptions used in calculating value in use in 2012 are as follows: NATIONAL SEGMENT Gross margin 35.00% Long-term growth rate 3.45% Discount rate 10.28% These assumptions have been used for each CGU. The gross margin has been budgeted based on past performance and on development expectations of each market. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the projections included in the industry’s reports. The discount rate corresponds to a before-tax measure that is estimated based on past experience and the weighted average cost of capital of the industry that is based on a possible range of debt leveraging of 40 percent at a market interest rate of 7 percent. 104 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Five years of cash flows were included in the model of discounted cash flow.

V. signed a sales agreement to acquire the shares of Grupo Nutrisa, S. A. B. de C. V. “Nutrisa”. Such agreement contained certain terms and conditions, including the approval by the Federal Commission of Competence and the approval by the shareholders of Grupo Herdez, which had to be complied with for the operation to be completed. In addition, Grupo Herdez was forced by the Securities Market Law to carry out the public offering for the acquisition of outstanding shares. On May 9, 2013, Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V announced a successful result of the public offering to acquire the outstanding shares of Grupo Nutrisa, S. A. B. de C. V. setting a share price of $91.00 pesos. As a result of the public offering, Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. acquired 99.82% of the capital stock of Grupo Nutrisa, S. A. B. de C.

If the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2013, the management estimates that consolidated revenue would have amounted to $13,629,137 and consolidated profits for the period would have amounted to $1,193,825. In determining these amounts the management has assumed that the provisionally determined fair value adjustments, arising from the acquisition date would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2013. Nutrisa shareholders received $91.00 pesos per share, representing a total of $2,971,308 of consideration transferred. Acquisition-related costs The Group incurred in acquisition costs of $6,000 relating to external legal fees, due diligence costs and bank commissions that guaranteed payment.

The depreciated replacement cost reflects equipment the adjustments relating to physical deterioration as well as the functional and economic obsolescence. Relief-from-royalty method and multi-periods excess earning method: The relief-fromroyalty method considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are Intangible assets expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned. The clients accounts receivable include the gross contractual amounts due of $24,383 to the acquisition date. 110 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT If the new information obtained within a period of one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date identifies adjustments to the above amounts, or any additional provisions that existed at the date of acquisition the accounting for the acquisition shall be revised. Goodwill Goodwill arising from the acquisition was recognized as follows. Transferred consideration $ 2,971,308 Non-controlling interest 6,473 Fair value of the identified net assets (1,253,318) Goodwill $ 1,724,463 Goodwill is mainly attributable to Nutrisa workforce skills and technical talent and the growth strategy of the Group to strengthen its position in the segment through the incursion into the category of frozen foods and a new sales channel through retail stores. No portion of the recognized goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Contingent consideration On August 22, 2011, HDF acquired through their joint venture called Megamex, 100% of the shares of the corporation Avomex, which purpose is the production, marketing, distribution and sale of processed avocado and “guacamole” through premium trademarks in the U.S. As part of Avomex sales agreement, Megamex pledged to the payment of contingent consideration subject to Avomex financial results, which will be due in 2014 (in terms of annual compound growth rate of net sales and adjusted EBITDA percentage on net sales). The Group’s Management concluded that the contingent consideration to be paid by Megamex, following the acquisition of Avomex is part of the consideration for the business combination. Due to the above and as a result of the valuation of the consideration, the best estimate was indeed performed; therefore, no significant losses are expected for any variation that may occur. The record of this allocation was made on the proportional part, and was part of the total consideration related to such business combination. The subsequent adjustments of valuation are recognized in the income statement of the Group. On October 8, 2013, the Group entered an agreement in which they agreed to limit contingent consideration to US$60 million, which will be paid in November 2014. Such agreement created the recognition of the corresponding liability. Also, the net effect on the Group income statement was by $9.2 million USD. GRUPO HERDEZ 111 GRUPO HERDEZ, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) (16) Operating leaseLeases as lessee At the end of the reporting period under review, the future minimum lease payments arising from non-cancellable operating leases are made as follows. 2012 2013 Reformulated Less than a year $ 21,987 15,428 Between one year and five 108,709 115,822 years $ 130,696 131,250 The Group leases a number of warehouses and factory facilities under operating leases. Leases are usually for a maximum period of 5 years with an option to renew the lease after that date. Lease payments increase every five years to reflect the market lease prices. Some leases include additional lease payments based on changes in a local price index. One of the leased properties has been subleased by the Group. The lease and sublease are due in 2019. Sublease payments are expected to be received during 2014 in a total amount of $1,500. During the year, $106,371 were recognized as an expense in the income statement in respect of the operating leases ($99,971 in 2012). An amount of $1,500 was included as “other income” in respect of sub-leases ($1,500 in 2012). Leases of plant and warehouse were signed more than ten years ago and they correspond to combined leases of land and facilities. The Group determined that the land and buildings items of the lease of the warehouse and factory are operating leases. The fee paid to the owner of the building is increased to market shares at regular intervals, and the Group does not participate in the residual value of the facilities. Therefore, it was determined that substantially all the risks and benefits belong to the lessor.

For the 2012 period a total of $23,158 was included in the cost of sales for $11,455, administrative expenses $4,288, and selling expenses $7,415. The main variables used in the actuarial calculations were the following: Discount rateThe determination of the discount rate in some companies considers the term and behavior of corporate bonds of high quality credit. For other companies a refinement in the methodology was applied where a curved based on future payment durations was concluded. The Company has decided to use the discount rate according to corporate bonds with ranking AA exclusively, that is to say, an 8.00% rate (rounded off to the nearest quarter). Long-term inflation rateBanco de México (Central Bank) established a goal for long-term inflation of 3.50%, which was considered for the valuation of the labor obligations. Salary increase rateBased on experience, salary increases have been observed to be presented on the basis of annual inflation, thus a nominal rate of 4.50% was maintained, the same as in 2012. Expected return of PAThe expected return rate on plan assets is consistent with the discount rate reported by the actuary and it was determined with the guidelines established in the most recent version of IAS 19. See main variables used: 2013 2012 Discount rate 8.00% 5.75% Salary increase rate 4.50% 4.50% Minimum wage increase rate 3.50% 3.50% Long-term inflation rate 3.50% 3.50% GRUPO HERDEZ 115 GRUPO HERDEZ, S.

(18) TaxesIncome Tax (IT) The Group has authorization, granted by Ministry of Finance on December 30, 1992, to determine its Income Tax under the tax consolidation regime, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries in Mexico, as per the provisions of the Income Tax Law. In 2013, the Group determined a consolidated fiscal profit, relating to the group of entities that are part of the tax consolidation regime of $176,313 (consolidated fiscal profit of $182,138 in 2012). Consolidated book and tax results differ mainly due to items taxed or deducted over time, differently for book and tax purposes, due to recognition of the effects of inflation for tax purposes, as well as to items only affecting either book or tax consolidated results. On December 11, 2013, a decree was published in the Official Gazette whereby several tax provisions were amended, supplemented, and repealed. This decree became effective as of January 1, 2014. Upon enactment of a new IT Law, the IETU Law and the IT Law in effect until December 31, 2013 were repealed. 116 2013 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Further changes are set out in the scheme of deduction of expenditure for employee benefits in the Income Tax Law, IT on dividends, eliminating the simplified regime, changing the income tax rate, changes in the determination of the Employee Statutory Profit Sharing (ESPS) and the elimination of tax consolidation regime. Up to December 31, 2013 the Group’s Income Tax was determined on a consolidated basis On December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized a liability (asset) for income tax related differences of “Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta” (CUFIN) for $(7,006) and $20,267, respectively. The 2014 Tax Reform provides the elimination of the tax consolidation regime, an issue that leads to the conclusion that, in one way or another, the balances of assets and liabilities related to this regime and pending completion are recognized on the financial statements. Following is a reconciliation of tax-consolidation-related income tax balances: INCOME TAX LIABILITIES 2012 2013 Reformulated Opening balance at January 1 of every year $ 225,649 205,382 Increases: IT from differences in CUFIN and CUFINRE1 (7,006) 20,267 Closing balance at December 31 $ 218,643 225,649 (1) Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta Reinvertida.
