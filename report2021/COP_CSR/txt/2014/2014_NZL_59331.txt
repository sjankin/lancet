All incidents, regardless of their impact, are included in the calculations. The most frequent injuries are those caused by cuts. In the long term, the Zumtobel Group is aiming to reduce the TRI rate below 9.5. Due to very different nature of business, Tridonic NZ is target TRI rate below 13. In comparing with other plants / locations, the TNZ is much more involved with manual handling and heavy lifting as customized products weight up to 3500kgs. There is no Recordable Injury (TRI) since April, 2011. This indicates the significant improvement in our work place. The LTI rate (Lost Time Injuries or number of working days missed due to injuries per million hours worked) is measured in order to differentiate between industrial accidents having various degrees of seriousness. Industrial accidents are taken into account if they involve more than eight hours off work. Measures such as employee training, improvements in protective clothing, upgrading of installed machinery, etc. are constantly being taken in order to improve occupational safety. The Tridonic NZ is continually making investments to improve working conditions. By preventative and corrective actions throughout the year, Tridonic NZ is targeting to reduce the number of injury rates for the upcoming year. Tridonic NZ provides a safe and healthy workplace.

Labour Principle 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6 The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Tridonic NZ’s Employee Rights Policy is guided by international and New Zealand human rights standards, ministry of Labor, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nations Global Compact. Tridonic NZ is committed to working with and encouraging our sub-contractors to uphold the principles in this Policy and to adopt similar policies within their businesses. The Policy includes the following components: • Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining The Company respects our employees’ right to join, form or not to join a labour union without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. Where employees are represented by a legally recognized union, we are committed to establishing a constructive dialogue with their freely chosen representatives. Tridonic NZ is committed to bargaining in good faith with such representatives. • Forced Labor Tridonic NZ prohibits the use of all forms of forced labour, including prison labour, indentured labour, bonded labour, military labour or slave labour. • Discrimination at work place Tridonic NZ values all employees and the contributions they make and has a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity and intolerance of discrimination. We are dedicated to maintaining workplaces that are free from discrimination or physical or verbal harassment on the basis of race, sex, colour, national or social origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, political opinion or any other status protected by applicable law. The basis for recruitment, hiring, placement, training, compensation and advancement at the work place is qualifications, performance, skills and experience. • Work Hours and Wages Tridonic NZ compensates employees competitively relative to the industry and local labour market. We operate in full compliance with applicable wage, work hours, overtime and benefits laws. We offer employees opportunities to develop their skills and capabilities and provide advancement opportunities where possible. • Workplace Security Tridonic NZ is committed to maintaining a workplace that is free from violence, harassment, intimidation and other unsafe or disruptive conditions due to internal and external threats. Security safeguards for employees are provided as needed and will be maintained with respect for employee privacy and dignity. Page 16 of 64 11 FEBRUARY 2014 TH CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY • Child Labour Tridonic NZ adheres to minimum age provisions of applicable laws and regulations. Tridonic NZ prohibits the hiring of individuals that are under 18 years of age for positions in which hazardous work is required. Tridonic NZ’s prohibition of child labour is very strict with International Labour Organization standards. The Zumtobel Group, of which Tridonic NZ is a member of, has a code of conduct which everyone in the Zumtobel Group adheres to. The Zumtobel Group’s Code of Conduct states that no type of discrimination will be tolerated. The Zumtobel Group’s code of conduct is shown in Appendix – A. Tridonic’s enterprise policy is attached as Appendix – B. It can be seen that the social responsibility and environmental protection section in the code of conduct addresses basic labour principles and employee working conditions which the whole Zumtobel Group abides by. A breakdown of the age bands of the employees in Tridonic NZ has been provided in the table below: No of No of No of No of No of Age Group Employees Employees Employees Employees Employees 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 18 -20 4 2 1 0 0 21-30 15 23 17 12 11 31-40 11 9 8 11 9 41-50 11 11 12 10 9 51-60 10 12 13 11 11 Above 60 0 2 3 4 5 TOTALÆ 51 59 54 48 45 This clearly establishes that Tridonic NZ does not discriminate against age & does not tolerate child labour. Tridonic NZ would like to ensure that Tridonic NZ only do business with companies that treat labour issues as seriously as we do. Page 17 of 64 11 FEBRUARY 2014 TH CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 3. Environment Principle 7 Businesses are asked to support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Support to environmental challenges: Tridonic NZ recognises the New Zealand government efforts to provide a clean healthy environment for both the present and future generations of New Zealanders. The National Environmental Standards enforced throughout the country helps to ensure that everyone in New Zealand has clear air to breathe, clean water to drink and clean land to live on. Tridonic NZ is committed to maintaining and protecting New Zealand’s clean green image because we believe this is an essential value adding process which we can benefit from. Initiatives to promote environmental responsibility: Global changes, dwindling resources and the effects of climate change – every individual has to assume responsibility. Tridonic takes its social responsibility to society and its employees just as seriously as it takes its responsibility for ensuring sustainable environmental protection and manufacturing energy-efficient products. Far-sighted ecological and social actions enable us to contribute towards protecting the environment and society at large. There is a concept for our contribution towards treating the environment, its resources and society responsibly: “ECOLUTION”. The development of environmentally friendly technologies: The Zumtobel Group’s vision of sustainability – “Through light, we care” – expresses its absolute commitment to corporate responsibility. In its core business the Group develops sustainable lighting solutions that set new standards in promoting human well-being – particularly in terms of energy efficiency and light quality. This means that through its products, the company’s economic interests are intrinsically linked with both social and ecological responsibility. Tridonic NZ is committed to the development of environmentally sound new products and reducing waste materials produced during manufacturing processes. The Zumtobel Group as a whole take environmental concerns very seriously. This can be seen from: • Attachment 2.1 – Our Environment Health and Safety Policy • Appendix C : Ecolution – an initiative of TRIDONIC Page 18 of 64 11 FEBRUARY 2014 TH CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (Environment Health and Safety Policy) Page 19 of 64 Page 20 of 64 11 FEBRUARY 2014 TH CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ECOLUTION is the integrated sustainability strategy which links all the divisions of our company. We assume responsibility for the environment, society and, above all, our customers. Our ecolution strategy sets new sustainability standards that go far beyond just environmental protection. TRIDONIC Group helps its customers identify the ideal solution for greater sustainability and efficiency. Energy savings of up to 80 percent can be achieved with lighting management systems and digital dimmable ballasts. Control of the luminaries is demand-led, governed by presence sensors and daylight levels. As part of TRIDONIC’s “ecolution” sustainability strategy, the “ecosim” simulation toll compares different lighting technologies based on life cycle costs, energy profiles and life cycle assessments. This way, the cumulative costs of various solutions can be mapped over several years, helping to define amortization periods and environmental impacts. Product quality is the top priority for us and is constantly monitored. As part of our Lean Six Sigma philosophy, we also operate a continuous improvement process and adopt a zerodefect approach. Our processes are constantly improved and systematically monitored, and the effectiveness of implemented process and quality improvement measures are followed-up through continuous reviews. In the event of any deviation, we instigate corrective measures and monitor their effectiveness. This ensures that resources are used in a sparing, costconscious manner throughout the entire life cycle of products, environmental pollution is prevented to the greatest possible extent and risks are minimized. This allows us to guarantee customers the very highest product quality at all times. The Tridonic Group is determined to make its contribution to climate protection not only by developing innovative products – as a manufacturing company it is also constantly mindful of the need to achieve the biggest possible reductions in emissions. The Tridonic Group’s environmentally relevant emissions include carbon dioxide (CO2), dust and noise. Measures in the Tridonic Group to cut CO2 emissions are based primarily on optimising material and energy requirements in the manufacturing process and optimising transport logistics.

Anti-Corruption Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Our businesses are against all forms of Corruption: New Zealand does not have any one single agency tasked with fighting corruption. Unlike many other countries it has not seen the need to create an Independent Commission against Corruption. Rather it has a number of agencies that focus on the different elements in the fight against corruption. Some of these agencies have their focus on the more positive task of reinforcing values to ensure that New Zealand maintains a corruption free environment; others focus on the enforcement of the laws and the rules. Transparency International (www.transparency.org) is the global civil society organisation, leading the fight against corruption. Transparency International’s mission is to create change towards a world free of corruption. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) was first launched in 1995; it has been widely credited with putting the issue of corruption on the international policy agenda. The CPI ranks almost 176 countries by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys. New Zealand is maintaining its No.1 position with least corruption nation and very clean image in public sector for consecutive 8th years in row. (Year 2006 to 2013). Attached Appendix-D of “Corruption Perceptions Index-2013” Background: Tridonic NZ defines corruption as ‘the abuse of a position of trust in order to achieve improper financial or other advantage’. We are aware that corporate corruption can take many forms such as: • bribery, price-fixing agreements, facilitation payments • money laundering • inappropriate favours, hospitality or gifts The Zumtobel Group’s Corporate Values, Code of Conduct and Corporate Policies are binding for all the Group’s employees. These lay the foundation for taking the right decisions and acting in a fair, trustworthy and unprejudiced fashion towards both colleagues and business partners. Tridonic NZ is part of a the Zumtobel Group’s Code of Conduct which contains detailed regulations on corruption which all employees must observe as well as other sensitive issues such as: • Sponsorship • political and charitable donations • and relations with the authorities Page 26 of 64 11 FEBRUARY 2014 TH CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Objective: We believe that “Corruption is the abuse of entrusted power for private gain”. It hurts everyone whose life, livelihood or happiness depends on the integrity of people in a position of authority. Tridonic NZ will not condone any form of corruption. Briefly, the giving or accepting of undue advantage and other forms of corruption, along with the damage caused by such misconduct worldwide, are a serious issue in today’s legal, economic and political environment. For this reason, in September 2004 the Zumtobel Group of which Tridonic NZ is a member, made a clear commitment to introducing anti-corruption regulations for all business dealings, transactions and processes in all Zumtobel Group companies worldwide of which Tridonic NZ is a member. As an active participant in the World Economic Forum’s “Partnering against Corruption Initiative” (PACI) the goal of the Zumtobel Group of which Tridonic NZ is a member, is to actively combat the various forms of corruption in international and national business dealings. Target: Do note, as an international company, we currently have an independent 3rd party audit carried out on a yearly basis. Fraud and corruption is an important component of this audit. Nevertheless, we will try and further improve by identifying key areas which might be susceptible to fraud and corruption in our business and rectify it. In the Zumtobel Group we will not tolerate any form of corruption; regardless of the value or nature of the advantage this involves (cash, benefits in kind, etc.). Inappropriate favours, gifts or complimentary benefits for customers and business partners also violate our Code of Conduct. In this respect we wish to point out that this also applies within the company to inappropriate gifts given by our employees to one another. Such gifts are not permitted and violate our Code of Conduct.

At Tridonic we adhere to a holistic sustainability concept. In keeping with our vision of “Through light, we care“, we take responsibility for our employees and our customers, for the environment and society – as a responsible employer, as a good neighbour and as a reliable business partner who offers high-quality products with the best possible properties. We are constantly looking to improve our sustainability credentials. We are helped in this respect by our sustainability strategy, a systematic sustainability programme with strategic objectives and concrete measures, and regular reporting on our activities and progress in all aspects of sustainability*. With close reference to our core business we are making a significant contribution to greater sustainability. Our products are helping our customers to manage their valuable energy resources efficiently, thereby helping the environment and creating financial benefits. *Sustainability report published by the Zumtobel Group: There are ordering and download options at tridonic.com/com/en/ecolution.asp Page 46 of 64 “The aim of our ecolution initiative is to show our customers that by using intelligent component solutions from Tridonic they can achieve greater convenience, improved economy and better quality of light, and all at reduced energy consumption. And to ensure that you benefit twice over – ecologically and economically.“ Alfred Felder, CEO Tridonic As part of our holistic sustainability concept, the Tridonic ecolution initiative stands for the added value in terms of sustainability and energy efficiency that we are offering our customers. Under the ecolution umbrella we have gathered together all the activities and measures that contribute to optimised and at the same time ecological lighting solutions for our customers. With this initiative we aim to make it absolutely clear to our customers exactly what Tridonic solutions can offer them in terms of sustainable added value. There are three aspects here: h Energy savings through technological innovation h Maximum quality and safety h Excellent customer service and advisory skills Page 47 of 64 f Sustainability at Tridonic | Light & sustainability | Energy savings | Quality & safety | Customer service & advisory skills 2 3 Light and sustainability Lighting and environmental protection are inextricably linked. Power for lighting makes up almost 19 % of global energy consumption and is also responsible for nearly 6 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. This corresponds to all the emissions from Germany and Japan combined. By combining modern light sources with innovative light management systems a large proportion of this can be reduced. 19% of global energy Fluorescent lamps still produce 70 % of artificial light 70% consumption is throughout the world 2 due to artificial lighting 1 99 Eco balance of a converter 3 % 6% of greenhouse gas emissions operation < 1 % production < 1 % transport < 1 % raw materials come from artificial lighting 2 < 1 % recycling 2020 would be the year in which three nuclear power plants could be shut down if Germany switched totally to LED lighting 4 75% of industry and office lighting in Europe is outdated or inefficient 2 Page 48 of 64 With appropriate ecological lighting design, efficient lighting technology and task-specific lighting control it is possible to reduce power consumption, operating costs and environmental impact considerably. h This is why at Tridonic we devote all our energy to your light. We can work together with you to achieve maximum possible savings based on a tailor-made system solution from Tridonic.

Our customers achieve significant energy savings by switching to modern innovative lighting technologies such as LEDs and OLEDs. Although impressive improvements are possible with a minimum of technical and structural changes, it is through the use of intelligent light management systems that the greatest progress can be made. Energy savings of up to 80 % can already be made in conjunction with intelligent lighting control systems, dimmable and electronic control gears and sensors. Our aim at Tridonic is to offer you intelligent technical solutions that provide light and energy consumption tailored precisely to your particular requirements. Tridonic has an entire portfolio of sustainable product solutions here is a snapshot: Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) ___ OLED modules enable 100 % of the light generated to be used with no losses caused by reflectors. ___ This significantly reduces energy costs compared with conventional light sources. ___ OLEDs are an extremely eco-friendly and sustainable lighting option, offering maximum light from minimum material outlay. ___ Simple recycling. OLEDs contain more than 90 % glass so they are not classified as special waste. The phosphor used is non-poisonous and constitutes less than 1 g/m². LED products for general illumination ___ Energy savings of up to 60 % compared with conventional technology. ___ As an emergency lighting option they provide greater safety in buildings – and are extremely energy-efficient and reliable. ___ Sustainable right to the end. Long life of 50,000 hours and more ___ LED products are ideal for efficient dimming and therefore open up even greater energy savings. ___ The Tridonic system offerings are designed for particularly high levels of sustainability. In a dynamic LED environment our LED modules and LED converters are constantly being further developed and remain backwards compatible. Light management: luxCONTROL-system products ___ Convenience and energy savings made easy. Daylight and artificial light in perfect combination. ___ Tailor-made solutions: from individual intelligent luminaires through large room installations to extensive lighting concepts in buildings. ___ Energy savings of up to 80 % are possible with dimmable LED systems comprising light management systems (presence sensors and daylight usage), LED light engines and LED converters. Page 50 of 64 Sample applications and possible system combinations vengine STARK SLE GEN3 CLASSIC ___ LED module for installation, ideal for use in spotlights and downlights ___ High module efficiency of up to 137 lm/W ___ The new “Best LED Operation“ (BLO) mode ensures that there is the optimum balance between efficiency, lifetime and cost.

Future School Programme, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) Customer requirements: Efficient light management in conjunction with significant energy savings. Light should only be switched on where and when it is needed. The Tridonic system solution: The luminaires were connected via the winDIM@net system and a DALI network with light sensors, motion sensors and timer switches. The light sensors enable natural daylight to be fully exploited, with dimming levels based on the amount of natural light available. With motion sensors and timer switches installed the lighting is only ever switched on when and where it is actually needed. More than 15,000 Tridonic products have been installed in 16 schools. Municipal Library and Culture Centre, Vallentuna near Stockholm, Sweden Customer requirements: Attractive optical lighting effects with an intelligent control system which also makes use of natural daylight. The lighting solution had to be easy to use and controllable from a central location. The Tridonic system solution: The entire lighting control functionality is handled via a DALI network. The intelligent light management system comprising more than 800 Tridonic products has led to a significant reduction in energy consumption and has made maintenance, monitoring and control much easier. The products included DALI TOUCHPANEL, DALI MSensor and TALEXXconverter. Morrisons supermarket chain, Bradford, UK Customer requirements: A reduction in energy costs and the same high quality of light. The Tridonic system solution: The old T8 fluorescent lamps and HF control gear have been replaced by state-of-the-art LED technology. With the aid of a total of more than 270,000 Tridonic products (including TALEXXmodule STARK LLE 24 and TALEXXconverter LCI 70 W 300 mA) Morrisons has been able to make energy savings of up to 70 %. This translates into annual savings of 195 tonnes of CO2 and 37,470 euros. Page 52 of 64 The results are crystal clear The example of rectangular recessed luminaires in the Office application shows that switching to LED lighting is a worthwhile move. If we compare different lighting solutions in a classic office with ros. And if a Tridonic lighting control system with daylight-dea floor space of around 63 m² and 15 luminaires, the differenpendent and presence-dependent control is added the total ce is very soon apparent. Replacing the existing T8 luminaires savings rise to an impressive 9150 euros. This changeover and magnetic ballasts with LED luminaires each equipped with would also reduce CO2 emissions from about 23 t to around four Tridonic QLE modules the savings in energy costs over 4.8 t. This corresponds to savings of almost 80 %. the entire lifetime of the system amount to around 6000 euCO2 emissions and energy costs over the lifetime of the system Switching from an existing lighting system comprising T8 luminaires and magnetic ballasts to an LED lighting solution with Tridonic QLE modules and Tridonic lighting control system can potentially offer savings of around 80 %. In concrete terms this represents a saving in energy costs of 9,150 euros. Assumptions: Room size (L x W x H): 12 x 5.3 x 3 m | No. of luminaires: 15 rectangular recessed luminaires | Electricity costs: 0.15 € per kWh with an annual increase of 5 % | Hours burned: 2700 h per year | Lifetime: 15 years | Emission rate: 0.43 kg CO2 per kWh | Lighting control: presence control (20 %) and daylight control (50 %) Page 53 of 64 f Sustainability at Tridonic | Light & sustainability | Energy savings | Quality & safety | Customer service & advisory skills 8 9 ecolution – maximum quality and safety From the initial idea to waste disposal at the customer‘s premises: Tridonic stands for quality, safety and transparency throughout the entire life cycle of a product. Quality – maximum required We are committed to meeting the highest demands in terms of quality. For us, quality means more than just perfect product solutions and faultless production, it means offering uniform process and service quality. Certification of our quality management processes to ISO 9001, environmental management to ISO 14001 and energy management to ISO 50001, continual improvements in efficiency, rejection rates and waste, constant advances in complaints management and not least the regular professional development of our employees are just some of the many ways we ensure top quality – in all that we do. Compliance – but of course Tridonic guarantees that all its products comply with all the relevant standards and regulations. This applies in particular to the regulations governing quality of light, energy efficiency and labelling. We expect the same of our business partners. We use material compliance software to monitor and document compliance with standards and regulations by our suppliers. Transparency – a pioneering initiative Tridonic offers environmental declarations to ISO 14025 and EN 15804 for all its new products – this puts us ahead of the competition. Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) systematically record all the environmental impacts of a product throughout its life cycle everything from the raw materials to waste disposal, including transport, production and usage. We can therefore easily answer any questions you may have regarding product-related environmental data. “The Environmental Product Declarations help us to reduce the environmental impact of our products through correct design and choice of materials. They also help you to make informed purchasing decisions based on environmentally relevant criteria.“ Karl-Heinz Fenkart, Tridonic Global Product Management Director Page 54 of 64 The life cycle our overall responsibility 4 1 Material selection 2 Production 3 Transport 4 Usage phase _ __ Compliance with laws ___ Improvement of process ___ Documentation of the ___ Use of energy-saving and directives (including quality through Lean Six CO2 emissions from lighting technology, REACH, RoHS, ErP) Sigma transportation in particular LEDs and _ __ Efficient use of materials ___ Quality management ISO ___ Consideration of suslighting control 9001 tainability aspects in ___ Planning and consultati_ __ Transparent documenta___ Environmental managethe selection of freight on services for sustaintion of the environmental ment system ISO 14001 forwarding companies able component solutions impacts of the products and environment pro___ Efficient transport logifor our customers‘ in Environmental grammes in all factories stics through grouping in lighting systems Product Declarations on that basis the HUB system _ __ Material compliance ___ Energy management ___ Project in Vorarlberg/AT 5 Recycling software for monitoring system ISO 50001 for switching from road _ __ Compliance with the components used ___ Use of eco-friendly to rail statutory requirements product packaging, transportation packaging and outer packaging wherever possible ___ Consideration of sustainability aspects in investment decisions Page 55 of 64 f Sustainability at Tridonic | Light & sustainability | Energy savings | Quality & safety | Customer service & advisory skills 10 11 ecolution – excellent customer service and advisory skills Highly qualified employees, sound advice, a wide range of tools and cooperation based on trust are our guarantee for satisfied customers and long-term success.

Page 60 of 64 Transparency International is the global civil society organisation leading the fight against corruption. Through more than 90 chapters worldwide and an CORRUPTION international secretariat in Berlin, we raise awareness of the damaging effects of corruption and work with partners in government, business and civil society to develop and implement effective measures to tackle it. PERCEPTIONS INDEX 2013 From children denied an education, to elections decided by money not votes, public sector corruption comes in many forms. Bribes and backroom deals don’t just steal resources from the most vulnerable – they undermine justice and economic development, and destroy public trust in leaders. But while the results of corruption are clear, the real extent of the problem is harder to pin down. Corruption is shadowy and secretive by nature. We all know corruption is a problem, but how bad is it, and what can be done? This is where the Corruption Perceptions Index comes in. Based on expert opinion, the index measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption in countries worldwide, scoring them from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). Covering 177 countries, the 2013 index paints a worrying picture. While a handful perform well, not one single country gets a perfect score. More than two-thirds score less than 50. The need for greater accountability is clear, and leaders cannot look the other way. But recognising the problem is only the first step – governments need to turn pledges into actions. All citizens deserve bribe-free services, and leaders that are answerable to the public, not to powerful friends. Working together, we can make this a reality. Test your knowledge.
