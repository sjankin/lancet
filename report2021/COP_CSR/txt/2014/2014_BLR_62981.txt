ONE CANNOT BUT MENTION THAT 2012 BECAME A START OF KEY PROJECTS OF THE MOST LARGE-SCALE PROGRAM OF REVAMPING IN THE PLANT’S HISTORY. WE STARTED THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SMALL-SECTION MILL WITH THE CAPACITY OF 700 THOUSAND TONS WITH FURTHER EXPANSION OF ITS CAPACITY TO 1 MLN TONS PER YEAR AND A NEW LIME KILN NO.3 DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE GROWING SHORTAGE OF ANNEALED LIME. OVER EUR500 MILLION WILL BE INVESTED FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROJECTS. IF TO REVIEW 2012 IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION RESULTS, WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO CALL IT A YEAR OF RECORDS. FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TO POINT OUT OPERATION OF THE ELECTRIC MELT SHOPS WHICH MADE A NUMBER OF RECORDS IN STEEL MAKING SEVERAL TIMES DURING 12 MONTHS. SO, OCTOBER CONTRIBUTED THE HIGHEST MONTHLY RESULT IN THE PLANT’S HISTORY — 236 THOUSAND 729 TONS. THE ANNUAL RESULT IS ALSO A RECORD FOR BSW. SO THE PLANT CLIMBED ONE D EAR FRIENDS! MORE STEP TOWARDS ITS STRATEGIC GOAL OF THE CURRENT FIVE-YEAR PERIOD — TO REACH THE OUTPUT OF 3 MILLION YOU ARE WELCOME TO READ 2012 REPORT OF BYETONS OF STEEL AND ITS COMPLETE PROCESSING INTO FINISHED LORUSSIAN STEEL WORKS. IT HAS BECOME A GOOD PRODUCT. TRADITION WITH US TO MAKE PUBLIC THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINING DETAILED INFORMATION ON ALL AREAS OF BSW ACTIVITY IN 2012 BYELORUSSIAN STEEL WORKS’ TEAM PROVED ONCE AS AN EVIDENCE OF THE PLANT’S OPENNESS TO THE COMMUAGAIN THAT COMMON EFFORTS DIRECTED TOWARDS ACHIEVENITY AND BUSINESS PARTNERS. MENT OF COMMON GOALS ALWAYS BRING A WORTHY RESULT. THIS COMMITMENT ALLOWED THE ENTERPRISE TO BECOME A A NUMBER OF EVENTS SIGNIFICANT FOR OUR PLANT HAVE WINNER OF SIGNIFICANT AWARDS OF THE NATIONAL AND INTERTAKEN PLACE SINCE THE PREVIOUS REPORT PUBLICATION: NATIONAL LEVEL LAST YEAR. I CAN POINT OUT TWO AWARDS 2012 DEMONSTRATED IMPORTANT INITIATIVES, IMPRESSIVE AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONES: DIPLOMA OF THE MINACHIEVEMENTS AND TESTED THE PLANT FOR STRENGTH AGAIN. ISTRY OF INDUSTRY OF THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS FOR THE AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF 2012, BSW BECAME AN OPEN ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE AREA OF QUALITY AND THE TITLE OF THE JOINT-STOCK COMPANY AND 8 MONTHS LATER, IT BECAME THE LAUREATE OF THE CIS AWARD FOR 2011. MANAGEMENT COMPANY OF “BYELORUSSIAN METALLURGICAL COMPANY” HOLDING. THIS CHANGE IN THE LIFE OF THE PLAN THE PLANT’S SUCCESS IS ENSURED BY ITS EMPLOYEES THAT OPENED NEW POSSIBILITIES, EXTENDED ITS POTENTIAL AND AT IS WHY BSW PAYS MUCH ATTENTION TO THE WORK WITH THE THE SAME TIME, ADDED RESPONSIBILITY. PERSONNEL, ITS PROVISION WITH SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS. TODAY 6 СОЦИАЛЬНЫЙ ОТЧЁТ 2012 БЕЛОРУССКИЙ МЕТАЛЛУРГИЧЕСКИЙ ЗАВОД BYELORUSSIAN STELL WORKS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD BUSINESS AVOIDING THIS ACTIVITY. BSW SHALL INVEST APPROXIMATELY $ 2 MILLION IN LABOUR IT IS CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE OPERATION OF ANY ENPROTECTION. TERPRISE. ON THE ONE HAND, THE MORE SUCCESSFULLY THE ORGANIZATION FUNCTIONS, THE MORE FINANCIAL POSSIBILITIES THIS IS THE FIFTH BSW CORPORATE SOCIAL REPORT. IT IS A KIND OF A JUBILEE PROVING BSW MATURITY IN THE AREA IT WILL HAVE TO ENSURE SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS OF ITS EMPLOYOF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. DURING THE TIME PERIOD FROM EES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MORE SOCIALLY PROTECTED THE DATE OF BSW JOINING OF THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT, THE PLANT’S TEAM IS, THE MORE MOTIVATED IT WILL BE TO ACTIVITY CARRIED OUT IN THIS DIRECTION HAS ACQUIRED A ACHIEVE HIGH PERFORMANCE. WE TAKE CARE OF OUR STAFF PURPOSEFUL CHARACTER. WE ARE AWARE OF ITS SIGNIFIAND THIS CONCERN IS NOT LIMITED BY THE MAINTENANCE CANCE AND I HOPE YOU WILL FIND EVIDENCE FOR THIS IN THE OF THE VITAL ACTIVITY OF THE EXISTING SOCIAL FACILITIES. ALONG WITH THE GENERAL SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS, THE PLANT REPORT DELIVERED. INTENTLY ATTENDS TO THE LABOUR SAFETY ISSUES. DURING LAST SEVEN YEARS THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION ACCIDENTS DECREASED PRACTICALLY BY HALF. POSITIVE DYNAMICS WAS ACHIEVED DUE TO THE GROWTH OF INVESTMENTS IN LABOUR PROTECTION. ACCORDING TO 2012 RESULTS, THEIR AMOUNT REACHED ITS HISTORICAL MAXIMUM — MORE THAN $ 2,2 MILBEST REGARDS, LION. IT ALLOWED US TO IMPLEMENT 100 MEASURES RESULTING IN IMPROVEMENT OF MORE THAN 700 WORKPLACES. IN A.N. SAVIANOK, 2013 WE SHALL CONTINUE OUR WORK IN THIS DIRECTION.

BYELORUSSIAN STEEL WORKS INTEGRATED INTO THE GLOBAL ACCORDING TO WSA DATA, IN 2012 STEEL OUTPUT GROWTH STEEL PRODUCTION MARKET FACED THE SAME DIFFICULTIES WAS SHOWN ONLY BY ASIA, NORTH AMERICA, MIDDLE EAST AS THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF STEEL MAKERS FROM AND AFRICA, WHILE SUCH REGIONS AS EUROPEAN COMMUOTHER COUNTRIES. NITY, CIS, SOUTH AMERICA AND OCEANIA DEMONSTRATED DECREASE. WE HAD TO WORK IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF STEEL PRICE DECREASE WHICH CAUSED THE EXPORT INDICATOR IN MONEY IN EUROPE, FOR EXAMPLE, STEEL PRODUCTION DROPPED BY TERMS APPEARED TO BE LOWER THAN PLANNED.
