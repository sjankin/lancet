United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2013 Heimo Scheuch, Chief Executive Officer of Wienerberger AG We strive to supply outstanding sustainable building material solutions for a better quality of life. Wienerberger is committed to sustainability. This is why we joined the UN Global Compact, as the “ten principles” of the UN Global Compact in the area of human rights, labour rights, environmental protection and the fight against bribery and corruption are core values of Wienerberger’s corporate culture. Respect for human rights is the foundation of our society. Wienerberger guarantees protection for basic human rights within its sphere of influence. At Wienerberger we ensure that all employees have the same rights and opportunities independent of age, gender, culture, religion, origin and political views. Wienerberger does not tolerate any form of discrimination whatsoever. Wienerberger’s Social Charter, signed in 2001, firmly commits the Group to compliance with the applicable conventions and recommendations of the International Labor Organization (ILO). With this charter, Wienerberger demonstrates its global commitment, among others, to human rights, to prohibition of child labor, to sufficient remuneration, against excessive working hours and to respect for the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining negotiations. In the Wienerberger Social Charter, Wienerberger committed itself to meet or exceed the requirements of tariff agreements and/or national law. Furthermore the Social Charter requires Wienerberger to comply with all agreements and recommendations of the International Labour Organization that are relevant to its business activities (e.g., freedom of employees to join the union of their choice and to participate in free collective negotiations). As Wienerberger puts particular focus on workers’ safety, the Charter includes the provision of appropriate, i.e. healthy and safe working conditions. In our Sustainability Program of 2012 we set the goal to reduce the frequency of accidents to less than 10 per million hours worked by 2015. We are proud that Wienerberger has reached this goal already in 2013. With a view toward today’s major challenges – which range from climate change and the necessary increase of more efficient use of resources and energy to the related necessary actions – we are following a sustainable strategy for our company and our customers. Our Environmental Action Plan is focused on the efficient use of resources in production, an increase in the share of renewable energy sources and the recycling of our products. For our customers we provide sustainable, durable and innovative building material and infrastructure solutions that improve the quality of life and make energy-efficient building and living as well as sustainable infrastructure possible. Wienerberger rejects any form of corruption. A commitment to compliance with all applicable national and international legal regulations is also an important part of corporate social responsibility at Wienerberger. Legal compliance at all organizational levels creates the basis for good management. Wienerberger ensures that both international and national laws and standards are followed in all its business operations and places a special focus on the prevention of illegal and anti-competitive behavior. Our strong belief in our corporate social responsibility is the driver for our CSR projects. In 2012 Wienerberger launched a collaboration with Habitat for Humanity to build houses for disadvantaged families in Romania and Bulgaria. Additionally in 2013 Wienerberger instigated a second CSR program, the Wienerberger Sustainable Building Academy, which focusses on education for future architects and civil engineers. In 2013 twelve students from four universities in Austria, Germany and Poland benefited from this program. All levels of management and our employees have taken shared responsibility for the implementation of measures in order to continuously improve towards the goals set in the UN Global Compact. Further information on specific measures as well as facts and figures regarding sustainability can be found on our homepage and in the Sustainability Update 2013, which is based on the standards defined by the Global Reporting Initiative (published in June 2014). Heimo Scheuch, Chief Executive Officer of Wienerberger AG United Nations Global Compact Wienerberger joined the UN Global Compact in 2003. This initiative was introduced by the United Nations in 1999 to promote good corporate citizenship and now encompasses ten guiding principles from the areas of human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and measures to combat corruption. Companies that join the program agree to voluntarily comply with the principles that are published on the UN Global Compact website. The following overview describes some of the actions taken by Wienerberger during 2013 to implement the ten Global Compact (“GC”) Principles. Reference is made to the Wienerberger Sustainability Report 2012 and Sustainability Update 2013 which contains a detailed description of Wienerberger’s latest facts and figures to implement the GC principles. The table below also refers to the corresponding Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators which provide a framework for measuring progress on the GC principles. GC Principles Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; Principle 2: and make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Actions: Wienerberger guarantees protection for basic human rights within its sphere of influence. Wienerberger’s Social Charter firmly commits the Group to compliance with the applicable conventions and recommendations of ILO. These include the provision of appropriate, i.e. healthy and safe working conditions. Safety is crucial for Wienerberger. Therefore Wienerberger set in 2012 the goal to reduce the frequency of accidents to less than 10 per million hours worked by 2015. This goal has been reached prematurely in 2013. Labour Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; Principle 6: and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Actions: With the signing of a Social Charter, Wienerberger has also committed to supporting the freedom of association and collective negotiations at all locations, preventing child and forced labour and preserving equal opportunity regardless of age, gender, culture or origin. In 2012 Wienerberger set the goal to raise the share of women in senior management to 20% by 2020. In the administrative area, the goal to increase the share of women to over 45% by 2020 has already been reached. Our plans also call for an increase in the share of women in sales to 30% by 2020, whereby the share of women in this area declined slightly during 2013. Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; Principle 9: and encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Actions: Production in harmony with the environment is a matter of great importance to Wienerberger. Our goal is to minimize the environmental impact of our production processes. The responsible interaction with clay extraction sites, the best possible conservation of resources and an increase in the share of recycling materials are the central principles of our sustainable production. By 2020 Wienerberger wants to reduce the specific energy consumption in ceramic production 20% below the 2010 level. The improvement of production processes, above all to reduce energy consumption, represents the main focus of research for our ceramic products. The result of these efforts is among others a continuous reduction of specific energy consumption by 9% compared to 2010. On product level Wienerberger supports greater environmental responsibility with high thermal insulating blocks in order to realize low energy buildings. Anti-corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery. Actions: Wienerberger is committed to free and fair competition, and rejects any form of corruption. In 2010 Wienerberger issued a group-wide guideline on business gifts and top managers and managing directors of the country organizations were instructed on the correct procedures for dealing with business gifts. Internal audit reviews the correct application as part of its regular review procedure. Measurement of progress for the year 2013 Detailed information about Wienerberger’s sustainability activity is described in the Wienerberger Sustainability report. Wienerberger Sustainability KPIs are shown in the following tables.

CO2 The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme entered the third trading period at the beginning of 2013. Changes were made to the calculation methods and to the criteria for selecting the facilities covered by the emissions trading system. Plants that were not included in the second emission trading period were also added. The data from earlier years – also for Wienerberger – are not comparable with 2013 because of these changes, and the EU Commission has explicitly noted this fact. The Wienerberger Sustainability Steering Committee therefore decided not to continue the internal Wienerberger index of specific CO 2 emissions based on the reference year 2010, but to use the 2013 emission data as the calculation base for future development. Therefore, the 2013 index was reset to 100%. 1) CO2 emissions in tons 2013 From primary energy sources 955,453 From the production process 682,328 2) Total – within the ETS 1,637,780 Plants outside the ETS 3) 223,572 From biogenic added materials 4) 257,986 1) The emissions in 2013 will be used as the new calculation base for future development; the data from earlier years – also for Wienerberger – are not comparable because of the changeover to the third EU emission trading period in 2013. 2) Source: European Union Transaction Log (EUTL) 3) Calculated in accordance with national rules (Switzerland) or based on EU standard emission factors. Only the CO 2 emissions from the firing of primary energy sources are included for the plants in the USA. 4) Volumes from Wienerberger CO2 monitoring in accordance with national rules Safety Accident frequency by operating segment 1) 2011 2012 2013 CBME Western Europe 22 17 14 CBME Eastern Europe 11 8 8 CBME 19 14 13 Pipes & Pavers Western Europe 29 17 8 Pipes & Pavers Eastern Europe 13 7 8 Pipes & Pavers Europe 17 10 8 North America 4 3 4 Holding & Others 10 4 13 Wienerberger Group 17 12 10 1) Accident frequency: number of work accidents / number of hours worked x 1,000,000; including temporary employees and persons with limited employment contracts Status GRI Indicator Nr.
