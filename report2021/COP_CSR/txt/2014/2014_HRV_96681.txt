Here you shall be able to find information on the environmental, social and economic effects of the business operations of INA Group companies in the past year. Despite many challenges and a long-term economic crisis, with its 13,460 employees, INA has successfully remained one of the biggest employers in Croatia in 2013, realizing a profit of 171.74 MIL USD (HRK 953 MIL) excluding the one-off items. We are aware of our influence on the environment and the society. Sustainable development, care for the environment, the economy and the community in which we operate are an integral part of our daily business. From these positions, we wish to contribute to the increase of common value, as well as to avoid possible negative effects. We launched various investment projects in 2013, the Međimurje project, closing the „Blow down system” in order to additionally reduce the hydrogen sulphide emissions, as well as the coke chamber replacement project in Refinery Sisak. We are focused on our domestic projects, like the continuation the project of implementing tertiary methods of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), research and preparation of new exploratory wells, and we are especially proud of the continuous work regarding the system improvements for the purposes of environmental protection. In order to increase energy efficiency, we have reduced energy consumption, and therefore consequently achieved reduction of carbon dioxide emissions 4 of the Management Board into the environment. Since 2010, we have been continuously working on the retail network modernization, through significant Letter from the President investments which amount to almost HRK 450 MIL (81,1 MIL USD), and in 2013, we launched the project “Energy for the Future“, as part of which the first energetically sustainable petrol station shall be built in Zagreb (Stupnik-East Petrol Station). of the Management Board At the end of 2013, encouraged by the idea of creating a “green” society, which also cares for sustainable development, we organized the first “INA – Green Forum”. The subject of the conference, which included the INA experts, representatives of the local and the academic community, as well as professional associations, was sustainable development and the safety and environmental aspects of the „Enhanced Oil Recovery project (EOR)“. As early as in 2007, INA signed the UN Global Compact, the largest global initiative aimed at sustainable business, by which we committed to invest efforts in the promotion of human and workers’ rights, environmental protection and fight against corruption. In accordance with this commitment, each year we try to increase the level of responsibility in our daily business, thus providing an example and a positive influence to our partners and suppliers. The success of our realized projects lies with the INA Group employees. We are continuously working on the health protection and safety of our employees. With our “Life Saving Rules“ campaign, we have educated our employees, contractors and subcontractors, on ten basic safety rules defined on the basis of work-related injury statistics. One of the basic postulates of our corporate social responsibility is to assist the community in which we operate. In addition to responsibility, we are motivated by the willingness to contribute to the society which participates in our success with its resources. In the last year, we provided support to an array of quality projects in the segments of culture, sports, environmental protection and science. We organized a number of humanitarian activities by which we proved that we are a socially responsible and reliable company. We are proud of our employees, who have completely accepted the corporate culture, and are prepared to invest a lot of their energy, free time, efforts, knowledge and skills in order to assist with the development of the local communities in which we operate. Their engagement is particularly noticeable in the activities of the Ina Volunteers Club, which was founded in 2011 and has so far organized many successful volunteering activities. In 2014, INA, the socially responsible company which is celebrating its fiftieth birthday this year, shall continue to contribute to the economic development of the Republic of Croatia and a better life for all of us through its activities. Zoltán Sándor Áldott President of the Management Board SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013 5 INTRODUCTION As the leading energy company and one of the largest companies in Croatia, INA is committed to sustainable development and transparent business. For INA Group, sustainable development represents a permanent commitment to a balanced integration of long-term economic, environmental and social factors into everyday business operations, in order to maximize a long-term value for all stakeholders and to safeguard the “license to operate”.

INA achieves better results every year and has achieved the maximum value in a large number of areas and is one of the best rated large companies in the Croatian CSR Index. 6 IVANA Platforma A Platform Ivana-K SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013 7 KEY IMPACTS, RISKS AND OPPO As a producer, processor and supplier of petroleum products HARMONIZATION and gas, INA is an influential participant in the energy market in Croatia and the region. In the total sales of the petroleum OF BUSINESS WITH products in Croatia, INA has a leading position. In 2013 INA Group EU ENVIRONMENTAL had generated sales in the amount of HRK 27.444 MIL (4.810 MIL USD). As the sole producer and a leading distributor of fuel REGULATIONS in Croatia, INA is the key holder of the program for placement of the fuel with a bio component for the transport purposes Harmonization of INA d.d., business with the provisions of of the Republic of Croatia, thereby significantly contributing in the Environmental Protection Act and the Regulation on meeting the obligations and objectives from the fields of using the Procedure for Establishing Integrated Environmental and promoting the renewable energy sources to which Croatia, Requirements as a future EU member, had commit itself. INA achieved it’s By the Environmental Protection Act (OG 080/2013) and obligations according to the National Action Plan for biofuels and the Regulation on the Procedure for Establishing Integrated placed biofuel on the market, toward the goal for the 2013. Environmental Requirements (OG 114/2008), the provisions of Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control) are transferred into the Croatian In the broader economic context, INA Group with its financial legislation. The Directive requires obtaining an environmental results contributes significantly to the Croatian economy and by permit to perform certain activities and requires the application employing 13,460 workers, it secures a subsistence for a large of best available techniques (BAT), which enable achieving a numbers of citizens. high level of environmental protection as a whole (protection INA’s business activities are in accordance with Croatian regulations of air, water, soil, noise, waste management, energy efficiency). and EU directives on the protection of market competition.

Regarding compliance with the technical environmental Harmonization of INA, d.d. operations with legislation in the standards for Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions area of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the storage and distribution of petrol, the entire European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, EU ETS is one of the INA retail network as well as tank truck loading station in Sisak fundamental mechanisms of the European Union in fighting the Refinery are in compliance with legal regulations (VOC I). climate changes with the aim of meeting the commitments made By December 31st 2018, every petrol station with a flow rate under the Kyoto Protocol. Within the Scheme, one part of the higher than 3,000 m3 shall be equipped with a second phase emission allowances (one allowance = 1 ton of CO2 equivalent) system for vapour recovery (VOC II). At such petrol stations, INA is allocated to the plant for free and they are used to „cover” has either already installed such a system or the petrol stations the emissions from the previous year. If the plant has a shortage are planned to go through a major reconstruction. of allowances in respect to verified emissions, the rest can be bought on the market through auctioning. Harmonisation of INA, d.d. operations with the provisions of Since January 1st 2013, Rijeka Refinery, Sisak Refinery, Fractionation REACH legislation plants Ivanić Grad and Gas Processing Facilities Molve have In accordance with the Croatian Law on the Implementation of been part of the ETS. In February 2013, requests to open four the Regulation No. 1907/2006 (EC) of the European Parliament accounts (one for each plant) in the Union Registry, through and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization which the emission allowances transactions are performed, had and Restriction of Chemicals, INA, d.d. has registered substances been submitted to the Croatian Environment Agency. The Annual in accordance with the REACH Regulation and notification Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reports for the plants were delivered pursuant to the Regulation on classification, labelling and in March to the Croatian Environment Agency in accordance with packaging of substances and mixtures EC no. 1272/2008, or the regulations. The European Commission published a new form abbreviated CLP Regulation, before the planned deadline. for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Monitoring Plans and INA plants The pre-registration period ended on December 31st 2013. submitted their Plans to the Ministry of Environmental and The registration deadline for all substances produced in the Nature Protection in August 2013. amounts larger than 100 t/year, which have CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic for reproduction) properties or are highly Harmonization of INA, d.d. business with provisions of toxic for organisms living in water (H 410) is June 30th 2014. legislation in the air protection domain The registration deadline for all substances produced in smaller From 1st January 2016, more stringent emission limit values (ELV) amounts (1-100 t/year) is May 31st 2018. shall come into force for the existing plants, as stipulated by the During 2013, INA-REACH team has collected data for a total Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) 2010/75/EU. The provisions of 14 registration dossiers for 9 substances and 5 on site of this Directive have been transposed into Croatian legislation (non-transported) isolated intermediates, which have been through the Regulation on limit values for pollutant emissions submitted to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). Besides from stationary sources into the air (OG No. 117/12). INA has registration, notification for 8 substances exempted from largely met the requirements of harmonization of the emissions registration obligations was completed in accordance with the from large combustion plants with the currently prescribed ELV CLP Regulation. by bringing natural gas as an energy source to those fireboxes. For 18 substances (14 substances and 4 intermediates) that In January 2013, refineries Sisak and Rijeka submitted an INA exported to the territory of the European Union before the Application for inclusion of their existing large combustion plants accession of the Republic of Croatia to the EU, all rights were into the Transitional National Plan (TNP). Large Combustion transferred from MOL Plc. to INA, since INA, d.d. was not a SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013 9 member of the European Union. Companies that produced and exported substances to the EU territory, and were not members of the EU in 2010, were obliged to appoint a Single Representative to register substances on their behalf. The single representative appointed for INA, d.d., was MOL Plc. Registration dossiers for these substances registered in 2010 were submitted again, due to the update with the latest data. After a successful registration according to REACH Regulation and notification pursuant to the CLP Regulation, the goal that INA can manufacture, store, use and place products on the market in the European Union territory has been accomplished. Environmental provisions Environmental obligations are the obligations of a company to recover pollution caused by the company’s operations. They can be divided into two categories: environmental provisions and potential (contingent) liabilities. The provision budget for the environmental protection refers to the preliminary exploratory works, groundwater treatment, removal of waste generated from past activities at the site and the restoration works which are in progress. On 31st December 2013, environmental provisions within the INA, d.d. business records amounted to 54.78 MIL USD (HRK 304 MIL), whereas the provisions at the Group level amounted to 57.30 MIL USD (HRK 318 MIL). Potential (contingent) liabilities at the INA Group and INA, d.d. levels were estimated at 117.32 MIL USD (HRK 651 MIL) and 78,93 MIL USD (HRK 438 MIL), respectively. The estimates were not recorded because the timing of the event was uncertain and there is no evidence of pollution. A portion of the contingencies may be recognized as provisions by moving the time frame or deciding to change business strategy. Sisak Refinery 10 REALIZATION OF SD&HSE GOALS of ina group FOR 2013 Objective Objective Result realization level (0-4) CONTROLPromoting the HSE culture and more efficient management framework annual Review INA Green Forum was held in in Ivanić Grad, where one of the most important projects of INA, the EOR project, is being implemented.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013 41 letter by the Director of the SD and HSE Sector In INA, we strive to implement the principles of sustainability in all processes, taking into account the health and safety of people, environmental protection and the benefit of the communities in which we operate. Therefore, in all business processes we try to recognise and implement the activities which contribute to sustainable development. Since we believe that accidents, work injuries and work-related illnesses may be prevented, we have initiated the activities for the improvement of the culture of workplace health and safety protection. This implies a proactive approach of the management in ensuring safe work practices, the identification and removal of potential hazards as well as the analysis of the causes of all incidents in order to prevent their reoccurrence. Therefore, through the campaign 10 basic safety rules, all INA Group employees have been familiarised with the obligation of following the stated rules, which may prevent an injury, but also save a life. The same rules are applied to contractors, but also to all other persons who are present at our locations. As a socially responsible company, we have recognised the importance of raising the awareness of our employees on the everyday hazards to which we are exposed, not only in the workplace, but also in traffic in our own vehicles, and through safe driving trainings we enable timely identification and assessment, and thus appropriate actions in potentially hazardous situations. In the field of environmental protection, we focused on the coordination of the transposed EU Directives with the legislation of the Republic of Croatia, obtaining Resolution on Integrated pollution Prevention and Control for our four installations, establishing the CO2 emission and emission allowances management system, the registration of substances in accordance with the REACH Regulation, the notification and labelling of substances in accordance with the CLP Regulation and the harmonisation with internal standards and best industrial practice, and we also expect the implementation of high environmental protection standards from our contractors. Being aware of the impact of the production and the handling of waste on the environment and the society, in INA Group we strive to improve and complete the internal waste management system, which also includes the processing within the INA Group itself. That system shall have numerous advantages since it shall result in financial savings and the reduction in pollution, but also in securing employment of STSI, d.o.o. employees, which a member of the INA Group. Since our strategy is focused on the continuous improvement of performance, each year we set challenging strategic goals and programmes, and key performance indicators in order to raise awareness of the health, safety and environmental protection system, as well as process safety and fire protection. Angelika Brnada Director of the SD and HSE Sector PF Corporate Centre 42 climate change Greenhouse Gas Emissions Energy Efficiency Lonjsko polje SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013 43 In INA,d.d. we are aware of climate change impact on a global condensation part by 209.55 t in 2013, which means financial scale. In our business we undertake and plan a whole range of savings of 13,235,717 USD (73,444,994 HRK). Activity will be projects and activities related to the reduction of greenhouse monitored continuously. gas emissions, increase energy efficiency, production of bio-fuel Two important initiatives for energy savings in Sisak Refinery component (from renewable sources). CO2 injection project into have been realized. The first one is Installation of flame baffles deep wells will contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions into in the Energy plant 2, aimed at using excess refinery gas, so it the air and by reconstructing the petrol stations we will reduce, wouldn’t be burned on the flare. This initiative incorporates fuel or completely eliminate, emissions of non-methane volatile savings and emissions decrease potential. The second initiative is organic compounds. decreasing the losses in the steam network, aimed at decreasing To reduce our contribution to climate change, we monitor the the steam consumption (and thus production) which enables a direct greenhouse gas emissions from our installations, and CO2 lesser use of fuels and water and can contribute to emissions emissions generated from road and air traffic related to transport decrease. of the employees. In E&P BD, there are several ongoing a few multiannual One of the INA Group goals is to establish a system of optimization CAPEX projects, aimed at energy efficiency measurements/calculations and reduce VOC emissions using the improvement and GHG emission decreasing. One of them is LDAR (Leakage detection and repair) methodology. system optimization of the Compressor Station Kalinovac We also carefully monitor direct and indirect energy consumption (maintenance and installing the electro engines instead of gas in order to track the effectiveness of the taken measures / engines have been contracted). Since the project activities in actions. 2013 considered only project documentation, procuration and INA Group does not use the materials which contain ozonecontracting activities, financial savings resulting from the project depleting substances, even in fire extinguishers, refrigerants or cannot be visible yet. Another project is the Optimization of air conditioning units. the Fractionation Facilities Ivanić Grad. The primary goal of optimization is keeping the production in progress with new PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE electrical compressor installation for gas cooling. This increases GAS EMISSIONS AND INCREASE ENERGY EFFICIENCY the efficiency of the turboelectric aggregates as well as the total yield of the gas plant. Optimization of the Fractionation Facilities EOR (Enhanced oil recovery) projects Ivanić and Žutica have Ivanić Grad resulted in decrease of GHG emission, since the gas reached the final construction phase. The primary goal of the has been redirected to the Molve for its processing, and the projects is to increase oil recovery in oil fields Ivanić and Žutica, compressor at the Fractionation Facilities Ivanić Grad which had and the secondary goal is a significant reduction of CO2 emissions. been used for gas distribution purposes is out of function. Total By a prolonged lifetime of the fields, the projects influence the investment value amounts to 3 MIL USD (17 MIL HRK). Up to now development of this region and the local community. 1-1.5 MIL USD (5-6 MIL HRK) have been spent. The comprehensive action plan “Energy Road Map” for Rijeka It is estimated that these projects result in the annual CO2 Refinery consists of 66 items, including the approved CAPEX, emission savings amounting to 61.11 tons. OPEX project. Realization of “Road map” activities is monitored In the Retail BD, electric sensors were installed in toilets of through 5 key activities: Condensation Recovery from GP5, new and reconstructed petrol stations (PS), eco-conscious Controlling condensation mode in turbo generators, combining engineering standard is being implemented for Capital the production and supply of electricity from the external Demolition and Reconstruction (CDR) and PS planned for partial network, controlling the delivery of electric energy to the reconstruction. The Energy for Future Project is in preparation external network and control of the cooling system. In 2012, (see: Environment). when this Action plan started, savings were 10,796,859 USD In 2013, INA Group initiated the procedure of old car fleet (59,911,771 HRK), and in 2013 savings amounted to 18,072,561 replacement, which will increase the safety of the INA Group USD (100,284,642 HRK). employees as well as of other traffic participants. Subsequent One of the activities with the on-going strong performance is to the replacement of the existing fleet, harmful gas emissions controlling condensation mode in turbo generators. The result will be reduced due to the technology in new vehicles. Estimates of this initiative is decreasing of steam loss through turbines show that fuel consumption shall decrease by 10%. 44 Greenhouse gas emissions Through the venting process, INA, d.d. released 409,393 tons of CO2 in 2013. In INA E&P BD, due to the changes in technological process and redirection of the gas (from the Fractionation Facilities Ivanić Grad to the Gas Processing Facilities Molve), there was a need for more frequent cleaning of the technological pipelines (pigging), which resulted with increased loss in hydrocarbons production from the Central and Western Croatia Production Region and the Molve field, which has resulted in significant increase in CO2 emissions from flaring. Emissions from INA Group for transport of employees by airplane amounted to 1,160 tons of CO2, and by corporate vehicles to 8,776 tons CO2.

With the control of the representation of performance indicators, the degree of clarity, detail and balance within the framework of the Report, the Commission has established that INA Group prepared the Sustainability Report for 2013 in accordance with the G3.1 GRI Guidelines with the use of additional indicators for the oil and gas production sector. The complexity level of this Report represents one of the best examples of reporting in the Republic of Croatia. The Report follows a well-established, 18-year long reporting practice on the economic, environmental and social impacts. The stagnation of economic growth which has been present in the Republic of Croatia for a long period of time has to an extent reflected on the INA Group business, but has not disturbed the reporting quality or reduced the interest in the realisation of sustainable development goals. As the leading energy company in Croatia which employs almost 13.5 thousand employees, it has a significant influence and responsibility not only to uphold the laws and standards which apply to it, but also the obligation to promote and apply all the principles of the Code of Ethics and ensure the quality and appropriate representation of social and environmental impacts. The word from the President of the Management Board in accordance with the provisions of the Reporting Guidelines introduces us to basic economic and financial business indicators in the previous year as well as the most important investment projects in the field of environmental protection which are numerous in INA Group. Employee training programmes and investment in the community are also emphasized. The quality of the Report may additionally be improved if the word from the President of the Management Board would underline the most important challenges faced by INA in the previous period as well as the expected challenges for the following period. That would provide us with concise information on the basic business environment of the company. It would also be useful to obtain information on the methodology used for the report preparation and the reporting level at the very beginning. In that manner, all the assumptions for a critical reading of the report would be provided in the introductory part. With its selection of indicators and short descriptions, the Report is interesting not only to the target group, but also to the general public since it deals with significant topics for the society as a whole, such as environmental protection, climate changes, energy efficiency and ethical business. It seems that the establishment of the Croatian Business Council for Sustainable Development has contributed to better coordination within the Group, but also to the susceptibility to the opinions of external assessors which form an integral part of this Report. At the very beginning, INA provides an overview of the accomplishments of sustainable development goals set for the reporting period, where it gives clear evaluation of the accomplishments along with an explanation. The goals for the following reporting period from the field of material aspects are set in the same manner. The Report especially indicates a larger scope of data on the field of climate changes and the emissions of greenhouse gases in accordance with the greater level of company responsibility for their emission and emission limitations which have been implemented by the trading system. INA informs us that due to the nature of the business, the allocated emissions are insufficient for the company needs and it purchases the difference on the market; however, it does not have information on the deficit amount. Nevertheless, further on in the report we are introduced to a number of activities with the goal of reducing the emissions in order to achieve a balance in the business with 94 regard to the allocated emission quotas. Next is a number of ecological indicators of the most important impacts of the company on the environment with regard to the emissions, water discharge and other indicators. It is interesting to note that most of these indicators demonstrate a decline in comparison to the previous years, which is surely commendable. It is difficult to assume the extent to which this reduction of the influence is a consequence of the improvement based on the investments in environmental protection or the consequence of the recorded decline in production. The thoroughness of the approach to environmental protection of INA Group and the reduction of the impact to the environment are evident in different activities related to the petrol stations. It is important to emphasize the project of greening the petrol stations, while the initiative of making petrol stations more accessible to cyclists and expanding the offer to the users of bicycle transportation is also notable. With this initiative, INA sets new trends and broadens the offer by expanding it to the users who are not exclusively the consumers of key INA Group products. This manner of thinking indicates the company vision and long-term strategy consideration. We would also like to emphasize the colleague rewarding programme which is original and motivating, and encourages corporate culture and quality of the work environment which the Commission considers mostly neglected in Croatian companies. The number referring to training the employees on different issues is significant, but the structure of trained employees or workers is not shown. The INA Group Report is exceptionally informative and interesting. The transparency in presenting the information provides us with the opportunity to obtain insight in the positive, but also the lacking aspects of the company business, which is commendable and displays seriousness and intent with regard to the sustainability of the business. In the following report, the connection between the strategic goals and interests of the Group and the general public should be substantiated. Furthermore, INA could be presented in numbers in a clearer manner by including the year periods which would be equal in all tables, in turn achieving a better overview and consistency, for example a five-year period. Considering the need for an immediate transition to G4 guidelines for reporting, we would like to suggest that INA in the following period documents in more detail and displays the communication with the stakeholders, since the G4 guidelines emphasize it as well as the assessment of the suppliers from the aspect of non-financial performance. Commission of the Croatian Business Council for Sustainable Development SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013 95 independenT review II An increasing number of companies, in the Republic of Croatia as well as in the world, wants to build their business on the foundations of sustainable growth and development since there is an unbreakable bond between financial health and corporate social responsibility. The integration of the model of the triple bottom line approach into the daily business of companies enables continuous creation of value for shareholders, access to key growth and development resources, optimises the business decision-making process and strengthens competitiveness in turbulent conditions of the modern market. This is especially the case with larger companies which are aware of their significant impact on the economy and the example they set for others, and by implementing their strategy they want to provide a strong impulse to the sustainable use of modern society’s scarce resources. The companies which do business in the energy sector have an especially significant role here since it is evident that the growing need for energy shall have a powerful influence on resource sustainability, and precisely the companies from this sector have been recognised as global innovation leaders offering solutions for future generations. In that context, the information from the Report stating that the share of domestic suppliers in 2013 accounted for 83% of the suppliers, and with regard to the contracted value of 84% of total procurement is exceptionally important. Consequentially, INA, d.d. may have a significant role in encouraging the suppliers who shall strictly adhere to the high corporate social responsibility standards, in the same manner as the company itself. In the world, there is a clear direction of the most successful business organisations towards integration of financial and non-financial reports in order to obtain key financial and narrative information on company performance which are accompanied by non-financial information on company actions within the social dimension of business as well as the dimension of business related to environmental protection. INA, d.d has long since recognised the importance of non-financial reporting. Such a manner of reporting in INA became a standard practice where key information on the internal and external stakeholders with regard to company performance is continuously, for the eighteenth time, being measured, presented and published. Two trends are noticeable in all forms of reporting; on the one hand the complexity of financial reporting is growing, but on the other hand, so is the need for non-financial indicators of organisational excellence. INA, d.d. is surely a company with the longest tradition and the most advanced practice of non-financial reporting, which is also confirmed by this year’s Report. It is especially important to emphasize that since 2004 those Reports have been prepared in accordance with rigorous standards of the global reporting initiative, and that each year there is a clear tendency towards improvement of the self-declared non-financial reporting practice, this year also including a number of new indicators for the activity of oil and gas exploration and production. The Report indicates the impact not only of INA, d.d., but also of all the connected trading companies, which provides the reader with a holistic overview of the Group activities. This Report also demonstrates the key information on the most important issues of the company related to the problems of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility in a clear and understandable manner. The Report clearly indicates the guidelines and principles by which the company finds the answer to the complex challenges it faces and manages the risks by positioning itself as the regional market leader. The Report also illustrates that this manner of business represents a basic organisational value and the management has a clear intention of becoming a part of the system of organisational values. The Report clearly shows that special attention is paid to INA Group employees who represent a key 96 comparative value of the company which is evident from the indicators related to employee health and safety. I find most encouraging the fact that INA, d.d. recognised its role in the society through constant employment of young employees, the cooperation with student associations, as well as the creation and continuous development of special internship programmes which manage young talents in the best possible manner. Furthermore, the activities of the Volunteer club should also be noted, which grew not only in the number, but also in the scope of the activities. Additional effort has also been made in the aspect of the presentation of information where it is evident that the manner in which key information shall be presented to the stakeholders such as local communities, representatives of the civil society, government officials, employees, the media and the general public is considered year after year. That multi-stakeholder view of the business reality indicates that the management has recognised the long-term perspective of the company and adjusted it to the short-term goals. These processes may additionally be strengthened by the increasingly important role of the Ethics Committee, the Corporate Social Responsibility Council and the Sustainable Development Board which are active within the INA Group each in their own perspective. Greater transparency and responsibility which are a part of that process are also visible. Progress in that sense would be possible with regard to further digitalisation of the presented information in the form of an interactive report which would enable two-way communication with key stakeholders. That significantly facilitates stakeholder evaluation of the company activities which is essential from the aspect of the creation and maintenance of reputation and relational capital. Finally, this A level non-financial report in accordance with the global reporting initiative GRI 3.1 provides a clear, understandable and balanced representation of the concrete company performance, taking into consideration the authenticity of the information in the report, as well as the overall content selection.
