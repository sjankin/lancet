Presently, by offering products like Kirei Kirei brand hand soaps, gargles, and disinfectants, we are driving efforts to help people realize hygiene and healthy life. However, as very few people know how to wash their hands correctly, it is a social challenge to disseminate correct hand washing practices. Our Kirei Kirei hand soap is receiving accolades in the market, and we consider the dissemination of hygiene practices to people and continuation of such practices by them to be a social responsibility. Notably, basic living habits like hand washing and gargling need to be practiced from childhood. Thus, not only are we selling products but are also actively engaging ourselves in activitiesｙ to educate how to wash hands and gargle at kindergartens and preschools. To prevent diseases and infections and help people live a healthy and comfortable life, all of us at Lion will work together to help make hygiene practices and habits stick in society.

The local employees conducted organized enjoyable activities, such as showing a skit to teach children the importance of removing bad bacteria and retaining the good ones to keep them healthy, and finger-painting sessions Development which was followed by cleaning their own hands using the Kirei Kirei hand soap.

In our dialogue with external specialists in 2012, an opinion was expressed that a full explanation from Lion would keep consumers informed about environmentally friendly products that they can choose from. In order to inform consumers – our most important stakeholder – about the importance of environmental considerations, Lion established new standards for eco-products through review of evaluation items from a product life cycle perspective, and created an environmental logo and label to be attached to eco-products to initiate new environmental communications. Establishment of Environmental Logo and Label The newly established environmental logo contains the environment slogan and an environmental mark and an environmental mark that clearly expresses Lion’s environmental aspirations that is in line < Lion's eco-standards > with its corporate slogan of Life. Love. Lion. Also, the environmental label has our environmental logo with an environmental statement on it. Lion established the Lion eco-standards It is now being attached to products that meet Lion's eco-standards. based on the life cycle assessment viewpoint, which provides quantitative assessment of environmental load at individual stages from procurement of raw materials, packages, and containers Environmental mark to disposal after use. Lion defines the products that meet one or more of the criteria for each evaluation item as ecoEnvironmental slogan products.
