Within the work environment, employment of a Hangar Facility and Security Manager in 2013 has assisted in the process to work against corruption, theft and bribery. Having Corporate Governance Policies coupled with the ability on the ground to investigate potential cases of fraud, theft and bribery enhances our efforts to deal with this scourge within our sphere of influence and within the work place. Our facilities internally and externally have been installed with CCTV cameras as theft within the workplace and from outside individuals remains a concern. We will continue to focus on this area during 2014 and 2015.
