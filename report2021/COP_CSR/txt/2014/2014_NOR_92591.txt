The tools for long-term management of the capital structure consist primarily of the draw-down and repayment of long-term liabilities and payments of share capital from/to the owner. The Group endeavours to obtain external financing from various capital markets. The Group is not subject to any external requirements with regard to the management of capital structure other than those relating to the market’s expectations and the owner’s dividend requirements. There were no changes in the Group’s targets and guidelines governing the management of capital structure in 2013. The most important target figure for the Group’s management of capital structure is long-term credit rating. Statkraft AS has a long-term credit rating of A(stable outlook) from Standard & Poor’s and Baa1 (stable outlook) from Moody’s. Statkraft’s goal is to maintain its current rating, and BBB+/Baa1 as a minimum.

The fair value of interest rate swaps, as well as combined interest rate and currency swaps, is determined by discounting expected future cash flows to current value through use of observed market interest rates and quoted exchange rates from ECB. The valuation of forward currency exchange contracts is based on quoted exchange rates, from which the forward exchange rate is extrapolated. Estimated present value is subjected to a test of reasonableness against calculations made by the counterparties to the contracts. The interest rate swaps, including the interest portion of combined interest rate and currency swaps, are part of risk management and are accounted for as hedging or at the lowest value principle, depending on whether the requirements for hedge accounting are achieved. The fair value of interest rate swaps designated as hedging (fair value) totalled NOK -2 million at 31 December 2013, while the interest rate swaps at the lowest value principle amounted to NOK -1368 million. Ineffectiveness on fair value hedges in 2013 is recognised as a net profit in the amount of NOK 7 million. The hedges expire in 2014-2022. The fair value of derivatives in cash flow hedges is not recognised and amount to NOK -11million. 104 STATKRAFT ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 21 Fees paid to external auditors Deloitte AS is the Statkraft Group’s auditor.

Our corporate responsibility work is founded on internationally recognised initiatives and guidelines such as the UN Global Compact and IFC’s Performance Standards on Environmental & Social Sustainability. Statkraft’s fundamental requirements for acting in a sustainable, ethical and socially responsible manner are described in Statkraft’s Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct applies to all companies and employees in the Statkraft Group.

The picture shows the construction of the Banjë dam with the associated access road. Health and safety In Statkraft, health and safety has the highest priority, everywhere and always. The goal is zero work-related injuries. To reach this goal, we are working systematically to establish a safety culture based on transparency and a desire to achieve continuous improvement as regards planning, execution and follow-up of health and safety activities. Accidents, near-misses and hazardous conditions are recorded and followed up, and we facilitate sharing of lessons learned and experiences across the organisation. In order to strengthen the health and safety work, an annual self-evaluation was introduced in all business units in 2013. The self-evaluation covers areas such as risk areas, performance and measures in relation to established requirements. Security Statkraft’s security work is coordinated and structured, and we aim to achieve international best practice. The umbrella term security covers four areas: personnel security, physical security, ICT security and information security. The security situation, as regards e.g. political instability and terrorism, is assessed continuously in the areas where Statkraft has a presence. In 2013, Statkraft established a comprehensive project to identify improvement areas and specific improvement measures in relation to security. Climate and the environment Statkraft mainly produces renewable energy without emissions of greenhouse gases and thereby contributes to address climate change. However, renewable power generation also affects the environment. Environmental impact assessments are included in all relevant business activities, and our goal is to find sustainable and environmentally responsible solutions. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 127 Statkraft established a climate research programme in 2013. The climate programme includes obtaining updated climate forecasts and facilitates unified handling of climate challenges in the Group. Ethics and anti-corruption Statkraft has committed to a high ethical standard and business culture, with zero tolerance for corruption. At the same time, we are present in markets where there is a great risk of encountering corruption challenges. Statkraft works continuously to strengthen the Group’s anti-corruption work. Examples of measures include various forms of training, tools for assistance in ethically challenging situations and background checks of relevant partners. Human rights Statkraft is present in parts of the world where human rights follow-up can be challenging. This is a topic taken seriously by the Group, and Statkraft actively promotes respect for human rights in all parts of its business. Follow-up of human rights is addressed several times in the company’s management system, including a requirement for follow-up of human rights to be a standardised element in Statkraft’s contracts. Social impact As a power producer, we have a long-term perspective, which emphasises the need to develop sustainable solutions. We will succeed best by maintaining an open dialogue with local communities and other stakeholders, and we facilitate such dialogue and interaction in all project development and operations.

The Statkraft Way The Statkraft Way, Statkraft’s management system, is based on the Group’s vision, values, code of conduct and business model and provides, through briefly formulated policies and more detailed specification and supporting documents, an introduction to how Statkraft works. Corporate responsibility is a key topic in The Statkraft Way. Requirements and guidelines Launch of Statkraft will operate in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in all countries where The Statkraft Way November 2012 we have activities and adhere to internationally recognised standards and guidelines. We focus our work towards creating a work culture in accordance with our principles and which promotes good business practice.

Statkraft has also prepared corresponding guidelines for the Group’s suppliers. Follow-up of Statkraft’s corporate responsibility is an integrated part of Statkraft’s management system, The Statkraft Way. The management system facilitates a structured and uniform handling of the company’s corporate responsibility, and the system is regularly evaluated to adapt it to new environments and challenges. More detailed descriptions of how Statkraft’s corporate responsibility will be discharged throughout the value chain can be found in the specification and support documents for the different areas, including for business ethics, environment, human rights, health and safety and security. Statkraft is a member of the UN’s Global Compact and is committed to following up this initiative and its ten principles. Furthermore, Statkraft bases its conduct on internationally recognised initiatives and standards, including principles from OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and IFC’s Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability. OECD’s guidelines present recommendations from governments to multinational companies in relation to responsible business conduct, while IFC’s standards provide guidelines for sustainable behaviour throughout the value chain. Corporate responsibility throughout the organisation Corporate responsibility is a line responsibility in Statkraft. This means that each individual unit has an independent responsibility to conduct the business activities in a responsible manner and that follow-up of topics such as health and safety, corruption, human rights and environmental impact are incorporated in relevant processes, projects and tasks in each individual unit. In addition, Statkraft has a corporate staff to follow up the company’s work and performance as regards corporate responsibility on an overall level. The staff has an advisory role vis-à-vis the business units and ensures that corporate responsibility is properly discharged in the Group’s management and reporting system. Corporate responsibility in development projects Statkraft has a set process for execution of major development projects, mergers and acquisitions which ensures a unified approach to, e.g., corporate responsibility from an early phase and through stepwise decision processes. The model’s basic principle is that each main decision must be accompanied by documented information on a number of stipulated topics, including corporate responsibility, as part of the decision basis. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 129 ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 Statkraft’s environmental management system has been designed in accordance with ISO 14001:2004, and parts of the Group’s activities in Norway and Sweden have also been certified under this standard. Statkraft has prepared Group-wide requirements and guidelines for environmental management, covering mapping of environmental impact and risk, mapping of expertise and expertise needs, as well as establishment of goals and action plans. Statkraft’s health and safety management system is based on the principles in OHSAS 18001. Common requirements and guidelines have been prepared for a number of areas, for example as investigation of serious incidents, handling of particularly hazardous work operations and reporting and follow-up of incidents. Emergency preparedness Emergency preparedness plans have been prepared for all operative units in the Group and focus especially on protecting life and health, reducing negative environmental impact and securing the company’s assets. Emergency drills are held regularly on different levels in the organisation so that unexpected, serious situations will be handled in a suitable and efficient manner. Performance follow-up Statkraft’s Group scorecard includes KPIs for the environment, health and safety areas and the scorecard results are regularly reviewed by the Group management and the board. In addition, relevant results and measures within all topics associated with corporate responsibility are discussed in regular Business Reviews (meetings between the President and CEO and the business/staff unit). In its work, the Group Audit considers to what extent the requirements and guidelines for discharging corporate responsibility have been implemented and adhered to in the organisation. This takes place through focused audits and as part of more wide-ranging efforts. In 2013, no serious noncompliances were registered in connection with corporate responsibility. Statkraft has established a Group-wide system for registration and follow-up of noncompliances and potential improvements. The system facilitates structured handling of measures and deadlines, analysis of causal links and learning across the organisation. Supplier follow-up Statkraft has developed a version of Statkraft’s Code of Conduct which is especially aimed at the Group’s suppliers. This document describes the Group’s requirements for suppliers as regards protection of the environment, human rights, labour rights and labour standards, health and safety and anti-corruption. Statkraft’s suppliers are informed of our Code of Conduct and other relevant requirements during the procurement processes and contract signing. Follow-up of suppliers A comprehensive systematic approach ensures that the correct requirements are applied to Statkraft’s suppliers in all phases of the procurement process, from pre-qualification to delivery follow-up. Particularly important and vulnerable deliveries are subject to more rigorous follow-up through several supplier links in the form of company visits and unannounced inspections. In 2013, Statkraft started the implementation of a risk-based tool which will identify and follow up risk topics throughout the purchasing process. The tool will make it possible to identify risk areas such as corruption, safety or child labour at an early stage, and the follow-up will be focused on high-risk areas. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 130 Stakeholder dialogue Statkraft wants to communicate in an open and active manner with everyone affected by our activities. Important partners in this dialogue include the owner, elected officials on all levels, employees, local populations, customers, suppliers, local and regional authorities, voluntary organisations and the media. Dialogue with local communities and host municipalities Statkraft emphasises a direct and predictable dialogue with all host municipalities. In Norway, annual meetings are held with all host municipalities, where Statkraft provides information about ongoing and coming activities, opening up for discussion about topics important for the individual municipality. It is particularly important to provide information and ensure transparency in the early stages of development projects. In line with national licensing processes and international guidelines, Statkraft holds open meetings and hearings, providing information about development plans and topics relevant for those affected by the project. Such topics may include expropriation, future job opportunities and environmental impacts resulting from the project. Dialogue with policymakers and voluntary organisations Maintaining an active dialogue with policymakers is important for highlighting the challenges and influencing the framework conditions that guide further operations and development of the company. Statkraft participates in several national and international forums for the purpose of discussing and influencing energy policy. These forums include Energy Norway, Eurelectric, Word Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the International Hydropower Association (IHA). Statkraft also cooperates with voluntary organisations and has entered into cooperation agreements with the environmental organisations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, Bellona and WWF. Statkraft’s Corporate Statkraft annually reports the most important challenges facing the Group, as well as corporate responsibility measures and performance. Responsibility reporting The report is based on GRI’s recommendations Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting is based on the recommendations from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for reporting of corporate responsibility and sustainability issues. GRI has also established ten reporting principles which include descriptions of how to identify significant topics and the execution of the reporting process itself. Statkraft has set up a systematic process to annually present results for areas such as environment and social impact, health and safety, security, anti-corruption work and follow-up of human rights. Both qualitative and quantitative indicators have been identified, and all relevant business units report their performance in relation to these indicators. We believe these indicators capture the most important aspects as regards corporate responsibility in the Group, while also taking into account reporting requirements and expectations from our stakeholders. Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting describes the most important topics and results on the Group level. More information on special topics and individual projects can be found on Statkraft’s website. Verification of corporate responsibility information Statkraft’s external auditor verifies the Group’s corporate responsibility reporting. The auditor’s work is based on the ISAE 3000 assurance standard, and the conclusion for the work is set out in the auditor’s statement. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 131 Competence and training Good corporate responsibility expertise among managers and employees is an important factor for Statkraft to achieve its goals. Relevant corporate responsibility topics have been incorporated in training programmes for both new employees and managers. Introductions are given, both as regards overall requirements and individual responsibilities, and more focused training in safety requirements in the workplace, anti-corruption work and environmental and social impact as a result of Statkraft’s activities. The projects sets a particular focus on health and safety training, and Statkraft has developed web-based courses that are available, and in some cases mandatory, for both employees and contractors. Efforts are particularly directed towards raising expertise in and understanding of anticorruption work throughout the organisation. Anti-corruption manuals and e-learning tools are available and tailored dilemma training sessions are held when needed. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 132 Environmental impact Statkraft offers renewable and sustainable energy solutions, which is how we help meet one of the greatest challenges of our day: global warming. At the same time, all power production is associated with different forms of interventions in nature. Systematic environmental management in line with good international practice will minimise and compensate for the negative environmental impact of the Group’s activities. Renewable and sustainable Statkraft is Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy, and in 2013, about 97% of the company’s power production was based on renewable energy sources. energy solutions Statkraft’s environmental ambition states that we will support a global transition towards a low-carbon economy by offering renewable and sustainable energy solutions. In addition, all activities shall be planned and implemented in line with good international practice. Our environment-friendly portfolio In 2013, 97% of Statkraft’s production was based on renewable energy sources, and more than 92%, or 52.6 TWh, came from hydropower. As a technology, hydropower has many advantages, including high efficiency, long lifetime and high flexibility. The large, Norwegian water reservoirs enable us to produce electricity even when there is little inflow. This flexibility is particularly important when combining flexible and inflexible technologies, for example hydropower and wind power. Development and operation of hydropower plants facilitate multiple uses of water resources and water regulation facilities. Examples of such use include irrigation, water supply, transport Caption missing. Please write a short caption, i.e. Blåsjø is and recreation. In addition, flood control using reservoirs is an important safety measure in the largest hydro power resovoir in Norway etc... many areas. Such use of our installations will in all probability be even more important in the future when we face the consequences of the climate changes. Wind power is a renewable technology with few environmental effects and almost no emissions. The tendency is towards larger turbines, higher towers and fewer turbines in each wind farm. This is considered to be a positive development as regards environmental effects. Power generation and district heating (Statkraft’s share) TWh 70 The Group’s non-renewable energy production includes gas-fired power and a small part of the 60 district heating production. 50 40 Gas power is by many considered a transitional technology while we wait for all power 30 production to become renewable. The technology generates carbon emissions, but the 20 emissions are substantially lower than for coal-based power plants. Statkraft’s gas power 10 plants in Germany operate only as peak load producers and, like hydropower, therefore 0 contribute to flexibility in the European energy markets. Knapsack I and II are two of Europe’s 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 most modern and efficient gas-fired power plants, but due to high gas prices, low carbon prices Hydropower Wind power and large growth in inflexible power production (solar and wind power), Statkraft’s gas power Gas power District heating production has been significantly reduced in recent years Environmental Environmental management is an integrated part of Statkraft’s management system and covers all business units and activities. The environmental management in Statkraft management system shall ensure a systematic approach to the environmental work, with key activities being identification of environmental risk, establishment of goals and action plans, implementation of measures and follow-up of results. Statkraft’s environmental management system has been designed in accordance with ISO 14001:2004, and most of the Group’s activities in Norway and Sweden have been certified under this standard. The Group was recertified in 2013. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 133 The Group’s development projects are planned and implemented in line with good international practice. The IFCs Performance Standards on Environmental & Social Sustainability are important tools in this connection. In accordance with these standards, Statkraft sets requirements relating to comprehensive impact analyses and environmental follow-up plans which must be updated throughout the project process. These documents are published on the projects’ websites and thereby made available to external stakeholders. Statkraft’s contractors are also subject to the Group’s environmental requirements, and these are therefore incorporated in all contracts where relevant. External assessment of environmental performance Statkraft’s environment KPI on the Group’s score card has, since 2012, consisted of an environmental assessment prepared by an external rating agency (oekom research AG). The assessment is based on a broad set of criteria covering environmental management, power production and energy efficiency, and provides an understanding of how the world around us rates our efforts and in which areas we should aim to improve. The use of a rating agency also makes it possible to compare with other companies, both in our own and other industries. The 2013 assessment resulted in the rating B+, which corresponds to good international practice in the oekom Corporate Rating. IHA’s Sustainability Assessment Protocol The International Hydropower Association (IHA) has developed a tool for considering sustainability in hydropower projects (IHA Sustainability Assessment Protocol). The most recent version of the protocol was launched in 2010, and a number of voluntary organisations, companies (including Statkraft), banks and national and international institutions participated in the development. As an IHA Sustainability Partner, Statkraft has participated actively in the testing of the sustainability protocol. In 2012, a sustainability assessment was made of the Jostedal power plant in Norway in accordance with the protocol’s requirements. This assessment was upgraded in 2013, and the report has now been approved as the official assessment and published on IHA’s website. The protocol has also been tested in a development project in Albania, Devoll Hydropower Project, where a preliminary assessment has been made, based on the requirements and scope of the protocol. The experiences so far show that the protocol can be a good aid, contributing to sustainable development and operation of hydropower. The results from the testing of the Jostedal power plant were very good and showed a sustainability profile on par with good international practice in all assessed areas. Cooperation agreements Statkraft has entered into strategic partnership agreements with the three environmental organisations Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, Bellona and WWF. The overall purpose of the agreements is to benefit from each other’s expertise and find the best energy solutions. A specific project has been established with WWF in Turkey, focusing on environmental water flow. The project will result in recommendations primarily directed at decision makers and investors. The application of IHA’s sustainability protocol is another project where we cooperate with WWF Norway and WWF International. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 134 Environmental activities in Statkraft’s core business areas are hydropower and wind power. Neither of these technologies generates significant emissions or discharges, but both cause Statkraft interventions in ecosystems and the landscape. The objective is always to make interventions as gentle as possible, and adapt them to local conditions. Statkraft is involved in many activities which will reduce the environmental impact of ou activities. Hydropower and the environment Rivers and river systems are important, both as elements of the landscape and as ecosystems. Watercourses play an important role in both droughts and floods, and also have a multi-purpose value for people in the form of recreation, transport and as water supply to households, industry and agriculture. The development and operation of hydropower plants must therefore take into account many interests. Statkraft’s goal in all activities is to achieve sustainable water management, and our environmental efforts in relation to river systems and fish are comprehensive. Examples of such efforts include environmentally adapted operation of the power plants, laying down suitable spawning and smolt growth substrate, fish restocking, egg planting, construction of fish ladders and improvement of thresholds and migration barriers. The overall objective for this work is to achieve sustainable and self-recruiting fish populations. Many of these measures are imposed by licence, but Statkraft also implements voluntary measures, often in close cooperation with landowners and local organisations. Statkraft operates two out of three Norwegian gene banks for salmon, nine fish cultivation facilities and is a large producer of stocking fish and fish eggs in Norway and Sweden. Planting of eyed eggs take place by releasing salmon eyed eggs into boxes filled with fist-sized rocks. We carry out comprehensive studies of affected river systems. In Norway, the main focus is on salmon and trout, while Sweden and Germany have seen an increasing focus on conserving eel populations. Eel are very vulnerable to turbine injuries when migrating from regulated rivers, and Statkraft is involved in several projects and has implemented various solutions to meet this challenge. In Sweden, eel are now moved downstream of power plants manually, while in Germany a system has been developed to control turbines and stop them when the eel migrate. In Norway, the licence terms for many power plants are now under revision, aiming to update the environmental terms to current standards. Suldalslågen, which is a national salmon river system, received new river management regulations in 2012, whereas reviews are ongoing in the Tokke, Vinje and Røssåga river systems. In Germany, Statkraft has installed a turbine control systems to increase survival rates for migrating silver eel. Statkraft has eight run-of-river power plants in the Weser River and The EU’s Water Framework Directive is a set of regulations developed to ensure comprehensive all are integrated in the turbine control system. The system satisfied the requirements both from the EU’s Eel Regulation management of European water resources based on the ecosystems. In Norway, these (2007) and Water Framework Directive (2000). The system regulations have been incorporated into the Framework for water management (the Water is based on a warning system for migrating eel, MIGROMAT, developed by the Institute for Applied Ecology (IFOE). After Regulations). Statkraft is working closely with the authorities to implement the Water three seasons of testing the turbine control system, Statkraft Regulations and to find sound environmental solutions in the river systems where we have can point to good results. activities. In order to be better prepared for the challenges resulting from the term reviews and implementation of the Water Framework Directive, 2013 has seen a comprehensive survey our greatest environmental challenges. The survey will form the basis for further research and action plans. The survey showed that the most important environmental challenges going forward will be in relation to minimum water flow and fragmentation of habitats, biological diversity and sedimentation. Wind power and the environment Both onshore and offshore, Statkraft’s wind power developments are facing environmental challenges. Birds are a recurring topic, both due to the risk of birds colliding with the turbines, and because wind farms can drive certain bird species away from their natural habitats or form barriers to important migration routes. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 135 Establishing wind farms with the associated infrastructure can influence living conditions for plants and animals, particularly in the construction phase. It is therefore important to find solutions that are well adapted to the individual location, and to avoid construction activity in particularly vulnerable periods. Noise and landscape aesthetics are also topics that are carefully considered when establishing new wind farms. Offshore, the impact on the marine environment is a particularly challenging topic, not least as there is currently little knowledge about the consequences for sea mammals, fish and benthic fauna. There are a lot of indications that negative effects mainly in relate to the construction phase, and that offshore wind farms may also benefit the environment in the longer term. A The wind farm on Smøla has led to increased mortality for white-tailed eagles, and only a few eagle couples now breed wind farm resting on the seabed can e.g. provide shelter for fish fry and create good growth inside the wind farm. However, this has not resulted in a areas for fish and other organisms. noticeable decline in the number of white-tailed eagles in the area. Photo: Bjørn Iuell Since 2005, Statkraft has been involved in R&D activities at the Smøla wind farm to look into how white-tailed eagles and the local variety of willow ptarmigan are affected by the wind farm, and specifically what can be done to avoid collisions between birds and turbines. Population studies of white-tailed eagles in the Smøla area indicate that most of the couples which previously bred in the wind farm area have now found new territories away from the wind farm, and that the white-tailed eagle population is stable. Different types of collision-reducing measures are being tested in the wind farm, and experiences from the research work on Smøla are used actively in the planning of new wind farms, also offshore. Other technologies and the environment In 2013, trials started at Smøla wind farm to make the wind Statkraft is also involved in activities using other technologies, primarily production of gas power turbines more visible to birds through use of lights or contrast (Germany), production of biopower (Germany), production of district heating (Norway and Sweden), paint. The goal is to reduce the risk of bird collisions. The trials are a collaboration with Statoil, Vattenfall, Trønder grid distribution (Norway) and some gas distribution (Norway through Skagerak Energi). EnergiKraft, NVE, the Research Council of Norway and Energy Norway, and are carried out by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research. Photo: Espen Lie Dahl Gas power results in carbon and NOx emissions, and discharge of cooling water. NOx can contribute to overfertilisation, while discharge of cooling water can impact biodiversity in nearby river systems. Statkraft’s gas power plants are some of Europe’s most modern power plants, with high efficiency, good treatment facilities and low emission and discharge risk. They are located in industrial areas where the additional impact from our plants has little environmental impact. The operation of district heating plants and biopower plants generates NOx emissions, and district heating plants also emit SOx, which can contribute to acidification of river systems. The amount of SOx emitted varies with the energy source used. Emission and discharge figures are carefully followed up to ensure that the plants comply with their licences. In connection with the planning and construction of offshore OVERVIEW OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN STATKRAFT’S GAS POWER PLANTS wind farms, considerable resources have been spent to look into possible environmental effects on fish, marine birds and marine mammals, such as seals and porpoises. Norway: Photo: Bjørn Iuell Kårstø 58-59% Germany: Herdecke 59% Knapsack I 58% Knapsack II 59% Emden 53% Robert Frank 43% CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 136 For district heating plants that use waste as fuel, there may also be challenges in the form of odours, and the activity generates large volumes of hazardous waste. Environmental challenges in connection with grid activities are primarily related to radiation from power lines and landscape impact, which in turn can change visual qualities and the opportunities for recreational activities in the area. For gas distribution, the risk lies primarily in gas leakages. This distribution is subject to detailed guidelines and controls covering environmental, health and safety risks. Skagerak Energi, which takes care of this activity in Statkraft, has not registered any nonconformities. Statkraft and the climate Climate change and global warming are among the greatest challenges of our day, and the UN climate panel’s most recent report from 2013 confirm that the global climate changes are anthropogenic. The IPCC has previously pointed out that increased use of renewable energy may be the single most important measure against climate change. Statkraft offers clean and sustainable energy solutions and in this manner supports a global transition to a low-carbon economy. Statkraft’s Climate Advisory Panel Statkraft’s activities have a very long perspective and climate change will influence both operations and business opportunities significantly, e.g. through influencing energy sources (precipitation, run-off and wind) and through changes in the political framework. In order to meet the challenges caused by climate change, Statkraft has established an internal, cross-disciplinary workgroup, Statkraft’s Climate Advisory Panel (CAP). The Climate Advisory Panel’s main mission is to coordinate the Group’s efforts in relation to climate issues. The picture shows the extent of the flooding in Rena in In 2013, the panel has worked to raise the Group’s understanding of climate issues. Based Norway on 23 May 2013. on information from international processes and key climate issue forums, as well as internal analyses of the climate situation, Statkraft has chosen a specific climate scenario as a starting point for the Group’s long-term strategy work. The Group will contribute to consistency in the choice of global climate models and consider how to apply such models across business units. In some locations, climate change will result in more water, in other locations less. Statkraft can contribute to dampening the effects of climate change by using its own installations for e.g. flood control. In dry countries, reservoirs can also be used for irrigation and water supply. Statkraft’s climate programme Statkraft’s overall guidelines state that our assessments and adaptations in relation to climate changes shall be based on international expertise and recognised research results. On this background, Statkraft established a specific research programme in 2013. The programme will focus on the development of business-specific climate knowledge and will help adapt the global climate models to planning and operation. The climate programme works closely with Statkraft’s Climate Advisory Panel and has two main objectives: ➔➔ Understanding the physical impact of climate change and recommend possible adaptations ➔➔ Contributing to development of scientific methods which can be used to consider how climate change will affect us commercially The programme will run over several years and has a budget of NOK 10 million per year. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 137 Climate Round Table In 2013, Statkraft hosted the Climate Round Table with selected participants from commerce and industry, key research environments and NGOs. The Climate Round Table is a debate forum where the objective is to increase the expertise concerning climate issues and establish a common understanding of the role of businesses. Greenhouse gas emissions Statkraft’s emissions of greenhouse gases Tonnes CO2 equivalents 2 000 000 Most of Statkraft’s portfolio is more or less emission-free hydropower and wind power production, and our emissions of greenhouse gases are therefore relatively low. In 2013, 1 500 000 the Group’s total emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to 460 900 tonnes of CO2 equivalents, corresponding to a relative emission of CO2 equivalents of 9 kg/MWh. Statkraft’s 1 000 000 total emissions of greenhouse gases have been reduced by 73% since 2010 due to lower 500 000 production of gas power in Germany. 0 In 2013, about 78% of the Group’s emissions of CO2 equivalents came from the German 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 gas power plants Knapsack, Emden and Robert Frank. CO2 emissions from district heating Gas power District heating plants Fuel consumption Business travel amounted to about 17% and came from the non-renewable share of waste and some use of oil. Accidental emissions of SF5 and halon The Group buys ordinary carbon quotas in the international carbon quota market to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from that part of the business that is not subject to mandatory quota schemes. This applies to emissions related to fuel consumption, business travel and any accidental emissions of the greenhouse gases halon and SF6. In 2013, the emissions from these sources amounted to 26 100 tonnes of CO2 equivalents. Emission quota and green energy trading Statkraft is engaged in trading with all types of carbon certificates permitted in the European Emission Trading System (EU ETS). We trade in EUAs (European Union Allowances), CERs (Certified Emission Reductions) and ERUs (Emission Reduction Units). Furthermore, we participate in projects under the Kyoto Protocol’s CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) and JI (Joint Implementation), and buy emission permits directly from such projects. One of our core activities as regards quota trading is the development of products which will help our customers to reduce costs in connection with requirements relating to carbon emission cuts. Statkraft also offers guarantees of origin, i.e. documents that guarantee what source a given amount of power has been produced from. Consumption, emissions, Statkraft’s activities do not cause waste production, emissions or discharges discharges and waste to any significant degree. Data for the Group’s energy consumption, emissions and discharges, waste volumes and environmental incidents are reported in the corporate responsibility statement. Electricity consumption In 2013, electricity consumption in Statkraft was 882 GWh, of which 67% was used for pumped-storage hydropower. Electricity use in the Group is certified as renewable in accordance with RECS. A major energy efficiency project has been ongoing at Statkraft’s Norwegian hydropower plants since 2010. The purpose of the project is to reduce internal energy consumption, primarily through installation of control systems for pumps, ventilation, heating and lights. The project is now in the final phase, and the preliminary results from the participating hydropower plants indicate an average reduction in electricity consumption of 35%. A different energy efficiency measure has been implemented in Germany. During the construction of Knapsack II, provisions were made for transfer of steam from Knapsack I. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 138 Normally, electric boilers are used when starting up gas power plants, but with the transfer of steam between the two plants, the use of electric boilers can be reduced substantially. Local pollution Statkraft faces few challenges as regards local pollution. The greatest environmental risk is associated with oil spills from vehicles, construction equipment and production equipment. New routines have been introduced for registration of equipment containing oil, and use of bio oils and the switch to equipment with water-lubricated bearings also help reduce the risk of oil spills. There were no oil spills with permanent damage to the external environment in 2013. There can be local challenges associated with noise and dust in connection with transport and construction, and we have also experienced challenges with odours and ash emissions from the district heating plants. Statkraft’s new gas power plant in Germany, Knapsack II, is built in an area previously polluted by chemical industry. In connection with the development, a rehabilitation programme for polluted ground has been established in cooperation with the authorities and other expertise. The programme will address environmental, health and safety risks. In Norway, a project has been executed in recent years to map and clean up polluted (heavy metals, PAH) blasting sand in connection with the company’s water pipelines. This project has now been concluded. Waste handling Statkraft’s operations generated about 86 000 tonnes of hazardous waste in 2013. More than 99% of this was residual products from the biomass plant in Germany and the district heating plant in Trondheim. In addition, 8 800 tonnes of other waste was generated. Statkraft goal is to separate as much as possible of the generated waste at source, and 74% of the waste (hazardous waste not included) was source separated in 2013. Environmental incidents Environmental incidents are recorded and followed up systematically throughout the Group and reported regularly to the management and board of directors. No serious environmental incidents have been registered since 2008. In 2013, 127 less serious environmental incidents with little or no impact on the environment were reported. Most of them concerned short-term breaches of the river management regulations for hydropower plants and minor oil spills. In the operations unit, a number of short-term breaches of the river management regulations have been registered at Swedish hydropower plants in recent years. In order to meet this challenge, a cross-disciplinary group was established in 2013 to analyse each incident and identify measures. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 139 Health and safety Statkraft shall be a safe place to work. All work shall be planned and executed so that the zero injuries objective is achieved. Statkraft’s safety culture shall be characterised by transparency and a desire to learn, both from own mistakes and from successful improvement measures. Preventive health and Clear requirements and guidelines, health and safety awareness in all situations and close follow-up in both operating and project activities are important elements safety work in achieving good health and safety performance. Statkraft works systematically to achieve a good working environment where no-one is injured. Statkraft’s safety culture Statkraft’s goal is zero work-related injuries. This is a logical, but ambitious goal. In order to reach this goal, Statkraft is working systematically to establish a safety culture based on transparency and a desire to learn, both from own mistakes and from good planning and successful improvement measures. The identification and assessment of safety risks before all activities is a fundamental requirement, and work must be planned to ensure safe execution. All accidents, near-misses and hazardous conditions are therefore recorded and followed up in a consistent and structured manner, and sharing of lessons learned and experiences across the organisation is encouraged. Statkraft’s management and follow-up of health and safety work are based on the requirements in the OHSAS 18001 standard and international good practice. The injury frequency for our own employees and contractors in both regular operations and projects is included as an indicator in the Group’s score card, which is followed up monthly by the Group management and Statkraft’s board of directors. Follow-up of health and safety is a line responsibility in Statkraft. This means that each unit has an independent responsibility for efforts and follow-up relating to the health and safety performance. In order to strengthen the follow-up, annual self-evaluation was introduced in all business units in 2013. The evaluation reviews and assesses risk areas, performance and implemented and planned measures in relation to established requirements. Health and safety expertise All Statkraft employees are given training in safety risk and working environment, adapted to their individual working situation. Health and safety is a mandatory topic in the introduction programme for new employees and the Group’s management programmes. In addition, there is a basic, web-based course on Statkraft’s safety culture and work, which is available to all employees. Statkraft has also developed a more comprehensive web-based health and safety course directed at operations and operative project activities. This course was updated in 2013 Example from Statkraft’s web-based health and safety course. and reviews topics such as safety risk identification, working at heights, handling mobile installations, working at heights, handling mobile installations, traffic safety, electrical installations, planning and coordination of safety work and emergency preparedness work. The course is mandatory for all employees and contractors in Statkraft’s Power Generation unit who work at the company’s plants. The course is also available for employees and contractors in other parts of our activities, both nationally and internationally. Furthermore, Statkraft’s project manager programme has a module which covers planning and coordination of health and safety work. Training is also given in specific health and safety topics as required. Examples of such topics include investigation of serious incidents, operation of electrical installations and first aid courses. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 140 Within our Norwegian activities, all safety delegates and members of the working environment committees complete a 40-hour health and safety course. Networks and industry associations Statkraft is a member of several national and international networks and industry associations which follow up health and safety issues in different ways. These are important arenas where people can exchange experiences and continuously acquire updated knowledge and information about health and safety in the energy industry. Examples of such networks and associations include: ➔➔ Energy Norway: Energy Norway is an industry association representing about 270 Norwegian companies engaged in generation, distribution and trading of electricity. Energy Norway works actively to improve the health and safety work in the Norwegian energy industry. ➔➔ British Wind Energy Association (BWEA): BWEA is the leading industry association for wind power in the UK and works to develop industry guidelines for health and safety. ➔➔ International Hydropower Association (IHA): IHA is an international organisation promoting the role of hydropower in establishing sustainable energy solutions. IHA has developed the IHA Sustainability Guidelines, which is a framework to monitor the degree of sustainability for hydropower plants, including the health and safety aspect. ➔➔ G9 Offshore Wind Health and Safety Association: Statkraft is one of nine companies which established G9 in 2012 and which will promote health and safety for offshore wind power. Statkraft is a board member and also participates actively in the working groups Working at Heights, Marine Operations and Lifting Operations. ➔➔ National Safety Council of India (through SN Power): The National Safety Council has been established by the Indian government with a mission to promote health and safety work at the national level in India. Stronger focus on health and safety in projects Health and safety are integral to Statkraft’s management system and project management tools. This means that status and performance for health and safety issues are included as a decision criteria in all main decisions in the project process. Investigations and audits show that Statkraft has established clear requirements and guidelines for how health and safety issues shall be handled in projects, but that these requirements and guidelines are not always implemented in the daily work. Statkraft therefore works focused towards clarifying requirements and following up health and safety efforts in the daily work. Below are some examples of improvement activities implemented in 2013. ➔➔ Following several serious traffic accidents, the South-East Europe development unit has implemented a traffic safety project focusing on risk in connection with transport. An awareness campaign and training sessions have been held to clarify applicable requirements and promote desirable traffic behaviour. Traffic safety is also important in the local communities where we have activities. As part of the development of the Kargi hydropower plant in Turkey, a traffic safety park for primary school children was opened in May 2013 outside Osmancik. ➔➔ The Power Generation operations unit has over the course of 2013 visited all plants and projects to raise awareness of health and safety issues, identify risk areas and evaluate A traffic safety campaign was held in Turkey in 2013. status and measures. The conclusions and recommendations from the visits have been summarised in a report which is a good basis for the further health and safety work in Power Generation. ➔➔ Sheringham Shoal has been nominated for the 2014 health and safety award from the industry association Renewable UK. The wind farm was nominated for having included a function for life-saving first aid even in the wind farm’s operations phase. In the offshore wind sector it has been common to have this function available on vessels in the development phase, but so far not in the operations phase. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 141 Investigation of serious incidents Statkraft records accidents, near-misses and unsafe conditions in a group-wide follow-up and analysis tool, Emendo. Emendo is undergoing continuous development to facilitate the best possible follow-up and analysis of incidents in order to find efficient measures. Incidents with, or with potential for serious consequences, are given particular attention. These incidents are investigated in accordance with a set procedure to fully understand what has happened. The investigation is summarised in a report which describes the detailed course of events, causal links and implemented short and long-term measures. The investigation report is followed up by the responsible unit, as well as the relevant boards. A brief version of the investigation report is made available throughout the organisation to enable us to learn from mistakes and avoid recurrences. Absence due to illness Absence due to illness in Statkraft has been stable, and was 2.9% 2013, which is within the goal of an absence due to illness rate lower than 3.5%. All Norwegian companies in the Group have entered into Inclusive workplace (IA) agreements, with active follow-up of absence and adaptation of the work as needed by the employee. Accidents Unfortunately, there were two fatal accidents in 2013 in connection with Statkraft’s activities. One of the fatal accidents was work-related and both took place in connection with SN Power’s activities in Peru. In total, 123 lost-time injuries and 230 injuries overall were recorded among the Group’s employees and contractors in 2013. For Statkraft overall, this yields a total recordable injury rate (TRI) of 6.6 and a lost-time injury rate (LTI) of 3.5. Fatalities Fatal accidents Number 10 There were two fatal accidents in connection with Statkraft’s activities in 2013, one of which 9 was work-related. The work-related fatal accident took place in the Cheves development project 8 7 in Peru, which is wholly owned by SN Power. Statkraft owns 60% of SN Power. The accident 6 took place in August, when a contractor died from crushing injuries during tunnel work. The 5 4 accident has been investigated by an independent commission, and the main conclusion from 3 the investigation is that the work was carried out in an area that was inadequately secured. 2 Practices were changed immediately after the accident, and the entire plant was reviewed to 1 0 uncover risks in connection with tunnel work. 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Contractors, subsidiaries Contractors, associates Third parties, subsidiaries Third parties, associates In addition, there was one fatal accident involving a third party; a person was found drowned Employees, subsidiaries near the Pariac hydropower plant in Peru in May. The plant is owned by SN Power. Statistics from recent years show that the majority of the fatal accidents occur in connection with work related to roads and transport. As a result, traffic safety campaigns have been carried out in both Statkraft and SN Power in order to reduce the number of traffic accidents. Total recordable injuries for employees and contractors Injuries Number per million hours 18 The LTI indicator (number of lost-time injuries per million working hours) was 2.5 among Group 16 employees, while LTI among the Group’s contractors was 4.4. Correspondingly, the TRI indicator 14 (number of injuries per million working hours) among Group employees was 4.1 and 6.5 among 12 10 contractors. In total, 230 injuries were recorded, of which 123 lost-time injuries, among the 8 Group’s employees and contractors. 6 4 2 The injury rate trend is still heading in the right direction for employees, while the injury rate for 0 contractors has remained at the same level in recent years. Especially in larger development 2010 2011 2012 2013 LTI – employees projects, there is a strong focus on establishing a good safety culture. Measures used to TRI – employees LTI – contractors achieve this include close follow-up to ensure safety in the workplace and safety courses and TRI – contractors campaigns which cover employees, contractors and sub-contractors. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 142 In 2013, 19 injuries were registered where the consequences were or could have been serious, and a total of 49 incidents (injuries and near-misses) with a serious injury potential. This type of injuries and incidents are investigated and subject to particular follow-up to identify preventive measures and disseminate experiences and knowledge across the organisation. Hazardous conditions and near-misses In order to prevent incidents which can have serious consequences, both hazardous conditions and near-misses are recorded in operations and projects. Almost 11 000 incidents were recorded in 2013. Both near-misses and unsafe conditions are followed up in the same manner as actual accident situations, and conditions which recur or could have had serious consequences are particularly subjected to analysis and follow-up with measures to prevent serious incidents. This way we are always growing our expertise about work situations exposed to risk, enabling us to plan and take precautions to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 143 Security Statkraft works systematically in relation to security and emergency preparedness and aims to comply with international best practice. The handling of security issues is based on recognised principles. There are four areas covered by the umbrella term security in Statkraft: personnel security, physical security, ICT security and information security. In a critical situation, these areas will be handled together by a coordinating staff function, while the daily follow-up is handled in the line and the individual staff area. The Project Statkraft Security was initiated in 2013 to identify improvement areas and specific improvement measures for the security area. The project will run until 2017 and includes clarification of roles and responsibilities, further development of requirements and guidelines, expertise enhancement among key personnel in Statkraft, crisis management training and development of a uniform company security culture in Statkraft. The Group’s guidelines for securing people and assets are based on national guidelines and internationally recognised principles. Risk assessment The security situation, as regards e.g. political instability, terrorism, sabotage and organised crime, is assessed continually in all areas where Statkraft has a presence. Such assessments are made both at the corporate level and by the individual unit. Measures will be considered upon changes in the security situation, e.g. reinforced security routines and travel restrictions. Emergency preparedness All business units, country offices and operative units in Statkraft have established emergency Demonstration against hydropower project in India. preparedness plans in order to handle emergencies in a structured and systematic manner. In addition, there is an overall Group emergency preparedness plan describing procedures for notification, interaction, information sharing and communication in a crisis. The emergency preparedness plans are regularly revised, and regular drills are held on small and large scales. Securing Statkraft’s assets All of Statkraft’s buildings, plants and infrastructure are secured against unauthorised access. The purpose of this is to secure the Group’s assets against external threats and vandalism, but also to protect third parties against any safety risks in connection with the Group’s installations. Statkraft is involved in development activities in countries and areas which can be politically unstable. This may result in an increased need for guards and security measures for people and assets. If the threat situation so warrants, this may involve armed guards. Large parts of the Muslim world engaged in large-scale protests following the publication of drawings of Mohammed in Norwegian media. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 144 Business ethics Statkraft is firmly committed to doing business in accordance with the highest standards of ethically responsible behaviour and has zero tolerance for corruption. Our commitment Statkraft´s commitment to a high level of integrity is clearly stated in the Code of Conduct, owned and approved by the Board of Directors. The Code of Conduct describes how we conduct business at Statkraft and applies to anyone acting on behalf of a Statkraft Group company. Statkraft has also adopted a group requirement document on business ethics that provides further details. Our policies leave no doubt as to our position on corruption: we work against all forms of corrupt practices, including bribery and facilitation payments. Statkraft endorses the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, which include a clear standard for business ethics. As a member of the Global Compact, we report annually on our progress on embedding our business ethics culture in all parts of our organisation. Challenging arena – firm position According to the United Nation’s Global Compact, corruption adds 10% to the total cost of doing business globally, and a staggering 25% to the cost of procurement contracts in developing countries. Statkraft is present in a wide range of markets. Some of these rank high on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, and particular care is taken to mitigate corruption risks in these markets. Corruption risks constitute a serious threat both to our business environment and to the societies in which we operate. Active and continuous mitigation of these risks is therefore essential. Actions 2013 BUSINESS ETHICS TOOL Statkraft has had a long-standing commitment to business ethics, and is committed to Quick guide continuous improvement of preventative efforts. In 2012, a decision was made to further Business partners: Contractors strengthen the group’s anti-corruption work, which resulted in a range of new activities being and Suppliers implemented throughout 2012 and 2013. Examples of these activities include training of employees, through in-person training and e-learning, performing background checks on potential partners and integrating relevant clauses in contracts. In order to facilitate consistent and systematic handling of ethical issues, each business unit in Statkraft now also has an Integrity Manager, while an Integrity Officer has been established at corporate level. Statkraft has completed important anti-corruption efforts throughout 2013. Special attention has been given to developing dilemma-based training modules and implementing these in parts of the organisation where risks pertaining to corruption are perceived to be greatest. One of the new guidance tools: a Quick Guide on business Another area of focus in 2013 has been the development of new guidance tools designed to ethics in Statkraft. assist Statkraft employees in handling ethical dilemmas as well as documenting how such dilemmas are handled. Implementation of the new guidance tools will continue in 2014, supplementing the existing anti-corruption handbook and e-learning program. Responsible supply chain In 2013 Statkraft took steps towards ensuring efficient implementation of the Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) in its wider supply chain. Based on a systematic and risk-based approach, a management system is now in place to ensure improved performance with regards to corporate responsibility in the supply chain. The system specifically aims at further improving the work with prequalification and assessment of potential suppliers, the requirements to be included in tender processes, and the monitoring and auditing of suppliers. In 2013 a review of a number of suppliers was completed, and follow-up inquiries were made to ensure that the corporate responsibility criteria are safeguarded. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 145 Whistleblower channel Statkraft is concerned with ensuring transparency as regards dilemmas and ethical issues, and has established the Integrity Helpline, where employees can seek advice as regards interpreting Statkraft’s code of conduct and desired behaviour. Statkraft’s code of conduct emphasises that employees have both the right and duty to blow the whistle when discovering legal or ethical violations, either through the line management or to the independent whistle-blower channel of the corporate audit unit. In 2013, the corporate audit unit received two whistle-blower cases. The handling of both cases has been concluded. In development projects, any complaints from stakeholders are registered and handled in line through projects grievance mechanisms. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 146 Role in society Both directly and indirectly Statkraft creates substantial value to societies where we are present. In 2013 the Group’s gross value added amounted to NOK 20 824 million. Gross investments totalled NOK 13 344 million, of which NOK 7338 million was invested in Norway and NOK 6006 million abroad. We also aim to define the success of our investments in broader terms. By being in dialogue with our surroundings and by running all aspects of our operations in a responsible manner we believe we can create shared value, for us as company and for the local societies where we are present. R&D continues to be an important part of Statkraft’s innovation activities. In 2013 a new R&D program on climate issues was established. Economic value creation The Group’s gross value added amounted to NOK 20 824 million in 2013 (14 883). Values created are distributed to a number of stakeholders, in Norway and abroad.

Business development, long-term expertise building and focused R&D programmes are all key aspects of this work. R&D climate programme established Through targeted R&D programmes, we want to strengthen our competitive advantage and develop new business models. Multiyear R&D programmes have been established, closely linked to the Group’s strategic focus areas, hydropower, wind power and bio energy. 2013 saw the establishment of a new R&D programme within climate. The purpose of the climate programme is to study how climate change will impact Statkraft’s power production and put forward relevant measures. The programme will facilitate uniform handling of climate challenges in the Group across business units. The programme will run over several years and has a budget of NOK 10 million per year. Examples of innovation projects in 2013 ➔➔ Hydropower: A new design for Pelton turbines has been tested and implemented by SN Power in a hydropower plant in Peru. A new coating technique increases wear and tear tolerance for the turbine, yielding a substantial value through increased lifespans and lower maintenance costs. The innovation is a result of a cooperation between Dynavec, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and SN Power and is an example of how Statkraft supports innovation and supplier development within renewable energy production at the national level. ➔➔ Wind power: The size of offshores wind turbines is steadily increasing, creating challenges The Bucket Foundation is lowered into the sea at Doggerbank as regards seabed foundations. The costs associated with foundations are estimated to make up about 30% of the total cost for a wind farm, and a reduction here can therefore be of great importance for future wind farms. Foundations with so-called suction buckets are a promising solution, using a combination of gravity and under pressure to anchor the foundations to the seabed. As part of the testing of the technical solution and installation method, two such foundations were installed on the Doggerbank field in 2013. ➔➔ Hydropower: In winter, water is stored in the form of snow. It is therefore very important for power optimisation in the Nordic region to know the size of the snow reserve. However, measuring the amount of precipitation in winter is challenging, especially at low temperatures and high winds. A new, advanced measuring station at Haukeli addresses this problem. The project was initiated by Statkraft and met.no, but is currently under the auspices of Energy Norway. Better snow measurements will provide Statkraft with a better basis for power optimisation and researchers with a better understanding of climate change. Osmotic power investments halted For more than a decade, Statkraft has worked to develop osmotic power. The ambition has been to develop a competitive technology for production of renewable energy by 2020. In 2013, Statkraft stopped its investments in osmotic power. The background for the decision was that the current market outlook would not enable the development of a competitive technology within the foreseeable future. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 148 Stakeholder engagement Many people, organisations and communities are directly impacted by, or have a direct impact on, Statkraft´s activities. In all dialogue with stakeholders we will be respectful of local environments as well as the communities and cultures we work in, creating opportunities to provide information as well as to listen to concerns. We want to build trust in our company by engaging in transparent practices and open dialogue with stakeholders. Active and long term involvement As a power producer with long term perspectives, it is in the interest of both Statkraft and our stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions. Success in this regard can best be achieved in open dialogue and interaction with those affected by the company’s activities. Important partners in this dialogue include the Owner, elected officials, villages physically affected by a projects presence, employees, customers, suppliers, local and regional authorities, voluntary organisations and the media. Disclosure of relevant project information helps affected communities understand the risks, impacts and opportunities of the project. Issues related to energy are multifaceted, and the outcomes our stakeholder’s desire may not always align with each other or with the interest of our owner. Nevertheless, Statkraft will continue to participate in dialogue with interested parties. Stakeholder engagement in practice – Examples from Laos and Turkey ➔➔ Theun-Hinboun Expansion Project, Laos: Reaching Vulnerable Ethnic Minorities One of the challenges of stakeholder engagement is reaching the most vulnerable groups that are impacted by projects. These groups are often characterised as economically marginal, highly reliant on natural resources, victims of exploitation and discrimination, and without political representation. Reaching vulnerable groups has been an on-going challenge for Theun-Hinboun Expansion Project (THXP) in Laos. In THXP, of which Statkraft owns 20%, a small group of eight households was identified. These were former hunter-gatherers who had recently joined a village and were in the process of learning basic agricultural methods but still highly reliant Kindergarten at resettlement site on diminishing forest resources, and, as a result, extremely poor and vulnerable. They did not participate in group discussions. THXP employed a professional anthropologist to provide information on the group and to advise on how to proceed with resettlement planning. The anthropologist also made regular visits to check on progress and to educate staff about this group, making them aware of the particular challenges and the need for culturally-sensitive approaches. Separate consultations took place in order to ensure individual needs. As a result, this group was one of the first to be resettled in an area chosen by them with house designs and plots modified to their cultural, social and practical needs. Two staff were assigned with the responsibility of following up on a daily basis during resettlement transition. Some examples of specific interventions included modification of household plots to resemble forest conditions instead of ordered, neat rows of vegetable gardens, work on nutrition to improve health, help with language at the kindergarten level so that the children would have the confidence to attend regular school. A government staff from a related ethnic group was integrated with the livelihood team at the resettlement site to follow up with company staff. All eight households are monitored to make sure that the restoration process is successful. ➔➔ Statkraft in Turkey: Bilateral agreement emphasizing cooperation on hydropower Statkraft was significantly involved in the Norwegian royal visit to Ankara and Istanbul taking place in November 2013. The most important development for Statkraft was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Norwegian Minister of Industry and Trade, Monica Mæland, and Turkish Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Taner Yildiz, towards bilateral cooperation in energy between the two countries. Amongst other things, the MoU emphasizes increased cooperation on hydropower. The Turkish state electricity generation Ministers Mæland and Yildiz signing the MoU in November company EUAS is an important stakeholder for Statkraft in Turkey. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 149 Strategic collaborations Statkraft strives to build synergies through close collaboration with special interest organisations. The main purpose of the partnerships is to draw on each other’s competence in order to create win-win solutions. Statkraft entered into formal partnership agreements with WWF Norway, Bellona, the Norwegian Society for the Preservation of Nature and the Norwegian Red Cross in 2012. Teaming up with WWF in Turkey In 2013, Statkraft in Turkey and WWF Turkey established a project titled “Towards Sustainable Hydropower Production in Turkey”. The project intends to develop guidelines for environmental flow primarily directed at investors and decision makers. The joint efforts also aimed at developing a deeper understanding of hydropower and sustainability issues in Turkey with a comprehensive stakeholder analysis of the Turkish hydropower sector. The project contributes to Statkraft’s ongoing efforts to introduce ownership know-how and expertise to Turkish decision makers and to promote good international practice in the Turkish hydropower industry. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 150 Corporate As a power producer Statkraft is involved in several development projects in different parts of the world. Most of these take part in emerging markets, responsibility in but there are also substantial developments taking place in Northern development projects Europe, within different technologies. Here we share how we addressed corporate responsibility in a selection of projects in 2013. Located in central Turkey, the Kargı Hydropower Project (Kargı HPP) is presently under Kargı Hydropower Project construction and the plant will have an installed capacity of 102 MW. – Hydropower in Turkey The construction activities that were initiated in 2011 have been largely completed as of yearend 2013. Kargı HPP will have an annual maximum delivery of 470 GWh. ➔➔ Ownership: Statkraft 100% ➔➔ Capacity: 102 MW ➔➔ Development phase: Under construction, scheduled to start operating in December 2014 Around 400 people are currently working on the plant construction. Corporate responsibility challenges and measures In 2013, Kargı HPP continued to carry out a close dialogue with its stakeholders through individual and community level consultations in Osmancık community relations office and throughout project affected villages. Information sharing about project developments and facilitation of ongoing legal processes for land access and promotion of new livelihood initiatives constituted the key topics of discussions. Following the promotion of livelihood restoration initiatives through the establishment of demonstration gardens and a communications program in 2012, the year 2013 witnessed a Local farmer overseeing controlled crop growth in new slowly growing interest of project affected communities for fruit tree orchards and greenhouses. greenhouse. Among other community assistance initiatives to benefit impacted communities and nearby Osmancık population, Kargı HPP identified traffic safety as a priority area for 2013, and implemented an awareness campaign that involved opening a traffic safety training park in Osmancık in collaboration with local authorities. Çetin Hydropower Project In 2013, Statkraft continued construction of the Çetin hydropower plant (Çetin HPP), the company’s third hydropower project in Turkey. – Hydropower in Turkey With a total output of 517 MW, Çetin HPP will be Statkraft’s largest hydropower plant outside of Norway and will have an annual maximum delivery of 1.4 TWh. ➔➔ Ownership: Statkraft 100% ➔➔ Capacity: 517 MW (from two hydropower plants) ➔➔ Development phase: Under construction Up to 1500 people will be working on the plant during the construction period. Corporate responsibility challenges and measures During 2013 prioritised corporate responsibility activities in the Çetin project have been the operation of the community relations office at project site opening of another community relations office in the Pervari district center as well as designing and agreeing with local authorities from the districts of Şirvan and Pervari on a Regional Investment Plan. The Regional Investment Plan includes investments within areas such as education, health, rural development and culture and recreation. In addition, emphasis has been given to liaising between the project contractor and villagers Local pupils demonstrate correct use of new safety gear regarding damages from contractor’s activities. during a traffic safety campaign at a school in the project impact area. Moreover, the project launched several studies and investigations, including a study on the livelihood compensation options and scenarios for both Pervari and Şirvan districts as well as pedestrian bridge user surveys in Pervari district. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 151 Björkhöjden and During the latter half of 2012, Statkraft initiated the development of Björkhöjden and Ögonfägnaden wind farms, which will be our fourth and fifth wind farms in Ögonfägnaden Wind Farms Sweden. – Windpower in Sweden The wind farms will consist of 90 and 33 turbines respectively and are scheduled for operation in late 2014-2015. ➔➔ Ownership: Statkraft 60%, Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA) 40% ➔➔ Capacity: 270 MW (Björkhöjden) and 99 MW (Ögonfägnaden) ➔➔ Development phase: Under construction Both projects will be executed by Statkraft SCA Vind AB, owned by Statkraft and SCA, and about 30 people are involved in the construction phase of the project. Corporate responsibility challenges and measures The wind farms are located in a sparsely populated area with large forests in a mountainous landscape. Within the farms there are several natural and culture values that have been taken into account when developing the layout of the roads, turbines and power lines. During the construction phase both Statkraft and the supervisory authorities conduct regular visits and audits to ensure that the contractor implements the project in line with applicable licence requirements. The people living close to the construction areas will be affected both from the construction activities and from the transportation of materials. In order to ensure that the affected people are well informed of ongoing activities Statkraft distributes information letters, holds public meetings at the site and distributes notices through local community information channels. The project also has its own website, which is used actively to provide information. During the winter periods two sami villages, Jijnjevaerie and Ohredahke, use the forest areas for winter grazing for their reindeer. There is an ongoing process between the construction and operations activities and the sami villages on how to minimize the impacts on the villages. Statkraft reported to the National Contact Point for OECD guidelines In 2012, a complaint was filed against Statkraft to the Norwegian and the Swedish National Contact Points (NCPs) regarding compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Jijnjevaerie sami village claims it has not been sufficiently consulted on the parts of the project that affect the reindeer herding of the village, and that Statkraft is therefore in violation of the Wind power development in northern Sweden. Together, principles in the guidelines. The sami village has therefore requested the NCPs to facilitate a Björkhöjden and Ögonfägnaden will consist of 123 turbines dialogue with Statkraft. A mediation process commenced in early 2014. (90 and 33 respectively). Cheves Hydropower Project In 2011, SN Power started construction of Cheves hydropower plant (Cheves HPP) – Hydropower in Peru in Peru, the company’s ninth hydropower plant in Peru. With a total output of 168 MW, Cheves HPP will be SN Power’s largest hydropower plant in Peru and will have an annual maximum delivery of 838 GWh. ➔➔ Ownership: SN Power 100% ➔➔ Capacity: 168 MW ➔➔ Development phase: Under construction, scheduled to start operation 2015 Up to 1200 people will be working on the plant during the construction period. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 152 Corporate responsibility challenges and measures During the first years of development, the aim was to establish a positive relationship with the main stakeholders, getting to know them and becoming familiar with their activities. An office for public affairs was established, and workshops with communities and local government were implemented. In 2013, priorities in relation to corporate responsibility were related to anticipation and mitigation of social and environmental risks and at the same time contributing to the development of the communities, through the construction of an irrigation channel, a reservoir Project development in Cheves for agriculture, and a nursery that will improve the agricultural production. As regards infrastructure, 2013 was a year in which the expected progress for the civil, electro­ mechanical, hydro mechanical and transmission lines contracts were exceeded. One of the most important milestones was the culmination of the excavation of the powerhouse in May. Devoll Hydropower Project The Devoll Hydropower Project (Devoll HPP) in Albania consists of a cascade of hydropower plants along the Devoll River with a potential installed capacity of 243 – Hydropower in Albania MW and production is estimated to 729 GWh/year. Following the acquisition of shares of EVN in 2013, Statkraft has become 100% owner of Devoll Hydropower ShA. ➔➔ Ownership: Statkraft 100% ➔➔ Capacity: 243 MW ➔➔ Development phase: Under construction Corporate responsibility challenges and measures The Devoll HPP currently has a team of approximately 30 on-site employees involved in managing social and environmental affairs. The project developed and finalized the Environmental and Social Management Plan in 2013. Developments are well under way at the Devoll Hydropower The Plan comprises all social and environmental mitigation measures and provides a general Project in Albania. The photo shows construction work at the Banjë reservoir with access roads. framework for resettlement, livelihood restoration, social development and environmental management and monitoring. The main social impacts relate to the loss of agricultural and horticultural land and the loss of livelihood associated with this impact. The project carried out a variety of initiatives in 2013 to compensate for these anticipated losses. One such initiative was the introduction of agricultural demonstration farms. Based on thorough mapping and analysis of both production and market suitability, watermelon, melon and sage were selected to be grown at the demonstration farms accompanied by consultations on productive agricultural techniques and know-how. Work to improve irrigation systems in impacted villages has also been initiated. The objective of the initiative was to demonstrate alternative and well suited crops as well as efficient production methods, with the goal of Improved systems for waste management is a central part of the on-going work. creating more sustainable livelihoods for the impacted households. Work was started in 2013 but will demand comprehensive and consistent efforts from the project. The main environmental impacts of the Devoll HPP pertain to the changes in the hydrological regime of the Devoll River. Water quality, currently being monitored on a regular basis, will be in focus for the environmental mitigation efforts going forward, including improved waste management and sewage treatment for Gramsh town at the end of the Banjë reservoir. Nursing and harvesting watermelons from the demonstration farms CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 153 Employees and Statkraft is an attractive employer, and surveys show that our employees are among the most highly motivated in the industry. We work intently to organisation maintain this position in the future. Organisation and Clear leadership, a positive working environment conducive to professional management development and expertise development are strategically important areas in Statkraft. Statkraft has its own corporate programmes for manager development. Leadership in Statkraft (LIS) is a basic course, while NEXT and Expand are aimed at experienced managers. In 2013, 53 managers participated in the Group’s management programmes, 25 in LIS, 14 in NEXT and 14 in Expand. The programmes are undergoing continuous development and adaptation to new challenges, not least those created by the Group’s international growth. Statkraft also has its own training programme for project managers, and 140 employees participated in these programmes in 2013. Expertise development is followed up through appraisal interviews, and employees are, in addition to courses and further education, encouraged to seek internal rotation. Employee survey A joint annual employee survey is held in Statkraft, Skagerak Energi and SN Power, where all employees are asked to evaluate the Group’s organisation and management. The survey covered topics such as leadership, cooperation, working conditions, ethics and corporate responsibility and personal development. The purpose of the survey was to compare ourselves with other companies in the industry and make Statkraft a better place to work. As in previous years, the results of the 2013 survey were very good. As regards the indicator “Job satisfaction”, Statkraft’s score was 73, well above the Norwegian industry index (69). Cooperation with trade unions Statkraft aims for a close and structured cooperation with all represented trade unions. In addition to national cooperation with trade unions, Statkraft has established a European works council (Statkraft European Works Council, SEWC), with employee representatives from Norway, Sweden, Germany and the UK. SEWC is an important cooperation forum for coordinating and implementing principles and guidelines as regards labour issues and labour rights in Statkraft. Examples of topics discussed in SEWC in 2013 include the work on the Group’s strategy plan and the market situation for gas power in Europe. The Group recognises the ILO Convention on labour rights and relevant EU directives have been included in the SEWC agreement with EPSU (European Federation of Public Service Unions), the federation for European unions within the energy industry. Statkraft’s employees At the end of 2013, Statkraft had 3734 employees, and 34% of them worked outside Norway.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 155 Human rights Statkraft is active in parts of the world where follow-up of human rights can be challenged, either directly through our own operations or indirectly through the company’s supply chain. This is something the Group takes seriously. Our position Statkraft actively promotes respect for human rights. Our duty to actively promote respect for human rights and labour rights is clearly described in Statkraft’s code of conduct and in Statkraft’s supplier code of conduct. Follow-up of human rights is addressed several times in the company’s management system, and systematic efforts are made to standardise requirements for follow-up of human rights in Statkraft’s contracts. New human rights steering document In order to strengthen the follow-up of human rights, Statkraft prepared a steering document in 2013, based on the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Further initiatives to support the implementation will be carried out in 2014. Ongoing dispute concerning development of wind power in Sweden In 2012, a complaint was lodged against Statkraft before the OECD’s Norwegian and Swedish contact points for multinational companies in connection with the development of wind power in Jämtland and Västernorrland counties in Sweden. Statkraft owns 60% of the company building the wind farm Statkraft SCA Vind AB. Jijnjevaerie Sami Village claims it has not been sufficiently consulted on the parts of the project that affect the reindeer herding of the village, and that Statkraft is therefore in violation of the principles in the guidelines. The Sami Village has therefore requested that the contact points facilitate a dialogue with Statkraft. Swedish courts have approved the project and project execution, including the consultations with parties affected by the project, which have been ongoing since 2007. In 2014, the contact points have offered to facilitate a dialogue between Jijnjevaerie Sami Village and Statkraft. Statkraft will follow the recommendations from the contact points and continue the dialogue with Jijnevaerie Sami Village. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2012 156 Corporate Statkraft’s corporate responsibility statement presents the results for health, safety and environment, employees, ethics and contributions to responsibility society. statement Scope of statement Statkraft reports relevant topics associated with corporate responsibility regularly. The reporting mainly follows the Group’s accounting principles for treatment of subsidiaries, partly-owned power plants and associated companies. This means that data are collected from all companies where Statkraft is the majority owner and included in the statement in their entirety. However, data relating to health and safety are collected from all companies where Statkraft owns 20% or more. The presented data should cover the entire Group, but this has not been possible for some indicators. Where this is the case, the issue is explained in the associated note in the accounts. The notes also clarify some terms, explain major changes and describe any changes in calculation methods.

Since 2002, Statkraft has issued systematic information in its annual report about strategy and performance in connection with corporate responsibility. From 2004, the reporting has been based on GRI’s guidelines and from 2010, on GRI’s guidelines prepared specifically for the energy industry. About GRI GRI develops industry-adapted guidelines for corporate reporting of sustainability and corporate responsibility. The guidelines define both reporting principles and general and industry-specific indicators. GRI develops reporting tools Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an independent organisation which, since it was established in 1997, has worked to create a more standardised format for corporate responsibility and sustainability reporting. The most recent main version of GRI’s sustainability reporting guidelines (G4) was published in 2013, but the last version (G3) can also be used in a transitional period (up to 1 January 2016). In 2009, the guidelines prepared especially for the energy industry (Electric Utilities Sector Supplement) were approved. GRI G3 defines ten reporting principles. Four of these deal with establishing the scope and content of the report, while the other six address the quality of the information presented. GRI G3 covers both general and industry-specific indicators, divided between core and supplementary indicators, for enterprise profile, economy, environment, working conditions, human rights, corporate citizenship and product responsibility. For all areas, companies must describe the governance and follow-up mechanisms that have been implemented. Different reporting levels GRI G 3 has three corporate reporting levels – A, B and C – where A is the highest level. In addition, the reporting level is marked with a ”+” if the reporting has been verified by an external third party. Statkraft’s GRI Index Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting is based on guidance and recommendations given in the GRI’s Energy Utilities Sector Supplement. Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting has been verified by an external auditor. The auditor’s conclusion is presented in the Auditor’s report: “Statkraft applies a reporting practice for its corporate responsibility reporting aligned with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (version 3.1) reporting principles and the reporting fulfills application level B+ according to the GRI guidelines.” Explanations Reported = The indicator is reported. Partly reported = The indicator is reported partly. Missing = The indicator is not reported. Not material = The indicator has been considered as not material at the Group level. * = Additional indicator in GRI’s Energy Utilities Sector Supplement. EU = Indicator numbers starting with EU mean that the indicator is specific for the energy utilities sector.
