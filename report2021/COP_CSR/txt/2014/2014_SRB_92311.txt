Care for the environment, a concept which is an integral at the same time demanding of us, with regards to its requirements part of all our activities, makes us one of the biggest role models of continuous improvement. Nevertheless, we have continued among companies in the region. to follow this trend and, despite the difficult economic situation throughout 2013, were successful in improving our environmental performance. Areas of focus in the continuous improvement of sustainability principles within the field of environmental protection are: For TCK, Sustainable Environmental Management involves systematically organizing appropriate activities, formalized • energy and climate change, through introduced management systems, such as ISO 14001, an • emissions, Environmental Performance Management System, an integrated • conserving resources (water, raw materials), • waste management, Energy and Climate Change • conserving biodiversity. The cement industry is highly energy-demanding, where approximately 90% of the required energy is thermal energy Thermal Energy Use per Fuel Type (%) produced by direct combustion of fuels in cement kilns. Consequently, the cement industry, on a global scale, contributes to the emissions of greenhouse gases at a rate of about 5% of the total Euro Diesel amount emitted. In order to reduce the impact and mitigate adverse 1% climate change, we are dedicated to investing our knowledge and Lignite Coal technological innovations in reducing fuel consumption and energy 12% 11% in the production process. Our long-term concern regarding this Fuel oil matter, which has led to the increase in energy efficiency in the 4% production process, not only mitigates harmful global warming, but may also lead to cost reductions and savings in the exploitation of non-renewable fuels. Therefore, the use of alternative fuels would be conducive to our economic needs, would establish the availability of a secure energy source, and would contribute to the conservation of natural resources which should be preserved for future generations. Pet coke Thermal Energy 72% In 2013, Titan Cementara Kosjerić consumed 885.1 TJ of thermal energy in the production of clinker. This consumption is approximately 26% less than in the previous year (2012), which is in proportion to the reduced quantity of clinker produced in the Electrical Energy same period. All thermal energy was produced from fossil fuels. Rationalization of technological steam and optimizing boiler The total electric energy consumption in 2013 was 36,878,750 kWh operation time in 2013 reduced the consumption of fuel oil by (132.8 TJ), 22% lower than consumption in 2012, due to reduced about 18%, thus achieving energy savings of 7.1 TJ. production volume. 28 Care for the Environment CO2 Emissions In the process of cement production, carbon dioxide (CO2), a gas Within the cement industry, carbon dioxide is released mainly when which contributes to the effects of global warming, is generated. raw meal is transformed into clinker, as well as when fuel is burned In 2006 the TITAN Group adopted a strategy to mitigate climate in the rotary kiln. The measures taken by TCK to reduce emissions are change, and pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, in line as follows: increasing energy efficiency in the production of clinker, with the Kyoto Protocol. Although Serbia has yet to introduce reducing the ratio of clinker in cement and using alternative fuels. regulations on the calculation and reporting of CO2 emissions Total direct emissions of carbon dioxide in 2013 amounted to 0.22 produced, TCK, adhering to WBCSD/CSI (World Business Council million tons and was about 26% less than in 2012, due to reduced for Sustainable Development/Cement Sustainability Initiative) production volume. In the same period, specific direct emissions of Guidelines, calculates direct emissions of CO2 produced by our carbon dioxide per ton of product were 623 kg CO2/tproduct, which is plant and report these findings regularly. 4.1% less than values measured in 2012, due to reduced clinker stock. Alternative Fuels In April 2013, TCK received approval from the Ministry of Energy, Development and Environmental Protection for the Study on assessing the environmental impact of The SRF (Solid Recovered Fuel) Dosing and Utilization Project for combined combustion (co-incineration) with primary fossil fuels in the rotary kiln. The planned project is expected to carry out the substitution of primary fuels, derived from fossils, with solid recovered fuels (SRF), and it is expected that this substitution of primary fuels is achieved to the maximum degree, or in other words 24%. The planned annual consumption of SRF is approximately 25,000 t/y (3 t/h). Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) is mechanically chopped (prepared), solid secondary raw material, unfit for recycling, but suitable for generating energy and is classified as non-hazardous waste. SRF is produced in special plants (located near solid waste landfills), where, after recyclable waste fractions (parts suitable for recycling) are separated – the remaining materials are shredded, dried, stabilized and packaged. SRF consists of combustible components: paper, fabric, light fraction man-made materials, wood, rope, thread, etc., and must meet all the minimum features required by law. In compliance with these standards, the process of co-incineration (incineration with fossil fuels) the following cannot be used: radioactive waste, medicinal and infectious waste, electrical and electronic waste, batteries and accumulators, SRF derived from waste reactive waste, mercury-containing waste, waste of unknown or undetermined composition. Air Emissions Air emissions which originate from cement plants are formed during Total dust emissions in 2013 was 1.05 tons, while specific emissions the combustion of fuel and raw material calcinations process. In this were 4.2 g/tclinker, far less than the 95 g/tclinker set by the TITAN Group. manner, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SO2), and dust are In the same period, total emissions of nitrogen oxides amounted released into the atmosphere. To ensure the proper management to 296.9 tons, a decrease compared to the previous year, which is a of our emissions, we are committed to proper management of result of optimizing the combustion process in the kiln by adjusting production processes, regular maintenance of equipment, as well as the burner. At the same time, specific emissions of NOX, which continuous monitoring of the level of emissions of major emitters. amounted to 1,183.5g/tclinker, were lower than the 1,670 g/tclinker set Periodical measurements, conducted by authorized institutions are by the TITAN Group. performed on our other dust emitters.

The value of this project was nearly half a million euro. With the erection of dry fly ash silos, the Company was able to reduce the effects on the environment, multiple times over. Not only does this progressive concept allow for the removal of an open stockpile (for bauxite), it solves the problem of fly ash as a by-product of thermal power plants because the ash created as waste in the production of electrical energy, is re-used as an additive in cement production. Thus, ash produced by companies that do not have solutions for storing this material, is taken care of. This speaks of the extraordinary environmental usefulness of the project, proving once again that TCK thinks responsibly and in the long-term about national and broader social frameworks. These kinds of initiatives undoubtedly enhance the reputation of the Company, confirming its continued commitment to the highest global standards in all areas of business. The primary advantage of the implementation of this project is the reduction of the use of a natural, non-renewable resource (bauxite) in the production process, and the focus on alternative raw materials. The realization of this project reduced the cost of raw meal, increasing the Company’s competitiveness in the cement manufacturing market. The production process in the actual plant was upgraded due to modernization in the way additives are transported to the raw materials mill, moving from conveyor belt transporters to pneumatic transporters, which also contributes to energy savings in parts of the process. Water It is a known fact that cement plants are relatively low industrial River and the broader environment, we have set high standards consumers of water and analysis show that in the cement – concrete in implementing a Water Protection System. This means that all – aggregates chain, approximately 1% of the world’s industrial our waste water, drainage and storm water is first treated to the water is consumed, or 0.2% of the total amount of water consumed required standards and only then is it discharged into the Skrapež globally. Nevertheless, we are committed to reducing our impact River. River water samples are regularly monitored, as is the quality on water resources, which is in line with Sustainable Development of the treated waste water. Reports and analyses show that all of and the need to optimize production. the regulation requirements concerning the discharge of waste water into the river are met. TCK uses water from the utility water supply system as drinking and sanitary water, whereas water used for industrial purposes is In 2013, 597,684.4 m3 of water was drained for the needs of our drained from the Skrapež River. In the production process, water production process, of which 581,764.4 m3 was taken from the is used exclusively as a cooling medium (cooling materials, gases, Skrapež River, while 15,920 m3 came from the utility water supply equipment) and to wash transportation routes (access roads), system. After the waste water treatment process, 516,290.4 m3 of therefore waste water is not a by-product of our production process. water was discharged into the Skrapež River. With the intention of protecting the natural course of the Skrapež Care for the Environment 31 Recirculation of Industrial Water System In 2013, a project was implemented that allows for the recirculation of industrial water at our plant. The investment amounted to approximately EUR 130,000. Until recently, the majority of drained water, (cca 90%) used by TCK as a coolant, was treated and discharged into the Skrapež River. With the implementation of this new recirculation system, after the wastewater treatment process, water is pumped back into our industrial water supply system. This allows for fresh water savings of up to 90%, since with this kind of system in place, the amount of water needed from the Skrapež is to cover evaporation and water consumed for core activities. Furthermore, production processes are no longer reliant on the water level of the Skrapež River during the dry season, due to this system. The company has shown its dedication to performance development within the field of Sustainable Water Management through investments made in a water recirculation system and wastewater treatment system. Waste Management Waste Management involves a set of multiple activities, decision Regulation on the Plan to Reduce Packaging Waste (”National making processes and measures all aimed at the prevention of waste Objectives”) to the authorized operator by contract, TCK has production, reducing its volume and/or its harmful effects on the exercised its right to implement this feature and according to environment. In the process of producing clinker and cement there reports submitted, the specified national targets for packaging are no waste by-products produced. Waste is created solely as a waste management in 2013 have been met. result of plant maintenance procedures and as such is submitted to authorized collectors and operators for further treatment. In In 2013, we delivered a total of 1,181 tons of packaging within the 2013, TCK generated 166.58 tons of waste. The total extent of Serbian market, as follows: non-hazardous waste (scrap metal, waste paper, palettes, waste • paper packaging – 271 tons foil) accounted for 159.24 tons, while the amount of hazardous • plastic containers – 30 tons waste (waste oils and greases, accumulators, light bulbs) was 7.34 • wooden packaging – 880 tons tons. All waste produced is delivered to authorized operators for further treatment. Taking into consideration that TCK delivers a The municipal waste is also generated but not weighed, therefore packaged product – cement, within the Serbian market, we are it has not been presented in this Report.
