Since 2012/13 Coloplast's US sites have been included in the reported data. All figures are annual averages based on quarterly figures. No/low – no or low degree of repetitive work. Medium – repetitive work with 0-2 aggregating factors, High – repetitive work with 3-4 aggregating factors. Very high – repetitive work with 5 or more aggregating factors. 7) Note that Coloplast conducts this survey biannually. 8) Calculation is based on white-collars only. Personal development plans for blue-collars are run locally and in local systems. 9) This year, Coloplast has implemented a new performance management system to support the Performance Development Plans of white collars globally.

Elise Sørensen is a nurse. Her sister Thora has just had an ostomy operation and is afraid to go out, fearing that her stoma might leak in public. Listening to her sister’s problems, Elise creates the world’s first adhesive ostomy bag. A bag that does not leak, giving Thora – and thousands of people like her – the chance to return to their normal life. A simple solution with great significance. Today, our business includes ostomy care, urology and continence care and wound and skin care. But our way of doing business still follows Elise’s example: we listen, we learn and we respond with products and services that make life easier for people with intimate healthcare needs. Coloplast develops products and services that make life easier for people with very personal and private medical conditions. Working closely with the people Coloplast A/S who use our products, we create solutions that are sensitive to their special needs. We call this intimate healthcare. Our business includes ostomy care, Holtedam 1 urology and continence care and wound and skin care. We operate globally and employ more than 9,000 people. 3050 Humlebæk Denmark The Coloplast logo is a registered trademark of Coloplast A/S. © 2014-11.
