For economic growth to pick up, following the 18 month hiatus from the end of the first assembly, businesses are still awaiting for the timely adoption of a full budget and political stability. Despite a rather stagnant economic situation in the country, Lotus Holdings have been able to continue to drive important long-term issues.

We firmly believe these principles will propel businesses to achieve sustainable success, create an appetite for change and a commitment to constant renewal in all that they do.

At inception, LH’s aim was to provide incubation and support to its sister companies to promote responsible and ethical business practices. LH ensures outstanding quality of the products and services of its sister companies while ensuring sound working environment for all its employees. Realizing the immense opportunity in the fast growing sector, LH has brought forward venture investment. LH believes this form of investment in small scale industries would be beneficial for entrepreneurial development. The basic modality is to create an investment fund from interested shareholders. LH will ensure proper management of the investments through well defined reporting and consultative meeting structures. Core Values 1. Capacity Building 2. Institutionalization of companies 3. Professionalism 4. Transparency 5. Social accountability 6. Information dissemination Initiative Lotus Holdings (LH) with a diversified investment portfolio is also an incubation specialist. LH is involved with entrepreneurs/ producers who have difficulty in their area of business and has inclination towards the concept of CSR. It is the philosophy of LH to be the backstopping instrument to such people/organizations by helping them in their revival and restructuring, or opening new companies if necessary, and also providing investment where required. Lotus Holdings looks forward to maintain its growth strategy to accelerate its current development rate.

Health Insurance: All LH staff are insured with up to NRs. 50,000 per year for Out Patient Services; NRs. 10,000 per year for medicine services and NRs. 100,000 per year for hospitalization service. Hygienic Canteen: A subsidized canteen at company premises provides healthy food and drinks. • Provident Fund for permanent employees. • 10 per cent of company’s net profit goes to employees as bonus. • Allowance for Dashain, Nepal’s biggest festival. • Flexible leave facility on par with Nepal’s Labour Act. • Maintained salary structure as per staff’s qualification and dedication. • Provided consultancy service to Hoste Hainse, NGO working to eliminate child labour through education. Challenges The instability of the government and the failure to draft the new constitution after the end of the monarchy has been causing a general slowdown in Nepal’s economy. The challenge is increased by the ever growing double digit inflation and the global economic crisis that has significantly decreased export sales throughout the country. With such problems, increase in CSR activities have been limited, but Lotus Holdings has not decreased its ongoing CSR activities to cut costs. Impacts and Benefits Due to the initiatives undertaken by the organization, it is now a more responsible organization geared towards not only raising its productivity but also contributing to the society through local Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Staff morale has heightened and the company’s productivity has increased. The image of the company, a leader in adopting CSR in the country, has improved noticeably. Future Plan The organization will continue to raise awareness, enhance skills and knowledge of its employees. Our previous strategy to establish an investment fund has been realized. Lotus Holdings is now even aggressively looking for opportunities to explore into new sectors to invest. Pursuing a dream of a self-reliant, socially and economically developed society, Lotus Holdings believes in business with ethics. This has been the driving force behind the company and as it continues to grow into this millennium, it will remain in the business of helping people achieve these dreams.
