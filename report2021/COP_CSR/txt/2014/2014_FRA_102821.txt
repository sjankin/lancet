Trust in products and technology cannot be achieved without trust in the company that is providing them. OT knows the importance of trust to its stakeholders, in every interaction, product and service and we recognize that our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) work is crucial to building and sustaining this trust. From our transparent and open relationships, to the highest levels of quality, security and environmental protection, and delivering products and services that benefit society, we are enacting CSR right across our business. GUIDING PRINCIPLES In 2006, OT reinforced its corporate responsibility activities by becoming a signatory to the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, the world’s largest voluntary corporate citizenship initiative, embracing and enacting a set of core values in respect of human rights, labour practices, anti-corruption and the environment. Our participation in the UN Global Compact guides our evolving sustainability agenda and focuses our efforts on achieving harmony between the financial, environmental and social factors that affect us. FULFILLING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS In our countries and regions of operation we comply with all applicable environmental legislation. Our skilled network of environmental managers, alongside our Global Environmental Policy bring about a coherent worldwide approach and help us to meet the obligations of complex, cross-country regulations such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), Reduction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). In addition to compliance with legislation that directly impacts our organization we are dedicated to helping our customers to achieve the legal compliance applicable to their organizations, wherever they are in the world. In 2013 we consolidated our actions on the ethical sourcing of minerals, publishing an official statement on conflict minerals, updating our Supplier Code of Conduct to include a clause on mineral sourcing and working closely with mineral suppliers to identify the chain of custody of the gold in our products. To date, all concerned suppliers have declared their mineral sourcing to be ‘conflict free’, and we continue to work on this important subject. MONITORING PARTNERS Choosing partners that share our high ethical standards is important to us and to our customers. That’s why, during 2013, we launched our annual supplier CSR assessment, scrutinizing our suppliers’ policies and practices. This yearly exercise will form a vital part of our key supplier assessment process, provides valuable opportunities to influence those less advanced in terms of CSR, and allows us to learn from the best practice of others at the forefront of the CSR field. 4 OCTOBER 2, 2014 OT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013 CSR MANAGEMENT The continuation of our certified management systems in quality, environment, energy, security and health and safety helps us achieve our sustainability goals and provides the opportunity to identify areas for improvement. In 2013 we initiated a social responsibility project based on ISO26000 guidelines for business, through which we are analyzing our sustainability practices, assessing the relevance of our key actions and benchmarking against best practices of our industry peers in order to continually improve our corporate responsibility performance. Our CSR taskforce, chaired by the Company’s VP Purchasing and Corporate Social Responsibility Director, continues to meet at minimum twice yearly to track progress towards goals, review ongoing sustainability initiatives and validate that CSR at OT remains relevant and aligned with the Company’s strategy. This report highlights the CSR developments at OT during 2013 and the plans we have for the year ahead. Didier Lamouche President & CEO “At OT we believe that corporate responsibility paves the way for business success and we understand its intrinsic value in strengthening our relationships, protecting our reputation, rewarding our employees, and reducing costs.” OCTOBER 2, 2014 OT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013 5 COMPANY INFORMATION OT is a world leader in digital security solutions for the mobility space.

In November 2013, OT presented its new brand positioning The M Company , reflecting its new ambition: to become a world leader in digital security solutions for the mobility space. In the same month, OT signed a strategic technology and business partnership with First Data, a global leader in electronic commerce and payment processing to manage and promote the migration to chip cards in the United States. In France, OT was selected by the National Printing Group to equip 100% of new electronic driving licenses. OT provides the embedded operating system in each driving license. Based on OT’s specific technology, this high-quality solution – the digital heart of the new French license – is only readable by law enforcement. Innovation has always been at the heart of the culture of OT: for proof, the company introduced two major innovations in 2013: Lasink ™ and MultiSIM: • Lasink™ is a patented technology to generate a laser engraved color photo on a polycarbonate card. Its aim is to provide governments with a unique and innovative solution for securing all identity documents to prevent fraud and identity theft. • MultiSIM is the first all-in-one SIM card with the classic plug-ins (2FF), micro (3FF) and nano (4FF). The MultiSIM combines all form factors in a single card, easy to use. This is a significant move in the Telecom market because it significantly improves the practicality of the SIM card. In practice, this means that the same SIM card, regardless of its size, can be used in all mobile phones. In 2013, OT was ranked number one in contactless smart cards market by ABI Research and it has been selected by the Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi to provide PEARL, its embedded secure element to enable Chinese consumers to pay with their mobile phones. OT’s embedded secure element was certified the same year by MasterCard and Google Wallet. On the Identity market, OT successfully delivered in 2013 an end-to-end ePassport solution in Uzbekistan, including citizen enrolment, e-passport personalization, document verification, border control and authentication. The company signed a contract with the Mexican Government to supply a high-tech identity document solution through a complete solution for state-of-the-art personalization, combining a high-level secure component and dedicated technical equipment. It also delivered a turnkey eGovernment solution to the Swedish Tax Agency. In the Telecom sector, OT provided AIS in Thailand, with MIFARE DESFire™ technology, embedded in new generation NFC SIM cards for public transportation, to enable a mobile phone to be used as an e-purse to pay for public transportation and goods. In 2013, OT joined the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance to enhance end-users’ online experience through the promotion of end-to-end, universal authentication framework and has been appointed to the Board of Directors. Finally, at the same time, the management team has been significantly changed in a number of key business functions, with the arrival of new executives and managers, all benefiting from extensive experience in international groups.
