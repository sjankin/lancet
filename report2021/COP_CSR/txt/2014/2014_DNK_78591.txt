At the same time, we are continuously assessing and improving the environmental impacts of our op erations. In the past year we have taken a number of steps to strengthen our CSR and further integrate CSR into our processes. We wish to highlight the following key areas in which we have continued to make significant progress. Tommy G. Jespersen CEO I N THE PA S T Y E A R : HUMAN RIGHTS In the past year we have continued to conduct risk assessments of our suppliers in regards to compliance with our Code of Conduct. We have fur ther integrated CSR measures and our Code of Conduct in screening and assessing new suppliers. ENVIRONMENT In the past year we have continued our work with product develop ment that contributes to the optimisation of renewable energy. We have reduced our heat and energy consumption, increased recy clable waste and set new targets. EMPLOYEES In the past year we continued our work to promote health and safety in the workplace. We have increased reporting of “near misses” and introduced initiatives to create a “culture of safety” based on prevention. OUR CONTINUOUS FOCUS ON SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability has been on our agenda for many years. With the signing of the UN Global Compact in 2010 we have been striving to address the ten prin ciples and integrate CSR efforts in our processes and daily work. In 2011 we issued our first communication on prog ress and in order to keep a constant focus on our CSR activities, we introduced the CSR cycle to our organization in 2012. We introduced the CSR cycle to continuously follow plans and processes as well as the progress of our CSR efforts. The flow of the CSR cycle constitutes our annual efforts and serves as an evaluation of action plans as well as target setting. Besides being a planning tool, the purpose of the CSR cycle is to keep all employees informed about our activities and progress within the areas of CSR.

We are committed to the protection of human rights and have made a formal commitment by signing the UN Global Compact. We support the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We recognise that we will have to continuously work to make sure that we have the right measures and assessment in place when it comes to ensuring re spect for human rights in our operations. We realise that it requires continuous training and integration of our processes to achieve implementation. For that reason we focus first of all on our employees and our suppliers. HUMAN RI G H T S We encourage our suppliers to respect their em ployees’ human rights and provide them with decent kk-elec t roni c a c k n o w l e d g e s th e working conditions. We require that our suppliers i n c reas ingly i m p o r t a n c e o f h u sign our Code of Conduct. To ensure our standards will be met we have made a risk assessment of our man right s i n t o d a y ’s s o c i e t y suppliers in regards to compliance with our Code HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVITIES of Conduct.

To ensure compliance of the Code of Conduct these suppliers will be asked to do an assessment and we will conduct an on-site audit. We will also focus on integrating CSR into supplier assess ment and supplier selection tools. If there are conditions, which do not meet our require ments, the supplier must draw up a plan for cor rective actions in dialogue with our supplier audit team. The plan will be combined with a follow-up visit to check whether conditions have improved in the same way as we ensure our own product quality. Our aim is to continue to detect and prevent human rights risks in our operations and seek conformity with our Code of Conduct.

Our production facilities are certified accord ing to the international environmental standard ISO14001. This ensures systematic organisation and documentation of internal environmental pro cedures. We measure and monitor environmental indicators such as waste and energy consumption. To further strengthen our focus on environmental indicators we have set targets and measurement standards for all our production facilities. For wind to be a viable alternative to traditional ENVIRONMENT fossil fuels it has to become more competitive. At kk-electronic we contribute to advancing the wind industry by continuously improving our products. In the past year we have continued our work with product development that can contribute to the optimisation of renewable energy. We are also working in partnership to extend the lifetime expectancies of wind turbines. In 2013 we implemented heat recycling and have reduced our heating and electricity consumption by 3%. We have exceeded our target of 70% recy cling for 2013/2014 with a result of more than 76%. In 2013 we also improved our introduction process for new employees to include more information about our environmental practices and behaviors. efforts to fulfil our strategy in an ever changing environment where rapid growth, technology development, competition and internationalisation are both continual challenges and opportunities We are committed to high health and safety standards in the workplace. In the past year we have maintained the OHSAS 18001 certification (Occupational Health and Safety Management System) that we obtained in November 2012. This certification ensures our commitment to continuous implementation and improvement of the way we manage our health and safety systems. EMPLOYEES IMPLEMENTING OHSAS 18001 LEARNINGS FROM 2012 At kk-electronic we are convinced that each and every In 2013, we built on our learning s from the OHSAS 18001 certification process that we went through in employee is essential to our 2012. The certification process revealed that the success. It is our employees vast majority of our efforts and targets already met who make the difference in our with environmental and occupational standards. EMPLOYEES We identified the biggest improvement we could make was building even more awareness of safety and accident prevention among our employees. In 2013 we worked to further develop and integrate a strong “safety awareness” culture amongst our em ployees. Among other initiatives we have improved our introduction process for new employees to include more information about safety in the working environment. In 2013 we increased our focus on accident preven tion and reporting on near misses. We now have the practice of interviewing technicians after external work to identify and anticipate potential hazards so that they can be prevented. We are looking into methods to make this as easy as possible, one potential method is a mobile phone platform for technicians to input information related to accident prevention. In 2013, we identified Service aspect of our busi ness as the area with the most potential dangers. We responded to this by reorganising the Working Environment Organisation (our internal safety orga nization) so that the Service department has greater focus and representation. EMPLOYEES In 2013 we received a Kronesmiley from the Dan ish Working Environment Authority. This recognition means that the company has made an extraordinary effort to ensure high safety standards. We created a new Driving Policy to increase aware ness on safety. Company cars have been changed to newer safer cars and some employees have partici pated in a course for driving on slippery roads. In 2013 all employees were offered influenza vac cine paid for by the company. Alcohol based hand sanitizers have been installed in all toilets. An occupational therapy review of working processes in our production facilities has taken place. For the coming year, we will focus on achieving zero accidents throughout the whole company and achieving a maximum of 3% absence on a company level .
