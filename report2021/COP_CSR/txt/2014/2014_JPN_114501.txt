Progress with Medium-Term Business Plan ’12 (1) Changes in the business environment Launched in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, our medium-term plan was formulated with several assumptions. These included a sluggish Japanese economy, contraction of the domestic construction market, and a subsequent increase in the intensity of competition for receiving orders. As a result, the policy we enacted was to continue to enhance the profitability of the domestic construction and real estate businesses, our core fields, and to diversify our earnings base through growth in the overseas business and new businesses. The environment surrounding the construction industry, ­however, has changed dramatically since the medium-term plan was formulated. The economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (“Abenomics”), coupled with infrastructure development in the Tokyo metropolitan area ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Net sales increased 11.4% from the previous fiscal year to Olympic and Paralympic Games, are pushing construction ¥1,612.7 billion, reflecting firm growth in orders received in the demand higher than seen in recent years.

Examples of this include growth in the real estate business, expansion in business scope through M&As overseas, and ongoing progress in renewable energy businesses. The measures outlined in the medium-term plan have thus been successful to some extent. While construction demand in Japan today has risen to levels not seen in recent years, there remains little prospect for any substantial increase in construction demand over the medium to long term. Led by a commitment to realizing further growth in our core fields and diversifying our earnings base, we will strive for a swift recovery in profitability of our domestic construction business, while moving to diversify our earnings base over the Net sales are projected to increase 5.4% from the previous medium to long term. fiscal year to ¥1,700.0 billion.

The project will construct a pair of high-rise towers located within the Yamanote Line loop. One building will be a 37-story office and condominium tower with a multipurpose hall, while the other will be a 26-story seismically-isolated condominium tower with commercial facilities and a public plaza. The condominium tower will be completed first in December 2014, while the office and condominium tower will be completed in March 2016.

In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, a cumulative total of 4,600 tablets had been provided, a 50% increase from the previous fiscal year. The tablets contain lots of information needed for on-site management, such as blueprints and specification sheets. Other important data can be downloaded from cloud-based servers, enabling speedy confirmations. We have promoted these small, lightweight tablets with portability convenient for on-site engineers as their tool for enhancing construction quality and management efficiency. Development of a Camera with a Built-In Clapperboard Traditionally, on-site engineers used clapperboards when photographing construction in progress to keep records of items like the area worked on, time, date and state of the work. The drawback to these clapperboards was that they were time consuming. As a solution, we developed a camera with a built-in electronic clapperboard. This has enabled our on-site engineers to work more efficiently, because they can now use tablets to fill out clapperboards when taking photographic records of their work.

To address such needs, when we built the Grand Mall and Pet Mall buildings for AEON MALL Makuhari New City, we incorporated a variety of environmental technologies for resource conservation. These included a solar power generation facility with a total rated output of 1,000 kilowatts to harness renewable energy, full LED lighting, energy conservation through the cascading use of water generated by the cogenAEON MALL Makuhari New City eration system and air conditioning facilities in stages, and the effective use of recycled wastewater and rainwater. As a result, the buildings received the S (excellent) rating under the Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE®). The buildings are also on the way to becoming the first in Japan to receive LEED* certification as a large-scale commercial facility with world-class environmental performance (under preliminary review for certification as of May 2014). * LEED: Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design.

Create a Recycling-Oriented Society Disaster Debris Disposal Operations Obayashi took part in the waste disposal of approximately 940,000 tons of disaster debris and tsunami sediment from Watari district, Miyagi Prefecture and other areas affected by the Great East Japan ­Earthquake*1. The debris was thoroughly sorted and useful materials were recycled for use in earthquake reconstruction projects. At the same time, disaster debris that normally cannot be recycled, was solidified in cement to create Upcycle Blocks*2 for recycling as construction material. We plan to make effective use of the Upcycle Blocks as embankment material in constructing land for parks and green spaces, as well as elevated evacuation sites. Thanks to these efforts, we have achieved a compacting rate of 98% from the resource recycling and incineration in our disposal operations. *1 Joint venture comprised of Obayashi Corporation, Toda Corporation, Konoike Construction Co., Ltd., Toyo Construction Co., Ltd., Hashimototen Co., Ltd., Fukamatsu-Gumi Co., Ltd., and Haruyama Construction Co., Ltd. *2 Joint development between Advanced Construction Technology Center (ACTEC), Obayashi Corporation, Kajima Corporation, Kumagai Gumi Co., Ltd., Shimizu Corporation, and Taisei Corporation Obayashi took charge of all aspects of the incinerators (five Upcycle Blocks stockpiled for use in earthquake reconstrucfacilities) from construction to dismantling after completion of tion projects the waste disposal 39 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2014 To Contents p03–06 p07–12 p13–32 p33–46 p47–52 p53–99 About Obayashi Management Policy Business Overview Together with Corporate Governance Corporate Data Corporation Stakeholders Create a Society in Harmony with Nature P  rotect Precious Living Organisms Obayashi is currently constructing a segment of the Shin-Meishin Expressway in Kuwana City, Mie ­Prefecture, where the planned construction site has been confirmed as a A water scorpion habitat of an indigenous (nepa hoffmanni) species of water scorpion Transplanting activity (nepa hoffmanni). This aquatic insect is a natural monument of Kuwana City, and has been designated as an endangered species in the Red Data Book of Mie Prefecture. The water scorpions are about 2 centimeters (a little less than an inch) in size, and require swamplands fed with pristine spring water to survive. In proceeding with construction in and around the habitat, we cooperate closely with the client, as well as the boards of conservation and education of Kuwana City, to protect the swamplands by making certain that the supply of water from upstream is uninterrupted. Furthermore, in situations where the planned construction site overlaps with the habitat, we have temporarily transplanted the habitat away from the construction area. TOPICS Smart City Construction Business development at Obayashi involves the accumulation of advanced ­technologies and ingenuity. At the Obayashi Technical Research Institute, we have introduced micro combined heat and power equipment, storage batteries, and other facilities to make more effective use of solar power equipment and exhaust heat from power generators. We are in the process of constructing and testing a Smart Energy System that combines these facilities with energy management systems that can optimize real-time control of energy and make precise demand forecasts using big data. In testing, we are utilizing Demand Navi*1 software to encourage voluntarily power conservation by employees in the building to promote energy management activities. *1 Demand Navi: a software program for computing power load changes and demand forecasts for the next day and beyond in offices and other business establishments.

The two parties also cooperate to raise the effectiveness of audits by sharing information and opinions. Meanwhile, as Obayashi’s internal audit arm, the Business Administration Department is responsible for audits conducted separately from the corporate auditors and independent auditor. Performed according to Obayashi’s Internal Audit Regulations, these audits monitor the effectiveness of internal control and the execution of duties by each department within the Company. The corporate auditors and Business Administration Department cooperate as well to raise the effectiveness of audits by sharing information and opinions. Policies for Determining Remuneration for Directors, Corporate Auditors and the Independent Auditor The basic policy with regards to director remuneration is to determine the amount of remuneration for each business term in accordance with actual contribution to earnings, in order to secure outstanding human resources and to provide incentive to each director to improve earnings and enhance corporate value. Specifically, the Board of Directors has set a remuneration table in accordance with title and earnings contribution ranking, and at the end of each business term, the Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by the president and comprises members delegated by the committee chairperson, appraises the degree of earnings contribution of individual directors and determines the amount of remuneration for the following fiscal year. The basic policy with regards to the remuneration of the corporate auditors is to set an amount required to secure outstanding human resources in order to have corporate governance function effectively. Specifically, remuneration standards are set up in advance in accordance with full-time and parttime status, etc., through discussions among corporate auditors, and remuneration for each corporate auditor is determined in line with those standards. With regards to remuneration of the independent auditor, the auditing structure and auditing time required for an appropriate accounting audit is discussed with the auditing firm, taking into account the Obayashi Group’s business size, business characteristics, etc., and a fair auditing ­remuneration amount is determined with the approval of the Audit Committee.

Further details Financial Statements http://www.obayashi.co.jp/english/ir/financial_statements/ To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2014 62 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements OBAYASHI CORPORATION For the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the accounts maintained by OBAYASHI CORPORATION (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Companies”) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan. Certain amounts in the prior year’s financial statements were reclassified to conform to the changes made for the latest fiscal year. 2. U.S. Dollar Amounts The accounts of the consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen by rounding down to the nearest million. The U.S. dollar amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto were translated from the original Japanese yen into U.S. dollars on the basis of ¥102.92 to US$1, the rate of exchange prevailing at March 31, 2014, and were then rounded down to the nearest thousand. The approximate rate of exchange prevailing at May 31, 2014 was ¥101.66=U.S.$1. These U.S. dollar amounts are not intended to imply that the Japanese yen amounts have been or could be converted, realized or settled in U.S. dollars at this or any other rate. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (1) Scope of consolidation and application of the equity method The Company had 85 subsidiaries at March 31, 2014. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 included the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Investments in all affiliates (27 ­companies for 2014) are accounted for by the equity method. (2) Business year for consolidated subsidiaries Certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries (31 companies) and a domestic consolidated subsidiary (1 company) have a fiscal year that ends on December 31. Certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries (5 companies) have a fiscal year that ends on February 28. The consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the financial statements as of the same date or provisional settlement based on the latest quarterly financial statements. Necessary adjustments for consolidation were made on significant transactions that took place during the period between the fiscal year-end of the subsidiaries and that of the Company. Consolidated subsidiaries other than those referred to above have the same business year as the Company, which ends on March 31. (3) Goodwill Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 5 years. However, goodwill that is not material is charged to income in the year of acquisition. Differences between the cost and underlying net equity of investments in affiliates accounted for by the equity method are charged or credited to income as they occur. (4) Foreign currency translation Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The balance sheet accounts of the foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding minority interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Differences arising from the translation are presented as foreign currency translation adjustments and minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. 63 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2014 To Contents p03–06 p07–12 p13–32 p33–46 p47–52 p53–99 About Obayashi Management Policy Business Overview Together with Corporate Governance Corporate Data Corporation Stakeholders (5) Cash equivalents All highly liquid investments, generally with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are so near maturity that they represent only an insignificant risk of any change in value attributable to changes in interest rates, are considered cash equivalents. (6) Short-term investment securities and investment securities Securities are classified into two categories: held-to-maturity and other securities. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method. (7) Inventories Real estate held for sale, costs on uncompleted construction contracts, costs on real estate business, ­inventories for PFI and other projects and costs on other business are all stated at cost determined by the specific identification method. Raw materials and supplies are stated at cost determined by the first-in first-out method. The net book value of inventories in the balance sheets is written down if the net realizable value declines. (8) Property, plant and equipment The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries mainly calculate depreciation by the decliningbalance method, while the straight-line method is applied to buildings, excluding building fixtures, acquired on or after April 1, 1998. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries mainly apply the straight-line method. The useful lives and residual values of depreciable assets are estimated mainly in accordance with the ­Corporate Tax Law. (9) Intangible assets Intangible fixed assets are amortized by the straight-line method. Computer software for internal use is ­amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 5 years. (10) Leased assets Depreciation of leased assets under finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the leased assets to the lessee is calculated by the straight-line method over the lease period with a residual value of zero. (11) Allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on the historical experience with respect to writeoffs for the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and based on an estimate of the amount for specific uncollectible accounts for the Companies. (12) Provision for warranties for completed construction The provision for warranties for completed construction is provided to cover expenses for defects claimed concerning completed work, based on the estimated amount of compensation to be paid in the future for the work completed during the fiscal year. (13) Provision for loss on construction contracts The provision for loss on construction contracts is provided at the estimated amount for the future losses on contract backlog at the balance sheet date which will probably be incurred and which can be reasonably estimated. (14) Provision for loss on real estate business and other The provision for loss on real estate business and other is provided for the estimated losses to be incurred in liquidating real estate and restructuring the real estate business. To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2014 64 (15) Provision for environmental measures The provision for environmental measures is provided based on an estimate of costs for disposal of ­Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) waste, which the Company and its domestic subsidiaries are obliged to ­dispose of by the Act on Special Measures Concerning Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Waste. (16) Retirement benefits In calculating retirement benefit obligations, the straight-line method is used to allocate expected retirement benefit payments in the period until the end of the current fiscal year. Actuarial differences are amortized commencing in the following year after the differences are recognized ­primarily by the straight-line method over periods (5 to 10 years) which are shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees. Prior service cost (PSC) is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years which is shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees, while PSC of certain subsidiaries is expensed as incurred. (17) Derivatives and hedge accounting (a) Method of hedge accounting Hedging instruments are valued at fair value and accounted for using the deferral method of accounting. The monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, for which foreign exchange forward contracts or currency options are used to hedge the foreign currency fluctuations, are translated at the ­contracted rate if the foreign exchange forward contracts or currency options qualify for hedge accounting. The interest rate swaps, which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria, are not remeasured at market value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is charged to income (short-cut method). (b) Hedging instruments and hedged items To hedge foreign exchange risks related to the monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign ­currencies and projected future foreign currency transactions, foreign exchange forward contracts and nondeliverable foreign exchange forward contracts are employed as hedging instruments. To hedge the interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks related to loans payable and transactions of affiliates, interest rate swaps or interest rate/currency swaps are employed as hedging instruments. (c) Hedging policy The Companies utilize derivative financial instruments only for the purpose of hedging future risks of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates in accordance with internal rules. (d) Assessment of hedge effectiveness Hedge effectiveness is not assessed when substantial terms and conditions of the hedging instruments and the hedged transactions are the same. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted for interest rate swaps as they meet certain criteria under the short-cut method. (18) Recognizing revenues and costs of construction contracts Revenues and costs of construction contracts of which the percentage of completion can be reliably estimated are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage of completion is calculated at the cost incurred as a percentage of the estimated total cost. The completed-contract method continues to be applied for contracts for which the percentage of completion cannot be reliably estimated. Revenues from construction contracts and the related costs of the overseas subsidiaries are mainly recorded on the percentage-of-completion method. (19) Revenues and expenses associated with finance lease transactions Sales and cost of sales are recognized upon receipt of lease payment. (20) Consumption taxes Consumption tax and local consumption tax are accounted for under the tax-exclusive method. 65 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2014 To Contents p03–06 p07–12 p13–32 p33–46 p47–52 p53–99 About Obayashi Management Policy Business Overview Together with Corporate Governance Corporate Data Corporation Stakeholders (21) Income taxes The Companies apply deferred tax accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of income taxes by the asset/liability method. Under the asset/liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. (22) Consolidated taxation system The Companies adopted the consolidated taxation system. 4. Change in Accounting Policies The Company adopted “Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Statement No. 26 of May 17, 2012) and “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Guidance No. 25 of May 17, 2012) (except for certain provisions described in the main clause in Section 35 of the standard and in the main clause of Section 67 of the guidance) as of the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. These standards require entities to apply a revised method for recording the retirement benefit obligation, after deducting pension plan assets, as an asset and a liability for retirement benefits. In addition, unrecognized actuarial differences and unrecognized prior service costs are recorded as an asset and a liability for retirement benefits. Concerning the application of the Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits, based on the provisional treatment set out in Section 37 of the standard, the effects of such changes in the current fiscal year have been recorded in retirement benefit asset and liability adjustments of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Financial Instruments (1) Overview (a) Policy for financial instruments The Companies raise funds by borrowing from banks and issuing commercial paper or corporate bonds. Also, the Companies restrict temporary excess fund management to highly secure assets, time deposits and other short-term investments. The Companies use derivatives in order to avoid the risks, fluctuations of ­particular assets and liabilities, and fluctuations of interest rates. The Companies do not use derivative ­transactions to gain short-term profits or for speculative purposes. (b) Types of financial instruments, related risks and risk management “Notes and accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other” and “Accounts receivable—other,” which are operating receivables, are exposed to the credit risk of customers. In order to mitigate the risk when orders are received, the Companies conduct a strict screening and determine project plans so that potential risks are minimized. “Short-term investment securities” and “Investment securities” mainly consist of stocks. While short-term investment securities and investment securities are exposed to market risk, the Companies monitor market prices of these securities. “Notes and accounts payable for construction contracts and other” and “Deposits received,” which are operating liabilities, are due within one year. “Short-term loans payable,” “Long-term loans payable,” “Commercial papers” and “Bonds payable” are used for operations or capital investment. “PFI and other project finance loans” are used for enterprise funds related to particular PFI and other projects. Floating rate loans are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. In order to hedge against the interest rate risks and fix the payment of interest, the Companies utilize derivative transactions (interest rate swaps) for each contract of certain long-term loans payable. The ­evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted for ­interest rate swaps as they meet certain criteria under the short-cut method. The transactions of derivative financial instruments are carried out in accordance with the Companies’ internal rules, and the status of the transactions is reported regularly to the Board of Directors. The Companies trade derivative transactions with major financial institutions and therefore consider there is no credit risk underlying those transactions. While operating debt and borrowings are exposed to liquidity risk, the Companies manage the risk mainly by preparing quarterly and monthly cash management plans.

To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2014 74 Note 1. Method to determine the fair values of financial instruments, and other information related to ­marketable securities and derivatives Assets Cash and deposits Since deposits are settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The ­carrying value is the same as fair value. Notes and accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other The fair value of these items is determined based on the present value of carrying value, grouped by term of settlement, discounted at an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of those and credit risk. Short-term investment securities and investment securities The fair value of stocks is determined based on the quoted market price and the fair value of debt ­securities is determined based on either the quoted market price or prices provided by financial ­institutions making markets in these securities. Information on securities classified by holding purpose is disclosed in Note 13 “Securities.” Accounts receivable—other Since “Accounts receivable—other” is settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Liabilities Notes and accounts payable for construction contracts and other, Short-term loans payable, Current ­portion of PFI and other project finance loans, Commercial papers, Current portion of bonds and ­Deposits received Since these accounts are settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Bonds payable The fair value of bonds issued by the Company is based on the present value of the total principal and interest discounted by an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of bond and current credit risk. Long-term loans payable and PFI and other project finance loans For fixed rate loans, the fair value is based on the present value of the total principal and interest discounted by an interest rate to be applied if similar new loans were entered into. For floating rate loans, since the market interest rate is reflected in the interest rate set within a short period of time, the carrying value is the same as the fair value. The fair value of loans qualifying for special hedge accounting treatment of interest rate swaps is based on the present value of the total principal and interest hedged by interest rate swaps, which is discounted by an interest rate to be applied if similar new loans were entered into.

Segment Information (1) Segment information (a) Overview of reportable segments The reportable segments of the Companies are components for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee to make decisions about resource allocation and to assess performance. The Building Construction, Civil Engineering and Real Estate Development divisions at the Company are responsible for strategic planning and business development of the building construction, civil engineering and real estate development businesses, respectively. Business operations of the building construction and civil engineering divisions are classified geographically with headquarters and each branch as separate ­operating units and evaluated individually. The Company’s subsidiaries are also evaluated on an individual basis. The building construction and civil engineering businesses are segmented based on domestic and overseas areas. The Companies therefore have five reportable segments: “domestic building construction,” “overseas ­building construction,” “domestic civil engineering,” “overseas civil engineering” and “real estate.” The overview of each reportable segment is as follows: Domestic building construction: Execution of building construction contracts and related businesses within Japan Overseas building construction: Execution of building construction contracts and related businesses outside Japan Domestic civil engineering: Execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related ­businesses within Japan Overseas civil engineering: Execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related ­businesses outside Japan Real estate: Purchase, sale and rent of real estate properties, development of land ­parcels and related businesses (b) Accounting treatment for net sales, income (loss) , assets, liabilities and others by each segment The accounting methods of the segments are substantially the same as those described in Note 3 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Segment performance is evaluated based on operating income or loss. Intersegment sales are recorded at the same prices used in transactions with third parties. 87 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2014 To Contents p03–06 p07–12 p13–32 p33–46 p47–52 p53–99 About Obayashi Management Policy Business Overview Together with Corporate Governance Corporate Data Corporation Stakeholders (c) Reportable segment information (net sales and income (loss)) Millions of yen Reporting segment Domestic Overseas For the year building building Domestic civil Overseas civil Others ended March 31, 2014 construction construction engineering engineering Real estate Subtotal (Note 1) Total Net sales: Sales to third parties ������� ¥902,488 ¥243,393 ¥321,005 ¥54,186 ¥51,668 ¥1,572,742 ¥40,014 ¥1,612,756 Inter-segment sales and transfers ��������������� 46,121 61 25,112 – 1,828 73,125 7,537 80,662 Segment sales ��������������� 948,610 243,455 346,118 54,186 53,497 1,645,867 47,551 1,693,419 Operating income (loss): Operating income (loss) from sales to third parties (Note 2) ������������� 5,109 6,273 11,419 (3,615) 11,222 30,409 1,582 31,991 Inter-segment operating income and transfers ����� (393) – 134 (1) (0) (261) (168) (429) Segment income (loss) ����� ¥ 4,716 ¥ 6,273 ¥ 11,553 ¥ (3,616) ¥11,221 ¥ 30,148 ¥ 1,414 ¥ 31,562 Thousands of U.S. dollars Reporting segment Domestic Overseas For the year building building Domestic civil Overseas civil Others ended March 31, 2014 construction construction engineering engineering Real estate Subtotal (Note 1) Total Net sales: Sales to third parties ������� $8,768,838 $2,364,882 $3,118,979 $526,488 $502,025 $15,281,213 $388,790 $15,670,004 Inter-segment sales and transfers ��������������� 448,129 600 244,003 – 17,769 710,503 73,237 783,741 Segment sales ��������������� 9,216,967 2,365,483 3,362,982 526,488 519,795 15,991,717 462,028 16,453,745 Operating income (loss): Operating income (loss) from sales to third parties (Note 2) ������������� 49,648 60,950 110,957 (35,131) 109,042 295,467 15,372 310,839 Inter-segment operating income and transfers ����� (3,823) – 1,303 (10) (8) (2,538) (1,632) (4,171) Segment income (loss) ����� $ 45,824 $ 60,950 $ 112,261 $ (35,142) $109,033 $ 292,928 $ 13,739 $ 306,667 Notes: 1. Businesses that cannot be classified into the reportable segments are shown as “Others.” This includes PFI (Private Finance Initiative), finance, operation of golf courses and other businesses. 2. “Operating income (loss) from sales to third parties” was computed by subtracting “Inter-segment operating income and transfers” from “Segment income (loss).” The total “Operating income (loss) from sales to third parties” is equal to “Operating income” as shown in the consolidated statement of income. 3. The amounts of the assets are not shown since the assets are not divided by the segments.
