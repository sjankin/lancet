Showing responsibility Sustainability Report 2013 Highlights 2013 At €983 million, value creation at Krones was up 11.50% (+€113 million) year-on-year and reached a new record high. 90% of the machines and systems presented at the industry’s premier trade fair, drinktec 2013, had been assessed ­according to enviro criteria. Direct and indirect CO2 emissions at all German sites were reduced by 1,696 tonnes – a decrease of 4.87% year-on-year. Our international sites employed 3,187 people – 25.9% of our total workforce – in 2013. Krones AG donated €275,000 to victims of the one-hundred year flood of the Danube and Inn Rivers. In a show of solidarity, employees at all sites opted to forgo their annual company parties. 2013 2012 Change Revenue € million 2,815.7 2,664.2 + 5.7% ebt € million 169.7 99.1 + 71.2% Consolidated net income € million 119.4 68.3 + 74.8% Value added € million 983 870 + 13.0% Capital expenditure for PP&E and intangible assets € million 108.1 110.9 – €2.8 million Equity € million 954 836 + 14.1% Total CO2 emissions metric tonnes 33,155 34,851 – 4.9% Water consumption m3 114,837 116,043 – 1.0% Total waste generated metric tonnes 14,483 14,683 – 1.4% Employees at 31 December Worldwide 12,285 11,963 + 322 Germany 9,098 9,076 + 22 Outside Germany 3,187 2,887 + 300 Employee turnover rate % 2.2 1.9 – Women in the workforce % 13.0 13.0 – “Showing responsibility” – Ever since the company was founded, ­responsibility has been an important, guiding value within our corporate philosophy. We have always felt a strong sense of responsibility to offer and deliver the very best to our customers. We also have, since our ­beginnings, always felt a close connection with our employees and ­assumed responsibility for fostering a strong and lasting partnership. ­Finally, our long-standing relationships with our suppliers testify to our strong awareness of the business community in which we operate. We are staying this course and will continue to act responsibly with ­respect to our environment – both near and far – by conserving resources, promoting mutual understanding, and of course systematically designing our products for a long, sustainable service life at our customers’ plants.

It contains economic data as well as information on our environmental and social performance. We use the report for the purpose of self-assessment and to define further actions in the area of sustainability. Let us first take a brief look back over the past year: 2013 was a big year. Not only in terms of our earnings performance but also with ­respect to important milestones and events. Our machines and systems met with overwhelming interest at the 2013 drinktec trade fair. The innovative exhibits generated a surge of new inquiries and orders. ­Besides this major event, we also launched a new corporate structure last year with which we laid the groundwork for ensuring our organisation’s ability to meet the With energy and media-efficient needs of the markets for the long term. To fulfil our customers’ wishes even faster machines, we deliver resource-­ and even more accurately, we have reduced the interfaces along our entire value saving concepts for filling and chain. With that, we are building structures that ensure fast, direct support for our packaging to our customers in the emerging markets and beyond. customers worldwide. The third building block for our success in 2013 was the steady implementation of our Value strategy programme. The achievements made under Value are described in our Annual Report. When we look at the global markets, we see a continuing trend towards urbanisation and increasing prosperity in the emerging markets. This trend has been evident for years now and will generate steadily rising demand for packaged beverages and foods. For our company, that means that by increasing our presence in these markets we can also help to ensure the use of energy and media-efficient filling and packaging machinery and lines there. Another clear trend is the increased tendency among beverage producers to use different types of packaging to set themselves apart from the competition. Conserving resources is always a consideration for ­every type of packaging. We consult with our customers and give them the data they need to make informed decisions that also take sustainability into account. A look at our sustainability performance shows that this approach supports our ­economic success. We will continue to make it a high priority. We also attach great importance to the environmental and social aspects of sustainability. The motto we have chosen for this year’s report – “Showing responsibility” – is a clear testament to our commitment. Three main themes run through this year’s efforts. First, we will press on with our efforts to further improve resource conservation with our machines and lines. Our enviro programme gives our customers an excellent basis for KRONES compact | Statement by the Executive Board 5 5 reducing using energy and media consumption. We will continue to implement this programme and intend to have assessed all new machines under enviro by the end of 2015. We still see considerable long-term potential here. This programme also strengthens our position as the technology leader for machinery and lines in the food and beverage industry. KRONES compact Second, we value our strong team very highly. Our people are our most important asset. They are highly motivated and superbly qualified and they are the very foundation on which our long-term success stands. Our efforts with respect to human ­resources and social affairs at our sites in Germany and abroad will remain focused on promoting our workforce with an eye to the future. We will be expanding our professional development offerings at our international sites in the years ahead. Third, we are devoting great attention to environmental considerations. CO2 emisOur actions – both internal and sions are especially important – not only for us. Given the age of our buildings and ­external – are guided by the ten principles of the UN Global Comcurrent economic conditions we are compelled to take a gradual approach to reducpact. We have integrated these ing CO2 emissions rather than setting ambitious targets. We will continually examprinciples into our Code of Conduct. ine all of our processes and implement any and all optimisation measures, however small they may be. We are standing by our strategy of critically reviewing our processes and consumption data and then determining what is feasible. One thing is clear: We cannot think in terms of large reductions here. But rest assured that every measure we take to reduce our CO2 emissions drives us to search for yet more ­potential. We will continue to pursue these core aspects of our sustainability policy in the ­medium and long terms and position Krones as a highly economically, environmentally and socially conscious company. By incorporating the Global Compact principles into our Code of Conduct, and thus into our company’s day-to-day culture, we are ensuring that our actions are guided by a widely recognised framework. Volker Kronseder, Chairman of the Executive Board Human Resources, Communications and Quality KRONES compact | Statement by the Executive Board 6 Statement by the Executive Board Legal compliance and ethical conduct are absolutely vital to any sustainable business concept. In establishing an ­internal Compliance organisation, we have put important structures in place for making our business processes even more transparent. That brings us closer to optimisKRONES compact ing our multi-dimensional risk management and is essential to our ability to identify and head off risks early. In this way, we are ensuring that our Code of Conduct is implemented and traceable in all areas of our business. What is important here is that we deal with problems openly and further strengthen the culture of trust at ­Krones. That makes for highly secure business processes. Christoph Klenk Finance, Controlling and It also gives our customers the assurance that all of our Information Management ­actions are in keeping with the Code of Conduct at all times. Christoph Klenk Trust and accuracy are two good reasons driving our ­intensive dialogue with customers worldwide. This close contact is essential to our ability to meet our customers’ (often widely varied) needs in a timely manner. In this trusting partnership, sustainability topics are also gaining importance. We talk about individual consumption data when defining a line’s performance but also cover our environmental and social performance in detail. These topics come to us by way of various platforms such as ecovadis and the Carbon Disclosure Project, through standardised data surveys for the food and beverage ­industry. Krones is very open to these surveys and we are Rainulf Diepold happy to support our customers in determining their Sales and Marketing ­sustainability performance. Rainulf Diepold KRONES compact | Statement by the Executive Board 7 We are continually examining our Plants and Components portfolio for resource-saving potential. In the very energy-intensive area of brewery systems, we offer energy management solutions such as EquiTherm, which helps reduce primary energy use. KRONES compact But sustainability is not just important to our customers. KRONES, too, can improve the resource-friendliness of process flows in our own production facilities by implementing a number of individual measures. For example, by streamlining processes in manufacturing. When investing in new technologies, we always examine the associated resource consumption and include this information Werner Frischholz Plants and Components in our decision making. Of course, we discuss such issues with our suppliers. We make sustainability considerations an obligatory part of our value chain. Werner Frischholz Staying on top – that is our aim in product development. It applies to our machines’ high availability but also to low consumption data and high resource efficiency. Our ­enviro sustainability programme documents these efforts. The presentation of our enviro-rated exhibits and their consumption data at the 2013 drinktec trade fair clearly demonstrated the high priority we give to resource conservation in our product development. Every single new development is examined for enviro compatibility. That means we are systematically aligning our product range with aspects of sustainability. The interaction between people and machines is very important here. By fully Thomas Ricker ­integrating ergonomics and ease of maintenance into our Bottling and Packaging Equipment developments in a purposeful manner, we help our ­customers stay on top in terms of efficiency in their dayto-day operations. Thomas Ricker KRONES compact | Statement by the Executive Board 8 Statement by the Executive Board We are ramping up development of service products that enable us to directly support our customers – sometimes without the need for a service technician to be physically present on site. Service models such as remote service ­allow us to monitor machines and support our techniKRONES compact cians in the field as well as our customers. This saves time, of course, but also saves resources associated with transportation and travel. In our ongoing efforts to expand our sites worldwide and our supply chain, we are also keenly aware of the need to maintain a high level of sustainability. By growing our ­local presence and service network, we are able to offer Markus Tischer International Operations continuous support to our customers. Within our global and Services supply chain, we also very closely monitor the conditions under which vendor parts are manufactured. In obtaining IMS certifications for our sites in Brazil and China, we have taken the first step towards traceable application of our standards in our international offices. Markus Tischer KRONES compact | Statement by the Executive Board 9 KRONES COmpaCt A strong team is the cornerstone of our success. KrOnes is proud that our employees have a great sense of community and work together to actively shape our success. In this way, they are assuming their share of responsibility and ensuring that our company will remain a strong force on the market. Acting sustainably is a team effort that all KrOnes employees undertake continually in their day-today work. 10 KRONES compact KRONES AG’s CSR Committee: From right to left: Prof. Dr. Thomas Schwartz, honorary professor Volker Kronseder (Chairman of the Executive of applied ethics particularly business ethics Board), Prof. Dr. Erich Kohnhäuser, Philipp Graf and corporate ethics, is the committee’s source von und zu Lerchenfeld, Prof. Dr. Thomas of inspiration on all matters relating to ethical Schwartz, Ingrid Reuschl, Claudia Islinger, and sustainable action. ­Roland Pokorny, Nico Irrgang.

Report from the CSR Committee 11 Ladies and Gentlemen, The CSR Committee is established as an independent, management-level body within Krones AG. The Committee develops and evolves the company’s sustainability strategy and advises the Executive Board on implementation of these tasks. The input of the Committee’s external members is a crucial element for developing these measures as they draw the Committee’s attention to overarching trends. That KRONES compact enables Krones to incorporate the perspectives of different stakeholder groups and thus position itself far ahead of our industry in terms of sustainability. The Committee convened for four meetings in Neutraubling in the year under ­review. Each meeting focused on a main topic as well as current issues relating to various aspects of the company’s CSR strategy. For specific matters, project leads were invited who provided detailed information from the perspective of the relevant departments and helped the body develop a sound position on the topics. The first meeting took place in March 2013 and dealt with the results of the SMETA In June 2013, the external auditor ethical trade audit, which one of our key customers had conducted at all of our proconfirmed the successful completion of a SMETA audit for all of our duction sites in Germany in 2012.

At the same meeting, Roland Pokorny, Vice President, Head of Corporate Communications, presented the current status of the Value strategy. This strategy includes Krones’ growth targets and areas of focus. To support the further expansion of our sustainability expertise, a working group was appointed to work out ways to incorporate e ­ nvironmental and social tasks into the Value strategy programme. With a presentation on the megatrend “demographic change”, Prof. Dr. Thomas Schwartz showed a methodological approach to how changes in the age structure of Krones’ workforce can be incorporated into goal-setting within our CSR strategy.

Krones’ Press Officer Danuta Kessler-Zieroth, who represented Krones in a nationwide program for promoting women in management positions, explained the results of workshops within the programme entitled “ff frauen führen – Regionale Bündnisse für Chancengleichheit” (“Women in Leadership – Regional Alliances for Equality”). Krones strives to promote female managers from within its own ranks and has set a goal of 7.2% women in management for the year 2015. The meeting also dealt with topics relating to our CSR strategy 2015+ with concept ideas on how to strengthen the presence of environmental, labour practices, and society aspects within the Value strategy. KRONES compact | Report from the CSR Committee 12 In the Committee’s July 2013 meeting, Albert Bauer presented the status of the IMS Matters concerning the company’s certification, product certification, and SAP audit management projects.

Mr. Bauer reported that initial certification of our Taicang, China, site was to be completed by the end of 2013. He also pointed out that the certification process for Franklin, USA, was slated to begin in January 2014. The recently published CSR Report 2012 was another topic of discusKRONES compact sion at this meeting. The report contained a more comprehensive data set compared with the previous year. The Committee’s fourth meeting took place in December 2013 and focused on the framework for the CSR Report 2013. Ingrid Reuschl provided an overview of the status of the goals and actions presented in the 2012 list. The Committee discussed ­Krones AG’s Level C+ – Prime – rating through oekom Research and possible potential for improving that rating. In addition, fundamental information on CSR strategy relating to environmental performance and on defining CO2 emissions reduction targets was presented. It was decided that Krones AG’s options in this regard would be prepared for the first Committee meeting in 2014 with the involvement of ­experts from the environmental CSR team. Four Committee meetings are planned for the year 2014. Neutraubling, April 2014 The CSR Committee Volker Kronseder Ingrid Reuschl Claudia Islinger Prof. Dr.-Ing. Erich Kohnhäuser Philipp Graf von und zu Lerchenfeld Roland Pokorny Prof. Dr. Thomas Schwartz Nico Irrgang KRONES compact | Report from the CSR Committee 13 Dr. Jochen Klein, Member of the Supervisory Board, on CSR at KRONES: Many producers attach importance to the sustainability of their machines and lines. In your experience, to what extent does sustainability play a role in investment decisions? Sustainability has gained increasing importance in recent years, due in large part to rising energy prices. It is difficult to say exactly how much weight it is given in KRONES compact a ­percentage figure since customers have to look at a bigger picture that includes such other factors as maintenance costs, performance data, and space constraints. I would assume that such a percentage would be in the double digits. Krones is increasingly addressing the issue of compliance. What are your thoughts on the activities and areas of focus that Krones has chosen for the launch of its ­compliance policy? In a company that has always had a majority shareholder – first the company’s founder and then the founding family – you have to look at compliance differently than you do with a DAX 30 company. The founder’s value system and that of his ­successors has shaped the company and its workforce. As a major employer, Krones also serves as a role model within the region. The introduction of a compliance policy at Krones is a natural and positive outgrowth of the company’s traditional policy of transparency and integrity. The Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees, and the global Suppliers’ Code demonstrate that Krones is systematically pursuing a policy of compliance worldwide. The global structures support and accelerate this effort. Krones has made an international structure an important part of its internal organisation. This in turn must be reflected in increasingly international CSR reporting. Here in Germany, collecting data on energy and emissions is considered very important. As you see it, how important is the collection and presentation of this data on the global market? Global climate change makes energy and emissions data crucial worldwide. In the future, they will take on growing importance, particularly for the BRIC nations. These data are also a critical factor for assessing and developing sustainable supply chain strategies. Which aspect of corporate strategy do you believe is the most important for a ­company to be perceived as sustainable on the international stage? On the global market, all matters relating to sustainability must always be viewed holistically. That is especially true of a company’s innovation strategy, particularly with respect to the reuse or recycling of materials. In the end, this has an impact on service life and line efficiency. It is simply impossible to be a technology leader ­without taking sustainability into account. 14 KRONES has whole-plant expertise A complete KRONES filling line for 1 Process technology 3 – 5 Contiform AseptBloc 4 Plastics technology producing, filling, and packaging The SyPro S sugar dissolving The Contiform AseptBloc is The PreFlow preform sterilisabeverages is composed of innostation and sugar syrup a compact, user-friendly tion unit uses H2O2 to sterilise vative individual machines and pasteuriser can produce up to system that covers bottle preforms before they are systems from the company’s 30,000 litres of syrup per hour . production and filling in an passed to the next module to different product divisions . integrated concept .

We have decided to continue to apply these standards for the years 2013 and 2014 rather than transitioning to the new G4 standard immediately following its release. The main reason for this decision is that our 2012 report was the first to be prepared according to the G3.1 Guidelines. The individual CSR teams and ­departments had been provided with the information, definitions, and calculation methods from the G3.1 Guidelines for the purpose of this report. In many cases, data KRONES compact measurement was done using these guidelines throughout the year. So as not to ­delay these processes by changing the variables, we will make full use of the grace period allowed for introducing the new guidelines. We will use this transition time to present the areas of focus required under G4 within the company and prepare for reporting on them. With respect to the report boundaries, we will largely maintain the same framework The Sustainability Report covers all that we established for 2012. The data reported in the general disclosures and in the production sites in Germany and thus 75% of our employees. Some environmental disclosures cover the KRONES Group while the other disclosure areas individual portions of this report primarily present data for KRONES AG only. In keeping with the goals laid out in 2012, ­include an expansion of the report we have begun to integrate some data from our international sites and offices. In boundaries – they are noted particular, these include data on “Labour Practices”, where we have added informa­accordingly. tion on some of our European sites. The information on our employees’ air travel activities also relates to the business travel of group employees. In general, this report covers the information on our German sites and thus 75% of our employees. With the IMS certification of our production sites in Brazil and China, we will gradually have access to uniform data from these offices and be able to include them in our reporting. That may include information on occupational safety and energy use. However, for the time being, our focus will be on supporting action in keeping with this standard at these sites and closely advising our colleagues there to ensure that a high level of data quality is achieved. We have added Compliance to our reporting this year. In appointing a Compliance Officer in 2013, the company took decisive steps to establish a national and international framework for our actions and define guidelines and oversight processes. These activities included a revision of our Code of Conduct, which contains all of the rules governing our employees and their actions both within the company and in their external dealings. Furthermore, we have changed the presentation of our enviro progress report from a revenue-weighting to a presentation of the actual number of machines assessed. The reason for this change is that newly designed machines that are still in the ­design stage are also included in the assessment process and, therefore, a revenue-­ weighted presentation provides an inaccurate picture. KRONES compact | The Sustainability Report 20 We have added an expanded description of our stakeholders and our activities with respect to these individual groups so as to provide more comprehensive information on stakeholder engagement in the general disclosures. Changes in presentation within in the report were made in the Environmental ­section, where we have switched from reporting the energy sources individually to aggregate data. We believe this provides a better overview and makes it possible to KRONES compact grasp the “big picture” faster. That means, however, that we have to present two different values in order to incorporate information on changes in energy use for 2013. We have integrated two pairs of columns to illustrate the transition. More details on this can be found on pages 69 through 71.

For certain aspects – such as biodiversity – we are no longer including information in an indicator, since this aspect is not relevant to our company.

Our business activities and ­decisions are also guided by respect for the needs of future generations. KRONES’ mission statement KRONES compact Our customers around the world are primarily in the food and beverage (liquid food) industry. We provide them with machinery, lines, and systems, including all related services, that are the best in every respect.

Our global network enables us to provide fast, cost-effective, high-quality service – anytime, anywhere around the world. All strategic decisions are aimed at ensuring the company’s sustainable development. Even when optimising profits and cash flow in the short term, we still keep sustainability sharply in focus. This makes Krones a dependable partner for our ­customers, employees, shareholders, and suppliers. Our financial strength gives us independence. We use resources wisely in order to safeguard this freedom for the long term. Our sites around the world form a global value chain that serves as the very foundation of our success. Each of our core modules is built at only one site, with exceptional cost-effectiveness. These sites concentrate our expertise and experience in the relevant technology. To secure this advantage for the long term, Krones offers attractive working conditions, promising training opportunities, and plenty of room for individual development at all of our sites worldwide. Transparent hierarchies, ­appreciative leadership, and clear goals inform our corporate culture. To stay agile and competitive going forward, we keep our structures lean and efficient. Fair and forthright interactions We are a multinational corporation where a diversity of cultures, languages, and ways of life come together on equal footing. We are fair and forthright in our inter­ actions. Honesty, transparency and integrity inform all of our actions. We are interested in the thoughts and opinions of our employees and partners and are willing to learn from others. Krones – we do more. KRONES compact | Our attitudes and actions 23 KRONES Code of Conduct KRONES is a constant in the beverage and packaging machinery market. One reason The Code of Conduct is available for this is that we have maintained an excellent reputation over the years. We want ­online at http://www.krones.com/ to continue to build on this reputation in the future and further develop our posidownloads/Coco_2014_en.pdf tion as the market leader. In this effort, just how we integrate our corporate and social responsibilities into our KRONES compact day-to-day processes will be very important. We want to ensure that our actions are always lawful, ethical, and responsible. This high standard applies to every single employee within the company. For this reason, we have drafted the Code of Conduct on the basis of our corporate mission statement. The Code of Conduct is binding for all KRONES employees – ­including the Executive Board, management, and every member of our staff worldwide. In their implementation of this Code of Conduct, all employees of companies belonging to the KRONES Group must abide by local national laws. The aim of this Code of Conduct is to ensure company-wide compliance with laws, standards, and policies in order to create a working environment based on integrity, respect, fairness, and accountability. All employees are urged to not only comply with the guidelines in the Code of Conduct in a formal sense but to live and breathe them. In this way, they serve as the basis of a culture of openness and compliance that informs our activities daily. In the interest of everyone involved and to ensure that Krones is perceived as a reputable, trustworthy, and dependable partner both within and outside the company, violations of the Code of Conduct are systematically investigated and disciplinary action taken. Suppliers’ Code KRONES has a supplier’s code to ensure that all suppliers meet certain sustainability KRONES’ Suppliers’ Code commits criteria and contribute to a sustainable supply chain.

Our quality assurance team performs audits www.krones.com/downloads/ on site at the suppliers’ facilities to verify compliance. In addition, KRONES seeks to Liko_2010_e.pdf use vendors that are also certified by an independent institution. Corporate governance With a few exceptions, KRONES follows the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. The Code presents essential statutory regulations for the management and supervision (governance) of German listed companies and contains internationally and nationally recognised standards for good and responsible corporate governance. More information such as the details of our declaration of compliance and the remuneration report are published in our 2013 Annual Report (pages 124 to 126 and 116 to 119) and online (www.krones.com).

The Compliance system covers the entire group of companies and is comprehensive, effective, and transparent. The concept also provides a secure framework in which to conduct all of our business activities. Krones’ compliance concept is based on three building blocks: KRONES compact | compliance 25 Prevention – This includes consultation of all business units, risk analysis, definition and review of codes and policies, employee education and training, establishment of a knowledge base, and a help desk. Detection – This includes standard audits in collaboration with the Internal Audit organisation as well as compliance spot checks. Response – This includes implementation of new findings into new or modified KRONES compact action plans and management of Compliance-related incidents in close collaboration with the Investor Relations, Legal Affairs, and Human Resources departments as well as the technical departments. These components cover all areas and processes within the company and are binding for all companies within the group. The Compliance system also applies to all laws affecting KRONES AG and its subsidiaries in any way as well as all levels of management and staff within the group. Compliance reporting To ensure the uniform and traceable flow of information on all aspects of CompliThe process illustrated in this flow ance, reporting processes have been defined for KRONES AG as well as the group chart is for Krones AG.

It integrates a regional Compliance Officer into the Krones Group’s organisational structures worldwide. In addition to defining staff responsibilities and hierarchies for Compliance duties, we have also put in place an incident management process. Whistleblowing procedures – Concerns and complaints, particularly regarding KRONES compact ­violations of this Code of Conduct or Group policy within the KRONES Group, may be submitted to one’s manager, the Works Council, KRONES AG’s Compliance Officer, or members of the KRONES AG Compliance Committee – in person, electronically, in ­writing, or by phone. A defined reporting structure renders each step in the decision-making process, from receipt of a tip to a preliminary judgement and, if applicable, launch of an ­investigation, to actions taken and any consequences and conclusion of the ­investigation. Informed employees – The basis for Compliance in our day-to-day ­operations The revised version of our Code of Conduct gives employees a brief overview of the most important laws, regulations, and company policies. In addition, the Code raises awareness and prompts readers to take a closer look at processes with legal ­relevance. Another part of our efforts to keep our employees informed is a training series that will begin in 2014. The training programme consists of three phases: In-person training of management personnel on KRONES’ Code of Conduct Transmission of basic knowledge about compliance management for all Krones AG employees and managers in an e-learning environment Transmission of specialised compliance knowledge for sensitive areas in ­in-­person training sessions The use of an e-learning concept ensures that the same information on all aspects of compliance is transmitted to all employees across our organisation. Mandatory participation in and documented completion of the training unit ensures broad coverage of Krones AG’s workforce. Employees who do not have a specific PC workstation – primarily those in production – will receive their information and training through their team lead. KRONES compact | compliance 27 KRONES COmpaCt “A help desk solution and a culture of trust serve as the basis for introducing and implementing an effective compliance concept at KrOnes. Each employee’s immediate supervisor is the first point of contact for questions regarding proper, irreproachable conduct. Of course, employees can also seek help with Compliance matters through our help desk – which primarily serves as a sort of triage to quickly sort problems and support employees in their day-to-day work.

Protecting the environment and conserving resources are basic tenets of our business policy. Systematic assessment of all of our consumption data enables us to act in a sustainable, ­forward-thinking manner within our environment. On the one hand, it enables us to secure our company’s long-term survival. On the other, it also contributes to a liveable future for all people. Pages 66 to 83 provide an overview of our efforts in this respect. Our products are the basis for our business success. The enviro certification process gives us a management system for assessing our machines’ sustainability performance. The enviro programme is now an integral part of all product development processes, which means our entire machinery programme is now informed by sustainability considerations. That is an excellent basis from which to achieve our economic goals, which are represented by the three figures: 7/7/20. Our goals and associated strategies in this area are presented on pages 56 to 64. The CSR Committee had set a goal for 2013 of further developing our strategy into a concept for a CSR Strategy 2015+. However, with the creation of our new corporate structure we have put off our pursuit of this goal for the time being. The CSR Committee will take a decision on this topic sometime in 2014.

This is the environment in which we operate and our business processes must be adapted to cope with it. For this reason, our short and medium-term strategy is aimed at further developing our prospects for a successful future with the Value programme. This programme is helping us improve our cost structures in all areas of the company and supporting the expansion of our service and components business. In addition to this primary focus of our activity, we are also emphasising the inter­ nationalisation of our strategy, aligning all of our activities in a targeted manner with the demands of our customers worldwide. That enables us to be flexible in how we address the individual markets and act quickly at the local level. These factors have prompted us to adapt our corporate structure to these requirements. Economic The enviro programme is the third tool we are using to achieve our growth targets and ensure our company’s sustainable development.

The aim of Value is to make the company faster and more agile, so that it can continue to grow profitably long into the future. That is crucial to KRONES’ ability to fulfil its responsibilities toward its employees, its business partners, its shareholders, and the environment and society. In our third year of Value, we once again made good progress in all four of the core areas: innovation, quality, profitability, and growth.

The company’s strong competitive position in the emerging markets had an especially positive impact. In all, KRONES increased sales revenue by 5.7% to a record €2.82 billion. Profits were up more than proportionately. KRONES’ consolidated net income improved from €68.3 million in the previous year to €119.4 million in the reporting ­period.

Economic Because the price environment for our machines and lines remains tight, reducing costs in all three of our operating segments will continue to be a key topic for improving profitability under Value. The emerging economies in Asia, South America, and Africa offer the biggest potential for growth in our market. In order to further expand KRONES’ strong position in these markets, we are pushing the continuous development of our services business in addition to our new machinery business. In 2013, KRONES generated 58.2% of sales revenue in the emerging markets. But the established markets of North America and Europe also hold opportunities for KRONES thanks to the economic recovery and our strong presence with subsidiaries and offices there. “Fast, flexible processes for project execution are important for our activities worldwide. That includes the precise coordination of all activities relating to an order, from contract clarification to design, manufacture, and assembly to putting the equipment into operation. We will continue to integrate project experiences into our inhouse commissioning and installation activities. That will give us fast, direct feedback on potential improvements. Our new process-oriented structures are enabling us to utilise synergies across functions along our entire value chain. That increases our efficiency in completing customer projects and makes for a high level of customer satisfaction.” Clemens Berger, Senior Vice President, Head of Bottling Technology Economic | Economic responsibility 37 New group structure gives Value additional thrust At the start of 2014, KRONES introduced a new corporate structure to support the company’s development with respect to sustainability and flexibility. With clear structures that are based on our key processes, we are giving more weight to the ­specific needs of the three new business units: Bottling and Packaging Equipment, Plants and Components, and International Operations and Services. The new structure also enables us to meet our customers’ differing requirements even better. Increased value creation at KRONES The value added calculation presented here shows the KRONES Group’s contributions to the economy and society and who benefits from the value added generated by the company. A company’s value added is calculated by deducting the expenses for production – that is, cost of goods and services purchased, depreciation and amortisation on non-current assets, and other operating expenses – from total operating perEconomic formance (including other income). KRONES’ value added for 2013 comes to €983 million (previous year: €870 million). The lion’s share of value added at KRONES (82.5% or €811 million) went towards our employees. Besides wages and salaries (€675 million), KRONES spent €136 million on social security contributions, post-employment benefits, and employee benefits. In addition, €50.2 million or 5.1% of value added went to the state in the form of tax payments. The company distributed €23.7 million in dividends to its shareholders. In the year under review, €98.1 million in value added remained within the company. This figure is available for investment in future growth.

That requires capital investment in training and continuing education for our workforce as well as in new equipment and research and development. At €108.1 million, KRONES’ capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets was nearly unchanged from the previous year (€110.9 million).

KRONES will continue to invest in the future to the extent ­necessary to maintain our leadership of the market for the long term. KRONES’ shareholders should also benefit from the company’s success and be ­rewarded for the risk they undertake as equity investors. The company distributed €23.7 million in dividends to its shareholders in 2013 (previous year: €18.1 million). KRONES paid out €23.7 million in dividends to shareholders and made capital ­expenditures totalling €108.1 million. Healthy balance sheet and financial structure The positive consolidated net income figure and the sale of treasury shares for around €74 million in 2013 further improved the company’s financial and capital structure. With net cash and cash equivalents (that is, cash and cash equivalents less bank debt) of €239.9 million (previous year: €132.9 million) and an equity ratio of 42.6%, KRONES has an extremely robust balance sheet and capital structure. This ­allows the company to maintain a high level of capital expenditure and a reputation as a stable, dependable company among business partners.

We continuously monitor all significant business processes to identify risks early and limit them. Within our corporate strategy, we also identify, analyse, and unlock opportunities. However, unlike risks, business opportunities are not documented within our risk management system. KRONES’ risk management system consists of an internal control system with which we record, analyse, and assess all relevant risks. We monitor all material risks and any countermeasures already taken in a detailed process. KRONES’ risk management system Risk management organisation at KRONES is continually monitored and reviewed.

In doing so, we take into account possibilities for making our production operations sustainable. Under our TPM lean production programme, we are pursuing concepts for group-based manufacturing in which production employees are closely involved in organisational matters. In addition, to the extent possible given economic parameters, we also try hard to use resource-friendly machines or adjust processes to improve resource use.” Ralf Goldbrunner, Senior Vice President Plants and Components 42 Production KRONES produces the core modules of its premium-segment machines and lines in KRONES is committed to Germany Germany.

The one exception is our subsidiary KOSME ­dependable partner. (< 4% of consolidated revenue), which manufactures its machines and lines for the low output range in Italy and Austria. The majority of materials for these production sites come from suppliers based in Germany. As a result, around 80% of our procurement budget goes to local com­ panies. When choosing our suppliers, we look at cost-accounting factors but also the successful completion of a supplier audit. Plant efficiency is the key to customer satisfaction Operators of bottling and packaging plants take a comprehensive look at the total Economic cost of ownership (TCO) when evaluating their capital expenditures. TCO includes the cost of acquiring the plant as well as all costs associated with its operation. ­Customers are looking for plant and equipment that will operate cost-effectively throughout its entire useful life. And that means minimised downtimes and sustained high performance. LCS is our programme for providing our customers with comprehensive Customer satisfaction service and support after their equipment has been put into operation. With LCS, we are increasing customer satisfaction and maintaining an ongoing dialogue with Plant efficiency our customers. Scheduled Unscheduled Plant Training maintenance maintenance optimisation and continuing education KRONES plants Key here is ensuring that our customers have a perfect understanding and mastery of their KRONES machines and lines so that they can operate them safely and efficiently. The KRONES Academy plays an important role in that. We have 39 expert trainers in Neutraubling and 63 trainers at our LCS Centres worldwide offering a Economic | Production 43 ­diverse range of practical training opportunities for machine operators and our customers’ own service technicians. In 2013, a total of 15,373 people made use of the Academy’s courses (previous year: 14,691). Our catalogue contains 406 different courses relating to all of the tasks involved in operating our machines and lines. Core topics include machine operation and maintenance as well as topics relating to automation and software. Independent of these offerings, our customers can also schedule company-specific training courses that are tailored to their machinery.

For this, geographic proximity is at least as important as the high quality and efficiency of our products and systems. Close proximity is important for better understanding a customer’s daily needs with respect to operating machines and lines. And rapid response times are essential to the success of any service business. At KRONES, we want LCS to be where our customers are. KRONES’ LCS strategy is designed to ensure that our products and services are as close to our customers as possible. Many years ago, we established LCS Centres in strategically important regions. LCS projects are now being implemented in our LCS Centres and branch offices using local resources. That means parts are delivered from regional warehouses and technicians, trained in Neutraubling, are then available locally for our customers. ­KRONES will systematically continue this strategy of internationalising by further building and expanding local resources and expertise. They are the basis for sustainable services.

Customers keep only the most important spare parts on hand, thus reducing the amount of capital tied up in storage. At the same time, we are further expanding the decentralised warehouses within our LCS Centres. In some regions, we are already able to serve more than 80% of customers’ spare parts needs from our LCS Centre warehouses. Spare parts that are not kept on hand at our customers’ plants or at LCS Centres are supplied from our corporate headquarters in Neutraubling, Germany. With more than 50,000 parts on hand, our main warehouse is able to immediately ship a large share of the parts needed. Any parts that are not kept on hand are produced quickly and in the highest quality in a separate KRONES production facility in Neutraubling. Our global logistics network fast-tracks delivery of all parts from Neutraubling to our customers worldwide as well as their installation into the machines and lines.

In this way, we are fully ­incorporating these principles into both internal and outreach activities worldwide. By introducing our management standards locally at our sites worldwide, we are both following the principles of the UN Global Compact and strengthening our efforts there. That has multiple effects: First, it makes for fast communication between the German plants and our international sites. Second, it gives us clear, uniform workflows, which are crucial to the cost-effectiveness and transparency of our business activities. That all means that we have work to do in a number of areas that must be addressed by our standards. When we make our supply chain more international, we must ensure that we set out clear rules for our suppliers and for the conditions in which the parts we buy from suppliers are manufactured. We will step up our efforts to prepare Economic this guidance in the years ahead. Second, we must ensure safe working conditions at all times at our construction sites worldwide. And third, workflows within our production sites must always conform to local laws as well as our own internal policies. Supplier Code lends security In February 2014, we added suppliers’ voluntary commitment to aligning their operations and workforce with a framework of ethical behaviour and integrity to our general terms and conditions of purchasing and procurement, making it a mandatory part of all contracts. That means 100% of our contracts contain provisions on protecting human rights. When beginning a relationship with a new supplier, our strategic purchasing department conducts a system audit in collaboration with our quality assurance team if a significant procurement volume can be expected in the future. With this approach, we examine a supplier’s qualifications, products, and labour practices before placing an order. As part of this “fitness test”, we also test the ­supplier’s knowledge of our Supplier Code. We conducted 76 system audits in 2013. New supplier system audits in 2013 – Testing knowledge of our Suppliers’ Code 42 40 30 20 4 0 Supplier has Supplier has No documentation knowledge no knowledge Economic | Communicating our high standards beyond our company 47 In those cases in which the supplier has no knowledge of the Suppliers’ Code, the ­auditor instructed the supplier about the Code over the course of the audit. In this way, we ensure that the supplier has received and acknowledged the rules of the ­Suppliers’ Code when we place an order. In a few individual cases, no documentation on this criterion was filed in the system audit. In these cases, the auditors were ­instructed to include a thorough examination in their audit process. We are taking the same steps in establishing long-term partnerships at our inter­ national sites. We follow the same procedure when selecting new suppliers from third-party countries. Occupational safety and employee protection are also taken into consideration here. Around 10% of the suppliers that apply ultimately meet the standards we set out in our tender documents and system audit and are then included in our supplier list. The provisions of our Suppliers’ Code also play an important role at our construction sites. Our site supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the Suppliers’ Code is Economic complied with on site. We also track for safe and fair working conditions in day-today business. Any violations are remedied immediately in the interest of safe, efficient workflows. We address the risk of child labour in this international framework by keeping lists of the names and birth dates of all workers at the construction sites. That not only gives us secure documentation of employees’ ages. It also provides a clear overview of the employees’ working hours. Our quality inspectors check for observance of the Suppliers’ Code at construction sites. In 2013, we conducted 120 construction site inspections. No significant incidents of human rights violations were noted. To date, we have conducted visual inspections relating to social factors and environmental aspects of the Suppliers’ Code. In the medium term, we will be establishing procedures that afford us a more detailed look at our suppliers’ actions in these respects. Long-term relationships Krones relies on long-term relationships with suppliers. In this way, we establish close communication and trust and we are perceived as a dependable partner. That also means we continuously audit and monitor our suppliers and document the results with ratings. If a supplier falls below a certain rating, we offer support in the form of a joint analysis and troubleshooting. No violations of the Suppliers’ Code were detected during the rating process. Likewise, no activities with heightened risk of child labour were detected in the thorough examination of our business activities conducted as part of the system audits. One reason for this is that we buy around 80% of our materials in Germany. We have no major investment agreements with partner companies. Economic | Communicating our high standards beyond our company 48 Ours is a culture of non-discrimination In our production matrix in Germany and in our branch offices, we have established uniform standards for all employees which also take into account the legal framework of the respective countries. The principle of non-discrimination is a binding guideline for all of KRONES AG’s activities. That is stipulated both in our Code of Conduct and in our Suppliers’ Code. It enables us to ensure that all of our employees and our suppliers are subject to equal treatment worldwide. No incidents of violations of the non-discrimination principle were reported in 2013. We did not change the procedure for monitoring this aspect last year. That means that we have not placed a special focus on this subject within our work with our branch offices. As a result, we have no hard data on this topic. The ongoing training of security personnel includes topics relating to constitutional law and human rights. These training sessions are offered to KRONES’ own security staff as well as for contracted factory security personnel. By requiring certification Economic of subject knowledge from the contracting company, we can demand a high level of knowledge on matters relating to non-discrimination. Production site in China IMS certified Following the certification of our production site in Brazil, we launched an IMS certification process for our 2013 Taicang, China, production site. The certification process required extensive preparation and the adaptation of all processes to the following standards on quality, environment and occupational safety and health, respectively: DIN EN ISO 9001, DIN EN ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001. This process entailed identifying and documenting local laws. In some cases, the applicability of these laws was determined and documented on an individual basis in communication with the local authorities. “We developed uniform standards together with our employees in Taicang. In the ­process, we systematically identified and assessed the potential threats in each area in collaboration with managers there. In some cases, we defined new procedures. For example, we had to reorganise the chemicals storage and establish procedures for ­accident response. The measures taken included training employees in first aid and getting support from in-house medical staff.” Daniel Weinzierl, Quality Management We trained a number of local employees to conduct internal audits and document verifiable processes. By modifying templates and defining uniform data formats in the master documentation and management software and by integrating the local regulatory requirements, we were able to adapt the management system to work well in China. Economic | Communicating our high standards beyond our company 49 ECONOmIC In obtaining certification of our production sites in Brazil and China, we have made great strides towards establishing uniform processes and procedures across our organisation. An important benefit here is that we will, over time, have access to uniform, comparable data on occupational safety and environmental impacts. For 2014, we plan to obtain IMs certification for our plant in the UsA.

KRONES took numerous innovations from all of its operating segments to the fair, which takes place only every four years and is the “global economic summit” for the beverage and packaging industry. Thus, KRONES once again demonstrated its technology leadership. Including capitalised development expenditure, KRONES spent a total of €132 million on research and development in 2013 (previous year: €121 million). That represents 4.7% of revenue. KRONES has a team of around 1,900 highly qualified people worldwide working to keep the pipeline filled with excellent new and evolving machines, lines, systems, and services. This team increased the number of registered patents and utility ­models by 15% to 3,150. Economic Growth depends on innovation Innovation is one of the four pillars of our Value programme. To grow profitably, a company must bring innovative products and services to the market. One question guides all of our new developments: How can we increase the benefit to producers? To answer this question, we listen closely to our customers and we use platforms like drinktec and other events to pursue intensive dialogue. But our outreach to customers is not limited to trade fairs. We are in dialogue on a daily basis and include the ­requirements of their operations into our design work.

The big advantage of this system over its predecessor models is that it sterilises the preforms (that is, the PET blanks) before they are blow-moulded into bottles. Since the preforms have a far smaller surface area than finished bottles, sterilising the preforms saves time, energy, and sterilising media. Another benefit: The Contiform AseptBloc can also handle extremely lightweight PET containers since, unlike bottles, preforms are Contiform AseptBloc not prone to shrinkage during the sterilisation process. The sterile preforms are passed into a hermetically sealed sterile unit in which they are blow-moulded, filled, and capped in a seamless aseptic process chain. The Contiform AseptBloc fills sensitive beverages such as juices, iced tea, energy drinks, and dairy drinks in an environment that ensures maximum microbiological safety. Economic PreBeam The PreBeam module is an ideal complement to KRONES’ new generation of aseptic technology and the first of its kind worldwide. In this innovation, KRONES combines the general advantages of preform sterilisation provided by the Contiform AseptBloc with our proprietary electron beam (e-beam) technology, which we developed specifically for this purpose. PreBeam sterilises preforms using accelerated electrons PreBeam – and no chemicals. PreBeam destroys even the toughest, most chemically resistant germs in an energy-saving process that leaves absolutely no chemical residue. The technology will be put into serial production following successful practical testing. Ergomodul/Ergomatic The new Ergo series is a completely modular concept for labelling technology. The base machine can be combined with different labelling stations which can be either permanently installed or interchangeable by way of docking systems. That ensures the highest possible level of flexibility. The new development also incorporates significant improvements to cost points, quality, ergonomics, safety, and environmental friendliness. The total cost of ownership is lower since the system uses less energy and consumables, allows for shorter changeover times, and requires less Ergomodul/Ergomatic maintenance. We are gradually expanding the range of available sizes in order to establish a complete series. DecoType The DecoType digital direct printing system makes possible individual, attractive design of round and oval-shaped plastic containers. For our customers, that means maximum flexibility and the shortest possible launch lead times for new products. Digital printing is especially well suited for marketing campaigns and product launches with short lead times. DecoType can print uneven product surfaces that existing labelling technology cannot accommodate. Moreover, the highly versatile decoration technology uses no adhesives and requires no label storage. We are adding more performance classes to the DecoType series to cover the entire market. DecoType Economic | Product responsibility 55 SyPro S Non-alcoholic beverages are gaining market share worldwide and syrup is often needed as a basic ingredient for these beverages. At drinktec 2013, KRONES presented a revamped design of a sugar dissolving and pasteurisation system. The entire sugar preparation unit from KRONES is modular in construction. It can be individually expanded and adjusted to suit different input materials. The compact design reduces the time needed for commissioning. In addition, Sypro S uses a heat recovery system to reduce energy consumption. The innovative inlet nozzle ensures fast, complete SyPro S dissolution of granulated sugar without the need for an additional pump or agitator in the tank. That shortens dissolving times and reduces energy consumption. With the Sypro S sugar-dissolving unit, KRONES is now able to deliver the entire syrup room from a single source. Viscofill KRONES developed the Viscofill series to handle products like jams and jellies, sauces and dressings, dairy products, and pet food in a precise, gentle, and hygienic process. Economic The dosing principle is a classic piston-type rotary filler that is particularly suited for filling highly viscous products and products containing large chunks or high particle concentrations. The following criteria were vital in KRONES’ development of the Viscofill series: greater hygiene, improved product quality, and more efficient processes. Pneumatically controlled valves and fully automatic cleaning processes meet Viscofill these criteria. The Viscofill series is divided into three types, each featuring different valve technologies to cover a wide range of food products and meet diverse customer needs. The variable Viscofill machine concept can handle cans as well as containers made of glass or plastic. BEVkeg With BEVkeg, the new, integrated system for single-use kegs made of PET, Krones ­offers a simple turnkey solution for serving fresh draft beer. The main advantage for customers is that the containers require no compressed gas for tapping and, ­because they are single use, also eliminate hygiene issues at “the bar”. The system is the result of collaboration between KRONES and the tapping systems specialists at Micro Matic. BEVkeg ensures high beverage quality from container production all the way to the beer glass. It protects beverages from temperature fluctuations and BEVkeg CO2 loss. BEVkeg is initially being offered to breweries but further development is ­underway to make it available to other sectors.

With the enviro programme, we are able to offer machines and lines that are setting industry-wide standards on all aspects of sustainability.” Martina Birk, enviro Officer enviro 57 58 enviro Standard of sustainability for machines and lines enviro informs the entire process of designing our machines and lines. The management and certification programme for environmentally compatible and therefore sustainable products was launched in 2008. It is a management tool that affects all stages of the design process. As an independent auditor, TÜV SÜD has confirmed that Krones has established a management system that results in energy and media efficient and eco-friendly ­machines and lines. The process is based on the Energy and Media Efficiency, Environmental Sustainability (EME) standard that TÜV SÜD developed as a basis for auditing and assessing resource efficiency and environmental compatibility. In addition, the enviro programme also includes a product certification process for verifying the promised enviro consumption data and environmental criteria. In all, 296 machines have been Status of enviro assessments at the end of 2013 ­assessed under enviro. Since the previous process required that each 50.00 % 46.28% individual machine undergo the enviro 45.00 % ­enviro assessment, the numbers are 40.00 % currently still rather low despite our 35.81% extensive assessment activities in 35.00 % 2013.

In all, another 30 individual machines were evaluated last year. That is far more than the 17 machines we had targeted for 2013. Twenty-five of the machines assessed in 2013 met the stringent enviro criteria without requiring any design modifications. The decision to present only enviro machines at the drinktec, the industry’s premier trade fair, in September 2013 helped us along here and made a clear statement that sustainable machine design is a high priority in our company. Krones documented the consumption values directly on the machines based on demonstration runs and showed great transparency in the information provided to visitors. A survey conducted among our staff during the fair showed that our employees consider the eco-friendliness and resource efficiency of our machines to be very important. Economic | enviro 59 We have to balance this view with the demands of the market, which demonstrates a widely varying propensity to invest in energy-efficient machines. This willingness is closely related to the payback periods that customers are willing to accept for their machines and lines. For this reason, it is important that we offer appropriate products for all of our customers. We will continue to offer machines that are not enviro-­ quality in their standard model but that can be brought up to this level with options. Many of these options are available as retrofits so that our customers can have the prospect of adding enviro performance at a later date. “Today’s customers want energy-efficient products and systems as well as excellent technical and technological characteristics for their machines and lines. Energy efficiency has become a key issue in our projects business in recent years as a result of energy price policies and trends. Manufacturers are called upon to make clear guarantees on consumption and, therefore, operating costs and to use this data to underscore their own products’ performance. Krones has developed a solid expertise in this area through enviro and the company’s engagement in energy consulting. And that is proving very valuable in our sales process.” enviro Matthias Pohl, Sales Plants and Components Central Europe In 2014, we plan to expand the strategy with the enviro 2.0 programme, which will support the systematic assessment of our machinery portfolio. Up to now, ­individual machines have been given an enviro certificate if they are identical to a previously certified model or if they have undergone an assessment of their own. That means that within the Contiform series only one size of machine was certified although the entire series shares many identical components. With the enviro 2.0 process, we will be able to assess KRONES’ broad range of products under enviro ­without having to repeat all of the certification steps for each individual model. In addition to expanding the certification concept in this way, we are also continuing to carry out the machine assessments in 2014. We plan to assess a number of individual machines under the existing enviro system in 2014 but will begin work on the first series assessments under enviro 2.0 as soon as the new procedure has been approved. We have been collecting enviro-relevant data from the suppliers of our third-party machines since 2013, thus expanding the programme’s reach. We are aware that we have only limited influence on these third-party machines. But we believe that our efforts certainly raise awareness of environmental impact and resource conservation as relates to machine components and assemblies.

That means that we begin thinking about possible potential for conservation or increasing efficiency as well as potential for reducing environmental impacts when we are still developing our machines and systems. The workflows in the product development process (PDP) include checkpoints that verify a design’s enviro compatibility. The guidelines set out in the enviro manual serve as the basis for the verification. Every new design includes a targeted examination of the enviro criteria. By weighting the individual environmental and resource-related testing criteria, we are able to draw conclusions early on about how the various factors will look in the overall machine evaluation. This includes matters such as: enviro Use of environmentally compatible materials and substances with low risk ­potential Promoting the recovery and reuse/recycling of materials generated and used Type, impact, and amount of emissions Consumption of materials Reducing accident potential and possible environmental impacts Type of energy supply, use of advanced processes and methods for efficient ­energy use Consideration of all materials that come into contact with the machine, e.g. lubricants After reviewing all of these criteria, the results are weighted based on their estimated impact. The machine then either is included in the list of assessed machines or undergoes an optimisation process in which improvements are reviewed. Only those materials that have been tested for their environmental impacts and hazardous materials class and are included in a whitelist/blacklist for engineers are used in enviro machines. In the product development process, these materials are systematically used to replace other materials in the standard machinery programme. For existing machines and machine series, modifications are made to bring the technology into conformity with enviro wherever possible based on the given specifications. In the Hydronomic UF series of water treatment systems, for example, the disinfectant used previously (chlorine) has been replaced with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) since chlorine does not meet the enviro criteria on environmental impacts. Economic | enviro 62 enviro saves resources LinaFlex tunnel pasteuriser Pasteurising filled and closed containers is one of the most energy-intensive processes in beverage production and filling. The LinaFlex already had monitoring and control systems that gave it several characteristics needed for resource efficiency. But more measures were necessary in order to achieve the high standard of an ­enviro machine. The LinaFlex is an example of how a standard machine can be fitted with enviro ­options for energy-efficient operation. Under these criteria, a larger number of recovery zones would be needed, which in turn might necessitate a longer machine ­design depending on the machine’s performance category. What measures make up the enviro option? enviro Heat recovery through energy recovery zones The enviro version requires 228 kW in heat energy, which corresponds to savings The sample calculation presented of 25% compared with the standard LinaFlex without the enviro option (303 kW). here is based on 0.25-litre cans at 40,000 cans per hour and a pasteurInsulation reduces the temperature of the machine’s outer surfaces isation level of 10 PUs. Insulation saves another 15 kW and improves total heat energy consumption by an additional 4%. As a result, the machine achieves a higher energy efficiency compared with the standard model. The combination of these two measures reduces the amount of heat ­required by around 30%. Heat recovery is improved by nearly ten percent, from around 60% to approximately 70%. enviro machines available in all core segments enviro is has been integrated across our entire portfolio of machines and systems. In process technology, we offer environment and resource-friendly machines and systems for producing beer in breweries, soft drinks in bottling plants, and milk-based drinks in dairies. In the area of bottling and packaging, we offer complete bloc solutions for manufacturing and filling PET bottles and for packing containers but we also provide individual stand-alone machines for filling, labelling, and inspecting.

Environmental | Transparency in resource consumption Energy consumption 69 Company-owned cogeneration plant for power supply Changing the energy supply matrix at the Neutraubling site has affected the presentation of data for 2013. At the start of 2013, Krones AG took over operation of the ­on-site cogeneration plant that had previously been operated by the utility company. Total energy consumption in 2013 was 124,756 MWh. Adjusted for 5,850 MWh in efficiency losses on the cogeneration plant (documented in actual measurements), the calculated energy consumption comes to 118,905 MWh. This indicates a 2.9% increase in energy consumption. If we take into consideration the increase in revenue in the same period, we see that specific energy consumption was down to 42.2 MWh per €1 million in sales revenue (previous year: 43.3 MWh). The 124.756 MWh total of ­energy drawn from external sources – which includes efficiency losses – yields a ­specific value of 44.3 MWh per €1 million in revenue. Energy consumed, absolute MWh and MWh per €1 million in KRONES AG revenue The data presented relate to consumption in our own buildings at the five German sites: Neutraubling, Nittenau, Flensburg, Freising, and 140,000 124,756 Rosenheim.

That will result in a change in energy data, which can be attributed to the changed energy production concept. Because of this change in energy sources, the shares of direct and indirect consumption by primary energy sources have also changed. We posted an 82% increase in natural gas consumption to 20.1 MWh per €1 million in revenue. However, this figure should be viewed in direct connection with a sharp reduction in electricity drawn from external sources. Our use of heating oil decreased by 8.3% year-on-year to 1.1 MWh per €1 million in revenue. Use of district heating was also down in relation to €1 million in revenue and is now at 4.43 MWh. That is a decrease of 43%. This reduction resulted from the elimination of district heating use at the Neutraubling plant. Of the district heating at the Nittenau plant, 100% was from biogas as before. The Rosenheim plant uses district heating that is 100% CO2-neutral and is generated without the use of a primary energy source. The Flensburg and Freising plants are operated without the use of natural gas or heating oil and draw district heating from local utilities. Apart from the switch to operating our cogeneration plant ourselves, the increases in energy consumption also result from a 9,340 m² increase in the size of our Rosenheim plant – that is an increase of around 33%.

For example, heat recovery systems were installed in the newly constructed EVOGUARD GmbH facility at our Nittenau plant. The systems reuse waste heat from the air compressors to heat the production halls. The same system was also put into use in the Neutraubling plant and has replaced around 15% of natural gas used in the relevant area, for savings of 257 MWh. Environmental | Energy consumption 71 Electricity use reduced further The trend in electricity drawn from external sources benefited from the change in This report does not include consumption data for our vehicle fleet our primary energy source matrix since we now generate a portion of our electricity (fuel) or data for energy consumed in our own cogeneration plant. Total energy consumption in 2013 was 62,369 MWh at installation sites. (previous year: 60,961 MWh). That corresponds to 22.1 MWh per €1 million in revenue, for a 3.5% reduction in specific electricity consumption. Electricity drawn from the utilities came to 52,726 MWh in 2013, which represents savings of 13.5% and is due to the fact that we are generating our own electricity in our cogeneration plant. According to information from the utility company, renewables accounted for 40.3% of the electrical power used at KRONES AG. Looking at our 5.7% revenue growth, we see that electricity consumption (+2.3%) ­increased less than revenue. Thus, we achieved a 3.5% reduction in electricity ­consumption per €1 million in revenue. With our energy management system, we are able to continuously review electricity loads and peaks. We are currently looking into possible improvements aimed at reducing electricity consumption in the paintshop ventilation systems at the Nittenau plant. Energy recovery technologies were included in the construction of the new building at the Rosenheim plant.

This due to the shift in energy sourcing as we are now operating the cogeneration plant ourselves. Thus, direct emissions came to 12,162 metric tonnes. Indirect emissions, which arise from purchased electricity and district heating, came to 20,986 metric tonnes. The reduction in CO2 emissions resulted in part from the more favourable CO2 emissions figures achieved by switching over to the natural gas-powered cogeneration plant, the increased share of renewable resources in our utility provider’s energy mix, and internal optimisation measures taken to reduce consumption. In relation to revenue, direct and indirect CO2 emissions amounted to 11.77 metric tonnes per €1 million in revenue, compared with 13.08 metric tonnes in the previous year.

By switching the manufacture of some parts from foaming to injection moulding, we were able to reduce our use of these substances 1,351 1,131 from 574 kg in 2011 to 416 kg in 2012 and now to 348 kg. That is a reduction of 39.4% since 2011. We plan to convert one more type of parts. However, it is not yet possible Environmental to eliminate foam-moulded parts altogether. We do not use other greenhouse gases. 2011 2012 2013 We had no emissions of ozone-depleting substances. Other air emissions Emissions of NOx and SOx are not measured continually. No measurement was ­required for 2013 for our facilities that are subject to a requirement that these ­emissions be measured every three years under the German Emission Control Act [Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz]. In 2012, such a measurement was taken at our Freising plant. In 2012, 0.345 metric tonnes in emissions were reported for NOx and 0.054 metric tonnes for HF. The next measurements for the Neutraubling facility are slated for 2014. The most recent mandatory measurements showed the following annual emission loads: < 0.088 metric tonnes HCl, < 0.109 metric tonnes dust, and 0.00016 metric tonnes Ni particulate. Environmental | CO2 emissions 75 ENVIRONMENTAL “In all, we reduced CO2 emissions by a further 4.87% compared to the previous year. Direct and indirect CO2 emissions came to 33,148 metric tonnes in 2013. As we continue to identify additional savings potential, such as in our consumption of electrical power, we plan to make further progress in the years ahead. We have to bear in mind, though, that this absolute reduction in our CO2 emissions is being achieved despite continuous growth – that is, increased production output.” Bertram Pretzl, Safety Engineer, Safety and Security Management 76 CO2 emissions from work-related travel reduced Work-related travel in miles flown (thousand miles) 76,525 72,201 69,677 70,000 66,160 61,457 59,284 60,000 50,000 40,000 30,000 20,000 9,776 9,473 9,395 10,000 967 891 999 2011 2012 2013 Total Intercontinental Europe Germany Environmental The increased expansion of our LCS Centres is showing its effects: Our total miles Average CO₂ emissions in 2013 flown in 2013 were down 8.95%.

The number of miles flown on long-haul flights was reduced by 10.4%. 67.95 56.42 Miles flown on domestic flights within Germany were up. However, as these flights make up only 1.4% of all flights, the increase of just under 12% is hardly relevant.

We kept this in mind when planning business trips. In 2013, our employees travelled 219,925 km by train. A calculation by Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s rail operator, provides an overview of the CO2 savings of 35 metric tonnes compared with comparable trips taken by one person in a passenger car. We do not have year-earlier figures for comparison. Compared with the previous year, we were able to reduce CO2 emissions from our company vehicle fleet by around 25%. CO2 emissions arising from car travel were also down. In 2013, these emissions CO₂ emissions resulting from car ­totalled 3,830 metric tonnes (2012: 4,573 metric tonnes). We believe this value – travel (metric tonnes) which was achieved with almost the same fleet of vehicles as in the previous year – is closely related to the fact that this was our first full year using the shuttle service 4,573 3,830 for airport trips. The total reduction was 16.2%. By making our vehicle fleet more flexible and gradually increasing our use of externally provided vehicles, we are making processes more uniform, which we expect will further reduce CO2 emissions from car travel. 2012 2013 Environmental | CO2 emissions 78 Freight forwarding logistics To ensure a high level of cost-effectiveness in transporting our machines and lines, all factors must work together perfectly. For example, production planning must be well coordinated with data from our freight forwarding logistics, as must the lead times needed for certain modes of transport. In certain cases, these conditions may necessitate last-minute changes in transport logistics in order for shipments to make their connections further down the line. Precisely these factors shape the data for the individual modes of freight transport. The data show that Krones used these flexible concepts in 2013. As a result, we are posting a 21.9% increase in road freight year-on-year. The share of loads forwarded by sea freight was up 0.2%. In contrast, air freight was down nearly 28%. Over the past three years, the share of air freight is down 38%.

That shows that freight transport logistics, which grew slower than revenue (5.7%) achieved a high level of cost-effectiveness and thus also improved resource conservation. A large part of the freight forwarded by sea – 5,038 containers – begins its journey to our customers around the world at our site in Neutraubling. Nearly 60% of these containers first travel by rail to ports on the North Sea. For those shipments whose dimensions required heavy cargo transports to the North Sea ports, emissions came to 693 metric tonnes of CO2 (previous year: 520 metric tonnes). A total of 1,353 truckloads reached other destinations by road, not by sea freight. ­Information on CO2 emissions resulting from these shipments is not available.

This is down roughly 1% from the year-earlier figure. Viewed against revenue, and taking revenue growth into account, water consumption per €1 million came to around 41 m³, a year-on-year reduction of 4.6%. Besides this water drawn from the municipal water supply, we also withdrew 1,429,533 m³ of groundwater for cooling our buildings at our Neutraubling plant. Optimisation of our building control systems enabled us to permanently reduce water consumption from the high year-earlier levels. All of this volume is fed back into the groundwater supply.

Waste water that must be treated came to a volume of 4,164 m³. This waste water is treated either in internal physical/chemical processes or in neutralisation systems. The discharge of this waste water is subject to testing under the German Self-Monitoring Ordinance [Eigenüberwachungsverordnung] or external checks. Contaminant loads in waste water from installations subject to licensing are far below the legally mandated limits. The data collected for the purpose of our environmental reporting did not reveal any significant spills in 2013. Environmental | Water consumption 82 Materials consumption Stainless steel is our material of choice. We use high-quality stainless steel of various compositions to manufacture machines used in the food and beverage industry. The material specifications depend on the concrete use and the requirements that the respective component must meet. For sourcing our stainless steel, we use major European manufacturers with high production standards, the majority of whom also report their output in a sustainability report. Apart from its high resistance and robustness in food and beverage applications, stainless steel is also highly recyclable. According to information from our biggest supplier, the share of recycled material in stainless steel is 83%. Of that, 32% is what is known as pre-consumer material – that is, raw material waste generated during manufacturing processes. Another 51% of the content is post-consumer material, which is defined as materials available at the end of a product’s use. Apart from stainless steel, significant materials used in our operations include copper, plastics, and aluminium. We have not collected data on the share of recycled content in these materials. Key raw materials sourced in 2013 Stainless steel 13,000 metric tonnes Plastics 500 metric tonnes Aluminium 800 metric tonnes Environmental Copper 1,000 metric tonnes Most of the waste and scrap material generated during production is reused as ­secondary raw materials as shown below. Environmental | Materials consumption Waste 83 Downtrend continues In 2013, we generated 14,483 metric tonnes of waste at our German plants. That is around 200 metric tonnes fewer than in the previous year. If we take into account the increase in revenue in 2013, we generated 5.14 metric tonnes per €1 million in revenue. A software solution installed in 2013 at our Neutraubling plant has lent transparency to our waste streams. It also has enabled us to monitor the amounts of waste that are approved and the amounts actually disposed of and to integrate quick-access documentation on the validity of our waste management records.

We generate around 90% of our revenue outside Germany. As we develop our workforce structure, we are steadily increasing the share of international employees so that we can be a powerful presence in all markets.” Labour practices Andreas Horn, Senior Vice President, Head of Human Resources and Social Affairs Labour practices 85 86 Labour practices and decent work Establishing structures for international HR development Our business is becoming increasingly international, as are our target markets. As such, we will gradually build up staff at our locations abroad. We have been pursuing this HR strategy for several years already and will continue to do so. We had announced changes in our group structure toward a more international orientation for 2013. Since the beginning of 2014, our new group structure has been handling our activities worldwide independent of legal units as an international process organisation. This means that our human resources management has to further internationalise its activities. We have to gear our HR processes to creating more local expertise in personnel development at our international locations. To this end, it is important to establish group-wide standards with highly transparent personnel development processes. This includes recruiting and qualification processes that are as uniform as possible as well as specialist training to address core subjects of HR organisation. We intend to pursue this strategy of gradually internationalising our HR processes and creating decentralised HR positions at our locations across the globe over the next few years. We are constantly striving to offer our employees individual solutions for their personal future development; be it in professional qualification, health maintenance, or life plans. These offerings are to help keep our staff socio-culturally varied with a healthy gender balance. Our markets expect a high degree of flexibility in realising innovative solutions adapted to the respective country as well as in the bidding process and job performance. For this, we need a corresponding flexibility reserve in our human resources. That means we will have to continue using temporary staff to some extent. We agreed on rules for limiting such temporary work contracts and taking the respecLabour practices tive persons over into permanent employment with our Works Council last year. Labour practices and decent work | Establishing structures for international HR development Workforce structure 87 We are growing even more international KRONES hired 325 new employees in 2013. That brings our workforce up to 12,285 employees for a year-on-year increase of 2.7% over the previous year’s 11,963. In keeping with our strategy to bring our activities closer to our customer markets, almost all of the workforce growth took place outside Germany. In this way, we are increasing our local value creation, particularly in the International Operations and Services business unit and significantly improving our ability to respond to customers’ needs. Within five years, we have increased the share of employees abroad by 56% to 3,187. Employees outside Germany now make up 25.9% of the Krones Group’s workforce, which is once again up year-on-year (previous year: 24.1%). Of our 3,187 employees working abroad, 364 are in Italy, Spain, France, the UK, the Netherlands, and Scan­ dinavia.

Labour practices and decent work | Workforce structure 88 Staff continuity The fact that our ratios of staff in terms of function, leadership, and work categories has hardly changed year-on-year speaks to the stability of our human resources planning. We can expect a significant change in our leadership structure in 2014, as the new group organisation has allowed us to trim down our leadership structures. In 2013, we employed 720 persons (2012: 722) in task-force management positions. We are already seeing the effects of further internationalisation in our job categories. As functions move to our locations around the globe, both administration and production at Krones AG became a little leaner. Temporary work contracts will remain a topic of discussion. We announced in last A voluntary commitment of year’s report that we are working on a solution to reduce the share of temporary staff Krones AG – as stated in a works agreement – stipulates that from in our company. For the time being, however, we expect an increase in temporary April 2014 employees shall be paid work contracts to 13.1 % due to high capacity utilisation at our Freising and Flensburg according to the compensation factories. schedule of the general pay agreement. In 2014 and 2015 we will be taking over 100 temporary staffers per year into regular employment. This gradual reduction of temporary work contracts and the regular employment of former temporary staff give us better planning security on the human resource side. We also agreed that the share of temporary staff on annual average may not exceed 8% of total staff per location by 2015 and should fade to 6% from 2016 onwards. The Works Council may agree to a higher share in individual cases. We will have to adapt our processes to meet these targets.

Krones AG takes responsibility for its employees quite seriously and will implement all corporate decisions on restructuring production or work processes in a socially responsible way. We have not laid off any staff for operating reasons in recent years. We intend to generally work out agreements with any affected staff should a business decision to restructure work processes or organisational units become necessary in the future. Such agreement may include flexible deployment to other positions within our company or qualification for other jobs. Thanks to our flextime accounts, we are prepared for a possible capacity reduction for economic reasons if we face underutilisation. We will coordinate any and all measures in works agreements with employee represen­ tatives. Volker Kronseder, Chairman of the Executive Board, and Norman Kronseder, Member of the Supervisory Board, are making arrangements to ensure the future orderly transfer of their Krones shares to their children. With that, they have taken proactive steps to continue the company’s tradition as a successful family enterprise. The existing pooling agreement, under which the voting rights of all members of the Kronseder Labour practices family and their enterprises are exercised as a voting trust, remains unaffected by the transfer agreements described above. In this way, the Kronseder family retains a 51.85% stake and remains a stable majority shareholder of Krones AG. One example for our approach to strategically necessary restructuring measures Krones AG values high job stability is the 2012 works agreement on the establishment of EVOGUARD GmbH as an in­ and has entered into works agreements on job security to run for dependent company for our valve technology domiciled in Nittenau, Germany.

Similarly, when we began co­ operating with Klug GmbH of Teunz, Germany, and ceased our own material flow/­ intralogistics activities, we offered the 70 or so affected employees equivalent jobs in other areas of Krones AG’s operations. To revamp our logistics activities in Project Logistics 2015+, we are collaborating with the Works Council on concepts for transitioning affected staff to other group operations. We will waste no time in finalising the works agreement planned for this, since it will serve as a clearly defined base for plans and actions going forward. Labour practices and decent work | Workforce structure 90 Variety and equal opportunity Krones AG has to face demographic reality. A glance at the age structure of our staff clearly shows a high proportion of employees 45 years and older. Many of these employees will remain in the workforce until they reach retirement age at 67 ac­ cording to current legislation. That means we can continue to benefit from their ­experience for quite some time going forward. We are closely collaborating with our Works Councils and in-house medical service as well as our respective corporate ­departments in developing measures to appropriately consider the needs of these employees. The back health awareness days in April and June 2013 showed that our health maintenance offerings are reaching their target group. The average age of persons taking advantage of this offering by Krones AG’s corporate health insurance came to 42.01 years. We are also offering our older employees an early retirement option that allows them some freedom for individual retirement planning independent of legislation. The works agreement on partial retirement provides for gradually phasing down work life. At 31 December 2013, 266 employees were in partial retirement. That is 3.4% of our workforce.

As part of Krones AG’s involvement in the programme entitled “ff frauen führen – Regionale Bündnisse für Chancengleichheit” (“Women in Leadership – Regional Alliances for Equality”), Krones has entered into a works agreement in which we undertake to: set appropriate and realistic goals for increasing the share of women in management positions and develop concrete HR policy measures to achieve this goal. The increase in the share of women in management is to come primarily from within our own ranks. Our target is to bring the number of women in management up from the current 42 (5.8% of our 724 management personnel) to 52 in 2015.

However, they may not immediately realise that themselves. It often takes some initial labOuR pRaCtICES awareness work to break down popular prejudices. It is important to me that female employees get a chance to evolve their careers by tackling new tasks and issues. One should just take an objective look at their skills and talents.

And this rate includes all reasons for termination. Although the turnover rate has increased 0.3 percentage points year-on-year, it is still far below the 6.5% average for the mechanical engineering sector, indicating a very loyal workforce. We think that a higher turnover rate in the younger age groups is only natural. Younger people often have much more volatile lives both privately and professionally and their greater mobility exacerbates that.

In 2013, 98 Krones employees made use of our sabbatical option to take a time out from work. The corresponding works agreement took effect in 2008 and helped Krones save costs in the crisis year of 2009. That our staff so broadly accepted this offer shows their strong need for new professional inspiration. The sabbatical option is open to employees that have been with Krones for two or more years. Eligible employees can apply to take up to six months off at reduced pay and then return to the same job afterwards. The reception of parental support and sabbaticals have alerted our HR management to the fact that helping our staff balance work and the rest of their lives is important and requires programmes that best allow them to do that. For 2014, we are planning to develop a programme for our exempt employees to take time off for personal reasons. We believe this group of employees especially deserves a dependable framework for flexible work time. Telecommuting has so far been handled without a fixed standard. We are planning to formulate uniform regulations for telecommuting group-wide. Fair working conditions and cooperation based on trust are a fundamental part of our activities. Our participation in the UN Global Compact documents this commitment as we have made its ten universal principles the very basis of everything we do. Freedom of assembly and fair and appropriate working conditions are an integral part of our Code of Conduct and binding for all Krones employees. Employees whose pay is determined by collective agreement total 6,199 and make up 74.8% of KRONES AG’s workforce (previous year: 75.1%).

Labour practices and decent work | Balanced lifestyle 96 Reliable and fair The provisions of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz) ensure that KRONES AG employees are represented in the company’s supervisory and monitoring body. The individual representatives are listed in Krones AG’s annual report. Thus, employee representatives can discuss and influence key business decisions with an impact on employment policy early in the process. Comprehensive employee benefits Krones offers an extensive range of employee benefits. These are available not only to full-time employees but also to part-time employees. These benefits and the conditions attaching to them are available for all employees to see on our Intranet and are identical for all of our sites in Germany. With the revision of our conditions for temporary employment, we have also opened up access to Krones AG’s community facilities to our temporary employees. That is in keeping with § 13b of the German Labour practices Labour Leasing Act (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz). Major benefits provided to employees include travel health insurance, group personal accident insurance, the in-house medical service, and access to the company health insurance fund. In addition, we also offer our employees a hardship bonus for shift work, a commuting allowance, and reimbursement of travel costs. The Hermann-­ Kronseder-Unterstützungskasse assistance fund paid out around €170,000 to employees to assist in circumstances of special need in 2013.

Krones offers an extensive array of health services to help our employees get advice on staying healthy and implement that advice in their day-to-day work. The Works Council, company counselling service, in-house medical service, and company health insurance fund (BKK KRONES), are all involved in developing these programmes. Our human resources department has set a goal of coordinating and expanding the variety of programmes offered to support employees who are unable to work as well as prevention programmes.

In addition, 450 employees (previous year: 270) participated in group development reviews. This form of competence management is designed for production staff involved in group work. In these development reviews, employees and their supervisors work together to identify any need for further training or qualification for the year ahead. This approach helps us ensure that all employees have access to targeted, strategically appropriate development opportunities. In addition, a catalogue of existing com­ petences and needs is presented in a transparent way. This results in efficient use of our continuing education and training budget. Labour practices In all, participation in various courses and seminars to support the development of our employees’ skills and expertise totalled 20,300 in 2013 (2012: 18,200) and the budget came to €2.9 million (2012: €2.5 million). These course offerings were utilised by 5,930 employees (2012: 5,820 employees), who booked their courses from a catalogue of 570 options through our training portal. On average, €490 of the total continuing education budget went towards each participant in a continuing education or training course in 2013. Every training measure will be monitored and evaluated: The participants complete a questionnaire in which they rate the items “information and topicality”, “content”, “practical relevance and applicability”, and the lecturer. In interdisciplinary courses, we furthermore send out questionnaires on the learning results after about three months that serve to rate the applicability of the learned content in practice. Labour practices and decent work | Qualifications 102 The continued learning measures focused, among other things, on integrating Krones colleagues from our locations abroad: The product portfolio courses on new machinery and LCS courses attracted a total of 66 international participants. Other key subjects included TPM and lean management, quality management, presentations for product specialists, and systems and software. We are also offering a topical curriculum of our corporate continued learning courses at our locations abroad. In 2013, we went international with our Krones Service Code course that teaches our sales force valuable communication tools for working with customers and on-site teams.

These courses have been supporting our managers in their tasks since 2005. In 2013, 160 employees enrolled in the leadership seminar and a follow-up session for indepth discussion of leadership and communication tools to use in their management tasks. Labour practices We supplement this course with management feedback where the participants get anonymous feedback from their staff to promote reflection and leadership competence development. This gives our management talent a differentiated and comprehensive picture of how their staff perceives their leadership style and inspiration for their management techniques. It also gives the staff an opportunity to communicate their impressions, expectations, and needs to the manager through the feedback ­process. Labour practices and decent work | Qualifications 103 “We have established a feedback process as a key component of our leadership development to help managers in their professional growth. In 2013, 86 managers used the feedback process for the first time. Some 600 staffers had the opportunity to anonymously give their managers systematic feedback.” Doris Pechler, Vice President, Head of Personnel Development Expanding international horizons Another option for Krones employees to develop professionally and gather experience is our international exchange programme, Across Borders. This programme Labour practices ­allows our employees to gather professional experience at Krones locations abroad. New workplace requirements often include international communication skills. In 2013, Krones launched its Across Borders programme to promote international ­exchange among Krones employees around the globe. Last year, 15 of our employees went abroad to another Krones location for six months, where they got to learn new processes and work on projects with their colleagues on site. The spirit of the programme is that colleagues from all over the world will be able to work well together on future projects when they learn to communicate know-how both ways. In 2013, the Across Borders programme sent ­employees to Kenya, South Africa, Brazil, Thailand, Denmark, China, and Indonesia. Krones employees from China and South Africa came to Neutraubling to expand their professional horizons and make friends with their German colleagues. Labour practices and decent work | Qualifications 104 “Africa is one of the most important target markets for KrOnes cleaning machinery. That is why I applied for a work exchange to Kenya through the Across Borders labOuR pRaCtICES programme. I learned much there about the local conditions for our machines on customer sites. As a result, I will be able to better assist in the development of machinery optimised for this market going forward. Over numerous meetings with customers in Kenya, I also learned a lot about the needs of our customers there. I was even able to help my Kenyan colleagues with technical tips, for instance, in service and repair, upgrade installations, or water saving measures.” Frank Hartmann, Order Clarification and Order Processing, Product Treatment and Cleaning Technology 105 Africa and China – Qualification and training projects Our Nairobi training programme offers local service staff a compact course on metalworking and wiring basics. The participants are Krones employees in extended job training. Krones team member, Ishmael Nyasani, is working on electrical ­installations at our Neutraubling factory. In the second half of 2013, we launched a project to improve training structures in Africa for a broader technical qualification of our local employees. Our modular Labour practices training series teaches about 25 employees at our Nairobi, Kenya, location the fundamentals of technical requirements they need to know for servicing our machines and plants. When the programme finishes at the end of 2014, we will have a local staff with uniform technical expertise to serve our customers on site. One of the long-term objectives of this programme is to collaborate with local technical schools and the Kenyan government to improve training structures there. Our goal is to establish a 2-year training programme by the end of 2015. This is how Krones supports the revamping of the local training system. In contrast to Africa, where our qualification programme trains service staff who are already active, our Chinese programme offers vocational training to high-school graduates. We are continuing the vocational training programme that we started in 2012 in China. Last year, we admitted a total of 72 new students, who will get their professional qualification over a period of three and a half years. The new students are 39 future mechatronics engineers and 33 aspiring metal milling machinists. Labour practices and decent work | Qualifications 106 Vocational training Constant commitment to training With a training rate of 6.0% (previous year: 5.8%), we continue to pursue a strategy of growing most of our young talent in our own apprenticeship programmes. This ensures the highest possible knowledge and understanding of the work involved in our industry. With these apprentices and trainees, we have a supply of highly motivated young people who are acquiring the skills and knowledge they will need for manufacturing and marketing our machines and lines right from their first day of training. In 2013, 141 new apprentices started their careers at Krones. Of the young people employed in vocational training programmes, 377 (previous year: 368) were in industrial/technical fields and 69 were in commercial program­ mes. Eighty (80) young people are currently pursuing a dual course of vocational training and university study at Krones. We were able to once again increase the share of female apprenctices to 22.1% (2012: 20.4%). We were able to offer all of our apprentices jobs upon completion of their vocational training again in 2013. Going forward, the company’s policy for hiring apprentices will be closely linked to our growth strategy since we do not intend to pursue further growth in Germany. We do not plan to further grow our workforce in Germany. However, given the low rate of age-related attrition, this is precisely what would happen if we were to permanently hire all of our apprentices. For this reason, we will have to revamp our hiring policies with this in mind. However, to offset this change and support school leavers, we have increased the number of spots in our vocational training programmes. We are confident that young people who have trained at Krones will leave with outstanding qualifications and the skills they will need to have the best chances of a good start to their careers.

KRONES AG invested €211,000 in a state-of-the-art training centre at its Freising site. The most important goal of the conversion of the 315 square meter hall was to create optimum working conditions for the apprentices. Merging the separate work areas for welding and machining into a single complex including a training classroom and an office for the master craftsmen has brought everything much closer together and simplified supervision of both areas. At present, 25 young people are in vocational training at Freising – primarily in the fields of plant fitting (with a focus on sheet metal working and welding) and milling machine operation (with a focus on turning and milling). In addition, the site has three technical product designers, who must also complete a basic course in metalworking, and a warehouse logistics specialist. Varied training programme Labour practices Our need-oriented staff development is constantly adding new programmes that According to information from the are custom-tailored to individual interest groups and requirement profiles.

Labour practices and decent work | Vocational training 108 The Start-Up Engineering programme launched in March 2013 and will take a very different approach. Four graduates of the dual course of vocational training and university study and scholarship recipients from Krones AG in the mechanical and electrical engineering departments will receive extensive engineering training during a work-study tour de force through various technical departments, making them well-rounded generalists. The graduated engineers can then go on troubleshooting in various product areas as needed.

That is a 15% reduction from 2012. All of our plants, with the exception of Rosenheim, have reduced their accident numbers significantly from the previous year. Considerable progress towards reducing work-related accidents was achieved in Nittenau and Flensburg. In the previous three years, there have been around 40 work-related accidents per 1,000 employees each year here. Targeted measures in the area of occupational safety at these sites, such as the introduction of TPM Pillar 8 (Safety, Health, Environment) and stepped-up, systematic workplace inspections, are yielding effects. For 2013, both plants were able to achieve accident rates of 30 or fewer.

With 17.1 reportable accidents resulting in three or more days of lost time per 1,000 employees (2012: 18.8), Krones has less than half as many such accidents as the industry average reported by the employers’ liability insurance association (40.9 in 2012). With IMS certification for our site in São Paulo, Brazil, complete, we now have occupational safety data for a site outside Germany: The rate of accidents per 1,000 employees resulting in 1 or more days of lost time came to 14.3 there (previous year: 12.6). Occupational health and safety management is certified under BS OHSAS 18001. This covers all of our German sites as well as, currently, the production sites in Brazil and (since December 2013) China. That means 9,421 of our employees are covered by these occupational safety and health activities.

The safety and health of all of our employees is a top priority for KRONES. This principle is firmly established in our Code of Conduct. All of Krones’ activities are in keeping with uniform, externally certified rules for occupational safety, which were defined as part of the OHSAS certification and the Occupational Health and Risk Management System (OHRIS). These provisions go above and beyond regulatory requirements. In addition, we influence our external partners’ occupational safety and environmental protection activities. Every employee is instructed on general and workplace-specific safety topics by their manager or supervisor at least once a year. This also includes new hires and temporary employees. Comprehensive rules and standards govern the way we handle occupational safety at our German sites. As a result, no formal agreements with trade unions are needed. Employee representatives exercise their legal right to be involved in matters of occupational health and safety by way of the committee on “occupational safety, health protection, workplace design, and environmental protection at work” as well as participation in the legally mandated formal occupational safety committees for each individual plant. As a result, 100% of the total workforce is represented on KRONES AG’s occupational health and safety committees. Targeted actions and competent teams ensure safety Labour practices Our emergency response team in Neutraubling provides rapid assistance when something happens. Whether it’s a fire alarm, water damage, hazardous weather, or a work-related accident, the team handles the situation for those crucial first minutes following the event until external help arrives on the scene. In all, 11 employees from the central company safety and health department and 25 external factory ­security personnel make up the team in cooperation with the in-house medical service. Krones organises regular safety training courses on specific topics, which are then held at all of the German sites. In 2013, fire safety days and “light week” were held at all five German plants. In addition, evacuation drills were conducted in accordance with a group policy to prepare employees for such a situation. The LCS Centres conduct their own training sessions and focus activities in accordance with local requirements. In Brazil, for example, this also includes information about AIDS.

The committee follows our charitable giving policy, which includes specific fund allocation guidelines. Our management approach to community involvement excludes donations to political parties. We refuse to support any political party and have stipulated such in our charitable giving policy. An important aspect of our external communications and our dialogue with the ­various stakeholders is our collaboration with associations. We are involved in many technical and scientific committees, which facilitate and support the advancement of science while ensuring that our employees have access to information on cutting-edge research. We are open to new forms of communication and integrate them into our communications system. This is also how we connect with interested parties and offer fast and timely information. In order to ensure that we are engaging our stakeholders properly and responding to their concerns in the medium and long term, we conduct online and in-person surveys on a variety of topics. We use the results of these ongoing activities to further develop our stakeholder dialogue strategy. Society Society | Engaging with all stakeholders 115 Offering multiple paths to dialogue Our goal is to fully engage each individual stakeholder and deliver comprehensive information, and we use a tailored communications approach to achieve it. In August and September 2013, we surveyed our stakeholders in an effort to evaluate our external communications and gather insights about the importance of our various communications channels. We chose three different ways to connect with our stakeholders, placing the survey on the KRONES homepage, our Facebook page, and on iPads at the drinktec 2013.

Society | Engaging with all stakeholders 116 Seeing our sustainability through the eyes of others Krones chooses to pursue sustainable activities because we believe that protecting resources is an important aspect of our corporate strategy and not because it might improve our image among stakeholders, investors or analysts. We understand that sustainability is a permanent part of doing business – and that there is still much room for improvement. Yet when we score better than other companies in this area, can’t help but feel good. It reaffirms our choice. In November 2013, KRONES AG received the German Investor’s Award for Responsible Business Practices. Volkswagen AG shared the honour with Krones. Companies were analysed on the basis of the “key performance indicators for extra/non financials” from DVFA/EFFAS and Sustainalytics core data. Prof. Dr. Alexander Bassen of the University of Hamburg provided accompanying scientific support for the survey.

In the industry rankvant to a listed company. ing for “machinery and systems ­engineering, multiple technologies”, Krones AG ranked 18th in Germany Associations – a platform for dialogue and 4th in the state of Bavaria. By maintaining memberships in select associations, we ensure that our employees have useful and precise information on relevant topics. These memberships also provide the opportunity to portray our company to the outside world. We are represented in the industry’s most important boards and use them as a platform for ongoing dialogue on the latest developments. For example, our Executive Board Chairman sits on the Board of the German Engineering Federation (Verband Deutscher Maschinenund Anlagenbau or VDMA). This allows us to help promote the image of the member companies in the industry as well as inform and shape policymaker opinion. We do not take individual positions, but instead participate in the discussion and the formation of an industry opinion. Thus, under no circumstances does Krones take a separate, formal position on curSociety rent issues. Society | Engaging with all stakeholders 117 Beyond this important membership in our broad-based industry organisation, we are involved in many other associations in order to take advantage of the opportunity to further advance research and keep up with the latest in administrative and organisational issues.

We foster this by keeping our staff regularly informed in our employee magaability, through the Brainpool. zine Inside KRONES, which is published three times a year. Beyond reporting on the company’s strategic focus, we also highlight employee accomplishments – everything from winning professional competitions to achieving results that move the company forward. The magazine also devotes, for example, a lot of space to the sustainable use of our resources. Topics like these are maintained and rated in our KRONES Brainpool platform. We publish the best proposals in Inside KRONES. In 2013, our staff submitted around 3,400 ideas that resulted in a total company savings of €4.37 million. These creative people developed 340 ideas for improvement in quality, energy and environmental protection alone, some 190 of which were put into practice in the same year. The proposals included everything from complex ideas for optimising the separation of shredded test bottles or improving the control of refrigerant dryer systems to simple ideas for reusing packaging and transport materials or extending the life of coolants. Society Society | Engaging with all stakeholders 118 Plant tours provide first-hand look Krones is a major employer at each of its sites. The company’s importance in each region is also reflected in the continued interest state governments and local communities have in our facilities. In 2013, Torsten Albig, Premier of the State of Schleswig-Holstein, visited our plant in Flensburg. Gabriele Bauer, the Mayor of Rosenheim, is in close contact with Rosenheim plant management and has been present on several occasions to celebrate new construction projects. Other stakeholders who reside near our plants – such as family members of employees or regional organisations – continue to show an interest in our company. As a result of this high interest in our production facilities, we offer tours of our Neutraubling site to employees and their family members. In 2013, the high demand for Rosenheim Mayor Gabriele Bauer (centre), Dr. Götz Brühl, CEO of the these tours made it necessary to reorganise the visitation process. In order to make Rosenheim public utility company the tours as readily accessible as possible to our employees without the need for ad(left), and Dr. Helmut Schwarz, ditional staff, we were able to bring on a team of company pensioners to be guides.

It is binding for all decisions made by the charitable giving committee. In 2013, parties. That is specified in our charitable giving policy. around €553,000 was made available to a number of interest groups. A portion of the budget is used for day care centres in Neutraubling and Rosenheim. These day care centres offer childcare to the children of KRONES employees as well as other community members in accordance with the local community operating license. In that respect, our funding also contributes to the community as a whole.

Danube River as well as the Inn River near our production facility. In an unprecedented act of solidarity, Krones employees at all sites cancelled the annual company party and as a result we were able to donate €275,000 to rebuilding in the affected regions. Krones also gave its employees time off work to volunteer with the volunteer fire brigade, THW (Federal Agency for Technical Relief), water rescue, DLRG (German Life Saving Association), and other aid organisations. If we take into account the resulting 560 or so absences – costs that will not be passed on to the communities – Krones ultimately contributed another more than €200,000 to the flood ­relief. After the devastating Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, Krones provided rapid aid outside its charitable giving budget, with no red tape. Society Due to the poor drinking water conditions caused by the typhoon, Krones chose an unconventional form of aid, purchasing 180,000 water bottles for €30,000. The bottles were filled locally by Philippine Spring Water Resources Inc. and Nature’s Spring. Together with the Philippine National Red Cross and the ABS-CBN Sagip Kapamilya Foundation, Alberto Diego, Head of Philippine Representative Office, helped distribute the water to the affected cities.

Value chain The value of a product or service consists not only of the product or service itself. In some cases, it may consist of many various components that are produced along the stages of value creation. Several stages of value creation constitute a value chain. Value creation calculation The value created is determined by subtracting from the company’s performance (sales ­revenues and other income) the advance payments necessary for bought-in goods and ­materials, depreciation and amortisation, and other expenditures. The origination of the value creation is set against its use. glossary Goals and actions GLOSSARy KRONES at a glance KRONES offers machinery and complete systems for filling and packaging and for beverage production.
