Some suppliers are more advanced than others in terms of the sustainability and responsibility of their operations. So our approach must meet different needs and build capabilities over time. Our supply chain is long and complex – there are typically four to eight layers between Nokia and any mining activities for the sourcing of metals used in phone components; our challenge is to work actively to increase transparency through all of these layers. See ‘Nokia and Suppliers’, chapter 3.4 Custumer Satisfaction, Customer Customer satisfaction, product safety and protecting customer privacy are top priorities for Nokia. Privacy, Product Safety Delivering customer satisfaction is first and foremost about creating value for our trade customers and the people who use our products. One important aspect of this is increasing the sustainability of our devices throughout the their lifecycle. Our products must be safe for both people and the environment. Protecting customer privacy has always been important to Nokia. And its importance grows as we develop new services and bring more people online through the internet and mobile technologies. Through these services, people are using and sharing their personal information in new contexts, and it’s important to us that we do our part to help them understand the implications. Nokia manages this issue with the highest intergrity. See ‘Customer Engagement’, chapter 2.2.4 Our Economic Impact As a global company, the Nokia Group has a significant economic impact, both directly and indirectly. Our direct economic impact on different stakeholder groups in 2012 can be summarized by the following figures: Net sales €30,176 million. Total purchases of goods and services from suppliers: €21,125 million. Wages and benefits to employees: €7,183 million. Dividends to shareholders: €755 million. Interest to creditors: €277 million.

See ‘Takeback and Recycling’, chapter 3.1.5 Green Operations & Facilities Although Nokia is not part of an energy-intensive industry, our operations do have an environmental impact through energy consumption and resulting emissions. We work continuously to reduce and control our environmental footprint. As the number of devices that can access internet increases, so too does the energy consumption of our data centers. The environmental impact of our activities is an area where stakeholder interest, with various reporting requirements, has increased in recent years. In extreme cases, non-compliance with various regulations and customer requirements can cause risks to our operations. See ‘Our Environmental Impact’, chapter 3.3 Green Supply Chain & Logistics The vast majority of the environmental impact of a Nokia device comes from our supply and logistics chains. That’s why we work closely with our suppliers and logistics service providers to reduce this impact. Our main focus is on energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, waste and water use. We encourage our direct suppliers to set reduction targets, and we follow up on their performance. We also require suppliers’ sites to be ISO 14001 certified. Our major challenge is the size of our supply chain, where we and our first-tier suppliers represent only part of the overall environmental impact of our devices.

However, two practitioners using the same standards are likely to get different results.

The various schemes managing this collection and recycling are operated and financed by the equipment producers. Municipal collections, specified waste management sites, and shops selling equipment manage most of the collection. The update was approved in 2012 and sets even more ambitious collection targets. In the EU context, a challenge for reaching higher collection targets is leakage, that is waste equipment that isn’t monitored by existing national collection channels. Leakage occurs because much of household electronic waste still has value at the time of disposal, and is sold for second-hand use (often abroad) or for recovery of its components after collection. Similar legislation for e-waste collection is in force in many other countries around the world, and more discussions and developments have started.

That’s equal to the emissions of 5.0 GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE flying 15 million people once around the world. A recent study USING MOBILE DEVICES TO WORK REMOTELY 6.0 NOKIA KEY DATA shows that many people have already done this: 6.2 NOKIA GROUP KEY DATA • 17% have replaced their car navigator If only 10% of people using Nokia devices used their mobile phone to work remotely once a week instead of driving to work, • 12% have replaced their music player there would be a reduction of about 62 million tonnes of C02 • 7% have replaced their camera emissions each year. • 6% have replaced their video camera This is more than the annual fossil fuel-based emissions of • 3% have replaced their game console countries like Portugal, Colombia or Nigeria. This means that the 1,454 people who participated in the study have saved over 43,000 kg of CO₂ emissions. USING MOBILE DEVICES FOR IN-CAR NAVIGATION Nokia provides excellent solutions for these, most notably the PureView camera technology, with impressive results even in lowlight conditions, as well as HERE Drive for in-car navigation. Several studies show that using car navigation services can result in fuel savings of 5% to 15%. The NAVTEQ Navigation Benefits Study (2009) showed that, with regular use, people actually drive shorter distances and spend less time driving. As a result, fuel efficiency increased by 12% and saved about 375 liters of fuel, a reduction of close to one tonne of C02 emissions annually. People also drove nearly 2,500 km less, which would save 1.19 million tires in Germany alone. If 10% of people using Nokia devices reduced their driving-related C02 emissions by 5% with the help of navigation, that would result in a reduction of C02 emissions of over 22 million tonnes per year. This equals the annual C02 emissions of about 6.5 million cars. 3.0 NOKIA & THE PLANET NOKIA PEOPLE & PLANET REPORT 2012 94 3.2.1 Replacing Several Products with One Smartphone 1.0 ABOUT THIS REPORT CASE STUDY 2.0 NOKIA & PEOPLE BROWSE THE INTERNET USING YOUR MOBILE DEVICE 3.0 NOKIA & THE PLANET 3.1 A LEADING ENVIRONMENTALLYHelping consumers reduce their CO2 emissions RESPONSIBLE PRODUCT RANGE With the same amount of energy used for one Facebook status 3.2 ENABLING SUSTAINABLE LIFESTYLE update with a desktop computer, you can post over 100 updates 3.2.1 REPLACING SEVERAL PRODUCTS WITH with your mobile.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY The Management of Nokia is responsible for preparing the Selected sustainability information in accordance with the reporting criteria as set out in Nokia’s documented standards and GHG Protocol (hereinafter the “Reporting criteria”). PRACTITIONER’S RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Selected sustainability information based on our work performed. Our assurance report has been made in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We do not accept, or assume responsibility to anyone else, except to Nokia for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions that we have reached. Within Nokia Group, Nokia Siemens Networks sustainability information for 2012 has been assured by another service provider. For those performance indicators in our assurance scope, which include Nokia Siemens Networks data, we have relied on the other service provider’s assurance work, and hence we have not performed any assurance work separately on Nokia Siemens Networks data. We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 “Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 4.0 INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE NOKIA PEOPLE & PLANET REPORT 2012 132 Information”. This Standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 1.0 ABOUT THIS REPORT 2.0 NOKIA & PEOPLE perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters come to 3.0 NOKIA & THE PLANET our attention that cause us to believe that the Selected sustainability information has not been 4.0 INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria. INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE REPORT 5.0 GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a 6.0 NOKIA KEY DATA 6.2 NOKIA GROUP KEY DATA reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. An assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and other disclosures in the Selected sustainability information. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgement, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Selected sustainability information. Our work consisted of, amongst others, the following procedures: • Interviewing relevant management of Nokia. • Interviewing employees responsible for collection and reporting of the Selected sustainability information. • Testing the accuracy and completeness of the Selected sustainability information from original documents and systems on a sample basis. • Testing the consolidation of the Selected sustainability information and performing recalculations on a sample basis. CONCLUSION Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that Nokia Corporation’s Selected sustainability information has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria. Our assurance report should be read in conjunction with the inherent limitations of accuracy and completeness for sustainability information. This independent assurance report should not be used for interpreting Nokia Corporation’s performance in relation to its principles of sustainability.
