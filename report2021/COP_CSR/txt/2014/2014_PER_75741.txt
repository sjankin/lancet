ALLIANCES AND PARTICIPATION 154 LETTER FROM THE MAN DEAR FRIENDS: It is with great enthusiasm that we present to you our Tenth Sustainability Report, corresponding to ﬁscal year 2013. Over the last ten years, following a transparency policy aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), we have shared with our stakeholders information related to the economic, social, and environmental performance of the Company, as well as our achievements and challenges in sustainability management. At UNACEM we are committed to doing business in a responsible way with respect for our surroundings, and creating value for all of our stakeholders. With that purpose in mind, we created a sustainability strategy that is based on our staff members, as ambassadors of responsible behavior. This strategy is also aligned with our corporate values, which are the backbone of the Company’s organizational culture. We thus create development opportunities for our community, for our suppliers, and for our home improvement customers, while also minimizing our environmental impacts. Thus sustainable business model in turn enables us to be more competitive in the market and increase our brand value. It gives us the opportunity to grow as an organization and contribute to sustainable development. With regard to our economic results, it should be noted that we achieved a cement dispatch of 5.6 million tons, 5.6% higher than in 2012. Thus, our total revenues came to S/. 1.785 million, 3.4% above the previous year. This was due to an increased production capacity as a result of the operation of a new kiln in the Atocongo Plant, which made it possible to cover growing internal demand, accompanying the development of the country and the expansion of the construction sector, which grow by 8.6% in 2013, at an even faster pace than Peru’s GDP. With these economic results, we maintained our position as leaders in the cement sector, a responsibility which we assumed with great optimism and a proactive attitude, seeking to create positive change in our surroundings. For this reason, we invested 20% more in 2013 than in 2012 in social projects aimed at building capacities among residents of the communities of Southern Lima and Tarma, so that they may become development leaders in their areas. We also continue to assume our environmental commitment, with the reduction of greenhouse gases in our production process, for which purpose we applied good practices such as the upgrading of our industrial plant; AGEMENT an increased use of natural gas; the generation of our own clean energy; and the development of alternative cements that are more environmentally friendly. We are aware of the fact that this is our main impact as an organization, for which reason we continue to spearhead the promotion of an environmentally friendly culture among our staff members and communities. This responsible behavior earned us several different awards in 2013, such as the “Entrepreneurial Eco-Efﬁciency Award” given out by the Ministry of the Environment; a “Socially Responsible Company (SRC)” qualiﬁcation from Perú 2021 and the Mexican Center for Philanthropy (CEMEFI); as well as being recognized for the ﬁfth straight year as an Exemplary Company for Latin America by the CEMEFI. These achievements were reached thanks to the commitment, hard work, and motivation of over 650 staff members, whose day-to-day labors made it possible for us to perform at a high level of quality, through safe and reliable operations. For this reason, we reafﬁrm our commitment to faithfully complying with the Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, to which we have adhered since 2004, as well as the transparency indicators of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which are the basis for the development of our entire sustainability strategy. Mr. Carlos Ugás Mr. Armando Casis General Manager UNACEM General Manager Asociación UNACEM 1 OUR AT UNACEM, WE MAKE USE OF INTERNAL SYNERGIES TO REINFORCE OUR COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING A SOLID AND SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY, RESPECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND THUS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY. With nearly 60 years of experience in the cement sector, we have become market leaders, with a share in excess of 50% nationwide. This enables us to aid in the country’s development, primarily through the construction of new infrastructures for public use that help improve the quality of life of the country’s citizens. To take on the new challenges of the market and integrally supply the construction center, UNACEM has diversiﬁed our businesses, enabling us to create internal synergies that build our response capacity and improve our competitiveness. As part of these efforts, seventeen years ago we created the company Unión de Concreteras S.A. (UNICON), an expert in the production of premixed cement. In 2007, we incorporated PREANSA, specialized in the construction and erection of industrialized concrete structures; and in 2010, we created Compañía Eléctrica El Platanal (CELEPSA), which operates the hydropower plant and supplies UNACEM and the national market with clean energy. On the other hand, as part of our internationalization process, in 2011 we inaugurated the Drake Cement plant in the state of Arizona, in the United States; and in 2012, we merged the companies Cementos Lima and Cemento Andino to create Unión Andina de Cementos (UNACEM), making use of the strengths and positioning of both companies to successfully accompany the country’s growth. With the formation of UNACEM, we reafﬁrmed our commitment to the development of the country and consolidated ourselves as the primary ally of the State and the construction sector.

At UNACEM, we carry out our business with a focus on sustainability, respecting the environment and creating value in our stakeholders, in keeping with our Corporate Responsibility Policy. For this reason, we created the Asociación UNACEM (previously the Asociación Atocongo), which is responsible for strengthening the organization’s sustainable vision and implementing the social responsibility strategy of the UNACEM Group, aligned with our business objectives. Our sustainability model includes the development of economic, social, and environmental aspects, prioritizing the management of the industry’s main challenges within each one of these areas. This model is based on the commitment of our staff members, who align their behavior with our corporate values, acting as responsible management ambassadors within the Company and its surroundings. On the one hand, with regard to the economic aspect, we focus on ethically managing our business, as well as ensuring transparency and inspiring market and investor conﬁdence. In social terms, on the other hand, we share the results of our responsible behavior with suppliers, contractors, and clients by transmitting our good practices and management standards. We also have a special commitment to our local communities, whom we support through capacity building and institutional strengthening for their self-sustainability. Lastly, with regard to the environmental aspect, we are committed to mitigating the effects of climate change and promoting environmental care. SUSTAINABILITY MODEL ECONOMIC SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL Ethical Transmission of Reduction of Management good practices climate change to suppliers, impacts Transparency contractors, clients and market Environmental conﬁdence Capacity building citizenship and institutional strengthening in the community Each one of the Group’s companies manages its own sustainability model. Thus, for example, UNICON focuses on the responsible use of natural resources such as water, through the development of green concrete projects and the fostering of new initiatives involving a reduction in the use of energy and other materials for its production processes. On the other hand, CELEPSA, as a hydropower generator, supplies the market with clean energy. As such, its strategy is focused on the promotion of the appropriate use of water in its surroundings and the social development of the community. This business vision has enabled us to consolidate our leadership in the sector and build trust among our stakeholders, emphasizing a sustainable, ethical, and responsible management.

In 2013, the construction sector was one of the most dynamic in the country, with a growth of 8.6% (higher than that of the KEY GDP, which was around 5%), thanks to higher investment in FIGURES the construction of shopping and business centers, housing, industrial and mining plants, and other buildings. This S/. 1,785.2 BILLION IN SALES increased public and private construction activity drove the growth of the cement dispatch volume in Peru, which rose by 5.6 MILLION 9.1%, according to recent estimates. TONS OF CEMENT DISPATCH In keeping with this growth, in 2013 we increased our cement production and dispatch capacity. In July, we started the trial 5.6% period for Kiln I at the Atocongo Plant, enabling us to fully HIGHER THAN IN 2012 meet growing internal demand and position ourselves as the main cement producer in Peru. As such, cement dispatches rose by 5.6% during 2013, totaling 5.6 million tons. Thanks to this increase in sales, our market share remained above 50% in an environment marked by new competitors, mainly in the Company’s area of inﬂuence. With this sales level, our organization’s total revenues for ﬁscal year 2013 surpassed those of the previous year by 3%, totaling S/. 1.7852 billion. Nevertheless, net proﬁt fell by 43% (from S/. 358.3 million in 2012 to S/. 204.7 million) due to factors such as the lower average price for the mix of products, the 31.2% increase in ﬁnancial expenses, and signiﬁcant losses due to the foreign exchange difference resulting from liabilities held in foreign currency.

At UNACEM, we have an Environmental Management System aimed at promptly identifying the impacts caused by our operations, as well as establishing prevention and mitigation plans for these impacts. This system has four pillars of action, corresponding to the impacts identiﬁed: environmental quality; natural and cultural resources management; capacity building; and environmental certiﬁcations. We are conscious that one of the primary impacts of companies in the cement sector is the greenhouse gases emissions (GHG). For this reason, our management is focused on reducing GHG emissions in the production process, through the implementation of more efﬁcient and cleaner technologies. In this way, we contribute to the mitigation of the consequences of climate change. TABLE N.º 6 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PILLARS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY CAPACITY BUILING Comprehensive solid waste, air quality, Internal capacities (training of staff water, emissions, energy efﬁciency, members) and external capacities and climate change management (training of the community, contractors NATURAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND CERTIFICATIONS Management of biodiversity, Environmental projects such as: water archaeology, and soils footprint, carbon footprint. Certiﬁcations such as: ISO 14001 and Environment Impact Assessments ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ENERGY, EMISSIONS, AND CLIMATE CHANGE Conscious of the impact that our industry causes on the environment, we have implemented technological changes and initiatives in our production processes that enable us to reduce GHG and particulate matter emissions. EMISSIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM KEY FIGURES As part of this pillar of action, we have implemented technological changes and initiatives in our production processes, which enable us to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate 137,754 matter emissions. We also have an Emissions and Climate CERTIFIED EMISSION REDUCTIONS (CERS) Change Management Program, with ﬁve pillars of action: 1 FUEL CONSUMPTION Fuel consumption is the main source of emissions in the industry. To mitigate these emissions, we taken the following actions: A changeover from the carbon energy matrix to one based on natural gas, reducing emissions by 100,000 tons of CO2 annually in the manufacture of clinker and cement. As a goal for 2015, we seek to use alternative fuels such as the co-incineration of waste. With our fuel changeover project, we issued 137,754 Certiﬁed Emission Reductions (CERs) and sold 134,998 CERs to a company. As part of our commitment, we monitor the reduction of emissions generated by our project. 2 ELECTRICAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION Electrical energy consumption is high in the cement industry, for which reason we use clean energy for the generation of the electricity for cement manufacture. We own the following energy generation plants: “Generación Eléctrica de Atocongo” (GEA) thermal power plant: Production of 41.75 MW of energy, with seven generators that use 94% natural gas and 6% de diesel. “El Platanal,” “Central Hidroeléctrica Carpapata I,” and “Central Hidroeléctrica Carpapata II” hydroelectric plants. In 2014, the Carpapata III project will be initiated, enabling us to achieve a total capacity of 24 MW of clean energy. 2013 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT • 87 3 THE IMPROVEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES The improvement of industrial processes involves the upgrading of the industrial plant and the manufacture of blended cement. This line of action has included the following activities: Upgrading of Production Line I in Atocongo: Increase in kiln production from 7,500 to 15,000 t/day, in addition to a reduction in the consumption of electrical energy by 17% and thermal energy by 10% for each ton of cement produced. Manufacture and sale of blended cements, which require less clinker in their composition, thus decreasing the quantity of fuel used for their manufacture. For 2014, our goal is to measure UNACEM’s carbon footprint. Another goal is the rooﬁng project for the clinker yard at Condorcocha, which will decrease fugitive emissions produced during transport. 4 TRANSPORT OF MATERIALS With regard to the transport of materials, we have implemented initiatives that enable us to entirely mitigate safety and environmental risks. These projects include: The Atocongo-Conchán ecological conveyor belt, an underground transport system measuring approximately 8 km long that reduces the emission of particulate matter. Watering of internal roadways in raw materials storage areas, roads, and quarries with treated water. 5 RAISING AWARENESS AMONG STAFF With regard to raising awareness among staff, our internal priority is our human resources. For this reason, we keep our staff members updated and informed through training sessions and inductions that contribute to their professional formation and increase their environmental awareness. Environment Week, including seven talks, with the participation of 252 staff members. Environmental inductions for all contractors entering our facilities. In 2013, we trained 2,605 contractors over the course of 78 class hours.

THIS BLASTING MAINLY GENERATES VIBRATION IMPACTS, WHICH WE MANAGE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY THAT ENABLES US TO MITIGATE THEM. DUE TO THE FACT THAT OUR QUARRIES ARE LOCATED NEAR POPULATED AREAS, IN 2013 WE CONDUCTED A MONITORING STUDY AT THE ATOCONGO PLANT ON THE VIBRATIONS PERCEIVED BY THE COMMUNITY DUE TO BLASTING. WE RANDOMLY SURVEYED PEOPLE LIVING NEAR THE PLANT IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THEIR PERCEPTION OF BLASTING DAYS AND DAYS WHEN BLASTING WAS NOT PERFORMED. IN 2013, WE SURVEYED MORE THAN 800 PEOPLE FROM THE FOUR AREAS OF INFLUENCE. IN 2014, WE WILL COMPLETE THE MONITORING INTERVIEWS AND ANALYZE THE OPINION RESULTS AND TECHNICAL RESULTS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL AREA, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING A STRATEGY THAT WILL PERMIT US TO IMPROVE OUR RELATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY. ATOCONGO PLANT, LIMA 2013 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT • 91 RESPONSIBLE WATER MANAGEMENT Cement manufacturing is a dry process, for which reason it does not require signiﬁcant volumes of water compared to other industries. However, at UNACEM we are concerned about implementing an integral environmental management, involving the optimization of this resource. As such, our management includes the implementation of new technologies that allow for reuse and a reduction in the production processes, as well as raising awareness among our staff members. Some of our projects: WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS (PTAR) Allows us to treat 100% of the Company’s water. In the case of Condorcocha, in 2013 a new biocleaner technology was implemented, where microbes take care of cleaning the water. This ecological process requires less space and maintenance, and lower operating costs. The treated water from both plants is reused to water green areas, roads, supply the ﬁreﬁghting system and industrial processes. At Atocongo, this system has permitted a reduction in groundwater consumption of over 10,000 m3, with savings in spring water use at Condorcocha of over 9,849.6 m3 monthly, or 35% of all water used. “MAKE THE DIFFERENCE” PROGRAM This program seeks to create an environmentally responsible culture among staff members and contractors. For this reason, campaigns are carried out for the optimum use of water at the Company’s facilities. Additionally, as part of this program, a water-saving device was installed in all restrooms, resulting in reduced consumption in ofﬁces and plants. WATER FOOTPRINT In 2013, we measured our water footprint at the Atocongo Plant in order to establish a baseline for our consumption based on a lifecycle analysis. This made us one of the ﬁrst ﬁve companies in Peru to conduct this study, positioning us as a leader in the promotion of large-scale initiatives in the country. The work was done together with Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (COSUDE), which provided the technical support for the study through the NGO Agualimpia. The Project is known as Suizagua, and will continue through 2014 and 2015. The study results will come back this year, and based on that, we will draft an optimization and awareness-raising plan for this resource, involving our staff members, the production chain, and the community, with whom we have already worked on several water-related projects through Asociación UNACEM. TABLE N.º 9 WATER CONSUMPTION Of the total water consumed at Atocongo, 27.9% was reused, compared to 64% at Condorcocha 64%, which signiﬁed a reduction in the consumption of this important resource.

BY 94% We also seek to reduce the production of waste, optimizing our processes in order to decrease the consumption of certain materials and raise awareness among our staff members with regard to the proper use of resources and their separation. EXAMPLES OF OUR MANAGEMENT ATOCONGO PLANT Started the implementation of the composting plant to treat weed and mud waste from the wastewater treatment plant, destined for use as fertilizer in the maintenance of green areas. Donation of recyclable waste to the Asociación Las Palmeras de Villa, 94% more than in 2012. Training of 20 UNACEM supervisors and 112 contractors in appropriate waste management. CONDORCOCHA PLANT Recycling program aimed at staff members and communities: Talks, workshops, and contests were organized regarding the reuse of products, recycling, and composting practices. Environment Week: A handicrafts contest was held using recycled materials so that staff members could create added value for daily waste. Compost plant for the processing of organic waste: We have 14 compost heaps that receive 520 kg per day. The plant has a 30% efﬁciency, i.e. for every 10 tons of waste, it produces 3 tons of compost for use in improving soils and green areas. CORPORATE As part of the cement manufacturing process, we generate industrial waste such as Recovered Raw Meal (RRM). At UNACEM, we reused 100% of this, recycling it in the process, as well as using it as a concrete byproduct. Reuse of glass, clinker, contaminated soil, and construction waste, later processing them and using them in production processes.

For this reason, we have species research and recovery projects that allow us to mitigate these impacts. Additionally, all of our quarries have a Mine Closure Plan, wherein we commit to remediate the affected areas. MAIN INITIATIVES OF 2013 FLORA AND FAUNA Biological monitoring during the dry and rainy seasons in the mining concessions: Aimed at determining the seasonal behavior of the species during mining development. Flora and fauna research to learn about the plant life in the Lomas Quarry and how to conserve it. With the results, we are establishing a plan to reintroduce wild species after the closure of the quarry. At Atocongo, we have a zoo that is home to 24 species. The Las Dunas 3 mining unit is located in the buffer zone of the Paracas National Reserve. At this quarry, impact mitigation and species recovery procedures are applied. It should be noted that this activity fosters the formation of lake surfaces that attract new birds from the zone. CULTURE We perform archaeological studies before the start of operations at each quarry. We have the Tablada de Lurín site museum in Villa María del Triunfo, as well as an Archaeological Center in Pueblo Viejo, Pachacamac, under an agreement with the Pontiﬁcal Catholic University of Peru. CAPACITY BUILDING We hold workshops and training sessions for our staff members on environmental issues, aimed at raising their awareness and promoting a culture of respect for the environment, both on and off the job. MAIN INITIATIVES OF 2013 Fifteenth Annual Environment Week: 234 staff members participated.

In 2013, three audits were performed on all our contractors with regard to matters of compliance with policies, training, safety committees, accident investigation, critical work procedures, waste management, and environmental aspects. When nonconformities are detected, UNACEM advises the contractor on how to investigate the case and determine the plan of action. 2013 UNACEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT • 113 PURCHASES FROM SUPPLIERS In 2013, the amount of purchases in goods and services totaled more than S/. 1 billion.
