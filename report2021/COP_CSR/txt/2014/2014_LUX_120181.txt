The only airlines operating an intra-European network that are thriving are the low-cost operators. In Luxembourg, competition will become even tougher in 2014 with the extension of the EasyJet network to Lisbon. Luxair Luxembourg Airlines plans to open three new routes in 2014: Lisbon, Stockholm and Dublin. It is also foreseen to add a 6th daily rotation to London City and a second to Copenhagen. A 7th Bombardier Q400 will also be delivered in the spring of 2014. The 2014 Airline budget again foresees a strong increase in passengers (+14%) and income (+10%). Despite this increase, the operating result should still record a loss of around EUR 12 million due to increases in production costs and a rise in personnel costs. The beginning of 2014 has been promising with an increase in high-yield passengers compared to 2013 and the budget.

LuxairCARGO activity thus managed to improve its results with a significant growth (+9%) in volume handled in 2013. Nevertheless this progress has not enabled the volume of activity to regain its pre-crisis level. Since 2011, Luxembourg airport has ceded its position as the 5th largest air freight platform in Europe. It now oscillates between 7th and 8th place, lagging airports which host the European platforms of operators specialised in international express courier and transportation services, specifically UPS in Cologne, TNT in Liege and DHL in Leipzig. The activity linked to air freight handling, historically the driver of LuxairCARGO profitability, closed the year with a profit of EUR 1.7 million compared to a loss of EUR 3.4 million a year earlier.

The same reasons explain an increase in energy consumption compared to 2013 as the increase in activity necessitated greater use of infrastructures and Percentage of employees living in Luxembourg 65 65 equipment. Water consumption is slightly lower as the de-icing of planes which is known for requiring a large quantity of water was less frequent due to the winter of 2013 being warmer than in 2012.

Compared to 2012, the CO2 emissions per passenger transported have been reduced by 9% as a whole. gement. The number of hours of training per co-worker has increased by 7 % in 2013 compared to the previous year, which is not negligible considering the general context of cost reduction that LuxairGroup set itself in 2013. This increase was caused by the implementation of a training platform (including access to a catalogue of training course for each employee) alongside more frequent use of e-learning training schemes. At LuxairGroup, e-learning is a perfect alternative due to the wide range of working hours and jobs, which make organising on-site training courses complicated. In management of Human Resources, LuxairGroup relies on diversity (languages, jobs, cultures, nationalities), social mix whilst encouraging the integration of disabled people and reorganising work stations according to the framework of the reclassification process. Regarding gender parity, LuxairGroup is conscious that there is room for improvement in particular in managerial positions, but the company’s desire exists and this has been formalised to some extent by the integration of performance indicators in this report.
