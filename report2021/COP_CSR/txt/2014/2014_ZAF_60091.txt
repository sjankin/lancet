The company also has custom-cut arrangements with Ringkink and John Wright Veneer sawmills. The Processing Flow (refer to acƟviƟes in the business model on page 9): Final lumber product Timbadola Sawmill The Timbadola Sawmill in Limpopo has an annual intake capacity of 120 000 m3 and two custom-cut sawmills in Mpumalanga with a total intake volume of 150 000 m3. Sawmill and plantaƟons in the north operate in unison and are interdependent. The Timbadola Sawmill operaƟons are currently under review with the intenƟon to expand the mill and increase intake and producƟon volumes thereby ensuring the sustainability of the mill, plantaƟons and employment. The Timbadola Sawmill has been unproĮtable for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the increasing input costs , including electricity, maintenance of old machinery, low selling prices, low availability and eĸciency of equipment and processes, and low throughput capacity. ImportaƟon of lumber into the South Africa market is also threatening the whole forestry and sawmilling industry. Selling prices do not increase as a result, forcing sawmilling operaƟons to Įnd other soluƟons in reducing costs and by increasing the value of their products. 16 South African Forestry Company (SOC) Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 Our leaders Our Board of Directors The SAFCOL board of directors is appointed by the shareholder as represented by the Minister of Public Enterprises.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) The Group embarked on an ERP implementaƟon in late 2010 because of the increasing risks associated with the old system (JDE) as well as numerous outdated legacy systems. An implementaƟon partner, Tata ConsulƟng Services, was appointed in mid-2011. Various challenges were experienced on the design and implementaƟon side, mainly due to the high level of customisaƟon required on the old system. The system went live on the 1st of November 2012 but was aborted a month later due to signiĮcant problems in the Įnancial module as well as inadequate reports. The risk of a adverse audit opinion became unacceptably high should the Group conƟnue with the old system. Subsequently, the Group took a decision to revert back to legacy systems. A re-assessment exercise was iniƟated in early 2013 involving all users and the project plan was subsequently amended to incorporate all the maƩers idenƟĮed and address all the issues that were experienced during the Įrst go-live event.

Cash Ňow Management The posiƟve net cash Ňow from operaƟng acƟviƟes of R22 million, has declined compared to the R73 million for the 2012 Įnancial period.

The 2012 Įnancial year includes a payment of a R11.5 million rights oīer for Singisi Forest Products. An increase of 50% on the investment made in Capital expenditure (capex). The Group put controls in place to ensure that only criƟcal capex that related to core operaƟons was acquired during the period. Financing acƟviƟes have shown a posiƟve of R12 million, due to a net amount of payments made and loans acquired during the period for assets that qualiĮed for asset-based credit facility, as well as the vendor Įnancing that was used for the ERP system. In conclusion, all acƟviƟes have resulted in a R153 million cash and cash equivalents’ balance, which is a 29% (R34 million) year-onyear increase. If the proceeds from the sale of Shannon property are excluded from cash and cash equivalents, the Group’s cash reserves reŇects a decline against the prior year, which is of concern as we are uƟlising our cash reserves. ________________________ Mr Leslie Africa Interim Chief Financial Oĸcer South African Forestry Company (SOC) Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 35 How we performed against the Shareholder’s Compact Paragraph 29.2.1 of Treasury RegulaƟons (TR) issued in terms of PFMA, 1999 states that the public enƟty in consultaƟon with its execuƟve authority must conclude a Shareholder’s Compact.

By applying the above agenda the SAFCOL strategy is pursued and adherence to the BBBEE Charter, Forestry Charter and the Key performance measurements Shareholder’s Compact, is achieved. Key performance measures agreed upon with the shareholder were the establishment of two enterprise development intervenƟons during the previous Įnancial year. These expectaƟons were exceeded by establishing four successful enterprises during the year which created 50 permanent jobs. Furthermore, a new enterprise also commenced at the end of the Įnancial year under MOUs with SEDA (Small Enterprise Development Agency) and SEOBI (the South African EssenƟal Oils Business Incubator). The SAFCOL enterprise-development agenda focuses speciĮcally on two important aspects of the vision statement – “mulƟfuncƟonal forestry” and “revoluƟonising the integraƟon of forests and communiƟes”. This entails: • UƟlising the forestry asset for mulƟple applicaƟons and forest-enterprise development; • Leveraging general business skills and assets into building new enterprises; • Development of businesses along the forestry supply chain; 44 South African Forestry Company (SOC) Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 Performance against target SAFCOL was required to start two new projects according to the Shareholder’s Compact – and four were in fact iniƟated.

Though a limited volume was sold to external customers, Ɵmber processing has grown from contribuƟng 26% to SAFCOL’s total revenue in 2008 to 39% in 2012. The company is therefore not as vulnerable to the whims of its log customers and could sustain itself. The diversiĮcaƟon of products and services has aīorded the cushion not to retrench employees, which most other forestry companies resorted to during the recession. All sales, of both logs and lumber, are geared towards the housing construcƟon market. When people are not building, SAFCOL experiences reduced sales. Although the construcƟon market is sƟll depressed, high sales are sƟll feasible as reŇected in the growth in revenue in 2012. The strategy to enhance SAFCOL’s Įnancial and commercial sustainability includes maximising income opportuniƟes throughout the value chain by seeking new income streams.

The Group plans to approach various potenƟal partners to source the required funding. It is envisaged that the ground work on the funding for Timbadola upgrade as well as IFLOMA will be concluded during the FY2014. The major risk associated with the non-implementaƟon of these projects is that the business would shrink and would become unsustainable in its current form.

The Audit and Risk CommiƩee has made an assessment of the eīecƟveness of the control environment through the use of assurance providers. Where weaknesses were idenƟĮed in internal controls, correcƟve acƟon was taken to eliminate or reduce the risks. The Audit and Risk CommiƩee is of the opinion, based on the informaƟon and explanaƟons given by management and the Internal Audit Department and discussions with the independent external auditors on the results of their audits, that the internal controls of the company have operated eīecƟvely throughout the year under review and, where internal controls did not operate eīecƟvely, that compensaƟng controls have ensured that the company’s assets have been safeguarded, proper accounƟng records maintained and resources uƟlised eĸciently. Following our review of the Įnancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2013, we are of the opinion that they comply with the relevant provisions of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999, as amended, and InternaƟonal Financial ReporƟng Standards, and that they present fairly the results of the operaƟons, cash Ňow and Įnancial posiƟon of the company. The Audit and Risk CommiƩee concurs that the adopƟon of the goingconcern premise in the preparaƟon of the Įnancial statements is appropriate. We therefore recommend that the Įnancial statements as submiƩed be approved. On behalf of the Board Audit and Risk CommiƩee: N Medupe Chairperson of the Combined Audit and Risk Management CommiƩee 74 South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL TO PARLIAMENTON THE SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY SOC LIMITED REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IntroducƟon 1. I have audited the consolidated and separate Įnancial statements of the South African Forestry Company SOC Limited (SAFCOL) and its subsidiaries set out on pages 91 to 154 of the integrated report, which comprise the consolidated and separate statement of Įnancial posiƟon as at 31 March 2013, the consolidated and separate statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash Ňows for the year then ended, and the notes, comprising a summary of signiĮcant accounƟng policies and other explanatory informaƟon. AccounƟng authority’s responsibility for the consolidated Įnancial statements 2. The board of directors, which consƟtutes the accounƟng authority, is responsible for the preparaƟon and fair presentaƟon of these consolidated and separate Įnancial statements in accordance with InternaƟonal Financial ReporƟng Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act of South Africa, 1999 (Act No. 1 of 1999) (PFMA) and the Companies Act of South Africa, 2008 (Act No. 71 of 2008) (Companies Act), and for such internal control as the accounƟng authority determines is necessary to enable the preparaƟon of consolidated and separate Įnancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor-general’s responsibility 3. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and separate Įnancial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the Public Audit Act of South Africa, 2004 (Act No. 25 of 2004) (PAA), the general noƟce issued in terms thereof and InternaƟonal Standards on AudiƟng. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate Įnancial statements are free from material misstatement. 4. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated and separate Įnancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and separate Įnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the enƟty’s preparaƟon and fair presentaƟon of the consolidated and separate Įnancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the eīecƟveness of the enƟty’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluaƟng the appropriateness of accounƟng policies used and the reasonableness of accounƟng esƟmates made by management, as well as evaluaƟng the overall presentaƟon of the consolidated and separate Įnancial statements. 5. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is suĸcient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualiĮed audit opinion. Basis for qualiĮed opinion Biological assets 6. The subsidiary Industrias Florestais de Manica, SA (IFLOMA) iniƟated a process for the measurement of planted areas using new technology. During the audit, diīerences emerged between the physical areas and the areas included in the biological asset valuaƟon of IFLOMA that were used to determine the fair value of the plantaƟon in terms of IFRS, IAS 41, Agriculture. The measurement process will only be completed towards the end of 2013 and consequently I am unable to determine whether any adjustments were necessary to the biological assets balance in the consolidated Įnancial statements stated at R67 697 546. Abnormal losses 7. SAFCOL did not calculate input value-added tax (VAT) in terms of the turnover-based method of apporƟonment as required by the VAT Act of South Africa, 1991 (Act No.89 of 1991). The amount of input VAT of R9 906 060 owing to the South African Revenue Service has been recognised as an abnormal loss in the statement of comprehensive income of the separate Įnancial statements instead of increasing the relevant individual expenditure items, resulƟng in their understatement and an overstatement of the abnormal loss. The eīect of the maƩer is not considered material to the consolidated Įnancial statements. South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 75 Capital proĮt and reƟrement fund reserves 8. The enƟty did not classify the capital proĮt reserve amounƟng to R64 374 000 and reƟrement fund reserve amounƟng to R64 000 000 as distributable reserves in the statement of changes in equity in accordance with IFRS, IAS 1, PresentaƟon of Financial Statements. The capital proĮt reserve and reƟrement fund reserve were incorrectly disclosed as non-distributable reserves. Consequently the non-distributable reserves consisƟng of the capital proĮt reserve and the reƟrement fund reserve are overstated and distributable reserve is understated by R128 374 000 (2012: R128 374 000) in the statement of changes in equity. The eīect of the maƩer is considered material to the consolidated and separate Įnancial statements. QualiĮed opinion 9. In my opinion, except for the possible eīects of the maƩers described in the basis for qualiĮed opinion paragraphs, the consolidated and separate Įnancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Įnancial posiƟon of the South African Forestry Company SOC Limited and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2013, and their Įnancial performance and cash Ňows for the year then ended in accordance with the IFRS and the requirements of the PFMA and the Companies Act. Emphasis of maƩer 10. I draw aƩenƟon to the maƩer below. My opinion is not modiĮed in respect of this maƩer. Restatement of corresponding Įgures 11. As disclosed in the statement of changes in equity and note 38 to the Įnancial statements, the corresponding Įgures for 31 March 2012 have been restated as a result of an error discovered during the year ended 31 March 2013 in the Įnancial statements of SAFCOL at, and for the year ended, 31 March 2013. AddiƟonal maƩers 12. I draw aƩenƟon to the maƩers below. My opinion is not modiĮed in respect of these maƩers. Prior year audited by a predecessor auditor 13. The Įnancial statements of the prior year were audited by a predecessor auditor in terms of secƟon 4(3) of the PAA. Other reports required by the Companies Act 14. As part of my audit of the Įnancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2013, I have read the directors’ report, the audit and risk commiƩee’s report and the company secretary’s cerƟĮcate to idenƟfy whether there are material inconsistencies between these reports and the audited Įnancial statements. These reports are the responsibility of the respecƟve preparers. Based on reading these reports, I have not idenƟĮed material inconsistencies between the reports and the audited Įnancial statements in respect of which I have expressed a qualiĮed opinion. I have not audited the reports and accordingly do not express an opinion on them. REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 15. In accordance with the PAA and the general noƟce issued in terms thereof, I report the following Įndings relevant to performance against predetermined objecƟves, compliance with laws and regulaƟons and internal control, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion. Predetermined objecƟves 16. I performed procedures to obtain evidence about the usefulness and reliability of the informaƟon in the group key performance indicators as set out on pages 36 to 37 of the integrated report. 17. The reported performance against predetermined objecƟves was evaluated against the overall criteria of usefulness and reliability. The usefulness of informaƟon in the annual performance report relates to whether it is presented in accordance with the NaƟonal Treasury’s annual reporƟng principles and whether the reported performance is consistent with the planned objecƟves. The usefulness of informaƟon further relates to whether indicators and targets are measurable (i.e. well deĮned, veriĮable, speciĮc, measurable and Ɵme bound) and relevant, as required by the NaƟonal Treasury’s Framework for managing programme performance informaƟon (FMPPI). 76 South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 18. The reliability of the informaƟon in respect of the selected objecƟves is assessed to determine whether it adequately reŇects the facts (i.e. whether it is valid, accurate and complete). 19. The material Įndings are as follows: Reliability of key performance indicators Indicators not reliable 20. The FMPPI requires that insƟtuƟons should have appropriate systems to collect, collate, verify and store performance informaƟon to ensure valid, accurate and complete reporƟng of actual achievements against planned objecƟves, indicators and targets. 21. I was unable to obtain the informaƟon and explanaƟons I considered necessary to saƟsfy myself as to the reliability of informaƟon presented with respect to the area under forest management – IFLOMA Mozambique. 22. This was due to limitaƟons placed on the scope of my work due to the fact that the insƟtuƟon could not provide suĸcient appropriate evidence in support of the informaƟon presented with respect to the area under forest management – IFLOMA Mozambique. AddiƟonal maƩer 23. I draw aƩenƟon to the maƩer below. My conclusion is not modiĮed in respect of this maƩer. Achievement of planned targets 24. Of the total number of 24 targets planned for the year, nine were not achieved during the year under review. This means that 37% of the total planned targets were not achieved during the year under review. The reasons for the variances are provided on pages 36 to 37 of the integrated report. Compliance with laws and regulaƟons 25. I performed procedures to obtain evidence that the enƟty has complied with applicable laws and regulaƟons regarding Įnancial maƩers, Įnancial management and other related maƩers. My Įndings on material non-compliance with speciĮc maƩers in key applicable laws and regulaƟons as set out in the general noƟce issued in terms of the PAA are as follows: Annual Įnancial statements 26. The accounƟng authority did not submit the Įnancial statements for audiƟng within two months aŌer the end of the Įnancial year, as required by secƟon 55(1)(c)(i) of the PFMA. 27. Material misstatements of non-current assets, current assets and liabiliƟes idenƟĮed by the auditors in the submiƩed Įnancial statements were subsequently corrected and the supporƟng records provided, but the uncorrected material misstatements and supporƟng records that could not be provided resulted in the Įnancial statements receiving a qualiĮed audit opinion. The Įnancial statements submiƩed for audiƟng were not prepared in accordance with the prescribed Įnancial reporƟng framework, as required by secƟon 55(1)(a) and (b) of the PFMA and secƟon 29(1)(a) of the Companies Act. Expenditure management 28. The accounƟng authority did not take eīecƟve steps to prevent irregular as well as fruitless and wasteful expenditure, as required by secƟon 51(1)(b)(ii) of the PFMA. Procurement and contract management 29. Goods and services were not always procured through a procurement process that was fair, equitable, transparent and compeƟƟve, as required by secƟon 51(1)(a)(iii) of the PFMA. Internal control 30. I considered internal control relevant to my audit of the Įnancial statements and compliance with laws and regulaƟons. The maƩers reported below under the fundamentals of internal control are limited to the signiĮcant deĮciencies that resulted in the basis for the qualiĮed opinion, the Įndings on the group key performance indicators and the Įndings on compliance with laws and regulaƟons included in this report. South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 77 Leadership 31. A lack of management responsibility by the leadership of the enƟty for oversight over Įnancial and performance management and compliance with laws and regulaƟons resulted in the qualiĮed audit opinion, Įndings on predetermined objecƟves and Įndings on compliance with laws and regulaƟons 32. Ongoing monitoring and supervision were not adequate to enable management to determine whether internal controls over Įnancial reporƟng were present and funcƟoning, which led to material adjustments to the annual Įnancial statements, the nonachievement of a signiĮcant amount of the predetermined objecƟves, and non-compliance with laws and regulaƟons. Financial and performance management 33. The informaƟon systems used for recording and processing transacƟons were not eīecƟvely and eĸciently used to produce reliable informaƟon. There was extensive manual intervenƟon in the preparaƟon of the annual Įnancial statements at year-end. DiĸculƟes were experienced during the audit with regard to delays and the availability of requested informaƟon due to poor record-keeping, a misunderstanding of the auditors’ requests, and the extensive use of manual record-keeping outside of the informaƟon systems used to record the Įnancial informaƟon. OTHER REPORTS InvesƟgaƟons 34. An invesƟgaƟon was conducted by an independent consulƟng Įrm on request of the enƟty. The invesƟgaƟon was iniƟated based on an allegaƟon of misappropriaƟon of assets by employees of the subsidiary of the enƟty. The invesƟgaƟon resulted in criminal proceedings being insƟtuted against employees of the subsidiary.

As at 31 March 2012, the disposal of the majority shareholding of four of these packages was completed. Due to the complexity of the land claims against KLF and the compeƟƟon concerns that were likely to have a material bearing on the Ɵmeframe set for its privaƟsaƟon, the Minister of Public Enterprises, and the Board, resolved that the privaƟsaƟon process should be postponed for the foreseeable future. This will allow both parƟes to address the issues and concerns raised regarding the privaƟsaƟon process. The Board was further requested to develop a corporate strategy for the period ending 31 March 2014 with a strong focus on land claimants and communiƟes. Status of previous privaƟsaƟon transacƟons The status of privaƟsaƟon transacƟons can be summarised as follows: Package Current Status Eastern Implemented the transacƟon with Singisi Forest Products (Pty) Ltd on 1 August 2001, Cape North and to date have sold 84% of the shares. The remaining 16% is earmarked for disposal in the future. KwaZulu-Natal Implemented the transacƟon with the SiyaQhubeka ConsorƟum on 1 October 2001. To date have sold 75% of the shares in SiyaQhubeka Forests (Pty) Ltd. The remaining 25% is earmarked for disposal in the future. Eastern To date have sold 84% of the shares in Amathole Forestry Company (Pty) Ltd. Cape South The remaining 16% is earmarked for disposal in the future. Southern and To date have sold 84% of the shares in MTO Forestry (Pty) Ltd. Western Cape The remaining 16% is earmarked for disposal in the future. Government’s policy decision about the disposal of the remaining shareholding is sƟll being Įnalised. Legal proceedings The Londoloza Paharpur consorƟum insƟtuted a damages claim against South African Forestry Company Limited and the Government. The claim is for payment of approximately R3 billion damages based on Government’s decision not to conƟnue with the previous privaƟsaƟon process. The maƩer is being defended by both the Company and the Government. The nature of the Group’s business means that it will be involved in liƟgaƟon from Ɵme to Ɵme. Management is, however, conĮdent that either all material lawsuits can be defended successfully or such incidents are suĸciently covered under appropriate insurance policies. In respect of lawsuits not being defended successfully, adequate provision was made in the accounƟng records. 88 South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 Directors’ approval The directors are required in terms of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 and the Public Finance Management Act of 1999 (PFMA), to maintain adequate accounƟng records. They are also responsible for the content and integrity of the Įnancial statements and related Įnancial informaƟon included in this report. It is their responsibility to ensure conformity with InternaƟonal Financial ReporƟng Standards (IFRS) – that the Įnancial statements fairly present the state of aīairs of the Group as at the end of the Įnancial year and the results of its operaƟons and cash Ňows for the period then ended. The external auditors are engaged in order to express an independent opinion of the Įnancial statements. The Įnancial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, and are based on appropriate accounƟng policies consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and esƟmates. The directors acknowledge that they are ulƟmately responsible for the system of internal Įnancial control established by the Group, and place considerable importance on maintaining a strong control environment. To enable the directors to meet their responsibiliƟes, the Board sets standards for internal control, which are aimed at reducing the risk of error or loss in a cost-eīecƟve manner. The standards include the proper delegaƟon of responsibiliƟes within a clearly-deĮned framework, eīecƟve accounƟng procedures, and adequate segregaƟon of duƟes to ensure an acceptable level of risk. These controls are monitored throughout the Group, and all employees are required to maintain the highest ethical standards in ensuring that the Group’s business is conducted in a manner that – in all reasonable circumstances – is above reproach. The focus of risk management in the Group is on idenƟfying, assessing, managing and monitoring all known forms of risk across the Group. While operaƟng risk cannot be eliminated fully, the Group endeavours to minimise it by ensuring that appropriate infrastructure, controls, systems and ethical behaviour are applied and managed within pre-determined procedures and constraints. The directors are of the opinion, based on the informaƟon and explanaƟons given by management and based on reports by the Internal and external auditors on the results of their audits, that the system of internal control provides reasonable assurance that the Įnancial records may be relied upon for preparaƟon of the Įnancial statements. However, any system of internal Įnancial control can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The directors believe that assets are adequately protected in a cost-eīecƟve way, and that they are used as intended with appropriate authorisaƟon. They also consider that the Group has access to adequate resources to conƟnue in operaƟonal existence for the foreseeable future. The annual Įnancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2013, set out on pages 91 to 154, and the reports by the Chairperson and the Chief ExecuƟve Oĸcer set out on pages 25 to 30, were approved by the Board of Directors on 02 September 2013, and are signed on its behalf by: VN Magwentshu N Mona .......................................... ...................................................

Presentation of Consolidated Annual Financial Statements The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied to all years presented which are consistent with those of the previous year, except for new and revised standards and interpretations adopted per notes to the financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, available for sale financial assets, and financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and incorporate the following principal accounting policies. The preparation of the annual financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) requires the Directors to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The actual results may differ from these estimates. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised and future years, if it affects both the current and future years. 1.1 Statement of compliance The Annual Group Financial Annual Group Statements of Financial Statements of SAFCOL SAFCOL isare prepared prepared in in accordance accordance with with IFRS, thethe IFRS, South South African African Companies Companies ActAct of of 2008, 2008, andandthethe Public Public Finance Finance Management Management Act, 1999.

The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for all the business combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed in the period incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquire over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which effective control is transferred to the Group and consolidation ceases from the date of disposal or the date on which control ceases. All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on transactions between Group entities are eliminated. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure alignment with the policies adopted by the Group.

Use of available information and the application of judgement is inherent in the formation of estimates. Actual results in the future could differ from these estimates which may be material to the consolidated annual financial statements. Significant judgements include: Provision for impairment of trade receivables The group assesses its trade receivables for impairment at the end of each reporting period. In determining whether an impairment loss should be recorded in profit or loss, the company makes judgements as to whether there is observable data indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a financial asset. At each statement of financial position date, the Group assess whether there is any objective evidence that debtors are impaired. If evidence of impairment exists, the provision is calculated as the fair value of the debtor less the present value of the estimated recoverable amount. Provisions Provisions were raised and management determined an estimate based on the information available. South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 99 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Accounting Policies 1.4 Significant judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty (continued) Taxation The Group is subject to income taxes in South Africa and Mozambique jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognise liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will affect the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Fair value estimation The methods and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the standing timber in the plantations can be described as follows and have been applied consistently in accordance with Group policy, and are reviewed every five years or when there is market conditions which impact: • Current market prices: The market prices per cubic metre are based on market expectations per log class. • Expected yield per log class: The expected yield per log class is calculated with reference to growth models relevant to the nominal planted area. The growth models are derived from actual trial data that is measured regularly. A merchandising model, using the modelled tree shape at various ages, is used to split the tree-lengths into pre-defined products or log classes. The nominal planted area is derived from the core forestry management systems. • Volume adjustment factor: Due to the nature of plantation forestry and more specifically its susceptibility to the environment, an adjustment factor is determined to reduce the modelled volumes to approximate marketable volumes. The percentage volume adjustment is based on inter alia: animal damage, such as cattle and baboon damage, insect and fungal damage such as sirex and fusarium, natural elements such as extreme wind, rain and hail conditions may damage the trees, in addition reduced rainfall (drought) or uneven rainfall affects tree growth. In the case of fires the actual volume is recalculated per compartment. • Rotation: The Group manages its plantation crop mainly on a 30-year rotation for saw log production. • Operating costs: Operating costs are calculated with reference to the maintenance and harvesting activities and the average annual unit costs per activity. The activities are based on the prescribed silvicultural regimes and volume of timber to be harvested and extracted. The operating costs per activity are based on the annual average unit costs as per the plantation operating statements and include relevant overheads. • Discount rate: The current market-determined discount rate is based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital model as calculated by an independent professional service provider, using the following: Risk free rate which is updated with the market rates applicable at the valuation dates. Market premium which has been adjusted to compensate for increased risk factors. Inflation assumptions which have been adjusted to incorporate the market view at the valuation date. 100 South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Accounting Policies 1.4 Significant judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty (continued) Fair value of sugar cane Recoverable value: The recoverable value price has been obtained and used from the Cane Growers Association. Costs: Costs are based on average harvesting for similar cane operations in the geographical area. Yield: Average yield is based on sugar cane harvested during the period. 1.5 Biological assets Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell. Fair value of plantations and sugar cane is estimated based on the present value of the net future cash flows from the asset, discounted at a current market-based rate. In determining the present value of expected net cash flows, the Group includes the net cash flows that market participants would expect the asset to generate in its most relevant market. Increases or decreases in value are recognised in the statement of financial performance. All expenses incurred in maintaining and protecting the assets are recognised in the statement of financial performance. All costs incurred in acquiring additional planted areas are capitalised. 1.6 Property, plant and equipment Owned assets: Property, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes all costs that are incurred in bringing the asset into a location and condition necessary to enable it to operate as intended by management and includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and the initial estimate, where applicable, of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment and are depreciated separately. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset when: -it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group; and -the cost of the item can be measured reliably Subsequent expenditure: Subsequent expenditure relating to an item or part of property, plant and equipment is capitalised when it is probable that future economic benefits associated to an item will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the part that is replaced is derecognised in accordance with the principles set out below. Costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised as an expense in the year in which it was incurred. Derecognition: The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised at the earlier of the date of disposal or the date when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses on derecognition of items of property, plant and equipment are included in the statement of financial performance. The gain or loss is the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset.

Land and capital work-in-progress are not depreciated. The methods of depreciation, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. If the expectations differ from previous estimates, the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate annually and changes in estimates, if appropriate, are accounted for on a prospective basis. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment have been assessed as follows: Item Average useful life Buildings and utilities 20-50 years Leasehold improvements buildings and utilities 25 years Plant and machinery 4-15 years Furniture and fixtures 5-10 years Motor vehicles 4-12 years Computer equipment 3-10 years Leasehold improvements telephone lines and fences 10 years Leasehold improvements roads 25 years 1.7 Intangible assets An intangible asset is recognised when: • it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity; and • the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Acquired computer software is capitalised based on the costs incurred to acquire and bring the specific software into use. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred. Intangible assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates, and all other subsequent expenditure is expensed as incurred. Internally generated brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and items similar in substance are not recognised as intangible assets. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as definite. Amortisation is charged to the statement of financial performance on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The methods of amortisation, useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and changes in estimates, if appropriate, are accounted for on a prospective basis. Amortisation is provided to write down the intangible assets, on a straight-line basis, to their residual values as follows: Item Useful life Computer software 3-5 years The carrying amount of an item or part of an intangible asset is derecognised at the earlier of the date of disposal or the date when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses on derecognition of an item of an intangible asset are included in the statement of financial performance. The gain or loss is the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset. 102 South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Accounting Policies 1.8 Financial instruments Classification The group classifies financial assets and financial liabilities into the following categories: • Loans and receivables • Available for sale financial assets • Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were obtained / incurred and takes place at initial recognition. South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 103 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Accounting Policies 1.8 Financial instruments (continued) Loans and Receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 30 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss within operating expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in profit or loss. Available for sale Financial Assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category, or are not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the Directors intend to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the statement of financial position date. Available for sale financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs, and carried subsequently at fair value. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Recognition and measurement of financial instruments Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the investments has expired, or has been transferred and the company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Fair value is the market value (listed investments) or the market price of a substantially similar investment, or the present value of expected future cash flows of the net asset base (unlisted investments). If the market for a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities), the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models, making use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost. Gains or losses on available for sale investments are recognised in other comprehensive income, as a separate component of the Group’s equity until the investments are sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investments are determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is recognised in the statement of financial performance. Impairment losses on available for sale equity instruments that are recognised in the statement of financial performance are not subsequently reversed. The Group assesses at each statement of financial position date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognised in the statement of financial performance. Impairment losses recognised in the statement of financial performance on equity instruments are not reversed through the statement of financial performance. In the case of assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The asset’s carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised 104 South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Accounting Policies 1.8 Financial instruments (continued) in the statement of financial performance. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, the Group may measure impairment based on an instrument’s fair value using an observable market price. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the statement of financial performance. Interest on available for sale securities calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the statement of financial performance as part of investment revenue. Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the statement of financial performance as part of investment revenue when the Group’s right to receive payment is established. Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Other receivables constitute sundry debtors. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy, financial re-organisation, and default, or delinquency in payments, are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced using an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in income. When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited in the statement of financial performance. Trade and other payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, as well as other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts (if applicable) are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement of financial position. Cash and cash equivalents are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Bank overdraft and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are stated subsequently at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs), and the redemption value is recognised in the statement of financial performance over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date. Derecognition Financial instruments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 105 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Accounting Policies 1.9 Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. The cost of inventories comprises of all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The cost of inventories is assigned using the weighted average cost formula. The same cost formula is used for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the entity. Cost is determined on the following bases: • Finished goods and work-in-progress comprises raw material, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, calculated on the weighted average basis, based on the normal capacity for the period to eliminate the effect of changes in log distribution. Included in finished goods and work-in-progress inventories are sawn timber or lumber and seedlings. • Raw materials are valued at landed cost on the weighted average basis. • Consumable stores are valued at cost on the weighted average basis. 1.10 Tax Current tax Current tax for current and prior periods is, to the extent unpaid, recognised as a liability. If the amount already paid in respect of current and prior periods exceeds the amount due for those periods, the excess is recognised as an asset. Current tax liabilities (assets) for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from) the tax authorities, using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax A deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except to the extent that the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss). A deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. A deferred tax asset is not recognised when it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss). A deferred tax asset is recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused STC credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused STC credits can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 106 South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Accounting Policies 1.10 Tax (continued) Tax expenses Current and deferred taxes are recognised as income or an expense and included in profit or loss for the period, except to the extent that the tax arises from: • a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different period, to other comprehensive income, or • directly in equity. Current tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited to other comprehensive income if the tax relates to items that are credited or charged, in the same or a different period, to other comprehensive income. Current tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited directly to equity if the tax relates to items that are credited or charged, in the same or a different period, directly in equity. 1.11 Share capital and equity Ordinary share capital is classified as equity. 1.12 Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisfied: • the group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; • the group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold; • the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; • it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the group; and • the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts and volume rebates, and value added tax and elimination of Group internal sales. Interest is recognised in profit or loss, using the effective interest rate method. Dividends are recognised in profit or loss, when the company’s right to receive payment has been established. Sales of Goods The Group harvests, processes, and sells a range of timber and logs. Sales of goods are recognised when a group entity has delivered products to the customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products. Sales of logs are recognised when the title is considered to have passed to the customer either when logs are delivered at roadside or when logs are delivered to the customers. All other sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed. Sales are recorded based on the price specified in the sales contracts. The provision for claims is based on actual returns by customers and includes volume, quality and price disputes. Sales of Services The Company charges management services to its subsidiaries, which are eliminated on consolidation level. These services are provided as a fixed-price contract, with annual contract terms. South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 107 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Accounting Policies 1.13 Employee benefits Pension plans The Group operates various pension schemes, which include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The SAFCOL Provident Fund, Investment Solutions Executive Provident Fund and Forestry Workers Pension Fund are defined contribution plans. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior periods. The Group pay contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. Defined benefit plans The defined benefit schemes are funded generally through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The SAFCOL Pension Fund and the SAFCOL Pension-Linked Provident Fund are defined benefit schemes. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date, less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past-service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of financial performance in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period (the vesting period). In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to a termination when the entity has a detailed formal plan to terminate the employment of current employees without possibility of withdrawal. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value Bonus plans The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the Group and Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where obliged contractually, or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation. 108 South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Accounting Policies 1.14 Leases Finance leases – lessee Leases that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset to the Group are classified as finance leases. Leased assets are measured at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. The capital element of future obligations under the leases is included as a liability in the statement of financial position. Finance charges are charged to the statement of financial performance over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The discount rate used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease. The lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate on the remaining balance of the liability. Operating leases – lessee Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying assets are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of financial performance on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The difference between the amounts recognised as an expense and the contractual payments are recognised as an operating lease asset. This liability is not discounted. Any contingent rents are expensed in the period they are incurred 1.15 Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. Non-current assets held for sale (or disposal group) are measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. A non-current asset is not depreciated (or amortised) while it is classified as held for sale, or while it is part of a disposal group classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are recognised in profit or loss. 1.16 Provisions and contingencies A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or announced publicly. Costs relating to ongoing activities are not provided for. South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 109 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Accounting Policies 1.17 Translation of foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions Functional and Presentation Currency Items included in the consolidated annual financial statements of each of the Group entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The consolidated annual financial statements are presented in Rand which is the Group functional and presentation currency. Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction or valuation date where items are re-measured. At each statement of financial position date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Investments in subsidiaries The results and financial position of all the group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of the Group are translated into the presentation currency as follows: • assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position; • income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction date, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and • All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income as a separate component of equity. On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations and of borrowings, are taken to other comprehensive income and accumulated in the separate component of equity. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in other comprehensive income are recognised in the statement of financial performance as part of the gain or loss on sale. 1.18 Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication that those assets may have suffered an impairment loss. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use of the asset. Value in use is estimated based on the expected future cash flows, discounted to their present values using a discount rate that reflects forecast market assessments over the estimated useful life of the asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is calculated. Where an asset or a cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount has declined below the carrying amount, the decline is recognised as an expense. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 1.19 Research and development Expenditure on research and development is charged against operating income when incurred. 110 South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Accounting Policies 1.20 Dividends distribution Dividends are recognised as a deduction in equity and a liability in the period in which they are approved. 1.21 Non-distrutable reserves Capital Profits Reserve As per the Memorandum and Articles of Association of SAFCOL, material capital profits are not distributed, but allocated to nondistributable reserves as and when applicable. Therefore, where profits made on the disposal of assets and the proceeds from insurance claims are deemed exceptional, these profits are transferred to a non-distributable reserve, being a capital profit reserve. Adjustments to the opening statement of financial position of the Group of a material nature or extent, resulting in an increase in the net asset value of assets taken over on 1 April 1993, are credited to a non-distributable reserve. A decrease in net asset value is charged to available non-distributable reserves and if any balance remains thereafter, it is charged to distributable reserves Foreign Currency Translation Reserve If the functional currency of a subsidiary is different to the presentation currency of the Group, the net effect of translating to the presentation currency is allocated to the foreign currency translation reserve. Items are translated at the Group’s financial year-end in accordance with section 1.18 Translations of foreign currencies. Revaluation Reserve The revaluation of non-current assets and equity instruments are charged to the non-distributable reserve and therefore reflected as a gain or loss in the statement of financial performance. Retirement Fund Reserve Accelerated lump sum payments to reduce the retirement fund deficit are transferred to a non-distributable reserve being a retirement fund reserve, as far as cash generated through profits from trading activities is available for this purpose. 1.22 Post balance sheet events Recognised amounts in the financial statements are adjusted to reflect events arising after the statement of financial position date that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the statement of financial position date. Depending on materiality, events after the statement of financial position date that are indicative of conditions that arose after the statement of financial position date are dealt with by way of a note. 1.23 Comparitive figures Comparative figures are re-stated in the event of a change in accounting policy or prior period error. Two comparative statements of financial position are presented in the event of a retrospective change in accounting policy, a retrospective restatement or reclassification of items in the financial statements.

Trade and other receivables (continued) Trade and other receivables impaired Included in the Group and Company's trade and other receivables with a carry amount of R 12 million (2012: R 7 million) and R 1 million (2012: R 0 million) which have been impaired and provided for. These relate to a number of independent customers which are in difficult economic situations. The ageing of these loans is as follows: Total impaired trade receivables 9 787 5 598 Total impaired other receivables 2 241 979 984 12 028 6 577 984 Trade receivables 90-120 days 108 4 120-150 days 906 39 150+ days 8 773 5 555 9 787 5 598 Other receivable 31-60 days 120-150 days 2 150+ days 2 241 977 984 2 241 979 984 Total trade and other receivables impaired 12 028 6 577 984 Reconciliation of provision for impairment of trade and other receivables Opening balance (6 577) (6 927) (2) Impairment losses recognised on receivables (5 530) (778) (984) Amounts written off as uncollectable 1 608 2 Amounts recovered during the year 291 Movement due to exchange differences (212) (480) (12 028) (6 577) (984) The average credit period of the Group is 85 (2012: 76) days. Interest is charged on trade receivables that default. The Group has provided for the majority of receivables over 150 days based on past experience, which indicates that the receivables which are past due beyond 150 days are generally not recoverable. Some past due receivables older than 150 days however have not been provided for due to specific conditions in regards to the payment of the debt. Trade receivables between 30 days and 150 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts. In determining the recoverability of the trade and other receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of trade and other receivables from the date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of the credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the provision for impairment of trade receivables. 130 South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements Group Company Figures in Rand thousand 2013 2012 2013 2012 18. Trade and other receivables (continued) All round wood and lumber receivables are secured by either bank guarantees, credit insurance (80%) or cash prepayments. Small sundry receivables are either secured by credit insurance or deposits. The carry value of receivables approximates the fair value. In circumstances where the carry value is less than fair value, receivables are accordingly impaired to reflect that status. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carry value of each class of receivable mentioned above. 19.

During 2012, South African Forestry Company SOC Limited paid R 11,5 million for the rights in order to retain the 16% in Singisi Forest Products (Proprietary) Limited. Investments previously classified as associates are classified as non-current assets held for sale as management is committed to a plan to sell the investments within 12 months. The sale is highly probable within the next 12 months based on a directive received from the shareholder to dispose of these assets. The shareholder has indicated in its strategic plan its intention to dispose of the minority interest with set deadlines. Management does not have significant influence, although South African Forestry Company SOC Limited has representation on the various board of directors of the investments.

Contingent liabilities Land claims Most of the land leased to SAFCOL by Government is claimed by various parties according to the Restitution of Land Rights Act, Act 22 of 1994 as amended. According to the study that was done by SAFCOL in 2008, 61% of the entire KLF estate is directly affected by land claims. In Limpopo, there are 14 claims lodged against the state by various communities on the land affecting KLF, including the farm where Timbadola sawmill is located; and are all at an advanced stage. In Mpumalanga, three new claims were confirmed in the 2013 financial year bringing the total claims to 17 claims; most of these claims are still under investigation. The Abacus properties in the Ngome area of KwaZulu-Natal, were investigated, validated and subsequently gazetted by the KZN Regional Land Claims Commission. The value of the land as per the 2007 valuation is R 3 million and the value of the standing timber amounted to R 28 million. An offer to purchase for both the land and the standing timber was accepted in principle by SAFCOL. To revise the valuation report, the Commission has secured the services of a professional valuer to update the existing valuation report and determine the market related rental of the property. The value would be used as the basis for negotiations and settlement of the claim by the parties involved. Bank facilities There are contingent liabilities in respect of: Bank guarantees in respect of third party liabilities to the amount of R 0.5 million (2012: R 0,5 million) Cross suretyships between the Company and its holding company for any indebtedness which any of them may have to the specific financial institutions in respect of cash management and financial facilities. Competition Commission There was a complaint that was lodged with the Competition Commission against the Company regarding the alleged abuse of dominance and excessive pricing. KLF has responded to all the queries and submitted the required information and KLF management was called in for enquiry by the Commission. However, the investigation is still ongoing. The Competition Commission has approached various industry role players to provide information regarding the timber industry and KLF's role in it. Litigation The Londoloza Paharpur consorƟum insƟtuted a damages claim against South African Forestry Company Limited and the Governnment. The claim is for payment of approximately R3 billion damages based on Government’s decision not to conƟnue with the previous privaƟsaƟon process. The maƩer is being defended by both the Company and the Government. The nature of the Group's business means that it will be involved in litigation from time to time. Management is however confident that either all material lawsuits can be defended successfully or such incidents are sufficiently covered under appropriate insurance policies. In respect of lawsuits not being defended, adequate provision has been made in the accounting records. A fire on the Jessievale Plantation took place on 31 August 2008. The outcomes of the resultant lawsuits were uncertain at year end. All of the respective 10 cases will be covered by our insurance in the event of these claims being successful, and R500 000 would have to be paid as excesses in respect of each claim, amounting in total to a contingency of R 5 million.

Risk management The Group is exposed to various financial risks due to the nature of its activities and the use of various financial instruments. The board has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. 34.1 Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern. The Group’s overall strategy is to position itself as an attractive business partner by continuous management of the Group’s statement of financial position, preserve cash and seek alternative funding alternatives. The management of financial risks takes place within SAFCOL’s centralised treasury and risk management functions. The objective is to ensure that the Group is not unduly exposed to financial risks and is governed by a Treasury Mandate. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes short and long-term borrowings and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. As a contingency plan, in order to manage the liquidity of the Group, a facility (combination of an asset-based finance and multi-option facility) has been secured with a financial institution during the 2010 financial year. No dividends have been declared in the current financial year (2012: R 0 million). Risk management policies have been compiled and approved by the Board. The Group’s risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor the progress made in addressing those risks. The internal audit conducts adhoc reviews to assess compliance with risk management policies. Gearing ratio The Finance, Investment and Transaction Committee reviews the Group’s capital structure on a quarterly basis. The gearing ratio at 2013 and 2012 respectively were as follows: Total borrowings Borrowings 25 26 929 10 044 Other financial liabilities 24 4 565 9 180 4 565 9 180 31 494 19 224 4 565 9 180 Total debt 31 494 19 224 4 565 9 180 Total equity (ii) 3 096 638 3 019 698 742 178 718 345 Total capital 3 128 132 3 038 922 746 743 727 525 Gearing ratio 1% 1% 1% 1% (i) Debt is defined as long-term and short-term borrowings, as indicated in the accounting policy.

Risk management (continued) 34.3 Major financial risks The following major financial risks that the organisation is exposed to have been identified: Liquidity Risk Forward Exchange Risk Credit Risk Cash Flow Interest Rate Risk Market Risk Compliance Risk Operational Risk Price Risk Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group has insufficient funds or marketable securities available to fulfil its cash flow obligations on time. Liquidity risk arises primarily from variation in revenue flows as well as the Group’s ability to repay principle debt and interest. The Group’s approach to liquidity risk management includes: Regular monitoring of liquidity through periodic forecast cash flow management and maintaining an adequate level of short-term marketable securities; Implementation of long-term and short-term funding and investment strategies; and Diversification of funding and investing activities. The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity dates.

Risk management (continued) Forward Exchange Risk Forward exchange risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in the exchange rate from one currency to another through higher payments or lower receipts in the local currency. The Group enters in forward exchange contracts to buy and sell specified amounts of various foreign currencies in the future at a predetermined exchange rates. The contracts are entered into in order to manage the Group's exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on specific transactions. The contracts are matched with foreign currency commitments and anticipated future cash flows in foreign currencies consisting primarily of exports. No significant export transactions were concluded during the year. Funding for the IFLOMA subsidiary in Mozambique is mainly paid in US Dollars, whilst expenses are mainly denominated in Metical. This has the effect that the Group is exposed to fluctuations in the Rand, the US Dollar and the Metical. No forward exchange cover was used during the year. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of default by counterparties. Financial assets, which potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term deposits and trade and other receivables. The Group’s cash equivalents and short-term deposits are placed with high credit quality financial banking institutions. Surplus cash is held in external investments that are rated AA or A1, or fully secured. Trade receivables are presented net of the provision for impairment of trade receivables. Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is moderate due to the Group’s customer base, which is dispersed across the forestry industry. Furthermore, a large number of customers have bank guarantees or other securities in place. Credit insurance is taken out where regarded necessary. At statement of financial position date all significant credit risks were provided for (refer note 20). With respect to foreign exchange contracts, the Group’s exposure is covered on the full amount of the foreign currency receivable on settlement. The Group minimises such risk by limiting the counterparties to a group of major South African banks, and does not expect to incur any losses because of non-performance by these counterparties. The carrying amounts of the financial assets included in the statement of financial position represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to these assets. The credit exposure of forward exchange contracts is represented by the net market value of the contracts, as disclosed. At year-end, there were no foreign exchange contracts in place. The credit control management has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for credit worthiness before the Group’s standard payment terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, where available, and in some cases, bank guarantees. Credit limits (purchase limits) established for each customer represent the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Senior Executive Marketing. These credit limits are reviewed regularly. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark credit worthiness may transact with the Group only on a pre-payment basis. At reporting date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk for loans and receivables. The carry amount reflected above represents the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk for such loans and receivables. Cash flow interest risk Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates through higher interest payments or lower interest receipts.

Risk management (continued) The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the Group funds working capital short falls and assets, and invests surplus funds from time to time. The Group utilises limited asset based finance leases to fund assets. These finance leases bear interest at variable interest rates / interest rates linked to prime. The Group also invests funds in the money market at both fixed and floating interest rates. The underlying interest rate risk associated with this risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating interest rates. Shortfalls are funded by the holding company SAFCOL, as and when required. Surplus funds from operations are transferred to the holding company on a daily basis. These surpluses or shortfalls bear interest on a floating interest inter-company account. The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk and the effective interest rate on financial instruments at balance sheet date are set out in the following tables: 146 South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 34.

Risk management (continued) Sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments The sensitivity has been determined based on the exposure to movement of interest rates on nonderivative floating interest rate instruments at the statement of financial position date. If interest rates had been 200 basis points higher or lower, the increase / (decrease) in the Group’s profit / (loss) and equity for the year ending 31 March 2012 are set out in the table below. This increase / (decrease) is attributable to variable interest rate borrowings, cash and cash equivalents,other loans and receivables and available for sale financial assets. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. Variable interest rate sensitivity analysis Sensitivity if interest rate increase by 200 basis points Increase in profit or loss 2 499 2 263 7 092 7 186 Sensitivity if interest rate decrease by 200 basis points Decrease in profit or loss (2 499) (2 263) (7 092) (7 186) South African Forestry SOC Limited Integrated Report 2012/13 149 SOUTH AFRICAN FORESTRY COMPANY (SOC) LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Registration number 1992/005427/06) Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 34. Risk management (continued) Market risk (Fair value estimation) Market risk is the risk of a decrease in the market value of a portfolio of financial instruments caused by an adverse move in market variables such as currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as implied volatilities on all of the above. At 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012 the carrying amounts of cash equivalants, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, accrued expenses and short-term borrowings, approximated their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. The fair value of long-term investments is not materially different from the carrying amounts. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts represents the estimated amounts (using rates quoted by the Group’s bankers), that the Group would receive to terminate the contracts at the reporting date, thereby taking into account the unrealised gains or losses of open contracts. At yearend, there were no foreign exchange forward contracts. Compliance risk Compliance risk is the risk of non-compliance with any statutory requirement of central or local Government and includes the South African Reserve Bank, Financial Services Board and various financial exchanges. This is minimised through effective monitoring and reporting to ensure compliance with the Public Finance Management Act, the Occupational Safety & Health Act, Companies Act, Income Tax Act, The Corporate Laws Amendment Act, applicable environmental legislation and the requirements of statutory and other bodies; including the Competition Authorities, South African Reserve Bank, Financial Services Board and the Forestry Stewardship Council. Operational risk Operational risk is the risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. The Group’s approach to managing operational risk has led to the establishment of the following practices: Policies and procedures to sustain effective risk management; and The ongoing assessment of the effects of changes in the regulatory environment and adaptation of the processes accordingly. Price risk Price risk is the risk that changes in log prices have on the financial performance and cash flows of the Group.
