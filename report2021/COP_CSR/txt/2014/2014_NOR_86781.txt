PENSION LIABILITY – PENSION COST The pension liabilities are calculated based on the Norwegian accounting standard. Nammo AS has established a collective pension plan according to Norwegian tax law and the law for pensions for all employees (Lov om foretakspensjon). The plan includes 13 active members. Nammo AS is a member of the LO/NHO AFP-plan. The old plan is closed and the corresponding pension liability deriving from the plan is de-recognized in the balance sheet. The pension liability in the new AFP-plan is not possible to estimate reliably at year end; therefore, this pension liability is not recognized in the balance sheet. The net periodic pension cost is based on this year’s actuarial calculations of earning of pension rights, and is included in payroll expenses in the profit and loss. The actuarial calculation was performed in December 2013 with the following assumptions: Yield from pension funds 4.40% Interest rate used to discount future cash flows 4.10% Annual salary increase 3.75% Annual increase in G 3.50% Annual change in pension 0.60% 31 NAMMO ANNUAL REPORT Pension cost (NOK 1 000) 2013 2012 Service costs 960 992 Amortization of net actuarial losses (gains) 113 55 Interest costs 581 526 Expected return on plan assets (472) (545) Net pension costs 1 182 1 028 Pension liabilities (NOK 1 000) 2013 2012 Defined benefit obligation incl. payroll tax 18 329 13 348 Fair value of plan assets (14 213) (12 405) Gross pension liability 4 116 943 Items not recognized in the profit and loss: Unrecognized net actuarial loss (gain) (5 238) (1 241) Net amount recognized in the balance sheet (1 122) (298) 11.
