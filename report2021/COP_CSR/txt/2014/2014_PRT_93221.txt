Given the high number of locations that are part of this class of assets, the Group carries out rotational valuations on all these assets at intervals of no more than five years. In the fourth quarter of 2013, new valuations were carried out: i) on assets acquired more than three years ago and which had not yet been evaluated; ii) on assets with an indication of a significant change in market value; and iii) on assets which had been evaluated more than three years ago. The outcome of these valuations in 2013 was a reduction in the value of the land of EUR 24,213 thousand. In 2012, the outcome was a reduction of EUR 7,184 (note 22.1). The table below shows the total amount of valuations carried out in the exercise, the previous revalued net book value of these assets and its acquisition cost.

The main change is a requirement for entities to group items presented in other comprehensive income (OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially recycled subsequently to profit or loss (reclassification adjustments) or not.

Their application resulted in minor changes in the presentation of items of OCI, with no impact in total equity of JMH; ii) Fully amended IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ improves recognition and disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans (DBP), eliminates the option for the corridor method and provides better information about the characteristics of DBP and the risks that entities are exposed on those plans. The major impacts on JMH were the re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability on post-employment benefits actuarial gains and losses and return on plan assets – now presented in OCI.

Individual Annual Report 2. 2.25 Accounting Fair Value Hierarchy policies The following table shows JMH financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 December, according with the following hierarchy levels: • Level 1: the fair value of financial instruments is based on quoted prices obtained in active and liquid markets at balance sheet date. This level includes equity investments quoted in NYSE Euronext; • Level 2: the fair value is not based on quoted prices obtained in active markets included in level 1, but using valuation techniques, involving other comparable quoted prices obtained in active markets or adjusted quotes. Thus, main inputs used on these valuation models are based on observable market data. This level includes the over-the-counter derivatives entered by JMH, whose valuations are provided by the respective counterparties; • Level 3: the fair value is not based on quoted prices obtained in active markets, but determined by using valuation techniques and main inputs are not based on observable market data. This level includes investment properties, which are evaluated by external independent experts, using in their valuations inputs that are not directly observable in the market. 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets measured at fair value Available-for-sale financial assets Equity Investments 339 339 Investment properties 2,470 2,470 Total assets 2,809 339 2,470 Liabilities measured at fair value Derivative financial instruments Used for hedging 818 818 Total liabilities 818 818 2012 Nível 1 Nível 2 Nível 3 Assets measured at fair value Available-for-sale financial assets Equity Investments 153 153 Investment properties 2,470 2,470 Total assets 2,623 153 2,470 Liabilities measured at fair value Derivative financial instruments Used for hedging 3,151 3,151 Total liabilities 3,151 3,151 268|269 2.26 Financial instruments by category Borrowings Available-forTotal financial Non Financial Derivatives defined as Other financial Total assets and accounts sale financial assets and Assets or hedging instruments liabilities and liabilities receivable assets liabilities Liabilities 2013 Assets Cash and cash equivalents 14,205 14,205 14,205 Available-for-sale financial assets 339 339 339 Loans to subsidiaries 645,427 645,427 645,427 Debtors and accrued income 5,613 5,613 215 5,828 Other non-financial assets 679,044 679,044 Total assets 665,245 339 665,584 679,259 1,344,843 Liabilities Borrowings 100,000 100,000 100,000 Derivative financial instruments 818 818 818 Creditors and accrued costs 2,321 2,321 3,078 5,399 Other non-financial liabilities 26,194 26,194 Total liabilities 818 102,321 103,139 29,272 132,411 2012 Assets Cash and cash equivalents 39,895 39,895 39,895 Available-for-sale financial assets 153 153 153 Loans to subsidiaries 611,587 611,587 611,587 Debtors and accrued income 7,187 7,187 209 7,396 Other non-financial assets 679,584 679,584 Total assets 658,669 153 658,822 679,793 1,338,615 Liabilities Borrowings 150,000 150,000 150,000 Derivative financial instruments 3,151 3,151 3,151 Creditors and accrued costs 3,209 3,209 2,577 5,786 Other non-financial liabilities 25,567 25,567 Total liabilities 3,151 153,209 156,360 28,144 184,504 Individual Annual Report 3. Operating The costs of services rendered correspond to the costs incurred by JMH in rendering technical and specialized services to its subsidiaries. In this sense, the costs costs incurred in each one of JMH departments are charged to the companies in the percentage that each one has in the referred services rendering. The administrative costs shown in the income statement include, among others, the percentage of the costs, incurred by each of the departments, which is not charged to the companies, as well as the non deductible VAT arising from the application of the effective allocation method. Other operational costs and losses include, among others, the costs incurred with studies on other markets, as well as donations and sponsorships granted according with the Group Social Responsibility policies. 3.1 Operational costs by nature 2013 2012 Supplies and services 10,162 9,396 Rents 821 869 Staff costs 9,029 7,926 Depreciations and amortizations 268 150 (Gains) losses with tangible and intangible assets 70 Other operational (profit) loss (618) 1,381 19,732 19,722 3.2 Staff costs 2013 2012(*) Wages and salaries 6,165 5,342 Social security 811 637 Employee benefits (see note 28) 1,143 1,321 Other staff costs 1,824 754 9,943 8,054 (*) Restated – see note 2 Other staff costs include namely labour accident insurance, social responsibility costs, training costs and indemnities, among others. The number of employees at the end of 2013 was 87 (2012 was 77). The average number of employees during the year was 82 (73 in 2012). In 2013, the difference between the total staff costs stated in note 3.1, and the total amount of note 3.2, in the amount of EUR 914 thousand, refers to exceptional operating costs associated with the change in the actuarial assumptions (EUR 73 thousand) and exceptional operating costs related with restructuring plans (EUR 841 thousand).

Other financial costs include, namely, stamp tax and issuance costs related to non-current debt recognised in the income statement for the loan’s term. 5. Operating The costs recognised in the income statement as operating leases are as follows: leases 2013 2012 Buildings – Third parties 72 165 Buildings Group 217 203 Vehicles – Third parties 487 437 IT equipment – Third parties 39 36 815 841 Apart from the costs above, there were occasional rentals throughout the year which amounted EUR 6 thousand (2012: EUR 28 thousand). Vehicle and IT equipment lease contracts entered by JMH are treated as operating lease. These contracts do not include renewal or purchase option at termination date, nor any amount relating to contingent rents. All contracts may be cancelled by means of prior notice and do not provide any type of restrictions concerning dividends or debt.

The net payable amount is EUR 225 thousand (2012: EUR 289 thousand payable). 286|287 Cash flow hedge JMH enters into interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk regarding future interest payments on the loans. At 31 December 2013, the bank and bond loans with derivative hedge instruments were EUR 100,000 thousand (2012: EUR 150,000 thousand). JMH fixed a portion of future interest payments on loans, through entering into interest rate swaps. The hedged risk is the variable interest rate index associated with the loans. The purpose of the hedge is to convert the loans with variable interest rate into fixed interest rate. The credit risk of the borrowing is not hedged. Nevertheless, the evaluation of JMH own credit risk and its incorporation in the fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised on the balance sheet would result in an immaterial impact as of 31 December 2013 and 2012. Swaps have a notional EUR 100,000 thousand (2012: EUR 150,000 thousand), and the fair value of these instruments at 31 December 2013 was negative EUR 818 thousand (2012: negative EUR 3,151 thousand). The changes in fair value of these instruments were recognised in other reserves in the amount of positive EUR 2,268 thousand (2012: negative EUR 742 thousand). These derivatives mature in September 2014. In 2013, the derivative instruments associated with the commercial paper loan of EUR 50,000 thousand, referred to in note 22, were canceled, due to the cancelation of the loan. 27.1 Impacts on financial statements 2013 2012 Fair value of the financial instruments at 1 January (3,151) (2,274) (Receipts) / payments made 2,353 1,421 Change in the fair value of financial instruments that qualify as hedge accounting (other reserves) 2,268 (742) Interest expenses from financial instruments that qualify as hedge accounting (P&L) (2,288) (1,556) Fair value of the financial instruments at 31 December (818) (3,151) Individual Annual Report 28.
