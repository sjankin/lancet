There continues to be interest, acceptance and support from all stakeholders in what we are trying to achieve, and the manner in which we are going about it. All that we strive to achieve both individually and as a Company, is underpinned by our Core Values, and there is little doubt that they have improved what we do and how we do it. Our Priorities for the coming year will remain the maintenance and expansion of our reputation for doing things in the correct fashion; we will do this by focussing on Honesty and Integrity, the two most highly placed Core Values within the Group. We will show continual improvement, not only in our performance, but also in our management of our Quality Management System (QMS) and our environmental processes. We are proactive in seeking assurances from our stakeholders about their commitment to the UN Global Compact, and we test the veracity of these assurances, as well as seeking further proof of dissemination up and down our supply chain. Additionally, we will strive to: execute the Vestey Group 5-Year Strategy, which encompasses the majority of the Principles from the UN Global Compact. In June 2014, a VFUK Manager attended the UNGC Food and Agriculture Business (FAB) Principles Presentation in London. VFUK is committed to supporting the UNGC FAB Principles and will report our performance against them in our 2015 COP Report, subject to aligning our policies against the new FAB Principles. The UN Global Compact has helped us to achieve year on year business management improvements to our operating procedures. It has also resulted in a more focussed approach to managing our suppliers and resources, which in turn has helped us to deliver better and more efficient food supply solutions across our business, and re-accredit and achieve new ISO Awards. Original signed Bill Cooper Director VFUK 3 The Ten Principles Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. The Vestey Group is family owned and has a history of food supply dating back to 1897 and is a leading supplier of food within the United Kingdom and overseas, including the Ministry of Defence and the United Nations. We are very aware of our wider social and economic obligations and, we conduct our operations in a way which promotes Corporate Social Responsibility in terms of interaction with our workforce, customers and suppliers. We ensure that information relating to suppliers’ business activities and actions are obtained by providing Supplier Approval Questionnaires (SAQ). The SAQ questions our suppliers on their compliance of the Ten Principles of the United Nations’ Global Compact; a link to the Global Compact website is provided so that suppliers can verify compliance against the principles. All responses to the SAQ are reviewed by ourselves and based on the risk assessment; we also conduct site audits of suppliers. We check all new suppliers against the UN/UK Government Prohibited Sanctions List to ensure that all suppliers are not blacklisted. Labour Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. We are committed to upholding freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. We are committed to the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory and child labour, and we aim to be an equal opportunities employer and respect individuals, regardless of ethnic origin, age or gender. Currently we do not employ any personnel under the age of 18, and we are aware of, and comply with, the Council Directive 94/33/EC covering the protection of young people at work. 4 All employees are encouraged to respect the Vestey Group's Core Values; developed as a guide to how we conduct ourselves day to day, interact with stakeholders, implement decisions, reflect on performance and development needs, and assess or give feedback to others. The four Core Values are: Honesty and Integrity; being a Reliable Partner, Teamwork and Individual Responsibility; and, Adapting to Change. Research demonstrates that having a strong culture and shared values will enhance our reputation and help us to attract and retain talented individuals who exhibit high levels of employee satisfaction and motivation. Value implementation is encouraged and monitored using surveys, communication bulletins and personal feedback. We commission an independent research company to administer an annual staff survey, which includes a questionnaire that covers a number of tailored questions on induction, training, development, and communication, as well as many other aspects of staff duties. We encourage all staff to participate in the survey in order to tell us how they feel; it does not matter how long they have worked for us, or where they work, or what role they fill – all views are equally valid and appreciated. Staff confidentiality is completely protected. All employment posts have formal job descriptions assigned and are advertised to the wider community during the recruitment process. After the interview stage, all applicants are offered formal contracts of employment with information on roles and responsibilities, hours of work and conditions of employment clearly stated. The Company aims to provide employees with fair and competitive terms of employment, and attractive benefits to all employees after completion of a 26 weeks probationary period. Benefits include, but are not limited to, private healthcare, pension scheme and life assurance. It is the Company’s view that the promotion of flexible working arrangements increases staff motivation, performance and productivity, reduces stress and encourages staff retention by enabling employees to balance their work and personal issues. We recognise that success depends upon a workforce that is motivated, skilled and highly trained and we are committed to providing the resources and facilities that support ongoing learning, training and development as well as the needs of the business’ strategic objectives. We have an equal opportunity employment recruitment policy, which provides a diverse and gender balanced workforce. The Company’s Data Protection Policy covers all current and potential employees, suppliers and customers, and is compliant with the Data Protection Act (1998).

Our employees’ hours of work are in general Monday to Friday (0800 to 1700), with appropriate unrestricted breaks with adequate provision for storage and preparation of meals and drinks. We place no restriction on taking annual leave, and sickness leave is provided when requested 5 All employees benefit from a formal induction package on commencing their position, which clearly defines Company policy, reporting procedures, confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations, and we brief employees on the principles of Global Compact during this induction process. All employees are encouraged to respect and adhere to the Group’s ethics policy and Core Values on commencement of their post, indeed Core Values are also covered at the interview stage and all staff were recently given their own copy of the Company Strategy and Core Values brochure. During their employment, all employees participate in annual appraisals. Employees are also encouraged to develop their professional skills through training to the mutual benefit of individuals and the Company. Currently no employees are members of a Trade Union. We strongly promote an environment that allows employees to represent themselves if an issue arises, via open management structure, yearly appraisals and a confidential helpline. Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. We are ISO 14001:2004, Environmental Management Standard accredited and we have an environmental policy that is reviewed bi-annually. The environmental policy is understood by all key personnel and communicated to all new staff when joining the company. All staff undertake regular refresher training days and senior staff are updated on progress during 6 monthly Business Management Meetings. We set environmental objectives and targets annually. Reviews occur at Business Management System Management Meetings against the information recorded in the Register of Environmental Aspects and Environmental Legislation. In setting these objectives and targets, we are mindful of: • The Environmental Policy. • Relative importance of the environmental aspects. • Relevant legislation. • View of any interested parties. • The need to prevent pollution in general. We continue to encourage the use of environmentally friendly technologies and are constantly reminding staff to be mindful of the need to use energy and fuel wisely for both sustainable and economic reasons. 6 The commercial, technical and product development teams work together with our suppliers to eliminate packaging waste and to reduce overall packaging consumption. This is monitored and analysed as part of our annual VALPAC return. We also strongly encourage staff to minimise office waste and adopt more sustainable office practices. All forms of energy consumption are monitored and trended against head count in the company. Waste management and energy consumption are analysed and form part of a Standing Agenda item at 6 monthly BMS meetings. Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. As outlined in our new Ethics Policy, corruption in all forms is not acceptable. Critically, we commit to acting within the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010. An anonymous suggestion/comments box is present in our offices. We operate a malpractice at work policy, which is displayed on all employee communication boards and covers all employees together with any individual undertaking work for the Group on a consultancy basis.
