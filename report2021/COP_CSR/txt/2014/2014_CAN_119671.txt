Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies As a global manufacturer of environmental combustion systems, Turbulent Diffusion recognizes its responsibility to maintain superior environmental protection efforts. As a result, Turbulent Diffusion has developed and implemented an environmental management system in order to manage and prevent negative environmental impacts on the environment. This Environmental Management System meets the requirements of the international standard ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management System for small/medium size businesses. The purpose of the environmental manual is to provide comprehensive evidence to all customers, suppliers, employees, and shareholders, of what specific controls are implemented to ensure adequate environmental management. 8 | 2014 | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS | www.turbulentdiffusion.ca The manual further describes the environmental management system and provides procedures or references for all activities regarding the environmental management system to ensure compliance to the necessary requirements of the standard. The objectives and targets contained in the Environmental Management System include: • Operational objectives to reduce energy usage, elimination of hazardous cleaning materials, and the reduction of consumables. • Product objectives to reduce customer fuel expenditure by 6%, NOx guarantees of as low as 4ppm, as well as a host of other performance guarantees. On an annual basis the Environmental Manual, its objectives, identified aspects, and the policy itself is reviewed for accuracy and applicability. Non-conformance reports as well as corrective actions are also reviewed to determine what preventative actions should be undertaken to ensure a continual improvement process. As of December 18, 2014 Turbulent Diffusion has met or exceeded all product and environmental environmental guarantees for the period of December 19, 2013 to December 18, 2014. www.turbulentdiffusion.ca | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS | 2014 | 9 ANTI-CORRUPTION With a growing global economy, anti-corruption practices are becoming a greater asset for businesses.. PRINCIPLE 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Turbulent Diffusion Technology adheres to a strict anti-corruption policy that applies to all employees and contractors, regardless of their location. Prohibited by law and corporate policy, Turbulent Diffusion employees, contractors, shareholders, and directors are prohibited from giving, promising, or arranging the exchange of money or anything of perceived value, including company work, to a potential or current customer, vendor, government or party official, or person of perceived influence in order to influence that person or company to obtain an improper advantage. Within the nature of our business we obtain sensitive customer information to design or optimize combustion equipment. This information is considered confidential by the customer or manufacture and must be treated as such and applies under the strict anti-corruption policy outlined above. At Turbulent Diffusion, not only do we believe in internal anti-corruption, we are committed to promoting an external anti-corruption policy for suppliers, vendors, contractors, and customers. In contract agreements clauses have been inserted to prohibit anti-corruption. Furthermore, Turbulent Diffusion encourages the use of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Anti-Corruption policy integrated into domestic and international contracts. 10 | 2014 | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS | www.turbulentdiffusion.ca Employees, customers, vendors, and contractors knowing of or suspecting any violation of this policy are required to immediately report to the executive team. Any conflicts of interest are controlled and monitored by an appointed third party. As required, this may include legal advice or consultants. Once a suspected violation is reported, our Anti-Corruption representative conducts interviews and reviews available information with all applicable persons to determine both the validity and severity of the claim. External parties are required to follow a 3 strikes policy; identification, warning, expulsion. Employees however, are required to abide by a two strikes policy; a warning followed by anti-corruption re-training, then termination if required. In 2013 and 2014, there were no reported or documented cases violating the Turbulent Diffusion anti-corruption policy. www.turbulentdiffusion.ca | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS | 2014 | 11 26 01 M ur ray St re e t Por t M ood y, B C C A N A DA Ph on e + 1 604 461 800 1 Fax +1 6 04 461 8002 Email sol ut i ons@ t ur b u l e ntd i ff u s i o n . ca Web w w w. t ur b ul e ntd i ff u s i o n . ca
