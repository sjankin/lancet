The Company makes an effort to raise awareness about sustainable use of energy throughout ArcelorMittal Group. Besides, all steel mills of the Company work with heat recovery and/or reuse of gases from production processes. Juiz de Fora Plant, which produces long carbon, has adapted itself to use charcoal in the production of pig iron used in its steelmaking process. This decreases its dependence on other non-renewable inputs and also streamlines the use of products by the Group itself (charcoal and iron ore). In line with the Group guidelines, ArcelorMittal Brasil understands that the cleanest, most economic and efficient form of energy is that which is saved. It adopts four main guidelines as a way to save energy: Follow-up of specific indicators; Measurement and verification plan; Permanent systems diagnosis; Implementation of cleaner technologies. 36 Table of Message of Sustainability Transparent Making Steel Investing in Enriching Our Reporting Profile Contents the Board Vision Governance More Sustainable Our People Communities Process ArcelorMittal Tubarão, for instance, is electric in the implementation of the following energy self-sufficient.

In 2013 these actions yielded savings of 138,829 GJ, resulting Implementation of Improvement (Fume Suppressant) and Shutdown of Finish Train Electrostatic Precipitator – HSR The new Fume Suppressant model proved more efficient in containing particulate material emissions. It proved to have advantages over the former system, the Electrostatic Precipitator. A small part of the particulate material that might have been suspended and dispersing into the air is now a coproduct. It is 100% sent to the HSR Water Treatment Station (ETA) and finally used as metallic charge in Sintering for further loading in ArcelorMittal Tubarão Blast Furnaces. The shutdown of the Electrostatic Precipitator does not entail in a significant increase in water consumption, since recirculation rate in the HSR is over 97%. This improvement brought a 108 MWh/month decrease in power consumption in the hot strip rolling process at ArcelorMittal Tubarão. 17 The Electrostatic Precipitator works as a magnet that attracts charged particles present in several gases. Besides keeping this dust from dispersing into the air, the equipment also allows for the reuse of the material in the production process. 37 Table of Message of Sustainability Transparent Making Steel Investing in Enriching Our Reporting Profile Contents the Board Vision Governance More Sustainable Our People Communities Process Juiz de Fora Plant also emphasizes the efficient use of as a greenhouse gas.

It is used to measure the amount of particulate material (black smoke) issued by diesel vehicles. Smoke from diesel engine exhaust is made up of particles suspended in the exhaust gas that cloud, reflect or refract light. The equipment is placed at the vehicle exhaust to measure smoke. Smoke is collected by the probe inserted in the exhaust and conducted to the measurement chamber, where there is a light emitter and receiver. The light beam is intercepted by the smoke and so its opacity is measured. The measurement is processed via a software in a laptop computer. 19 The Ringelmann Scale is a chart scale for calorimetric assessment of smoke density. It includes six levels with uniform tone variations from white to black. To find whether the vehicle is emitting smoke above allowed levels, the Ringelmann Scale is used and results compared to standards set in environmental law. 20 Qualiar Award (Air Quality Fetransportes Award) is intended to acknowledge transportation and logistics companies from Espírito Santo State that have exceeded expectations in the Despoluir/ES program, which addresses the importance of the transportation industry in the fight for environmental conservation. 21 Excelsior purchased the degraded area of a micro watershed and is trying to restore it by conserving its springs and planting 3000 saplings of Atlantic Rainforest native trees.
