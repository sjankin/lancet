Operations focus on new ­production of homes in ­attractive ­locations, with the main focus on expanding metropolitan areas and university towns in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Belgium. We are also involved in project ­development of ­commercial premises and ­contract work, primarily in the Greater Stockholm area. JM seeks to promote long-term quality and environmental ­considerations in all its operations. Annual sales total approximately SEK 13 billion, and the company has around 2,200 employees.

This Annual Report is a translation of the original text in Swedish, which is the official version. Value generation through project development JM creates houses where people feel at home. Our business concept is to create attractive living and working environments that satisfy ­ individual needs, both today and in the future. Our goal in terms of share­holders is to give them a higher total return – that is, the sum of dividend and increased value – than share­holders in companies with a similar risk ­profile and business activities. JM resides close to the customer. As a result of our ambition to understand how ­driving forces such as urbanization and demographics ­influence customers and how they live – and which requirements and needs are important to both current and future customers – we are able to offer our customers environmentally sound ­residential units in attractive ­locations in selected markets. We create profit­ability and value for our shareholders through sound risk control and effective capital ­utilization. Uniform modes of production and more effective logistics also ­contribute to value generation. Adopting a long-term approach has been a guiding principle for JM from the very start in 1945. A clear strategic focus and a well-balanced ­building rights portfolio, together with a clear sustainability perspective, form the basis for future value generation. Most of the residential units we build are tenant-owned apartments in apartment blocks, but we also build single-family homes. We also have a certain amount of commercial project development in close vicinity to housing in order to create vibrant neighborhoods.

JM’s employees are currently more active, for example, in terms of working methods and material selections, and we have a good system in place for managing ideas and suggestions for improvement. We are aware that a higher level of commitment results in improved quality and a better work environment. JM will continue being a sustainable company that operates on professional terms and conditions. Work environment everyone’s responsibility Our construction sites are unfortunately subjected to accidents and incidents, despite our control measures aimed at minimizing the risks. The “Safe Lifting” course, which is one aspect of JM’s major initiative to educate craftsmen, is an appreciated course that has provided understanding for how lifting material wears out and needs to be checked on a regular basis. We formed a clear organization for our work environment program over the year with the aim of supporting day-to-day work. Our motto is that it should be easy to make the right decisions, and we have a zero tolerance vision on accidents on the job. In December we had a Work Environment Day for all employees in Sweden and Finland; response in the form of commitment and suggestions for improvement was very positive.

We focus on the customer’s needs. Doing so gives JM one of its most important competitive advantages. In order to assume a leading position, we must be quick to recognize and understand how people live and work. From a slightly longer term perspective, the most important societal changes include urbanization, the aging population and a firmer focus on the environment and sustainability. Trends that influence demand: • Demographic changes, an aging population and a large generation of young people entering the housing market • Urbanization is a strong trend. People are seeking freedom of choice and diversity • Urban areas and commuting distances are growing, which makes new housing markets attractive • New technology generates new opportunities and makes old solutions obsolete • Financial development: continued growth of real disposable income, and the population is more inclined to put a larger portion of income into housing • Shift in values – more prominent individualism, but also accountability for the common environment • The real thing and genuine craftsmanship • The growing green city and the environment.

Operations primarily focus on new production of homes, with the main focus on expanding metropolitan areas and university towns in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Belgium. Demand for new residential units in Sweden was cautious during the year, but improved slightly during the last six months of the year. Demand slowed down in Norway, and the weak demand in Denmark persisted. In all, JM started construction on 2,953 residential units in 2013, compared with 3,163 residential units the previous year. Sweden had 2,465 housing starts; 96 percent were units in apartment blocks (2,170 tenant-owned apartments, 146 rental units and 54 residential care units) and 4 percent were singlefamily homes (95 freehold units). Norway had a total of 331 housing starts; 75 percent were apartments and 25 percent were single-family homes. Belgium had 99 housing starts, all of which were apartments. In Finland and Denmark, production on 46 and 12 single-family homes was started, respectively. JM’s assessed market position in Sweden is number one and in Norway number seven. Market for new production in 2013 The housing market developed positively in 2013. Housing prices in Sweden, Denmark and Finland rose, while they were at a standstill in Belgium and fell in Norway. Continued strong population growth, low interest rates and improved private finances have impacted housing prices positively, while the European debt crisis is still leaving traces in the form of weak economic growth and cautious households, which influence prices negatively. down due to the weak development of export companies and cautious households, which kept down consumption.

We focus on the right style and design for today – and tomorrow. JM makes environmentally conscious selections and ensures that its interior designs maintain good functionality and high quality for many years. Good material choices and JM Original The importance of selecting materials that are long lasting in terms of both quality and design is an important aspect of our homes, especially in terms of our JM Original interior design. It is for this reason that planning of the home’s interior space begins early, to ensure positive interplay between the character of the neighborhood and the building’s architecture as well as good functionality and design. Interior design is an important part of the home. In conjunction with reserving a home, the customer receives an Interior Selections catalogue for the project, in which the well-planned JM Original interior selections are presented. The customer then meets with the project’s interior designer to discuss the various selections that are available for the future dream home. JM continuously works to monitor materials and trends, which is a prerequisite for creating the appropriate basis for the individual project. Our most satisfied customers have selected JM Original as the interior design for their new home. Digital meetings with customers JM is to be accessible where our customers are, which is why digital channels play an important role in our communication with customers and the surrounding world.

At the same time, we also want to take responsibility for our children’s future environment. More information about our environmental initiatives is presented on pages 33–43. Well-insulated windows Windows are often a major source of heat loss in a building. As a result, all of the windows in our new homes have extra heat insulation with a Uw value of 0.9 W/sqmK. Allergies Research has shown that there may be a correlation between problems with allergy in children and PVC. JM’s residential units have PVC-free walls and flooring. The landscaping surrounding JM’s homes avoids the use of plants and trees that are toxic or unsuitable for people with allergies. JM avoids “dusty shelves” in the kitchen by installing cabinets that go up to the ceiling. Energy-efficient appliances Major appliances can account for a large proportion of a household’s electricity consumption, which is why JM equips our housing with energy-efficient appliances. All of our housing that is being planned will be equipped with induction cooktops, which can offer energy savings of up to 20 percent compared to a traditional cooktop. Good electrical installation environment We minimize exposure to electrical and magnetic fields. We always use a five-wire system, which limits the magnetic fields throughout the building, and we avoid locating distribution boxes close to the bedroom. Good sound environment Many people perceive loud sounds and noise as one of the biggest problems in a residential environment. Our residential units are quieter than what Swedish building regulations require. Our extra thick walls and floor structure provide very good insulation between apartments. Our exterior doors are required to have a good sound transmission class, and we avoid mail slots in doors by placing mailboxes in the entry to the stairwells and newspaper delivery boxes by the apartment doors. Possibility to impact energy use Since all of our residential units are constructed according to JM’s concept for low-energy houses, residents can achieve low household operating costs and help lower overall energy use. In addition, hot water usage is measured individually in each apartment, which helps residents understand that using hot water sparingly will also result in a lower cost. Sound materials Wood, rock and tile. We use natural materials to the greatest extent possible. We have been developing an environmental product database since 1996 where we check relevant products. Doing so enables us to build housing that is healthy and helps us avoid using hazardous substances.

The energy rating system excluding household and business electricity is similar to the one used for major appliances, and it indicates a residential unit’s energy use. JM uses a standardized method to calculate the energy use of newly produced homes, which enables a comparison over time. The diagram shows the average The system is based on Swedish Standard SS-24300 and JM’s of housing projects that were completed each year. The calculated energy use guidelines. The values and parameters we employed are presented has been reduced by around 40 percent since 2005. J M A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 3 38 sustainabilit y ENVIRONMENT Choice of materials The growing use of chemicals in society is a major problem. JM’s residential units are built using sound, proven and natural materials such as tile and wood. Since the mid-1990s, we have had an environmental assessment system in place to steer the use of building materials toward reduced usage of chemicals and reduced burden on the environment. All pre-construction and installation work in JM’s residential units complies with requirements under the industry rules “Safe water installation”. The industry rules also apply to installed heating systems. JM works with methods during planning and production that avoid humidity in the building to prevent moisture and water damage. We use moisture-tolerant and mold-resistant gypsum wallboard for both wet areas and exterior wall constructions. Stringent requirements are also placed on vapor barriers for bathroom walls in accordance with current construction regulations. Building waste In 2013, JM’s residential development projects in Sweden generated around 8,400 tons of waste (of which 0.1 percent was hazardous waste). JM endeavors to reduce the amount of unsorted waste and waste sent to the landfill from construction sites in collaboration with our suppliers, waste management companies and by offering internal courses. During a three-year period that started in 2011, we aimed to reduce the amount of waste sent to the landfill by 50 percent and to reduce the amount of unsorted waste by more than 50 percent; see facts and key figures on page 43. The Ecocycle Council industry guidelines for waste management during construction and demolition are integrated in procedures for all JM projects in Sweden. Studies show that packaging and temporary constructions such as protective railings and molding material comprise a significant portion of our waste. As a means of increasing pallet re-usage, JM has been active for a number of years in the industry’s joint system for Long-term environmental program Over the years we have carried out a variety of development projects to test and evaluate new environmental solutions that have then been translated into general requirements for JM’s production.

The carrying amount for the JM Norway Group was tested as of December 31, 2013, and the recoverable amount was found to exceed the carrying amount. Therefore no impairment loss for goodwill was necessary. J M A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 3 NOTES – GROUP 75 The recoverable amount was determined by calculating the value in use of the cashgenerating unit. Value in use for goodwill attributable to the JM Norway Group was NOTE 12 MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT calculated based on discounted cash flows. Cash flow for the first two years, after 2013, is based on the strategic plan adopted by the management. 2013 2012 Cash flow beyond the strategic two-year period is extrapolated based on the Accumulated cost following assumptions: On January 1 80 78 • Estimated operating profit or loss based on the previous year’s results and expectNew purchases 2 2 ations of future market developments. Translation differences -2 0 • Growth rate of at least 2 percent (2) in order to extrapolate cash flow beyond the Sales – 10 0 strategic period. The growth rate is a conservative assumption of the operation’s On December 31 70 80 long-term growth, not exceeding growth for the industry as a whole. Accumulated depreciation according to plan • Discount rate before tax is 11 percent (11), which is based on the JM Group’s On January 1 – 69 – 61 average cost of capital before tax, while taking operation-specific data into account. Depreciation for the year –5 –8 Translation differences 2 0 Sensitivity analysis Sales 10 0 If the estimated operating profit after the end of the strategy period had been 5 percent On December 31 – 62 – 69 lower than the management’s assessment, the recoverable amount would decrease by 4 percent. Closing residual value according to plan 8 11 If the estimated growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the strategy period had been 50 percent lower than the basic assumption, the recoverable amount would decrease by 8 percent. If the estimated average cost of capital applied for the discounted cash flow had NOTE 13 PARTICIPATIONS IN ASSOCIATED COMPANIES been 3 percentage points greater than the basic assumption, the recoverable amount would decrease by 23 percent. 2013 2012 A sensitivity analysis of the discount rate shows that the discount rate would have Accumulated cost to exceed about 21 percent (22) before the need for impairment would be present. On January 1 10 9 In all cases, the sensitivity analysis above shows a surplus (i.e. that the recoverable New purchases 1 amount is higher than the carrying amount). None of the hypothetical cases above Sales 0 0 should lead to impairment of goodwill for the Norwegian business.

Total 2,385 2,475 Interest rate risk Short-term investments have a maturity between one day and three months. Interest risk refers to the risk that changes in interest rates would have a negative effect on the Group’s net interest and cash flow. One of the biggest risk factors involves choosing the interest rate period for the Group’s loan portfolio. JM chooses its fixedNOTE 23 financial LIABILITIES interest period based on the tied up capital and cash flows of ongoing projects, the volume of long-term borrowing, as well as the current market situation for interest rates with different maturities. To achieve the desired fixed-interest period, the Group Long-term interest-bearing liabilities 2013 2012 primarily works with interest rate derivatives, mainly interest rate swaps. Liabilities to credit institutions maturity date 1–5 years Since the volume of long-term borrowing is relatively limited, the Group mainly from closing day 195 155 works with short time to maturity. The average fixed-interest period excluding pension Long-term promissory notes, development properties liability on December 31, 2013, was 0.2 years (0.3). 1–5 years 75 75 Fair value on interest-bearing loans was SEK 823m (877).

Financing and liquidity risk Financing and liquidity risk refers to the risk that loans could become more difficult and more expensive to refinance and that the Group cannot fulfill its current payment obligations due to inadequate liquidity. The Group manages its financing risk by signing long-term binding credit agreements with different maturities with several different institutions.

The relevant key indicators can be seen in the five-year overview on page 89. Also see the “Business concept and strategy” and “The JM Share” sections. Valuation of financial assets and liabilities JM used generally accepted methods for calculating the fair value of the Group’s financial instruments as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. The fair value of interest-bearing liabilities to credit institutions is assumed to correspond to the carrying amount since they mainly have a short fixed term of less than three months. Notes payable for property acquisitions become payable in conjunction with fulfillment of various conditions, such as approval of local plans or when the project begins. The fair value of notes payable for property acquisitions is therefore assumed to be equal to the carrying amount when the liabilities are payable on demand. For all other financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, the carrying amount is assumed to provide a good approximation of fair value/cost. The Group applies trade date accounting.
