There was an outstanding for Libra Logística which achieved 30% growth in relation to 2012, increasing its participation from 16% to 19% per cent in Grupo Libra’s revenue. Libra Terminais showed a 4% growth in sales revenue, due to the growth in the import storage revenue partially balanced by the reduction in the port operation revenue arising from the highest competition in the Port of Santos, due to the entrance of new competitors. Libra Aeroportos reduced its participation in the revenue due to the revenue reduction of regular cargo storage, and Libra Participações, which consolidates the companies (CNA, Olivares de Quepu, Cia. Providência and Libra Imobiliária), had a reduction of 18% in the Revenue due to the change of ODQ consolidation criterion at Grupo Libra in 2013.

Financial Result In 2013, Grupo Libra’s net financial result was related to net expenses in the amount of BRL 99 million, a result of financial expense effects and exchange rate variations that affected financing agreements. Financial revenue variation arises from flow reduction of Grupo Libra’s companies, especially for its use as a source of resources for investments in the expansion of terminals in progress. The exchange rate devaluation of 15% of Brazilian currency (BRL) against American dollar (US$) in 2013 was the main reason to increase the amount estimated of net exchange rate variations a year, due to exposure of this currency in debts incurred by Libra Terminais.

The main impacts are related to the increase of net financial expenses arising from the lowest financial revenue in 2013 and from the increase of exchange rate variation, in the debt stock valuation in dollar and reduction of financial revenue which was minimized by the highest operational cash generation (EBITDA) shown in relation to 2012.

Short-term debts in 2013 accounted for 14% of the total gross debt, which represents an increase of 5 percentage points (BRL47 million) in comparison to the short term indebtedness in 2012, arising from the contract mature date of financing made in previous years. The extension of debt average term which changed from 5.29 years in 2012 for 5.45 years in 2013 should be highlighted. On the other hand, the net indebtedness position of Grupo Libra on December 31st of 2013 amounts to BRL 688 million. The estimated financial leverage of the company in 2013, measured by the relation net indebtedness/Ebitda, is of 1.88x. The increase of indebtedness and the financial leverage level of Grupo Libra is related to the cycle of investments in business expansion projects highlighting the Expansion Plan of Libra Terminais Rio (PLTR), all financed by long-term credit lines.

However, there were some outstanding projects and initiatives in the operation of Libra Aeroportos, such as the increase in the sea and airport modal integration through the Port of Forno and the mapping and capture of special project cargoes of oil and gas. In addition, the unit opened a new weekly cargo route with Europe (Amsterdam –Cabo Frio). With this unit, which brings gains of logistic and collection effectiveness, the Airport of Viracopos, in São Paulo, is no longer the single option of the importer from Rio de Janeiro to receive cargoes from Europe. Another reason to celebrate in this same year was the publication of Public Utility Decree for the purposes of expropriating areas addressed to Condomínio Logístico (Conlog).

In addition, the unit closed the year with a new model of customer’s service which monitors all steps of its flow, involves trained employees, well defined processes and systems of control and follow-up, in order to offer a differentiated service to customers. Another way of Grupo Libra to listen to its customers is to carry out an annual satisfaction survey to evaluate its perception about the company and the services provided. In 2013, the results showed an important satisfaction growth of ship owners, whether in relation to Libra Terminais Santos or Libra Terminais Rio, that achieved a respective growth of 30 and 14 percentage points, being among the best in their regions. However the satisfaction of Importers and Exporters respectively dropped 3 and 8 points – the main elements to be improved are in Rio de Janeiro, with 53% dissatisfied public, showing operational problems faced along the year. Several actions were implemented in 2013 with significant evolution in the last months of the year. Libra Logística shows an excellent result in its customers’ satisfaction. The general index of satisfaction has been 79% since 2011, even with the unit growth. What customers of Libra Terminais and Libra Logística showed in common as a point of attention was the billing process. On the other hand, at Libra Aeroportos, the main aspects to be observed are related to process improvement and goods clearance. The results obtained by the annual customer’s satisfaction survey of Grupo Libra will be used a subsidy for the development of an action plan adjusted to the relationship strategies of each unit. As a part of this action plan, in 2013 Grupo Libra consolidated the Customer’s Assistance (SAC) of Libra Terminais that supports, through the line 0300-11LIBRA (54272), customers from the terminals of Santos and Rio de Janeiro. 2013 Annual and Sustainability Report 46 Management 2013 Annual and Sustainability Report Management 47 Sustainability Commitments In 2012, Grupo Libra undertook four commitments which guide its main actions and investments: a) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (especially diesel consumption); b) suitable waste reduction, treatment and disposal; c) training of youngsters from the community surrounding the operations for their first job; d) labor safety improvement and sustainability qualification of employees.

Since its base year inventory developed in 2010, the company has systemically reduced its direct emissions (Scope 1) with investments in new technologies, especially in terminals, and a closer management in relation to runaway emissions of cooling gases. The profile of Grupo Libra’s direct emissions is marked by diesel oil consumption in movable equipment, of cargo and container movement. The port operations also make use of large electric power equipment. Furthermore, in relation to direct emissions, in 2013 Libra Logística Campinas and CNA were highlighted with expressive reductions in their emissions. Libra Logística Campinas changed its refrigerating gas to another of lower impact in the ozone layer, and then Grupo Libra advances to the mandatory elimination set forth by the Montreal Protocol for 2040. On the other hand, CNA showed a 27% reduction of its total emissions, a result which is mainly explained by the best programming, which optimizes logistics and enables transportation in convoys with higher volumes carried per travel. This also explains why Grupo Libra remained below its goal of diesel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for 2013. Indirect emissions for power consumption (Scope2) of Grupo Libra suffer with the increase of carbon percentage present in the Brazilian energy matrix due to a higher use of thermoelectric plants. The company decided to provide more transparency to third party emissions in its establishments with the report of its indirect emissions by other sources (Scope 3) in order to stimulate its value chain (customers, suppliers and third parties) instead of provide visibility to impacts of its operations. These impacts are mainly related to supplies made by third parties in airline company aircrafts which use the International Airport of Cabo Frio.

Administration Responsibilities of the Company Grupo Libra’s administration is responsible for the suitable development and presentation of information released on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report, according to Guidelines for Sustainability Report of Global Reporting Initiative – GRI (GRI3.1) and to the internal controls it determined as necessary to enable the development of this information exempt from pertinent distortion, no matter if it is caused by fraud or error. Responsibilities of the Independent Auditors Our responsibility is to express conclusion about information released on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report based on the limited assurance work conducted according to the Technical Communication (CT) 07/2012 passed by the Federal Accounting Council and developed according to NBC 3000 (Assurance Tasks Different from Audit and Review), issued by the Federal Accounting Council – CFC, that equals to the international regulation ISAE 3000, issued by the International Accountant Federation, applicable to historical non-financial information. These regulations demand the compliance with ethical requirements, including independence requests and that the task is carried out for the purpose of obtaining limited confidence that the information released on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report , together, is free of any pertinent distortions. A limited assurance report carried out according to NBC TO 3000 (ISAE 3000) mainly consists of questionings to Grupo Libra’s administration and other professionals of the Company that are involved in the development of information contained on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report as well as by the application of analytical procedures to obtain evidence which enables us conclude in the way of limited assurance about sustainability information together. A limited assurance report also requires the performance of additional procedures when the independent auditor is aware of matters which make him believe the information released on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report together can show pertinent distortions. The selected procedures based on our understanding of aspects related to compilation, materiality and presentation of information contained on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report and of other task circumstances and of our consideration about areas and processes related to material sustainability information released where pertinent distortions may exist. The procedure covered: (a) task planning considering the materiality of aspects and topics for activities and operations of the Company, the importance of information released, the volume of quantitative and qualitative information and the operational systems and internal controls which were used as a base for the development of sustainability information contained on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report of Grupo Libra; (b) understanding of calculation methodology and procedures for the compilation of indicators through interviews with the managers responsible for the information development; (c) understanding of reporting process and the management of material aspects and performance indicators; (d) application of analytical procedures about quantitative information and questionings about qualitative information and its correlation with indicators released on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report; 2013 Annual and Sustainability Report 71 (e) analysis of evidence which supports quantitative and qualitative information released on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report; (f) analysis of processes for the development of the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report and of its structure and content, based on the Principles of Content and Quality of Guidelines for the Sustainability Report of Global Reporting Initiative – GRI (GRI-G3.1;) (g) visits to Grupo Libra’s business units for application of procedures (b), (c), (d), (e) e (f); (h) confrontation of financial indicators with financial statements and/or accounting records; and (i) reasonableness analysis of omission justifications for the non-release on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report of performance indicators related to aspects and material topics shown in the process of materiality definition conducted by the Company. We believe the information, evidence and the results achieved in our report are enough and appropriate to ground our limited conclusion. Scope and limitations The procedures applied in a limited assurance report are significantly shorter than the ones applied on a reasonable assurance report. As a consequence, they do not enable us to obtain confidence that we are aware of all matters which would be identified in a reasonable assurance task which has the purpose of issuing a report. If we had performed a reasonable assurance report, we could have identified other matters and any distortions which may exist in information contained on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report. The non-financial data are liable to more inherent limitations than financial data, given the nature and diversity of methods used to determine, calculate or estimate these data. Qualitative interpretations of materiality, importance and precision of data are liable to individual suppositions and assessments. In addition, the scope of our tasks did not contemplate the review of data related to greenhouse gas emissions and we did not carry out any activity based on data provided for previous years, for evaluation of suitability of their policies, practices and performance in sustainability or in relation to future projections. Conclusion Based on procedures carried out and herein described, nothing has come to our attention that makes us believe the information contained on the 2013 Annual Sustainability Report was not compiled in all important aspects, according to the Guidelines for Sustainability Report of Global Reporting Initiative – GRI (GRI-3.1), and to records and files which were used as a base for its preparation.
