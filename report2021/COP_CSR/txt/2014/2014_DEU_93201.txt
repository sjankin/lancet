We greatly value their in-depth language training, which is an excellent match for Wieland‘s internationalization objectives. The share of apprentices who complete their training and immediately go on to become employees of Wieland lies at almost 100 percent. The percentage of those who are still employed by the company three years later is also pleasantly high at approximately 50 percent. Wieland‘s social commitment is also demonstrated by the fact that with every intake of apprentices we provide a few places for apprentices from the ABF (Forchheim Training Alliance) Initiative so that young people whose school careers have not gone all that smoothly can benefit as well from good, sound professional training and make their way in the world. 12 CSR-Report 2014 5.0% Engagement by Wieland‘s own personnel officers is Training quota at nothing new with their involvement in youth project Wieland Electric GmbH 4.0% days (e.g. implementation of applicant training programs at schools with simulated interviews), but 3.0% from 2012 solid building blocks are also to be put in 2.0% place for manager training: Training quota Besides the regular presentations to instruct managers 1.0% on the annual performance appraisal and career 0% development interviews with the staff in their charge 2011 2012 2013 as well as other management briefings, from 2012 workshops will also be offered on the subject of We also give our apprentices access to attractive “communication and conflict communication” (for all additional offers while they are learning, such as an middle managers and senior engineers) to ensure that all-day welcome workshop as a team-building all managerial personnel at Wieland have the same measure, participation in the plain-language program basic knowledge in this area and “sing from the offered by the publishing house Mediengruppe same hymn sheet”.

We provide training and information to motivate staff to behave in an eco-friendly manner. 3 Compliance with official and legal requirements as well as our company guidelines underpins our environmental protection measures. 4 We conduct regular reviews to improve our management system continuously and to document our achievements. The defined environmental and energy targets are our benchmark. 5 In the event of deviations from our environmental policy, we intervene with appropriate corrective measures. 6 We plan, set up, operate, and develop our plant technology according to the latest technological advancements with a view to “improving energy efficiency”. 7 We fully utilize technical and economic possibilities in order to avoid waste and emissions and to reduce energy consumption. Where waste is nevertheless produced, we examine recycling and recovery options for these substances. Non-recyclable waste is disposed of in an eco-friendly way. 8 We select, transport, store, use, and dispose of operating and auxiliary materials in line with environmental considerations. If we employ third parties for these purposes, we validate their technical know-how and reliability. 9 We use raw materials and energy in a manner that is as economical and as eco-friendly as possible. We pursue this goal from the development to the disposal of our products. 10 In all matters of environmental protection we cooperate with the public authorities, associations, and other technical institutions. We provide open and objective information on matters of internal environmental protection. 11 W  e provide our customers with appropriate information on environmental aspects relating to our products. 12 We pursue the target of involving our contract partners in improving our environmental performance. 15 Environmental management Sustainable technologies – photovoltaics Our products are widely used in the ➲ Eco-friendly product development/ products for sustainable technologies context of “green”, sustainable forms Wieland Electric was quick to recognize that pluggable installation of photovoltaic systems is safer and far of energy (solar and wind power). more effective and flexible than conventional cabling. We designed not only special PV connectors but also an extensive portfolio of standard products for the DC and AC sides (DIN rail terminal blocks with spring clamp and screw connection technology, PC board terminals, empty electronics housings, industrial connectors, overvoltage protection, string monitoring, DC distributors, and AC distributors) as well as professional project planning support and projectspecific components. For the AC side of photovoltaics plants the gesis® ACSOLAR system was developed, which is suited to the pluggable connection of inverters, main distributors, and yaw motors (tracker drives). The mechanically coded RST 25i3/i5 3 and 5 pole round connectors offer secure pluggable connections and save valuable time on the building site. The connection cables can be sourced pre-assembled to the exact length or assembled on-site. Leading manufacturers equip their solar inverters with Wieland‘s pluggable device connector actually at the factory so fitters and building owners can benefit from simple electrical connection without opening the inverter. 16 CSR-Report 2014 Environmental management Sustainable technologies – wind power plants ➲ Wind power plants Spaces inside wind power plants have to be fully illuminated in compliance with standards in order to ensure that service personnel can climb up the tower safely, including in an emergency. With its pluggable energy bus solution podis® Wieland Electric offers a system that is not only cheaper and quicker to install, but can be adapted very flexibly to individual tower models because of its modular structure. The components have international approval and are particularly suitable for use in the industrial environment worldwide. The energy bus system is installed using a flat cable system that has already been partly pre-assembled at the factory. This is delivered to the tower builder as required for the project and then assembled and pre-installed in segments. Upon the erection of the tower, the system is simply connected using connectors. 17 Environmental management smart installation – building installation The environmental aspect of the Wieland ➲ Example: Who is certified, and how? product range is most visible when it Green building certification is voluntary, unlike compliance with the EnEV and issue of the energy comes to the certification of buildings by pass. The project is certified by the respective organization. Generally, construction and renovation different companies. Wieland products, projects are already monitored by the organization, which ensures that the targeted certification level is reached. The actual certification is then performed especially the systems, contribute to using point systems with checklists. The smart installation concept excels here. From many of the ratings. simple electrical connection to room automation with presence detectors and room thermostats, Wieland helps to create sustainable buildings. The pluggable electrical installation scores well in all areas, from planning, execution, and operation all the way through to renovation and demolition. Flat cable systems and distributed automation reduce wiring expenses considerably. Besides being pluggable, the electrical installation also remains flexible during operation. The use of room automation devices, especially presence detectors and room thermostats, plays an active role in helping to save energy. The most recent studies by Biberach Technical University produced potential savings in electrical energy of over 30% and in thermal energy of over 50% thanks to room automation. These values were calculated using seminar rooms at the university over two years during ongoing operation – without any structural measures!

Electricity and compressed air are used efficiently; oil-based coolants are treated and recycled. The filings and punching scrap accrued are all sorted, de-oiled, and recycled as raw materials. 20 CSR-Report 2014 ➲ Plastics production The sprue material accrued is recycled and Thermoplastics are processed on fully automated integrated into the production process injection molding machines. Mechanical, electrical, and fire-protection properties are taken into account when selecting the plastics again in compliance with regulations. used, as are all environmental aspects. The priority is given to halogen-free flame-retardant plastics that exhibit an extremely low smoke density and toxicity during a fire. This aspect is becoming increasingly important. The heat generated while processing plastics is extracted via plate heat exchangers and cooling towers. Energy input is minimized by using closed cooling systems to cool both the tools and the machines. This measure means that refrigerating units to cool the machines can be dispensed with all year round. 21 Environmental management Eco-friendly manufacturing processes ➲ Electro-plating In 2004, a new electroplating process to state-of-the The waste water treatment facility that was also art production and environmental technology was commissioned in 2004 processes all the waste water deployed.
