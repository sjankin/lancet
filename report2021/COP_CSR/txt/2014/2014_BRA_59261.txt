Sustainability and corporate responsibility Report 2012 The art of Vik Muniz for a more sustainable world In the hands of Brazilian artist Vik Muniz unusual materials such as sugar, chocolate, magazine clippings and even trash come to life in images reliving everyday life situations, whether they show famous people or not, describing nature and the environment in quite an upto-date and realistic way. In this Report you will find some of the pieces that are part of the surprising and magical collection created by Vik Muniz specially to advertise the Movimento ArcelorMittal Recicla. This is a project designed by the company to foster culture, citizenship and sustainability, always around a focus on recycling. In order to produce these works in its studio in Rio de Janeiro, the artist employed over 12 tons of scrap provided by ArcelorMittal, which today is considered the largest metallic scrap recycler in the world. In the pieces of about 300 m² each we can notice seven different kinds of 100% recyclable and 100% sustainable steel scrap. 2 Summary Message of the Board The Importance of Steel ArcelorMittal Sustainability Vision Transparent Governance Making Steel More Sustainable Investing in Our Staff Enriching our communities Reporting process Summary 1.
