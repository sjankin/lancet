Dalekovod’s business operations were further marked by the administrative settlement process, which we underwent last year. The agreement process with our creditors was supposed to be completed in an extremely short timeframe, however, due to the lack of alignment of legislation and judicial practice, over a year was necessary to conclude a settlement. Due to the stated circumstances, Dalekovod faced numerous difficulties in signing new deals, as well as additional challenges in its everyday business operations. After the successful completion of the administrative settlement process, we began to focus on our core business – the design, production and construction of transmission lines, as well as accompanying infrastructure, as part of which we additionally develop sustainable business operations and introduce new business processes, in order to be able to achieve our long-term sustainability goals. Dalekovod’s focus in the forthcoming period is to strengthen exports and attract foreign investments, and more specifically to build transmission lines, substations and infrastructure facilities. Despite facing numerous challenges in our everyday business operations, we have always kept in mind the implementation and the advancement of all areas related to sustainability. Due to the previously mentioned business conditions, in the short-term, we were concentrated on maintaining business operations and jobs, which were additional reasons for reducing the consumption of all resources, thereby further enhancing sustainability. 5 01 01 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT GRI4 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT GRI4 Given that we are one of the leading companies in the transmission line construction ORGANIZATION PROFILE business segment, we always keep up to date with the trends followed by leading global companies, and in this manner we have remained at the very top of leading global comThe Social Responsibility Report was prepared by the Dalekovod Group, although such panies.
