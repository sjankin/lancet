Guided by the Ethics Officer, the committee is responsible for the implementation of the anti-bribery and corruption compliance program. This is a break from the past where ethics compliance was discussed in various meetings as an agenda. The development of an ethics function has brought focus and coordination in the way Kapa manages its ethics-related initiatives. Kapa’s internal audit department has also been responsible for compliance with anti-bribery and corruption. Any cases reported on bribery and corruption are directed to the Ethics Committee and finally to the Board of Directors. Due diligence Kapa performs due diligence procedures on its customers, agents, suppliers as well as employees. Background checks on new employees are conducted through telephone calls and reference forms sent to previous employers aimed at gathering information relating to their integrity and history. Majority of Kapa customers are regional distributors. The Company requires its customers to produce relevant certification documents such as PIN and VAT certificates. Before taking on any customer, background checks are carried out including contacting references and fellow business associates who have dealt with them before. The results of the background checks are recorded in writing via email or letter and attached to the Customer Data form (which is used to open new customer accounts). Kapa’s customers are assessed on a regular basis. In case of any negative reports or suspicion of fraudulent activities, the customer can be dropped or blacklisted depending on the severity of the offense. Kapa’s suppliers go through a vetting process before being selected. The process includes background checks, checks with referees, obtaining copies of important documents such as PIN and VAT certificates, certificate of incorporation and recommendations from business associates. Suppliers are required to sign a supplier data from which captures all their details. Once contracted, their performance is monitored periodically.

Kapa: Marketing team in a training session, 2013 Monitoring and review Testing of controls is carried out by the internal audit team. The internal audit procedures have been designed to incorporate tests relating to anti-bribery and corruption. Response and investigative procedures Employees are encouraged to report any ethics-related allegations to their Line Manager, who forwards them to the Ethics Officer. The report is then discussed by the ethics committee. Depending on the committee’s deliberations, the Ethics Committee can recommend the matter to be investigated further. From the third line of defense, the Ethics Officer may be assisted by the internal auditor to carry out investigative activities when they arise. Where allegations are leveled against any of the Board members, relating with the conduct of business itself, the matter is handled at the Board level. Kapa is committed to reporting any cases of corruption and other forms of dishonesty to the relevant authorities and cooperating with the authorities in facilitating legal actions against those involved.

The questionnaire included aspects of the inherent risks to the jurisdiction relating to government agents, local authorities and industry-related risks. The Ethics Officer analyzed the received questionnaire and developed the risk profile. The results of the analysis were forwarded to the ethics committee for further discussion. Developed Anti-Corruption Code and Policies In February 2013, Kapa embarked on developing policies on anticorruption aimed at ensuring that its various stakeholders do not engage in corrupt activities. There is now a fully developed policy on anti-corruption and fraud which will be available for view on our website www.kapa-oil.com once ready. The Kapa Code of Conduct requires every employee to take responsibility for ensuring that the Company business is undertaken with utmost integrity and respect but not limited to fraud and extortion, bribery, facilitation payments, gifts and entertainment, interaction with third parties, government and public officials, charitable contributions and sponsorships, political donations and conflict of interest. The Code of Ethics includes a commitment to work against corruption and publicly states a policy of zero tolerance on these issues. The policies have taken into account the requirements of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act (2003) and its enforcement mechanisms as well as the UN Global Compact principle on anticorruption. Employees, business partners and other third parties are required to sign up to the anticorruption Code of Conduct upon entering into contract with Kapa.
