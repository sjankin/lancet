Firstly, the 25th of April, I have had the honor to take over the reins of Unibail-Rodamco when Guillaume Poitrinal decided to bring the succession process to a close. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him, who through his 18 years of dedication to the Group, was able to turn a French company called Unibail into the world-class leader in commercial real estate we know today. Secondly, following this change in leadership, I thought it was also the right time to rethink the Management Board, creating a new group of highly skilled, highly different and highly complementary individuals, who I am sure, will guide the Group to new successes. Operationally, our ability to predict and understand customer expectations has enabled Unibail-Rodamco to deliver a remarkable performance in all its three activities despite the weakness of Europe’s economic recovery. Three fundamentals underpin the Group’s ability to remain at the forefront of changes in the market: concentration, differentiation and innovation. We continue to focus our portfolio on assets with high growth potential, namely large, high quality shopping and leisure destinations in the best locations. As a result, more than 90% of our retail portfolio attracts more than 6 million visits a year. We will continue our successful, disciplined, approach to disposals we expect to dispose an estimated €1.5 Bn to €2.0 Bn worth of shopping centres in the next five years. We use differentiation and innovation initiatives to further bolster the intrinsic qualities of these prime assets. The Group’s shopping centres have become leisure destinations, true multi-sensory environments with unique architecture, spectacular events, differentiating retailers, outstanding services and innovative digital tools. In short, we create exceptional places for the best brands to meet the largest number of customers. However, this is just the beginning. To continue to set ourselves apart, we have intensified our focus on innovation in 2013. UR Lab, the Group’s innovation incubator, inaugurated its own campus in December, providing a real scale test lab to develop new concepts. Unibail-Rodamco has innovation in its DNA: after Digital Dream™, iconic shop fronts, the Dining Experience™ or the New Art of Working™ for offices, we will continue to dare to be different and redefine tomorrow’s retail, office and Convention & Exhibition assets. We are confident that even the most challenging markets will reveal exciting opportunities for those who are capable to innovate and make a difference. 2013 was an outstanding year with €1.1 Bn worth of projects delivered, including Aéroville located next to the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris and the extensions of Centrum Černý Most in Prague and Täby Centrum in Stockholm. These projects, as well as a pipeline of €6.9 Bn, are proof of the Group’s confidence in the opportunities ahead. None of this performance would be possible without the dedication of the Group’s exceptional teams. Each of our assets is connected to the social, economic and environmental issues of its community, embodies the operational complexity and turnover of a large company, involves local challenges and yet is managed by a handful of people. Our ambition is to be the leader in all our markets. This necessitates highly skilled and passionate individuals, entrepreneurs, whose vision is to set the Group apart. Our unwavering commitment to satisfying our stakeholders has made alll the di ce difference p e past e in the pa and I have no doubt this will drive our continued success in the future. Sincerely, Christophe Cuvillier CEO and Chairman of the Management Board. 13 CORPORATE | STRONG VALUES WHICH DRIVE OUR PERFORMANCE Despite consumer and business spending continuing to lag in Europe in 2013, Unibail-Rodamco produced a gratifying 6.5% increase in recurring earnings per share.” ROB TER HAAR, The Supervisory Board, again, had a very high level of active Chairman’s Message participation this year and continued to benefit from the close and transparent relationship that it has developed with Despite consumer and business spending continuing to lag the Management Board over the years.

Since 2007, the Group has published an annual corporate sustainability report which aims to provide a clear, objective picture of its goals and results. Since the 2010 reporting period, the corporate sustainability report has been integrated into the annual report to reﬂect the fact that sustainable practices are fully integrated into the Group’s everyday operations. In 2013, the Group started implementing its reﬁned long term sustainability strategy and priorities, based on the conclusions of the materiality review carried out at the end of 2012. In particular, the cooperation with stakeholders and local economic development is now of greater importance in the Group’s sustainability initiatives, which sustain and create value for both the Company and its stakeholders. At the same time, the Group maintained its efforts in tackling environmental issues, which is illustrated by the increase in environmental certiﬁcation for its entire portfolio and development projects. In 2013, 15 additional shopping centers and 4 additional office buildings obtained the highest scores in BREEAM-In-Use certiﬁcates, reaching 53% (in value) of the standing Retail properties awarded with an environmental certiﬁcation and for more than 1.6 million m2 GLA.

The CO2 figures are calculated with local emission factors for each source of energy consumption. These factors depend on the source of energy (electricity gas etc.) the country and the energy supplier. The KPI highlights the split between direct CO2 emissions (scope 1: gas and fuel oil) and indirect CO2 emissions (scope 2: electricity district heating network and district cooling network).
