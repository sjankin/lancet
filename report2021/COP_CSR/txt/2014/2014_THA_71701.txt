This is why PTT invests in human capital development by promoting systematic knowledge management and continuing education, as well as investing in innovation. We established the PTT Leadership and Learning Institute to develop our employees in a formal and structured way. In addition, we are investing in education to enhance the country’s competitiveness as part of our creating shared value effort. By spearheading the establishment of the RAyong Institute of Science and Technology (RAIST) and RAyong Science Academy (RASA), which are expected to admit their first incoming classes in 2015, PTT plays a big part in creating long-term and sustainable competitiveness for the country through the development of personnel and knowledge in technology, science, and engineering fields. To raise industry standards, PTT co-hosted the Energy Session to define the direction and framework for energy policy in ASEAN at the World Economic Forum on East Asia held in Naypyidaw, Myanmar. PTT also participated in the Fortune Global Forum in Chengdu, China to discuss how businesses in Asia can contribute to energy security on both national and regional levels.

broken down by provinces or Thailand’s regional level because PTT’s reporting boundary covers domestic operation only. OH & S data is not broken down by gender because PTT gives equal importance to the safety of all employees in accordance with PTT’s code of business ethics. 2012 Absentee Rate Normalization factor was changed from 200,000 hours to percentage (100). TRIC, TRIR, OIFR, LTIF data do not include first aid case. LWC data are tracked based on calendar day. Record begins the next day. Working hours of contractors at service stations include only stations in which PTT owns and operates. The information also excludes contractors who are not involved in the main business, such as convenient stores in the stations. Working hours of NGV Service Station covers NGV Mother Station and PTT’s own and operate only. PTT’s OH & S reporting scope does not include the operation of contractors in project during the period prior to delivering the area back to PTT. In 2013, recording and reporting requirements for contractors’ hours were expanded to increase the coverage.  Æ For PTTEP: Employee includes Employee & Supervised Contractor (PTTEP & PTTEP Services Ltd.). Contractor includes Independent Contractor only.  Æ For PTT: Contractors include Supervised Contractor and Independent Contractor. For the next report cycle, OH & S data will be reported by Total workforce and Independent contractors. In 2013, there were 3 fatalities all of which occurred outside of operational areas. All incidents were travel related which included a plane crash during a flight to the Lao People’s Democratic Republic which resulted in 2 fatalities (1 employee, 1 contractor) and a car accident which resulted in 1 employee fatality. Although the plane crash incident was beyond PTT’s control, PTT supports employee’s right to refuse work when conditions  CTGFGGOGFWPUCHGHQTGZCORNGYJGPÍ[KPIWPFGTWPHCXQTCDNGYGCVJGTEQPFKVKQPUWEJCUVJKUKPEKFGPV+PCFFKVKQPCNN266GORNQ[GGUJCXGVJG authority to stop work if he or she determines that the work could result in a severe accident or injury.

The organizational boundary of PTT based on equity share approach includes every domestic companies that PTT directly owns more than 20% shares or indirectly own 100% share. The percentage of shareholding was at 31 December for each calendar year. In 2013, PTT has revised base year from 2010 to 2012 as data quality was more accurate; therefore, GHG emission from such year was recalculated. Major recalculations under operational control approach include taking out companies such as PPCL and adding some companies such as IPT that was merged with PTTUT to become GPSC and are reported in this year’s publication. After recalculation, an increase in GHG scope 2 since 2012 was mainly from the merger of PTTCH with PTTAR leading to the inclusion of several facilities that use electricity. GHG intensity of refinery business in 2012 was revised for more accuracy. The GHG intensity reporting boundary of Refinery includes TOP, IRPC, PTTGC, BCP. The GHG intensity reporting boundary of Petrochemical includes IRPC, HMC, PTTGC and PPCL (before merging to become one facility under PTTGC).

PTT began reporting energy consumption based on boundary of operational control approach similar to GHG inventory in 2012. Therefore, the approach for calculating direct energy consumption of 2010 and 2011 was different comparing to 2012. PTT is undergoing the recalculation of past years’ data and is expecting to report in next year’s publication. Reduction in direct energy consumption, as well as energy intensity, was partly due to the implementation PTT Group Energy Management System Project in 2013. Intensity of Oil & Gas Production, Refinery and Petrochemical follows GHG intensity reporting. 2013 boundary successfully includes Energy intensity of Refinery and Petrochemical plants of IRPC as planned. 2012 intensity was also recalculated.

Terms of Engagement Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd. (LRQA) was commissioned by PTT Public Company Limited (PTT) to provide independent assurance on its Sustainability Report 2013 (“the Report”) against the assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance using LRQA’s verification procedure. LRQA’s verification procedure is based on current best practise and uses the principles of AA1000AS (2008) Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Reliability of performance data and processes defined in ISAE3000. Our assurance engagement covered PTT’s operations and activities in Thailand and specifically the following requirements: x Confirming that the Report is in accordance with: GRI G3.1’s Reporting Guidelines and application level A GRI Oil and Gas Sector Supplement (OGSS 3.1) x Evaluating the reliability of data and information only for the following specified Indicators: Energy consumption within the organization (EN3), Direct and Indirect GHG emission (EN16), NOx, SOx, and other significant air emission (VOC) (EN20), Water withdrawal (EN8), Water discharge (EN21), Waste disposal (EN22), Spill (EN23) and Occupational health and safety (LA7). Our assurance engagement excluded data and information of PTT’s operations and activities outside of Thailand and PTT’s suppliers and any third-parties mentioned in the Report. LRQA’s responsibility is only to PTT. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. PTT’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the Report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the Report is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of PTT. LRQA’s Opinion Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that PTT has not: x Met the requirements above x Disclosed reliable performance data and information for the eight specified indicators as no errors or omissions were detected x Covered all the issues that are important to the stakeholders and readers of this Report. The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the Verifier. Note: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites. LRQA’s Approach LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with LRQA’s verification procedure. The following tasks though were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement: x Assessing PTT’s approach to stakeholder engagement to confirm that issues raised by stakeholders were captured correctly. We did this through reviewing documents and associated records. x Reviewing PTT’s process for identifying and determining material issues to confirm that the right issues were included in their Report. We did this by benchmarking reports written by PTT and its peers to ensure that sector specific issues were included for comparability. We also tested the filters used in determining material issues to evaluate whether PTT makes informed business decisions that may create opportunities that contribute towards sustainable development. x Auditing PTT’s data management systems to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions or misstatements in the Report. We did this by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling procedures, instructions 7KLVGRFXPHQWLVVXEMHFWWRWKHSURYLVLRQRQSDJH and systems, including those for internal verification. We also spoke with those key people responsible for compiling the data and drafting the Report. x Reviewing supporting evidence made available for the eight specified indicators from a representative facility of each of PTT’s business operations at: their Head Office at 555 Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, Chatuchak, Bangkok, Thailand 10900 Oil Terminal in Saraburi Petroleum Exploration Support Base in Songkla, and the Gas Separation Plant in Rayong. x Checking that the Indexes allow stakeholders to access sustainability performance indicators for both the GRI G3.1 and the OGSS 3.1 final version. Observations Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are: x Stakeholder Inclusivity: We are not aware of any key stakeholder groups that have been excluded from PTT’s stakeholder engagement process. However, we believe that future Reports should further explain how PTT engages with its different stakeholder groups; for example – with independent contractors and local communities where PTT has its operation. x Materiality: We are not aware of any material issues concerning PTT’s sustainability performance that have been excluded from the Report. It should be noted that PTT has established extensive criteria for determining which aspects are material and that these criteria are not biased to the company’s management. We believe that future Reports should describe how different business operation units contribute to the extent of the material issues; for example – domestic waste from the Gas Separation Operation accounts only for a minor portion of the total waste generated, domestic waste from the Retails (nationwide) accounts for a significantly greater portion. This also allows PTT to describe in detail those issues material to one business operation unit that are not material to PTT as a whole. Likewise PTT should consider using accepted international practices to improve their disclosure of occupational health issues. x Responsiveness: PTT has processes for responding to various stakeholder groups with no material issue not being addressed in the Report. x Reliability: PTT uses a well-defined, centralized, system to collect and calculate its data and information associated with the selected specific standard disclosures listed above. PTT also carries out its own internal data verification process to ensure the quality of its reported data and information. LRQA’s competence and independence LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent. LRQA provides no consultancy but we have delivered a range of training services related to sustainability and data verification to PTT. The training services are the only work undertaken by LRQA for PTT and as such it does not compromise our independence or impartiality.
