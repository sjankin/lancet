We are convinced that forward-looking corporate policies, an environmentally-friendly attitude towards resources and confidence-inspiring relations with all our business partners and stakeholders are competitive advantages that make a crucial difference. We also consider the connection between our sustainability report and our integrated management system to be a plus. It means we can gather information that helps us to improve our management, information that we can also pass on to Dr Jürg Liechti interested parties. As in previous years, our report is in line with the guidelines CEO and President of the and criteria of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Governing Board international standard for drafting sustainability reports, third version. A further advantage of this procedure for us is that it provides a clear guideline for a company of our size on how to disclose important aspects in a clear manner. At the same time we are preparing for the future, as in May 2013 the GRI issued the new, fourth version of its guidelines. The systematic consideration of the ecological and social themes that are essential for a company has now been made a rule. As the stakeholders play an important role in this consideration, we will therefore do all we can to maintain and further intensify the dialogue based on mutual trust between ourselves and our stakeholders. In the previous year we continued to work on improving our services. We now offer reliable support to our customers for their own reporting, especially if they are already working with management systems. This report also sets a good example of how SMEs can play an active part in this field. This report is as well the Communication on Progress (COP) for the UN Global Compact which covers the period January 1st to December 31st 2013. I would like to address our stakeholders directly and to emphasize: I am pleased to confirm that Neosys reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and AntiCorruption. In this annual COP, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. I would like to thank all our employees for their excellent contributions and our customers for their trust in us during the previous year. I now invite you all to join us in reviewing once again all our activities and achievements in 2013. 4 Sustainability report Our company An overview of Neosys AG Competent – Personal – Sustainable We are a specialist sustainability consultancy and engineering practice with offices in Gerlafingen, Bern and Epalinges.

Developments – Impact – Opportunities For Neosys AG, 2013 was a year in which the market situation was really positive, but which was nevertheless a difficult one due to extraordinary internal difficulties. The CSR Business Unit – set on a successful course after a turnaround in the previous year – lost its joint Business Unit manager, Alex Kunze, in the summer. Although his departure was amicable and there was a smooth hand-over, the subsequent transitional phase until his successor Jörg Schmidt took up his post caused substantial pressure on the small Business Unit and had a negative effect on its results. The RisCare Business Unit was also under substantial 6 Sustainability report pressure during the year in question; the MODULO project was unprofitable for a long time, which caused high staff costs that could not be offset. These deficits in the results were partly, but not fully, compensated for by the Technology-Environment Business Unit which recorded an excellent year. Taken together with the Management Systems and Compliance and the Administration Business Units that were on budget, this resulted in results for the year that were still reasonable, but which did not fulfil the expectations placed on the 2013 business year. This was despite the fact that the budgeted growth in turnover was easily achieved. The results of the tax dispute with the Canton of Solothurn were received with a certain satisfaction. The court decision was fully in favour of Neosys and the reserves set aside in the previous year for disputed tax demands could be released, which further improved the results. In addition to the unexpected departure of Alex Kunze, 2013 saw two new appointments and a further cooperation agreement with a freelancer. This meant that the targeted continued growth of the company was again achieved, despite some “setbacks”. The opportunities for the future business activities of Neosys are very good, and it is now our task to make the most of them. This is due above all to the following developments: · The “energy transition” still offers the opportunity to continue and increase our energy consulting and energy management activities. In particular, the introduction of energy management systems in accordance with ISO 50001 has seen rapid developments, and we are in an incredibly good starting position here with our combination of management systems expertise and specialist knowledge. · The implementation of the new CO2 law and the associated CO2 ordinance has triggered substantial demand for CO2 auditing services in Switzerland. Our approval as validators – both for EHS monitoring concepts and for agreements on targets – ensures that we benefit from having the best prerequisites in place. In addition, the requirement for the fuel industry to provide compensation in this country has triggered strong demand for compensation projects, an area in which we are also active. · Legal compliance is on the way to becoming a global must for all companies that are traded on the stock exchange. Our “Legal Services” product, currently the leading one of its kind in Switzerland, is therefore of great significance for the further development of the company. With a corresponding increase in efficiency and by making the tools offered more attractive, we are in a position to make the most of this opportunity. During 2013 we built up our expertise, with external specialists from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, in the laws relating to human resources (employment law, social insurance law, illicit work, etc.) and are now in a position to offer this successfully on the market. · The CSR Business Unit is slowly beginning to benefit from increased awareness of sustainability issues. Interestingly, this is evidenced by a strong increase in the number of companies that wish to report in accordance with the GRI standard. Thanks to our new addition to the CSR team we will be able to translate this trend into consultancy assignments. · The TU and RC Business Units have a solid and attractive mix of products, which, however, are mainly aimed at industrial customers. The deindustrialisation of Switzerland is still progressing despite all assertions to the contrary by politicians. Every year customers are lost or take their industrial activities abroad, and this represents a 2013 7 significant risk to Neosys, a challenge which we aim to meet by offering new services, which can also be oriented to the needs of service providers or public institutions. The corporate risk analysis is heading in a very good direction; considerable investment was made in 2013 to develop it further. Chronicle of the year 2013 January 2013 Annual employee satisfaction survey undertaken by the Culture Group manager February 2013 As a result of the 2012 strategy, and in response to the employee survey, a team is put together to revise our website.

Due to information from the tax authorities that has obviously been incorrect, substantial reserves have to be set aside for taxes. The company management decides to bring a case before the fiscal tribunal. March 2013 A cooperation agreement is concluded with Berhard Bühler, who is available to work for us on a freelance basis in the areas of REACH and RoHS. 14 March 2013 The first specialist evening event on changes and amendments to the laws attracts a high number of participants and receives very good feedback.

November 2013 The plans to find a successor to our CFO Rolf Scheidegger, who is to take early retirement in 2014, are initiated. 27 Nov. 2013 Successful Neosys customer early-evening seminar in Zofingen on the subject of “Health and safety at work”. 28 Nov. 2013 Training of all project managers in leading workshops with an external trainer. December 2013 Antoinette Krügel begins as trainee for 6 months in the RisCare Business Unit. 13 Dec. 2013 Christmas dinner organised by the MSC Business Unit in Bern, preceded by a creativity workshop in the Paul Klee Museum. From the Neosys AG portfolio of services: The spatial planning risk analysis If the risks are too high there is a conflict of uses, which must then be discussed with all As urban settlements grow and spread into parties involved. former industrial areas, or if new residential developments arise along railway lines used to transport hazardous substances, the risks associated with long-established industrial uses increase, without the industrial occupiers being able to do anything about it – there may simply be more victims around them from long-known incidents. Illustration: No conflict of use here. Risk minimisation measures may be implemented by the risk owner, i.e. at the source, but they can now also be brought about by formulating requirements through the zoning plan or by taking technical measures against a spread of the risks. New guidelines from the Federal Government compel spatial planning Neosys AG – RisCare Business Unit authorities to take account of this situation, and when planning new residential zones to assess the risks that are presented by existing industrial uses. It is assumed that the new residential zone will hereby be used to the maximum permitted by the envisaged zoning regulations and the existing risks (e.g. a tank depot or a railway line used to transport hazardous substances) are recalculated in line with the new conditions. 2013 9 Economy The success of our company Current status and indicators The overview table shows the key indicator values. The net turnover (CM1) is practically at the level of the budgeted expectations. This shows that the market was in good shape and the growth of the company was on course. On the other hand, the company was not satisfactorily able to derive the budgeted profit from the turnover. The reason for this lies mainly in the excessive number of non-chargeable activities. This was partly caused by the transitional period and staff changes in the CSR department, and also by the development of the MODULO project in the RisCare Business Unit did not progress as planned, and required substantially more acquisitions than anticipated. Despite these factors the EBIT was CHF 163,000 (excluding the heating technology disregarded for results purposes). This is a little above the lowest acceptable values for yields, 5.0%. A positive contribution to this result was made by to the TechnologyEnvironment Business Unit, which had an extraordinarily good year, and the sound performance of the Management Systems and Compliance Business Unit, and this was mainly responsible for the growth in the reporting year. Staff productivity increased slightly in comparison with the previous year (1.44), but at 1.47 is still below the long-term reference value of 1.50. The reason for this lies in the aforementioned less favourable chargeability (non-chargeable developments and acquisitions). The operating profits are more or less at the same level as the EBIT value, in fact slightly higher. The reason for this lies in the release of the special reserves set aside for potential tax demands, made possible after the fiscal tribunal for the Canton of Solothurn fortunately decided in favour of Neosys in their tax dispute.

Although Neosys has everything required for state-of-the-art working, and although investments have always been written off at the maximum rates permitted, the material costs barely account for a fifth of costs. The remaining 80% are direct or indirect HR costs. This makes clear that the costs are dominated by staff costs and that the performance of the company depends on a good staff return, that 10 Sustainability report is, a high offsetable utilisation of the existing staff capacities. This phenomenon has improved further from 2012 to 2013. Breakdown of Cost 2013 Salaries Social Insurances Training Room cost Maintenance Insurance Travelling cost Administration + Office Marketing + Advertising Depreciations Assessment After a rather difficult year, the operating profits were substantially below expectations. The net turnover and staff productivity are still below the budget values and further efforts are needed to move them into a positive range. On the other hand there has been a pleasing growth in turnover, which has been well in line with the strategy plan. Measures · Greater accountability through increasing the efficiency of non-productive activities · No introduction of additional unproductive activities · Further pay scale adjustments where possible · Examination of the introduction of a new pension fund model with defined contributions (measure adopted from the previous year; still in the course of implementation) Our customers Current status and indicators Our customers are companies, authorities (departments and municipalities) and organisations (associations, international organisations, NGOs, etc.) in Switzerland and abroad. Our customer base has included a broad range of industries for many years. The 2013 11 trademark of Neosys is the provision of personal support and consulting services that are tailored to the clients and their requirements. This personal contact has provided us with direct feedback, which indicates satisfaction with our work and the services we offer. In addition, we systematically use a questionnaire to obtain information on customer satisfaction, to enable us to continually improve. The rate of return of customer questionnaires during the reporting period was 20% of those sent out (30 out of 147), which is a drop of 13% compared with the year 2012. 100% of these customers stated that they want to work with us again and/or will recommend Neosys AG to others. In the last year overall customer satisfaction increased once again – almost all assessments were given as “very good” or “good”. The lowest rating, but still predominantly good, was regarding the level to which we and our services fulfilled customer expectations. Customers rated our specialist and project management expertise especially highly. Since the introduction of the new customer survey method in 2011, the number of customer questionnaires sent out after the end of a project has fallen consistently, and this is something to be monitored. Customer satisfaction Average figures for the years 2011-2013 100% 90% 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% 2011 2012 2013 Expectations Project management Expertise In the reporting period we received no complaints from customers. This positive feedback is a pleasing and motivating factor for us.

This is pleasing and motivating for us – and is a great incentive to become even better. Measures · Further monitoring off the trend indicated by the customer survey · Monitoring of the return rate · Monthly assessment by the company management of the feedback from the questionnaire and any complaints · Use of the annual project manager continuous development training (measure fro from 2012) to improve the performance of the project managers in their dealings with customers (e.g. presentation techniques) Efficient and effective advice from analysis to implementation “The Neosys experts have provided us with competent competent support in bring bringing our environmental management system system, which is pioneering, but not adequately tely implemented in all respect respect, up to the state of the art, and to establish it in Schindler’s development locations worldwide. From gap analysis, through the division of the necenecessary work into eight manageable modules, to creative, practical solutions for the implementation of environmental management, we have worked together very well on a goal-oriented basis. Thanks to the excellent project management, the expertise and the dedication ication of the Neosys specialists, we have been able to complete this important project on schedule and within the budget, and have successfully maintained our ISO 14001 certification.” Urs Thumm, Environmental Manager at Schindler Elevator Ltd., Corporate R&D Suppliers Current status and indicators Supplier management is of secondary importance for Neosys as most of the value chain comes from the work of the employees and only very little is contributed by suppliers. For our basic operational needs, we have important suppliers in the areas of IT, mobility, offi office material and laboratory services. There were no negative incidents involving suppliers in 2013. Neosys has defined a code of conduct that includes the locally valid environmental, occupational safety afety and occupational legislation, as well as the ILO core conventions and the payment of social security contributions and taxes. Service partners and suppliers with a purchase volume in excess of CHF 1000 per annum have been informed of this code and 2013 13 asked to confirm their compliance by means of self-declaration. The rate of return was 60%, and an analysis is being carried out. For years Neosys AG has been purchasing Fair Trade coffee, recycled paper and 100% organic produce for the fruit provided for employees’ breaks. In addition, the IT products used are sourced from an electronics company that is a leader in the field of fair working conditions. The list of criteria according to our IMS manual that relate to the ecological and social aspects of the sustainable acquisition of products is applied. Unit of Actual Target Actual Target Indicator measurement 2013 2013 2012 2011 Suppliers/Service partners who have % 0 --45% 0% been reviewed Exclusion of suppliers Number 0 --1 0 Assessment The supplier management policy was implemented. The suppliers who have not responded have yet to be followed up. The many years’ cooperation with known, established partners is to continue. To date, no critical situations have arisen. Measures · Follow up suppliers who have not responded. · Examine whether project partners abroad are included in the assessment (of the social and environmental aspects). Innovation Current status and indicators In 2013 there were four innovation projects that were continued throughout the year. Two of these will soon be concluded in accordance with the milestones and progress. See figure on the following page. A number of product developments were accomplished on the job without initiating a development project. Unit of Actual Target Actual Target Indicator measurement 2013 2013 2012 2011 Innovation projects handled (as at end of the year) Number 4 ï 4 4 5 Working hours spent on innovation Hrs 274 --49.3 9.23 projects Assessment Innovation projects are taking place and the process is being used. Reviews are also being undertaken regularly on the occasion of the market meetings. The activity devoted to innovation projects was 274 hours in 2013, around five times higher than in the previous year. This is due above all to the relatively time-intensive activities in the “Laws” project. 14 Sustainability report However, a range of relevant innovations were not brought about as (non-chargeable) innovation projects, but directly as part of an ongoing assignment. Ultimately this is our aim wherever possible. It can also be that some innovation projects are neglected if the employees are already being used to capacity; in these cases the process quality should be improved further. Measures · Examine the innovation process, in particular the question of how work should be done on development projects, so that progress in the project can be achieved efficiently. Management system Current status and indicators Neosys AG has an integrated management system. The company's quality management has been ISO 9001-certified since 1994. The management system is expedient and is regularly developed further. Among other things, in the 2013 reporting period a corruption policy was developed (See “Business practices” section). Instruments of the continuous improvement process are: customer surveys, employee surveys, internal audits, team meetings and improvement reports. In 2011 an environment management system (ISO 14001-certified) and sustainability reporting (oriented towards GRI G3) closely linked to the management system were introduced. Assessment The integrated management system has proven itself for the running of the company. It is generally well-accepted and is run efficiently. Combining the management system and the sustainability report also opens up numerous synergies for obtaining information and disseminating it to stakeholders internally (including the management itself) and externally. In previous years the Neosys AG reporting was found to be good by several independent observers. In an evaluation of 158 SME reports from Germany, Austria and Switzerland as part of a Master’s thesis at the University of Munich in 2012, our first sustainability report for 2010 was the best report by a small Swiss company (< 50 employees). With its report for 2011, Neosys achieved a good 45th place (fourth-best SME report) in the 2012 FHNW rating for the best-integrated company reports (including those by major companies). Measures We also continue to investigate ongoing potential improvements to the IMS and seek to continue and improve the existing instruments. · Regular holding of training courses on administrative and content aspects of project management. · Revision of the GRI report in line with Version 4.0 of the GRI standard, anticipated in 2013. 2013 15 People and society Corporate management Current status and indicators The Board of Directors at Neosys AG consists of four people, of whom two are major shareholders and two are external parties. As an SME not listed on the stock exchange, it is our policy for the members of the Board of Directors to firstly be the major shareholders responsible and secondly selected external individuals who can support Neosys with their network of contacts. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is also the majority shareholder and the CEO. This constellation results from the management buyout in 2006 and is intended to help stabilise the company. It is reviewed at regular intervals. The company management consists of the heads of the four Business Units (one is also the CEO) and the Director of Finance and Administration. From a geographical perspective, the company is currently run from three offices in Switzerland, as well as via a number of freelancers in various regions of the world. The current strategy includes an appendix on the geographical orientation of the company’s activities. Neosys AG fundamentally believes it makes sense to provide its services globally. It does not, however, have a proactive strategy for expansion, but responds to opportunities for cooperation. The market meeting has an essential role as an important committee to discuss the company’s management and organisation. It regulates the issues relating to product design, marketing and the corporate image. It comprises all employees with project manager status (excluding freelancers). The strategy committee reviews the corporate strategy on an annual basis. It has a new composition every year, which is decided by the Board of Directors, and in which at least the Board of Directors and the company management are represented. This flexibility makes it possible to adapt the participants to the current situation and to the form of the strategic meeting according to the specific situation. Assessment The governance structure has proved itself to date, in that it has led to the continuous development of the company and its performance. Measures No measures are planned in the area of corporate management. Stakeholders Current status and indicators As a company we associate closely in our activities and services with numerous individuals and groups internally and externally. These include in particular our customers and our 16 Sustainability report employees, as well as many other stakeholders. As part of our strategy development, in 2010 we undertook an initial and general identification of our stakeholders; as a result of this initial assessment we see our important stakeholders as: · Customers, i.e. private industry, public sector, international organisations · Employees · Suppliers, i.e. suppliers in the value chain, service providers to Neosys (banks, insurance companies, ...) · Collaboration partners · Media · External market influencers · Local community (neighbours, associations, municipality, canton) · Competitors · Nature and ecosystems (i.e. the representatives of interested parties and their spokespersons) Assessment This list gives us an initial rough overview of the number and variety of our stakeholders. However this is not a sufficient basis on which to shape a systematic management of the stakeholders. The current developments in the reporting landscape are of significance in this context. Within the scope of the GRI G4 guidelines issued in 2013, which are to apply from 2016 as an international standard for sustainability reporting, a joint development, together with the stakeholders, of the ecological and social criteria on which an organisation should report will be required. It is therefore important for Neosys AG to know the relevant stakeholders as well as possible in order to be able to interact even more effectively with them and to derive mutual benefits from these interactions. Measures · In the course of 2014 we will carry out an in-depth analysis of our stakeholders. · A workshop will be held with our employees to discuss the essential topics to be reported on with this (particularly important) group of stakeholders. Business practices (incl. corruption) Current status and indicators In accordance with our corporate values we seek to ensure ethical conduct towards all our partners and stakeholders (see “Stakeholders” section). Because it is important to our credibility and identity, many aspects of ethical conduct have been applied implicitly to date. Thus, for example, complaints and criticisms from customers, neighbours, social groups, employees etc. are received and pursued by the management system manager. At home, i.e. in Switzerland, the risks connected with corruption are assessed as low. However, in the case of projects abroad we perceive an increased risk of potential corruption. During the reporting period there were two incidents2 in this context concerning third parties where we investigated in further detail whether there had been attempted corruption or an attempt to influence our neutrality. 2013 17 Unit of Actual Target Actual Target Indicator measurement 2013 2013 2012 2011 Employees who were given anti1 ï % of people 57% 50% 57% 60% corruption training Cases in which there was any 2 Number 1 --0 0 suspected corruption Complaints from stakeholders with regard to environmental or social Number 0 --0 0 aspects A clear corporate policy, including integration into the provisions of the employment contracts, specifications for the tender phase and order processing, was formulated and adopted as planned in 2013. This includes a description of the possible risk situations and the relevant preventive measures and procedures in cases of suspicion. Assessment The new company policy provides a practical framework with regard to corruption and attempted illegal influence by third parties which may affect us in the course of our activities. Employee training sessions concerning the new provisions will take place from 2014. Potential risk situations of this kind are dealt with at company management meetings and followed up on the basis of the above list. Measures · Provision of training on the new corporate policy, so that at least 75% of the workforce are trained in this (new target). · Alongside this, the list for recording and pursuing situations that involve the risk of corruption will be continued. 1 The new company policy on corruption was completed by the end of 2013. Within the reporting period, no further training sessions for employees had yet been provided. These will be held in early 2014. 2 In accordance with the definition of this GRI indicator, there was 1 relevant case. The second case was an attempt to apply outside pressure on a decision by a Neosys expert, which was not responded to. The listed case involved an express fee paid by a Neosys employee while completing a customs procedure. The subsequent Neosys investigations showed that the customs authority in question was legally entitled to demand such a fee, as the upstream authority of another country had made a processing error. 18 Sustainability report From the Neosys AG portfolio of services: Sustainable procurement for municipalities and SMEs There are ever-increasing numbers of media reports on products that contain substances hazardous to health, or that have been produced under problematic working conditions abroad. Criticism is often also levelled at Swiss companies or public bodies that use or sell products of this kind. This is one of the reasons why increasing numbers of companies and authorities are also examining their procurement from a social and ecological point of view. For some years we have been active in advising our customers in both the private and public spheres on environmentally-friendly and socially-acceptable, i.e. sustainable, procurement. In addition to projects for individual municipalities and cantons, we also act in a secretarial capacity for the Interest Group for Ecological Purchasing, Switzerland (IGEP: www.igoeb.ch). We were substantially involved in drafting the IGEP guidelines on sustainable procurement, and continued this work in the “Municipality Cluster” project. This provides municipalities, especially medium to small-sized ones, with specific instruments to help shape their procurement practices. Working closely together with certain municipalities we developed, among other things, a set of procurement guidelines, a stepby-step manual (with various checklists) and practically-applicable criteria for 12 product groups. This enables the municipalities to lead by example by improving their ecological and social practices. The product group criteria in particular may also be of interest to SMEs.

Neosys AG – CSR Business Unit 2013 19 Employees Current status and indicators As at 31.12.2013, Neosys AG has just under 17 full-time time equivalent posts (FTE) with employment contracts in accordance with Swiss law. As at the reporting date these posts are divided between 23 people. There are also non-time-limited non limited cooperation agreements with 6 further people (freelancers). rs).

Collaborators Groups of Age 3 The Project Manager category PL4 cannot be evaluated as it currently only include includes one person. 20 Sustainability report During 2013 one employee was on maternity leave. Over the last year, employee satisfaction has increased again to slightly above the target value of 7. Assessment Neosys offers all of its employees modern terms and conditions of employment with opportunities for specialist and personal development, a good level of operational freedom and high delegation of responsibility. The motivation of our employees is one of Neosys AG’s most important resources – it is closely connected to employee satisfaction. We therefore measure it and include this indicator as one of the aspects we continually seek to improve. The most important instrument in this regard is the evaluation of the suggestions that are made at the time of the annual employee survey. Recent examples of the implementation of suggestions include the redesign/expansion of the office premises in Gerlafingen, and the provision of information to employees about the company’s cost structure and basic calculation principles (in particular relating to salaries). As the possibilities open to the company here are limited, and certain requirements of individual employees vary, it is impossible to have a set of measures that fully satisfy everyone. The salaries of male and female employees are not completely equal, but compared with the average in Switzerland, they only differ moderately. However, the ratio of men to women among the project managers has moved increasingly in favour of women for the last two reporting years. An analysis was carried out, which shows that the calculated salary differences disappear if account is taken of length of service in the calculation. Over recent years the company has appointed some less-experienced women, which has had a negative downward effect on the salary equality indicator. We expect that the salary inequality will correct itself as soon as the female employees’ experience increases, the longer they remain with the company. The wage spread is low (< 3), which is typical for a Swiss SME. Measures · Intensive consideration of the responses from the employee survey. · In 2014 Neosys AG will consider the question of whether and under what circumstances male employees should be granted paternity leave. Sponsoring, charity activities, etc. Current status and indicators It is part of our philosophy to be active in local sponsoring and to be a member of industry and specialist organisations relevant for our company. The annual budget for local sponsoring was not fully used. On the other hand, employee contributions have increased again, as provided for in the budget. The reason for this is the company’s broad spectrum of activities and the increasing number of associations and organisations. Significant new memberships include swisscleantech and UN Global Compact. 2013 21 Actual Target Actual Actual Indicator Unit 2013 2013 2012 2011 Sponsoring, donations CHF 3,700 P 4,700 3,700 4,450 Member contributions CHF 17,322 ï 17,500 16,149 14,948 In addition to financial contributions, Neosys AG is also active in a number of bodies and events without any reimbursement of expenses (e.g. ISO National Committee, the Interest Group for Ecological Purchasing [IGÖB] Office, Swiss Association of Independent Safety and Security Engineers and Consultants [SSI], swisscleantech, etc.), which although they are advertising platforms also contribute to honing society's awareness of sustainability. Costs in this regard are not indicated separately. A number of our employees are active as volunteers for social issues (NGOs, politics, churches, professional associations, etc.). Neosys AG welcomes charitable and political activities by its employees. These are not supported financially or by granting work time off; however, any flexibility in working hours that this requires is granted. The employees who took part in our one-day company trip in the summer of 2013 provided practical work for an amphibian protection project. Assessment The costs posted are around 10% of profits and therefore are deemed sufficient and acceptable for a company of this size. Measures · Sponsoring to continue as provided by the budget Professional and personal development of our employees “To enable me to improve my knowledge of English, Neosys offered me the possibility of unpaid leave to go to southern England. The Torquay International School enabled me and the other students from all around the world to discover the “English Riviera”. From the impressive coastline of the county of Devon to cities such as Exeter, it was a great opportunity to gain an insight into English life. I returned with many wonderful memories, new acquaintances and an enriched English vocabulary.” Alex Winkler, Safety Engineer, Neosys Project Manager 2013 22 Environment Since April 2011 Neosys AG has operated a certified environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001. We have specified and pursued our environmental objectives for 2012 accordingly. Our company’s environmental impact was analysed for the first time in 2010 and has been updated regularly since then. Our legal compliance is also checked regularly. No failures to comply have been found. The main relevance of our activities is on two levels. In terms of our own environmental impact, the emphasis is above all on mobility, followed by the office infrastructure. The second way in which we influence the control of environmental impact is by means of the projects we carry out for our customers. Some of these indirect effects are considerable, but difficult to determine at reasonable expense. It is our task, however, to ask our customers the right questions and give them active support in increasing their contribution to the environment. We report on projects of this kind – with our customers’ consent – in specialist publications and in our customer magazine, Graffiti. Operations-related aspects Current status and indicators Our greenhouse gas balance for 2013 is around 31.3 tonnes of CO2 and has risen by approx. 15% compared with the last evaluation period (26.6 tonnes of CO2). The comparison of the three defined sources of emissions, “Heating”, “Car travel” and “Air travel”, shows that there was a reduction in emissions for air travel of 0.5 tonnes (-25%), as our employees made fewer journeys by air4. However there was an increase of approx. 2.2 tonnes of CO2 (+13%) for car travel, which arose due to increased numbers of business trips to visit customers by car. The most significant increase in CO2 was in respect of emissions for heating, which increased by approx. 3 tonnes (+24%). This is due to the weather conditions during the long winter of 2012/13, and also to a larger office floor area that needs to be heated, as we have taken on additional premises on the second floor. The CO2 emissions attributable to Neosys are compensated for by the purchase of certificates from the Myclimate foundation. This brings the Neosys AG “attributable” CO2 emissions to zero. 4 The air travel undertaken by Neosys for SQS is neutralised via climate tickets by SQS and not included in this statistic. 2013 23 CO2 record of Neosys AG for 2013 in tonnes of CO2 Air travel; 1.7 Heating; 12.4 Car travel; 17.2 The consumption of electricity for office operations and for rail travel is not calculated in the greenhouse gas footprint. This is in compliance with the method of calculation used by the FOEN which uses the Swiss production mix, i.e. zero, for the emission factor of the Swiss grid electricity.. The table of indicators below shows the further relevant values in comparison with the previous years. Unit of Actual Target Actual Actual Indicator measurement 2013 2013 2012 2011 CO2 emissions, actual t CO2 31.2 --26.6 61.6 CO2 emissions, compensated t CO2 100% ï 100% 0 0 CO2 emissions per capita t CO2/FTE 2.0 --1.8 3.8 Road kilometres km/FTE 5,808 --4,981 6,009 Modal split rail/car kmB/(kmA+kmB) 0.576 ï > 0.50 0.591 0.530 Air kilometres km/FTE 377 --417 8,718 Production of waste kg/FTE 59.0 --60.6 88.9 Power consumption kWh/FTE 1,219 --2,466 2,161 Proportion of green power kWhÖ/kWhtot 1.000 ï 100% 0.497 0.374 Paper consumption kg/FTE 40.0 --34.6 --Water consumption l/FTE 15.6 --14.7 --Assessment The CO2 emission and air travel trends are pleasing. However, they are strongly dependent on the current position regarding orders, and it is not possible, nor is it desirable, to preven prevent the real CO2 emissions from increasing again if activity abroad increases. On the other hand the objective of improving the rail/car mode split is a long-term long term one. In the reporting year we exceeded the target set of 50%. The electricity consumption per full-term f term equivalent post has not in fact dropped by 50%, as could be inferred from the statistics. A new way of invoicing by our electricity supplier showed clearly that the electricity consumption in the previous years was duplicated on the statements. statements This is means that the electricity consumption has actually remained constant. It is pleasing that the environmental objective of 100% use of electricity from green sources was achieved in the last reporting year. The environmental 24 Sustainability report objective of achieving a climate-neutral operation has been achieved by substantial real reductions and the purchase of compensatory certificates. The actual CO2 output per FTE in the workplace, at 1.96 t/FTE, has increased slightly (by +4%) compared with the previous year’s figure of 1.82 t/FTE. An analysis of the data showed that the difference is caused by the emissions from heating, i.e. as a result of the harsh winter of 2012/13. We continue to pursue the higher-level objective of becoming a “1-tonne of CO2” company. During the last year the measure of investigating/planning for in-house solar power production was decided upon. Enquiries were carried out accordingly, but no suitable solution has been found to date. Measures We have updated our environmental objectives as follows for 2014: · Maintain climate-neutral operation (attributable CO2 emissions = 0) by ensuring as high a proportion as possible of rail travel by offsetting the remaining emissions (e.g. purchasing emissions certificates or climate tickets) · Improve the transport mode split to a rail proportion > 60% · Paper savings > 10% compared with 2013 · Continue to investigate/plan for in-house solar power production · Publish the environmental objectives and ensure internal staff motivation. The corresponding measures consist of promoting rail travel and the electronic office, and continuing with CO2 compensation by means of reputable offset certificates. Product-related aspects Actual status, assessment, measures As a small consultancy company our direct, business-related environmental impact is quite low. Our aim and motivation is, however, to achieve positive environmental effects among our customers by means of the services and advice we provide in the area of sustainability. Services we offer that have a particularly strong leverage effect are: · Introduction of environmental and energy management systems · Legacy consulting and redevelopment · Environmental technology (waste air, noise, NIR, etc.) and CO2 projects · Waste management · Energy management However, other services we offer to our customers also have a contributory effect, for example by making structures and processes more efficient and helping companies to become more aware of their environmental impact. We have described some of these services and approaches throughout this report. 2013 25 It is, however, not possible to quantify the effects of these offers at reasonable expense with any degree of precision. It often depends on the individual case, and in the long term this effect is of course also dependent on the commitment of our customers. With regard to quality, our impact is all the greater the more and the bigger the mandates we have with highly environmentally relevant clients. This situation is certainly satisfactory today. Our aim to increase this impact further goes hand in hand with our growth activities. A new product we are planning to introduce to our range, which will further reinforce the indirect environmental relevance of our services, is the area of assessment of natural capital and the management of ecosystem services and biodiversity. 26 Sustainability report Neosys at a glance Actual Target Actual Actual FINANCE Unit of meas. 2013 2013 2012 2011 Net sales (CM1), only Bus kCHF 3,365 ï 3,006 2,754 2,823 HR costs, only Bus kCHF 2,029 P 1,976 1,906 1,929 EBIT kCHF 163 7 215 186 226 Operating result kCHF 166 7 204 113 222 Cash flow kCHF 164 7 261 170 253 EBIT return % 6.2% P 7.3% 6.8 8.0 Staff productivity 1.47 P 1.51 1.44 1.46 Actual Target Actual Actual QUALITY Unit of meas. 2013 2013 2012 2011 Complaints from customers Number 0 0 1 0 Customer satisfaction % 0.895 ï 0.85 0.88 0.89 Reviewed suppliers/service partners % 0 --45 0 Exclusion of suppliers Number 0 --1 0 Innovation projects Number 6 ï 4 4 5 Hours of work on innovation projects Hrs 274 --49.3 9.3 Actual Target Actual Actual EMPLOYEES Unit of meas. 2013 2013 2012 2011 Workforce FTE 31.12. 16.95 --15.85 15.2 Proportion of women among employees % FTE 35.7 --30.6 31.0 Proportion of women in the company % FTE 17.4 --15.4 15.4 management Prop. of women on the Governing Board % 0 --0 0 Wage spread 2.51 --2.72 2.74 Wage ratio w/m PL1 0.979 ï 1 1.056 1.093 Wage ratio w/m PL3 0.906 P 1 0.954 0.998 Wage ratio w/m PL4 n.a. 1 1.000 0.956 Fluctuation % FTE 3.6 ï <8 0 19.3 Occupational accidents/illnesses Nr of cases 0 ï 0 0 0 Overall satisfaction Scale 0-10 7.03 P >7 6.93 7.3 Time spent on further training Hrs/FTE 98.2 --67.9 88.2 Actual Target Actual Actual SOCIETY Unit of meas. 2013 2013 2012 2011 Empl who attended anti-corruption training % 57 ï 50 57 60 Cases of suspected corruption Number 2 --0 0 Complaints from stakeholders Number 0 --0 0 Sponsoring, donations CHF 3,700 P 4,700 3,700 4,450 Member contributions CHF 17,322 ï 17,500 16,149 14,948 Actual Target Actual Actual ENVIRONMENT Unit of meas. 2013 2013 2012 2011 Road kilometres km/FTE 5,808 --4,981 6,009 Modal split rail/car % 57.6 ï > 50 59.1 53.0 Air kilometres km/FTE 377 --417 8,718 CO2 emissions (excluding compensation) t CO2/FTE 1.963 --1.821 3.841 Production of waste kg/FTE 59.0 --60.6 88.9 Power consumption kWh/FTE 1,219 --2,615 2,161 Proportion of green power kWhÖ/kWhtot 1.000 ï 100% 0.497 0.374 Paper consumption kg/FTE 40.0 --34.6 2.3 Colour code: ï Good P Satisfactory 7 Poor Target value ð Monitor ð Measures 2013 27 Appendices Corporate profile 1 Name Neosys AG 2 Brands, products, Analysing, consulting, planning, calculating, measuring and drawing up expert services reports in the areas of environment, environmental technology, safety, risk management, social responsibility and management systems.

On the one hand it enables us to keep our various partners and stakeholders systematically and transparently informed about our own services and varied activities. On the other hand it also enables us to offer our customers a consultancy service in the area of reporting. We therefore also regard our sustainability report as an example of how sustainability reporting can be implemented in SMEs. In 2013 the new, fourth, version of the Global Reporting Initiative reporting guidelines (GRI G4) was issued. According to this, companies preparing reports in future should first determine the essential criteria with their stakeholders, and then report on them. It should therefore be decided jointly where the greatest levers can be applied to improve sustainability – as the reporting should also increase the awareness of the central themes within the company. Some larger companies have already completed the route to GRI G4 while others are still hesitating. It should, however, be assumed that GRI G4 will be adopted in the coming years by most major companies in Switzerland as the standard for their reporting, as is currently the case with the third version, GRI G3. From the beginning of 2016, reports drafted in accordance with GRI G3 will no longer be deemed to meet the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative – and will also no longer be assessed by means of a “Report Check”. Whether GRI G4 remains the right way for SMEs remains to be seen. GRI G3 still provides clear guidelines on which themes can be included in a report and how this should take place, and the additional expense for an SME of establishing a stakeholder management system, may be considered too high. For us at Neosys, GRI G3 currently has a major advantage as it enables us to pass on the information that we generate from our management system directly to our stakeholders. At the same time we are also on the right path and in the coming year will undertake a stakeholder analysis and use it to build up a systematic stakeholder management system. We will gladly pass on the experience hereby gained to our customers, as we are already doing by means of the connection between our established management systems and the reporting procedure. It is clear, however, that sustainability reporting represents a substantial opportunity for SMEs. Within the framework of GRI G4 major companies now have to consider their supply chains in greater depth and find out their suppliers’ attitudes to ecological and social issues. In so doing they will now turn their attention more frequently to SMEs. In this context alone it is certainly a good thing for SMEs to contemplate producing a sustainability report at an early stage.” Dr Jörg Schmidt, Neosys CSR Project Manager The present report covers the period from 1.1.2013 until 31.12.2013. It represents the fourth public sustainability report of Neosys AG and incorporates all departments and areas of activity of Neosys AG. The sustainability report is repeated on an annual basis and corresponds to application level C of version 3.1 of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2013 29 standard.
