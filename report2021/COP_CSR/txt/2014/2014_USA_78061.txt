Hudson’s values and its Code of Conduct are at the core of its policies and practices to promote respect for human rights. Hudson’s Values Our values represent the high standards we expect our people to uphold in every interaction with clients, candidates, colleagues and community partners. Living our values ensures that we deliver consistently high quality service and can be counted on to act with integrity and respect Hudson’s Core Values in all aspects of our business. • Integrity • Respect Following are some of the ways that we measure, reinforce our core values: • Collaboration Each year, the prestigious One Hudson Awards program honors employees • Empowerment who best exemplify our values and further our global strategy. Approximately • Responsibility 25 people globally (less than 1% of the company’s employee population) are selected for this exclusive recognition through a combination of peer nominations and regional awards programs. Hudson’s annual engagement survey measures areas aligned with our values to track progress and identify opportunities for improvement. The company’s global leadership training program promotes discussion about the values with top leaders around the world. All members or Hudson’s global leadership team must re-confirm annually their adherence to the company’s core operating values. In addition, for succession planning purposes, the company’s Board of Directors uses Hudson’s core values as key criteria in considering leaders for advancement. As part of the Personal Performance Agreement, a formal process for managing performance, each employee is required to identify at least one objective related to furthering Hudson’s global values. Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics As a provider of talent and human resources solutions in 19 countries worldwide, Hudson is committed to the protection of human rights among employees and consultants based on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. This comprehensive document describes conduct that is based on our core values, reinforces our policies and practices, and enforces legal and regulatory compliance. It outlines the company’s expectations of employees, officers and directors to ensure lawful and ethical behaviour. Every new employee must complete a mandatory Code of Conduct training program and provide signed confirmation that they have read the Code of Conduct, understand the content, and agree to comply with its principles. www.hudson.com Integrity Line Any violations of the Code of Conduct or concerns about human rights or other issues can be reported via the Integrity Line, a 24-hour, third-party help line where employees can confidentially share information about potential misconduct without fear of retaliation or reprisal. Corporate Social Responsibility Hudson is an active supporter of responsible business practices and community involvement as another sign of our commitment to human rights and respect for others. Hudson and its employees support their communities and causes that are important to them in a variety of ways. One example is our support of relief efforts when disaster strikes. The company has made corporate and employee match donations to the Red Cross in response to catastrophes such as Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013. Soon after the typhoon hit, employees in our Asia-Pacific region quickly organized a number fundraising efforts across Australia and New Zealand and in Singapore. Collectively, the region raised nearly US$4,000 for the Red Cross Society, which was matched with a donation from Hudson Corporate. Following are a few of the local/regional initiatives supported by Hudson employees in 2013: • Americas: A group of Chicago public school children started the new school year with brand-new backpacks filled with much-needed school supplies, generously donated by Hudson Chicago employees to the local Boys & Girls Club. The office has raised thousands of dollars for the organization over the past several years. • Europe: Employees in our London office are long-time supporters of the Great Ormond Street Hospital and have raised thousands of pounds in donations over the years. For example, during the hospital's Donations Make a Difference Week” last October, employees raised £1,830, besting the previous year’s effort by several hundred pounds. Thirteen employees spent a day collecting the donations from commuters at Liverpool Street Station. That collection was then augmented by individual employee contributions. • Asia-Pacific: Hudson employees are helping the next generation prepare for a career by hosting interviewing and CV-writing workshops for students participating in a Careers Day program sponsored by a client and a prominent Australian nonprofit organization dedicated to helping disadvantaged youth. www.hudson.com SUPPORT OF THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT’S 10 PRINCIPLES LABOR Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labor; and Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. As a talent solutions company, we demonstrate our commitment to supporting the UNGC labor principles by helping our 4,000 clients worldwide make fair and informed decisions about their people strategies and also adhere to all applicable laws governing labor and employment. These principles also apply to our own efforts to attract, develop and retain the right people. Diversity & Equal Opportunity As a global company, our employees, contractors, clients and suppliers come from diverse backgrounds and cultures. By valuing diversity and equal opportunity, we connect with the richest spectrum of experiences, skills, expertise and perspectives for all of the markets we serve. This philosophy is also reflected in our own recruiting process – we recognize that a diverse workforce fosters creativity, innovation and better business practices. Our commitment to diversity is reflected in our Diversity Mission Statement: Valuing the differences among our employees allows us to better serve the needs of clients worldwide. We actively recruit candidates from many different perspectives and backgrounds, and promote a culture that allows all employees to contribute to their fullest potential. Hudson’s policies, procedures and corporate values ensure compliance with all legislation and regulations relating to recruitment and employment, these include Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), Anti-Discrimination, Occupational Health and Safety and Privacy.

All of our business activities are required to be conducted without discrimination based on race, color, genetics, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, disability or age. Commitment to a Harassment-free Work Environment Hudson has zero tolerance for harassment, including sexual harassment, by any employee or consultant. We are committed to a professional work environment that is free from all forms of conduct that could be considered harassing. We have strong policies in place, including our Code of Conduct and Anti-harassment policy. Every new employee is expected to complete our anti-harassment training program and sign a printed copy of the policy to acknowledge they have received and reviewed the policy. www.hudson.com The Integrity Line, which is promoted in every Hudson office and has online and global toll-free dialing capabilities, provides employees with a confidential outlet to report any harassment or concerns without fear of retaliation. Employee Development and Feedback Developing and listening to our people is part of our emphasis on making Hudson a fair and engaging place to work. In 2013: The Hudson Learning Solutions group launched a global online Learning Management System, which combines information previously stored on three regional online systems. The new global system promotes greater consistency and even more participation in self-paced online learning opportunities. Examples of training offered to employees in 2013 include the following. o The Skillsoft Leadership Advantage Solution provides just-in-time development resources for topics across eight core leadership competency clusters. All leaders at Hudson (at all levels) have access to this solution for self-paced learning. o The global LinkedIn training program initiated in 2012 continued into 2013. LinkedIn is a critical tool in the candidate search function of our business. o Training was held for all Hudson recruiters/consultants companywide on the subject of search engine optimization (SEO) and the importance of developing SEO-friendly job adverts, which is crucial to our attracting increased traffic to our jobs pages and website. The Personal Performance Agreement (PPA) is a formal employee process for setting goals, planning development opportunities and managing performance. Hudson enhanced the year-end portion of the process in 2013 to allow managers to give overall end-of-year ratings to their direct reports to provide them with greater clarity about their performance. 82% of employees globally participated in our annual employee engagement survey, administered by Aon-Hewitt, to share their feedback about Hudson as a place to work. The feedback is being reviewed on the regional and local levels, and teams of managers and employees throughout the company are developing and implementing action plans addressing key drivers for improvement that the survey identified. www.hudson.com SUPPORT OF THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT’S 10 PRINCIPLES ENVIRONMENT Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Hudson is committed to reducing as much office waste as possible. Recycling efforts are encouraged throughout the company to help reduce our collective carbon footprint. Following are some of the initiatives to reduce waste and promote energy efficiency that are consistent across locations and practices: IT disposal for redundant electrical equipment is conducted by a WEEE/EPA-regulated company to ensure that the highest percentage of our corporate IT waste is re-used or recycled. All hardware, including PCs and laptops, have automated sleep mode when not in use. We partner with building management, local service contractors and our own staff to promote recycling, reuse or reduction of office materials and install energy-efficient lighting and heating/cooling systems. Videoconferencing capabilities installed in 2012 in most of our larger offices continues to help reduce the need for business travel. Local/Regional Environmental Efforts Most of Hudson’s environmental efforts are driven at the regional or individual office level, spearheaded by committed local teams. Hudson’s UK & Ireland operation has continued making progress on its long-standing goal of reducing carbon emissions in all Hudson UK&I offices. The team produces a quarterly report on progress and tracks carbon emissions for Hudson’s head office in London, which is also the company’s largest office in Europe. From the third quarter of 2012 to 2013, Hudson London has increased it recycling rate from 58% to 73%. Other continuing initiatives in the UK&I include adopting more energy-efficient hardware, choosing more environmentally-friendly office products and encouraging public transportation and videoconferencing among employees to reduce travel. However, the biggest and most impactful initiative has been the introduction, internal awareness, promotion and support by employees of the company-wide recycling facilities. This, coupled with employees’ commitment to working in a paperless environment through initiatives such as double-sided printing, has had a positive contribution to reducing the company’s footprint. In 2013, the Americas region instituted an electronic on-boarding system enabling it to eliminate the current paper-intensive process of hiring consultant employees. The new system will eventually be expanded to the onboarding of all Americas employees. Significant savings in paper and ink consumption are expected over time. www.hudson.com SUPPORT OF THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT’S 10 PRINCIPLES ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Our value system emphasizes integrity and trust at all levels of the organization. To ensure our company is managed with integrity and in our stakeholders best interests, we have put in place policies and practices that maintain high ethical standards of conduct and comply fully with applicable laws and governmental regulations. Hudson’s Corporate Governance practices, framework and safeguards are posted to its Web site and include: Charters of the Board Committees Code of Ethics for CEO and Senior Officers Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Corporate Governance Guidelines Our Global Code of Business Conduct and Ethics gives clear guidelines for the company’s expectations of employees, officers and directors to ensure lawful and ethical behavior.

This work is supplemented with a comprehensive global program of internal audits with regular visits to company operating locations to assess internal control design and operating effectiveness.
