As Edinburgh International celebrates its 10 year anniversary, the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-corruption are still very much at the forefront of our business. When the Company was established in 2003, we set out to build enduring business relationships based on trust, transparency and exceptional levels of service. This has not changed. The Global Compact and its ten principles are of huge significance to Edinburgh International and in the way that it conducts its business. Working in environments where there is often fragile governance and security, our Company operates as a force for good. This annual Communication on Progress provides a medium for Edinburgh International to express to its Staff, stakeholders (both internal and external) and clients that it is a responsible and ethical company. Edinburgh International has been running a Public Service Programme in Iraq since July 2013, supporting the basic principles and tenets of good Labour practices. This programme was designed to increase the earning power of the local population and also to provide more opportunities within their communities. The success of the programme has been officially recognized with a note of appreciation from the Joint Coordination Centre and the Oil and Gas Committee in the province of Basra. In the area of Public Policy, one of Edinburgh International’s Directors has been working on a subcommittee of the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers helping to draft sensible metrics which can be fairly applied and objectively monitored across the security services sector. Edinburgh International was one of the initial signatories of the Articles of Association of the ICoC. This organization aims to raise and maintain standards within the security industry, particularly in the area of human rights. The Global Compact standards are highly valued by Edinburgh International. The Company, by electing to align with the Global Compact’s initiative and principles, has focused its attention to what is truly important in the way that it conducts its business and how it interacts with its employees and those communities in which it operates. Frank Philip MBE Managing Director Edinburgh International Communication on Progress 3 Human Rights ©Edinburgh International 2014 Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and, Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. ASSESSMENT Edinburgh International (EI) often works in fragile and weakly governed states; therefore, EI puts human rights at the forefront of what it does. Human rights training is one of the first pieces of training that all Staff undertake upon joining the Company, irrespective of which department they are part of and whether they are working operationally or in our Dubai or London offices. This is conducted so that all Staff understand EI’s stance on human rights and also what is expected of them in the conduct of their work. Figure 1 EI Staff conducting training EI’s overarching Policy is our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (The Code), which states: “All projects start with the foundation that respect for, and the protection of, human rights is a core principle of security provision in any society with which we interact. This includes the sometimes fragile states in which Edinburgh International operates and requires strict compliance with laws and regulations. Edinburgh International adheres to the following legislation and codes drawn up by sovereign governments and international agencies: • Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 • UK Human Rights Act 1998 • United Nations International Mine Action Standards, 2001 • Geneva Conventions of 1949 • Chemical Weapons Convention • Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment • United Nations Security Council Sanctions Communication on Progress 4 Human Rights ©Edinburgh International 2014 Edinburgh International also believes that it has obligations and commitments that extend beyond its statutory obligations to comply with legislation. Edinburgh International will be a force for good wherever it operates, so to that end, Edinburgh International voluntarily and actively supports the following codes of practice: • International Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers • UN Global Compact • Montreux Document • Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, 2000 • Code of Conduct of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, 1995” All Staff, contractors, subcontractors and business partners, are required to conform to the Code. Where possible, EI employs host country nationals, and therefore, the Code has been translated and is provided to all Staff in their native language. Continuous training and monitoring is conducted to ensure compliance and understanding of the Code. This training is recorded on the Company’s online Training and Knowledge System (TraKS). IMPLEMENTATION ETHICS HOTLINE EI has an anonymous telephone Ethics Hotline that is an automated voicemail system used for Staff and third parties (including clients) to report any suspected human rights violations from either EI Staff or its contractors of any violations that they may have witnessed in the course of their work. EI also continues to utilise its Ethics Hotline email address to good effect. HUMAN RIGHTS TRAINING EI conducts annual training in the areas of human rights by ensuring its Staff are familiar with and understand the Code and Rules for the Use of Force. In order to instil the significance of human rights training, the Company offers courses online, in classrooms and also through practical lessons given at the place of deployment. The training and guidance is provided in several languages in order to accommodate for all Staff requirements across all of our operational areas. TRAKS EI records and monitors all its training, including human rights, via its unique Training and Knowledge System (TraKS). This is a market-leading system that enables all training, including human rights and anti-bribery, to be conducted in line with EI’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. Communication on Progress 5 Human Rights ©Edinburgh International 2014 Every member of EI Staff is on TraKS and it shows all the training which they have undertaken, as well as when and who conducted the training. TraKS also provides an audit feature that allows managers to see what training has been done in all of EI’s programmes and projects around the world, and what has not. In this way, for example, a director in London can investigate what percentage of the personnel within a project in Iraq have conducted training in human rights, when they passed and when they are due for a Figure 2 Image from a TraKS audit for an Ethics lesson refresher course. This also allows for audit and due diligence to be conducted both by EI and our clients. TraKS was implemented at the tail end of 2011 across offices in London and Dubai. It was subsequently implemented in the operational areas of Afghanistan in 2012 and Iraq in 2013. MINIMUM WAGE EI remains committed to paying its Staff above the minimum wage in each country within which it operates, whilst also ensuring that it conducts its business in a responsible manner. EI always pays substantially above the minimum wage but ensures that it is in line with other relevant government industries, e.g. the local police force, so as not to undermine their recruitment effort and/or create a false economy. PUBLIC POLICY PARTICIPATION A key initiative which EI has continued to be involved in is the International Code of Conduct (ICoC), which is a Swiss/UK/US Government and civil society backed initiative. This organization was created to ensure that agreed upon standards in the private security industry could be measured and maintained. EI was an initial signatory in 2010 and, in February 2012, participated in a drafting conference for an oversight mechanism. As a Founding Member of the Association and long-time contributor to the ICOC process, EI attended the Launching Conference in September 2013 of the International Code of Conduct Association. This reiterated the Company’s commitment to the very Figure 3 Director Richard Phillips in Montreux, Switzerland in September 2013 Communication on Progress 6 Human Rights ©Edinburgh International 2014 highest standards of service delivery within the industry. Throughout 2013, EI also continued to support and participate in various public policy developments. EI continued its participation in the Security in Complex Environment Group (SCEG), which is the UK’s Government backed partner for the security industry, through attendance at quarterly meetings and engagement in policy decisions. The Company has also regularly attended the Standards and Accreditation (SAG) Working Group, which has aimed to raise standards within the industry through agreement upon and implementation of the series ASIS Private Security Company Standards and ISOs.

Communication on Progress 8 Labour ©Edinburgh International 2014 Labour Principle 3: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. ASSESSMENT EI operates in countries that do not have the same enforceable measures in place as the UK or other European countries. EI has highlighted the potential labour dangers that it faces whilst operating in Afghanistan, Tanzania, Nigeria and Iraq. Therefore, EI implements policies to ensure that it applies UK and US standards and values. This ensures that it treats its Staff and the local population with the highest regard for human rights and labour standards. EI initiated a quality, health, safety and environment (QHSE) enhancement programme in 2013 and is currently addressing and improving the standards across the Company. A key output for this programme is that the environments in which EI’s Staff operate are improved and fundamentally safer. The Company aim by the end of 2014 is to achieve the standard of OHSAS 18001 in Health and Safety Management. EI’s overarching Policy is our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (Code), which states: “Edinburgh International Staff will respect the human rights of all persons they come into contact with, including, the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly and against arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy or deprivation of property… Staff are expected to treat their peers, superiors, or subordinates, as well as clients, suppliers and others with whom Edinburgh International does business, with respect and to not engage in abusive, disrespectful, violent or insubordinate behaviour.” Communication on Progress 9 Labour ©Edinburgh International 2014 IMPLEMENTATION DUE DILIGENCE EI’s Human Resources department has a rigorous and comprehensive due diligence and vetting system that has been successful for some time. All Staff that work for EI go through this procedure and this ensures that EI recruit Staff that are not complicit in human rights abuses. The process includes criminal record and background checks for all employees and additional local and governmental authority checks when employing host country nationals in Afghanistan and Iraq. As part of this screening, all ages of Staff are corroborated so as not to employ anyone under the age of 18 to carry out security service work and therefore ensuring that no child labour is used. LOCALLY HIRED STAFF As the Company’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct states, EI “will be a force for good wherever it operates”. Measures taken by EI to accomplish this include recruiting and training locally wherever it operates and providing Staff with contracts in their own language. EI recruits Staff from abroad only when it is absolutely necessary due to contractual requirements. The Company also has its policies and procedures available to its Staff in their native language. Furthermore, EI invests its own time and money, to train its local work force for promotion to managerial positions. LOCAL COMMUNITY WORK Since July 2013, Edinburgh International has been running a hugely successful public service programme helping the local community in Basra, Iraq to improve their earning power. From flower arrangers to taxi drivers, over 65 local citizens in pursuit of better salary and better working conditions, have enjoyed a free week of pre-employment training designed to facilitate their entry into the growing security industry surrounding the southern oil fields. Training courses last between 4 and 7 days and Figure 4 The Training Programme in action take place at EI’s permanent and fully equipped training facility at Rumaila. Communication on Progress 10 Labour ©Edinburgh International 2014 Courses are offered at 2 levels: candidates with no previous security experience can enrol on a preemployment guarding course whilst those with previous industry experience can take the more advanced mobile security course covering mobile security techniques and defensive driving skills. Khalid Jawad, 47, from Basra, attended the EI Guard Course. Working as a delivery driver for most of his adult life, his pay was poor and he wanted a career change. Attracted by the better salary, better working conditions, better training and EI’s reputation for respecting the community’s cultures and traditions, Khalid signed up for the free training hoping to obtain employment afterwards. Happily, he passed the course and is now employed by EI as a guard on the Rumaila Oilfield.

Communication on Progress 11 Environment ©Edinburgh International 2014 Environment Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: Encourage the development and effective diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. ASSESSMENT Edinburgh International is fully committed to protecting the environment from the effects of its business. The Company aims to be a responsible steward of the environment by continually improving its performance through reductions in pollution and waste. A product of this is the attainment of ISO 14001 in Environmental Management, which the Company is striving to achieve in 2014 via its QHSE Programme. By means of this standard, EI can demonstrate that it is at an internationally recognised level, improve the environment in which it works and promote greater environmental responsibility. The following is an extract from EI’s Environmental Policy: “Edinburgh International recognises and accepts its responsibility to minimise, wherever possible, its impact on the environment and to comply with all statutory environmental requirements…It will seek to purchase from local or regional suppliers which will maximise Edinburgh International's input to the local community and minimise transport and carbon footprint.” IMPLEMENTATION VEHICLE FLEET Following an environmental impact assessment that was conducted in 2010 for the large vehicle fleet which EI operates, the decision was made to replace the entire fleet of petrol fuelled vehicles with diesel vehicles. It was estimated that this would reduce carbon emissions by an average of 21% per vehicle. Furthermore, from a safety point of view when operating on oilfields, diesel vehicles are deemed to be safer than petrol vehicles. Thus far, the fleet replacement has been going well, with Communication on Progress 12 Environment ©Edinburgh International 2014 initial target replacements exceeded. EI will continue to strive to achieve the ultimate target of total fleet replacement. EI, where possible, sources all vehicles locally either through hiring or purchasing them outright. Our vehicle fleet in Afghanistan represents 30% of the EI fleet. The vast majority of these vehicles are hired locally, thereby supporting the local economy.

ASSESSMENT By virtue of the locations that EI works in, the potential exposure to bribery that Staff face is assessed to be high. To counter these potential bribery and corruption threats, EI has a strict Anti-Bribery Policy in place. This policy is driven by the British Bribery Act 2010 and the American Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and governs all EI Staff. The Anti-Bribery Policy helps guide and focus EI’s attention on the business areas and personnel that are deemed to be most at risk to corruption. Additional training and validation is then conducted annually using EI’s Anti-Bribery Workshops. The following extract has been taken from EI’s Anti-Bribery Policy concerning EI’s commitment to training and educating its Staff. “Staff training and the sharing of best practice will take place in Anti-Bribery Workshops. The training will be organised by the manager convening the workshop and will be tailored specific to their business operations covering likely problems that they may encounter. All training which is conducted is to be recorded on TraKS.” IMPLEMENTATION ALL STAFF EI’s Anti-Bribery Policy applies to all Staff, contractors, sub-contractors and any organisation that the Company does business with. This Policy is required to be read and understood by all Staff upon joining the Company and again on an annual basis. This measure was implemented in 2011 and has had great success as a medium to deliver EI’s approach to anti-bribery. In order to ensure that all Staff have a full knowledge and understanding of the Policy, annual anti-bribery workshops are conducted by senior managers and General Counsel. This training is given at differing levels dependent on the role of the individual and the type of exposure to the risk of bribery. As with human rights training, TraKS is the platform for promulgating all material for anti-bribery training. All training is also recorded on TraKS. Communication on Progress 15 Anti-Corruption ©Edinburgh International 2014 COMPANY AREAS DEEMED AT RISK The Company areas judged to be at greater risk due to the environments in which they operate are; Sales, Financial and Operations Departments. These areas receive additional training. This measure was put into practise in 2011 and since then, there has been a wide spectrum of anti-bribery policy training and workshops which have taken place. All of this training has been captured on TraKS and can be reviewed and audited as required. 2013 saw additional training take place, in line with the US Government’s Foreign and Corrupt Practises Act, led by the Company’s legal team. This training covered off the Sales, Financial and in-country Operational Programme Managers. At the time of writing, there is a review taking place that will streamline the Company’s anti-bribery lessons, thus making it easier for our Staff to understand the nuances of and recent changes to the FCPA and the Bribery Act. INCIDENTS OF BRIBERY EI’s Ethics Hotline and email address are the conduits in place for anonymous reporting for Staff and third parties to use to report suspected bribery and corruption concerns. In 2013, EI received no complaints for bribery or corruption. AUDITING OF FINANCIAL BOOKS EI’s financial books are externally audited by Ernst and Young on an annual basis. To date no financial irregularities have been identified during these audits.
