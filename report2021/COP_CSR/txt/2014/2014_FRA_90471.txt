As a leader, it has always cared about upholding a high level of commitment to our employees, our guests, our partners and to our host communities where we live and work in more than 90 countries. This is our duty as a good corporate citizen. It’s not enough to create value, you also have to share it. Today, our corporate social responsibility process is being led by our PLANET 21 sustainable development program, which is unlike any other in the hospitality industry and which has set us ﬁrmly on the path to continuous improvement. It is being organically extended by the implementation of community outreach projects to support the disadvantaged. Inspired by these beliefs, Accor will continue to reinvent itself, retain its guests and employees and drive its sustainable growth for the beneﬁt of all its stakeholders.” Sébastien Bazin, Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 2.1.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND BUSINESS CHALLENGES FOR ACCOR For businesses in general and multinationals in particular, the These challenges can be broken down into three categories, rules of the game have changed signiﬁcantly over the past few depending on whether they concern the Group worldwide, the years.

Its business etc.), social issues (combating sexual tourism involving children, challenges include optimizing capital expenditure according to each ensuring local integration, promoting a balanced diet, supporting the asset’s energy proﬁle and integrating environmental criteria into the models used to value the Group’s asset portfolio. Differentiated deployment of the CSR process depending on each hotel’s operating structure Just like data reporting system, the method used for deploying Accor’s CSR commitments, policies and programs across the asset portfolio depends on whether the hotels are owned, leased, managed or franchised.  Accor’s CSR commitments cover all of the hotels by default, regardless of their operating structure.  Accor’s Sustainable development policies (especially the PLANET 21 program) cover all of the owned, leased and managed hotels by default. For franchised hotels, if the program is included in the franchise agreement, the hotel is required to deploy it. If not, Accor recommends the deployment to the owner, who makes the ﬁnal decision.  As a listed company headquartered in France, Accor has a legal obligation to disclose employee, social and environmental information for all of the entities in its scope of consolidation, which corresponds to owned and leased hotels. The Group also endeavors to include as many Accor-brand hotels as possible in its CSR communications, by inviting the owners of franchised hotels to participate also in the reporting process. Registration Document 2013 25 2 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Stakeholder relations 2.2. STAKEHOLDER RELATIONS Accor’s corporate social responsibility process is supported by ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders, including customers, employees, business partners, local development stakeholders and public authorities. Stakeholder dialogue plays a critical role in business operations, whether by showcasing Accor’s capacity for innovation, enhancing its appeal among customers, investors and employees, creating opportunities to open hotels in regions with high growth potential or protecting the Group’s reputation. Dialogue takes place at every level of the organization, from the hotels themselves, which strive to foster close ties with local stakeholders, to country managers, who represent Accor in front of national authorities and investors, and corporate headquarters teams, which serve as the primary interface for various international organizations. Accor ﬁrmly believes that, through these stakeholder relations, it is helping to create value shared by everyone. 2.2.1. A FRAMEWORK FOR STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE In 2013, a major project was undertaken to clarify the stakeholder dialogue process. The various departments in contact with internal and external stakeholders, both at headquarters and in the ﬁeld, worked together to:  map the stakeholders at different levels of the organization;  identify the methods of engagements used with each of the stakeholders (information/communication, consultation/dialogue, partnership, etc.);  prioritize corporate social responsibility issues in accordance with their relative importance to stakeholders and their criticality to operations. These discussions led to the preparation of a document outlining the responsibilities and core components of the stakeholder dialogue process. In addition, the Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility Charter was updated in 2013 to include Accor’s stakeholder dialogue commitments and to ensure that each of the stakeholder priorities identiﬁed during the project is addressed by a corporate social responsibility commitment. 26 Registration Document 2013 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Stakeholder relations 2 2.2.2. OVERVIEW OF STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE AND THE ASSOCIATED CHALLENGES Map of Accor’s stakeholders and the associated challenges Accor is actively committed to nurturing constructive dialogue and open communication with all of its stakeholders, both within the Company and in the community.

Registration Document 2013 33 2 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Corporate social responsibility process and commitments Commitments in the area of business ethics and bribery The Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility Charter has a section dedicated to our commitments and responsibilities in relation to business practices, which cover three main categories:  respect for people: the rejection of discrimination and the promotion of cultural diversity; vigilance in and rejection of forced labor, child labor and illicit activities; and vigilance in the area of prostitution, especially in relation to protecting children;  business ethics: compliance with competition law; the ﬁght against bribery, corruption, money laundering and complicity in money laundering; and lobbying ethics;  the protection of goods and information: prevention of insider trading; conﬂicts of interest; fraud; and the protection of personal data. Particular attention is paid to bribery, an issue that is addressed via two additional measures:  bribery of a public ofﬁcial: Illegal in many of our host countries, this practice consists of promising or giving a civil servant or elected ofﬁcial an inducement to act or fail to act in violation of his or her ofﬁcial duties. Accor pledges that no commission will be paid directly or indirectly to any elected or appointed public ofﬁcial with regard to the company’s contracts or its relations with government agencies;  bribery in the private sector: Considered a criminal offense in many of our host countries, this practice consists of promising or giving a private individual an inducement to act or fail to act in violation of his or her professional obligations (“active bribery”) or soliciting or accepting an inducement to act or fail to act in violation of one’s own professional obligations (“passive bribery”). Since 2005, acts of bribery committed in any country by Accor or one of its subsidiaries may be prosecuted under French law. Accor pledges to take all reasonable measures to avoid the use of bribes with regard to both its purchasing and sales procedures. To help employees put these fundamental principles into practice, the Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility Charter gives real-world examples of situations they could encounter and describes the right way to handle them. Given the large number of countries in which we operate, constant attention is paid to the risk of bribery. In addition to being addressed in the Charter, it has also been included in the risk map prepared by the Risk Management Department (see page 138) and is targeted by a detailed tracking process. Every hotel manager and senior executive promotes the values and commitments expressed in the Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility Charter and ensures that they are put into practice by employees. If employees have a question about a speciﬁc situation, they can speak to their manager or contact the Human Resources or Legal Affairs Department in their country. No incidents of bribery were reported to the authorities by Accor in 2013. 34 Registration Document 2013 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Corporate social responsibility process and commitments 2 2.3.2.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS Accor’s environmental strategy is supported by cross-functional programs, such as the environmental management processes used in the hotels and for our products and services, or the training and awareness building campaigns deployed for our guests and employees. It is designed to effectively address our main environmental challenges in four primary areas: water, energy, attenuation of local impacts and waste management. 2.7.1.

Other facilities have also undertaken individual ISO 14001 certiﬁcation commitments and by end-2013, seven of them – six Thalassa Sea Two improvement drivers & Spa hotels and one Académie Accor France site – had earned certiﬁcation. Charter 21 Accor has been involved in the ISO 14001 certiﬁcation program for Charter 21 is helping the hotels to deploy the PLANET 21 program ten years, steadily optimizing the related procedures and resources by providing an action framework for their sustainable development to guarantee its effectiveness. Its sustainability is secured by the process and by enabling them to improve and track their performance training and buy-in of every employee, in compliance with ISO 14001 over time (see page 42). standards, and by the ISO 14001 continuous improvement process. Lastly, outside audits are regularly performed by a certified, ISO 14001 environmental management certiﬁcation independent organization. As part of the PLANET 21 program, Accor is committed to earning ISO The main areas covered by the ISO 14001 process are as follows: 14001 certiﬁcation for 40% of the hotel base by 2015, regardless of training, compliance, water/energy use, waste, chemicals and cleaning operating structure.

To continue deploying certiﬁcation, the ISO 14001 in ACTion environmental management system (EMS) was ﬁnalized in 2013. It enables hotels to diligently apply our environmental strategy and to guarantee that our objectives will be met, while complying with ISO 14001 standards. Deployment will also be facilitated by an e-learning module that provides step-by-step support for hotels in implementing the ISO 14001 EMS.

WATER Because water is very unevenly distributed across the planet, Accor is aware of that the challenge of managing water use and the ability to access it varies widely from one region to another, addressing the lack of supply is even more critical in these regions. making it a source of political and social tension, and therefore It has conducted a study to assess the risks related to water a major challenge for humanity. Accor uses a great deal of water and availability of supply in its host regions. in its hotels, which are sometimes located in water-stressed regions. We are therefore assertively managing our water The following charts are based on data from all of our hotels, after consumption around the world. Close attention is also being inputting their exact location into the World Resources Institute’s paid to efﬂuent discharge, so as to preserve downstream aquatic Aqueduct risk mapping tool, which is one of the world’s two most systems and maintain water quality for future use. widely recognized applications for mapping water-related risks (the other is the World Wildlife Fund’s Water Risk Filter). This exercise measured and ranked the ability of Accor hotels Water use to access adequate quantities of good-quality water. Water use management program Percentage of hotels located in water-stressed The 2011 environmental footprint study showed that each hotel regions uses an average 15,000 cubic meters of water a year, for guest use, housekeeping, foodservices, laundry, swimming pools, grounds 6.6% 0.5% watering etc. In all, this represents 11% of Accor’s water footprint. 22% The study also revealed that the bulk of this footprint comes from 12.7% upstream farming operations, which account for 86%. In response to this major concern, Accor is committed as part of the PLANET 21 program to reducing water use per guest in the owned, leased and managed hotels by 15% over the 2011-2015 period. 13.2% In addition, Accor is supported by a variety of programs to help conserve water in upstream farming operations, either by issuing procurement guidelines or, more particularly, through the Plant for the Planet program (see page 78). 31.5% 13.6% Management of water-stressed regions UN-Habitat deﬁnes water stress as the inadequate supply of • Low water stress (<10%) water of satisfactory quality to meet the needs of people and • Low to medium water stress (10-20%) the environment.

On the other hand, 26% are located in high or extremely high water-stressed regions, of which 13% in the extremely high To track the hotels’ intrinsic performance, the water use indicator category. Most of these regions are found in China (around 70 is liters used per guest, i.e. per room night. hotels), Indonesia (around 30) and Morocco (around 30). More surprisingly, they are also located in the South of France, due to the Tracking water use high population density and limited water supply, and in Australia, due to wide disparity in water resources and their limited availability. 2013 When this geographic water risk analysis is compared with hotel 309 water use data, it appears that the most critical regions are located in Europe and Asia-Paciﬁc. 296  294 while hotels in Europe are generally water-efﬁcient, the region is home to nearly 500 hotels deemed to be in a high or extremely high water-stressed situation. As such, it deserves special attention; 274  270 in Asia-Paciﬁc, there are fewer hotels in critical regions (around 270, of which nearly 70 in China), but more attention is being 259 paid to improving water use ratios, which still offer potential for optimization;  the study also revealed that in coming years, hotels in Australia 25 17 25 17 32 17 will be particularly confronted with rising water stress levels, which is something else that deserves special attention. 2011 2012 In all, projected near-term trends in water-stressed regions indicate In millions of cubic meters that 4% of Accor hotels will face a drastic shift in their available water supplies by 2025. • Total water use This new vision, supported by current and projected data, will now • Total water use at comparable scope of reporting In liters per guest enable Accor to focus its water use reduction action plans on the regions at risk.

These trends conﬁrm the validity of the various actions undertaken to reduce hotel water use. Some of these were led by Charter 21, which recommends a panoply of measures to reduce the amount of water used in hotel operations, such as recovering rain water, using sub-meters to improve monitoring and equipping showerheads and faucets with ﬂow regulators. (1) Excluding Motel 6. 76 Registration Document 2013 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Environmental commitments 2 The following chart presents the percentage of hotels implementing these measures in 2012 and 2013. 7% Recycle grey water 7% 6% Recover rainwater for gardens and toilets 7% 77% Practice sustainable grounds watering 80% 49% Use a water-efficient laundry service 59% 54% Use dual flush toilets 59% 26% Use motion sensors for bathroom faucets 29% 68% Prohibit the use of cooling towers without water recovery systems 73% 30% Use sub-meters to improve monitoring 34% 93% Use flow regulators on faucets/showerheads 96% • 2012 • 2013 2012 2013 Number of applicable hotels 3,331 3,401 Response rate 92% 92% Discharges and treatment Accor is able to act directly on the second source, based on the principle that all hotel wastewater efﬂuent should be systematically Treating hotel efﬂuent treated in an appropriate treatment plant, either on-site or in the local community.

INDEPENDENT VERIFIER’S REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE MANAGEMENT REPORT This is a free translation into English of the original report issued in the French language and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France. To the shareholders, In our quality as an independent veriﬁer of which the admissibility of the application for accreditation has been accepted by the COFRAC, under the number n° 3-1050, and as a member of the network of one of the statutory auditors of the company Accor, we present our report on the consolidated social, environmental and societal information established for the year ended on the 31 December 2013, presented in chapter 2 of the management report, hereafter referred to as the “CSR Information,” pursuant to the provisions of the article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to establish a management report including CSR Information referred to in the article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), in accordance with the protocols used by the company, composed of social reporting protocols, sustainable procurement reporting explanation sheets, Guidelines for the Charter 21 actions and sustainable development reporting protocol in their updated versions of 2013 (hereafter referred to as the “Criteria”), and of which a summary is included in the paragraph “Methodological review” of the chapter 2.8 of the management report. INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL Our independence is deﬁned by regulatory requirements, the Code of Ethics of our profession as well as the provisions in the article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). In addition, we have implemented a quality control system, including documented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with ethical standards, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDEPENDENT VERIFIER It is our role, based on our work:  to attest whether the required CSR Information is present in the management report or, in the case of its omission, that an appropriate explanation has been provided, in accordance with the third paragraph of R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) (Attestation of presence of CSR Information);  to express a limited assurance conclusion, that the CSR Information, overall, is fairly presented, in all material aspects, in according with the Criteria (Limited assurance on CSR Information). Our veriﬁcation work was undertaken by a team of seven people between October 2013 and March 2014 for an estimated duration of twelve weeks. We conducted the work described below in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France and the Order of 13 May 2013 determining the conditions under which an independent third-party veriﬁer conducts its mission, and in relation to the opinion of fairness and the reasonable assurance report, in accordance with the international standard ISAE 3000(1). (1) ISAE 3000 – Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical information 94 Registration Document 2013 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Independent verifier’s report information 2 1. Attestation of presence of CSR Information We obtained an understanding of the company’s CSR issues, based on interviews with the management of relevant departments, a presentation of the company’s strategy on sustainable development based on the social and environmental consequences linked to the activities of the company and its societal commitments, as well as, where appropriate, resulting actions or programmes. We have compared the information presented in the management report with the list as provided for in the Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). In the absence of certain consolidated information, we have veriﬁed that the explanations were provided in accordance with the provisions in Article R. 225-105-1, paragraph 3, of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). We veriﬁed that the CSR information covers the consolidated perimeter, namely the entity and its subsidiaries, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L.233-1 and the entities which it controls, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L.233-3 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) with the limitations speciﬁed in the “Methodological review” in chapter 2.8 of the management report, notably regarding the absence of publication of severity rate, absence justiﬁed by Accor in chapter 2.5.4 of the present management report. Based on this work, and given the limitations mentioned above, we conﬁrm the presence in the management report of the required CSR information. 2. Limited assurance on CSR Information Nature and scope of the work We undertook about twenty interviews with the people responsible for the preparation of the CSR Information in the different departments(2) in charge of the data collection process and, if applicable, the people responsible for internal control processes and risk management, in order to:  Assess the suitability of the Criteria for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability, taking into consideration, if relevant, industry standards.  Verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the CSR Information. We determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information, in relation to the characteristics of the Company, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development. For the CSR Information which we considered the most important(3):  At the level of the consolidated entity, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organisation, policies, actions, etc.), we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and veriﬁed, on a test basis, the calculations and the compilation of the information, and also veriﬁed their coherence and consistency with the other information presented in the management report;  At the level of the representative selection of entities that we selected(4), based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests on the basis of samples, consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation. The sample selected therefore represented on average 25% of the total workforce, between 12% and 27% of the quantitative environmental information and 23% of hotels for sustainable procurement. (2) Sustainable Development department, Human Resources department, Group Procurement department, Design & Technical Services Corporate (3) Environmental and societal information: approaches to environmental evaluation and certiﬁcation, water consumption and water supply considering local constraints, raw material consumption and measures undertaken to enhance resource efﬁciency, energy consumption, measures undertaken to improve energy efﬁciency, greenhouse gas discharges, territorial impact, economic and social (employment, regional development, impact on regional and local populations), importance of subcontracting and the consideration of environmental and social issues in purchasing policies and relations with suppliers and subcontractors, measures undertaken in favour of consumers’ health and safety. Social information: employment (total headcount and breakdown per gender, age, geographical area, hiring and terminations, organisation of working time, absenteeism, work accidents, notably their frequency and their severity, as well as occupational diseases, training policies, number of days of training, measures undertaken for gender equality, anti-discrimination policies and actions. (4) Social: the Netherlands, Australia, New-Zealand, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru Environment: for water and energy consumptions: France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Australia, Brazil; for other environmental indicators: the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Australia, New-Zealand, Poland. Societal: for sustainable sourcing: the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Australia, Brazil and United-Kingdom. Registration Document 2013 95 2 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Independent verifier’s report information For the other consolidated CSR information, we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the company. Finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided, if appropriate, in the partial or total absence of certain information. We consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to express a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive veriﬁcation work. Due to the necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the risk of non-detection of a signiﬁcant anomaly in the CSR Information cannot be entirely eliminated. Qualiﬁcation expressed Indicators “Average number of days of medical leave per employee over the year” and “Average number of days of unauthorized leave per employee over the year” are underestimated outside Europe because of national regulations inducing different interpretations of the Criteria in these countries. Conclusion Based on our work, and under this qualiﬁcation, we have not identiﬁed any signiﬁcant misstatement that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken together, has not been fairly presented, in compliance with the Criteria. Observations Without qualifying our conclusion above, we draw your attention to the following points:  Information’s consolidation perimeter goes beyond regulatory requirements. It is a more complete perimeter than the ﬁnancial one because it covers all subsidiaries and managed hotels. It can sometimes integrate franchised hotels for some indicators as mentioned in chapter “methodological review” of the present report.  Except for water and energy consumptions indicators, internal controls conducted at country/area level can turn out to be limited in some cases, notably for a part of the Charter 21 actions and for some HR indicators.  Regarding sustainable procurement, a work to deﬁne indicators has been undertaken in 2013. Nevertheless, some of them are still misunderstood by contributors.  The “number of employees having attended at least one training course” could present a risk of over-estimation because of disparity in monitoring tools between countries.
