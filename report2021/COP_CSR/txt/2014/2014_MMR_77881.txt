We work in full compliance with the labour laws and regulations in the area that we operate in.

This leads us to adopt and operate a human resource strategy that goes beyond the national regulations. We do not forbid the creation and the commitment to any trade union, and recognize the right to collective bargaining as long as it is done in accordance with the law. The principles of non-­‐discrimination, no forced labour, no child labour (under 18 years old) are highly respected by Shwe Taung Group.

W e recognize the importance of the respect of the environment and feel concerned about the environmental issues. We understand the complexity of the climate change challenges and the fact that government actions alone cannot provide the urgent solutions required. For this reason, we are committed to participate to the necessary global effort. We are committed to identify opportunities in managing our activities to deliver long term benefits to our stakeholders while responding to climate change risks. We wholly support and comply with or exceed the requirements of current local environmental legislation and code of practice. We understand that the respect of the environment can have immediate impact by daily improving people’s quality of life and can therefore be included to our customer care principles. We are committed to sustainably reduce our environmental impact and continually improving our environmental performance as an integral and fundamental part of our business strategy and operating methods. We recognize the importance of settling policies on a long term, sustainable basis. We are committed to participate to the development of green technologies and renewable resources. We understand that our engagement can also serve our interests, as energy and climate risks can directly impact our own operations, whether because of rising resources prices, operation costs, and legislative changes... Our commitment also makes particular sense in an area like Myanmar where the access to natural resources and energies are still limited. We see this particularity as a great opportunity to develop green technologies and environmental-­‐friendly practices. Our mission is to be an environmentally responsible organization. We aim to raise awareness amongst our staff, our stakeholder and our overall public. We are aiming to align with the international standards (such as ISO 14001:2004) for environmental management systems and to refer notably to the UN Global Compact assessment principles and the Global Reporting Initiative to set up our environmental policy.

We prefer LED lights compared to conven^onal lights, hand dryers to ^ssues, digital communica^on to paper communica^on . We turn oﬀ all electronic devices when no one is using them and have a no air condi^oning policy once a week for an hour. When paper is needed, we use eco label cer^ﬁed paper products (such as FSC, SFI, PEFC). We try to use as much as possible the environment-­‐friendly technologies available. We are dedicated to pursue a strategy of con^nuous improvement by keeping updated on the new green technologies available. Batching / M ixer plants can deliver high quality pre-­‐mix concrete, but they are usually located out o f city area and distance away from point of use due to the large plant space, storage space for raw materials and nuisance created to the surrounding. Transporta^on eﬃciency and methodology of pre-­‐mix are therefore major considera^ons in construc^on projects for r educing overall embodied energy of concrete. Concrete is batched as near to the place of u se as possible for quality assurance, minimizing the transporta^on ^me and thus amount of addi^ves and retarders. Our subsidiaries GRCE and HTCT are using on-­‐site batching plant in all major developments to reduce embodied energy during the construc^on stage. For our all major real estate and hydropower projects and developments, we conduct an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report in a logic of precau^onary approach as part of the feasibility phase. These reports are produced by interna^onal consultants. The EIA Solar Street Lamps are used in our focuses on iden^fying environmental threats or opportuni^es related to the site and its factories at Shwe Pyi Thar Township, surroundings, covering areas such as air quality, noise, biodiversity, connec^vity, heritage Tharkayta Township and Thingangune and resources.

PLANT T REES F OR A G REENER C OUNTRY After 12 years, the trees planted along the Yangon-­‐Mandalay highway have enhanced the urban forest. Trees were planted along the road as part of the landscaping to protect nearby wooded areas and added landscaping for a safer, more comfortable driving. Current objectives include the prevention of global warming, the preservation of wildlife habitats and the protection of ecosystems. These activities are now valuable for drivers and local residents alike. DEVELOP I NFRASTRUCTURE F OR A G REENER C ITY Traffic congestion results in economic loss by impeding drivers and decreasing the travel-­‐time reliability. In addition, the lower driving speeds and repeated stops and starts during the congestion increase automobile emissions that include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and suspended particulate matter (SPM). In April 2013, 0.76 km of Hledan Junction Flyover was opened to traffic. This flyover provides the solution to traffic congestion and environmental deterioration in city areas. The photos below show the change in congestion at the Hledan Junction before and after the opening of the Hledan flyover. The congestion that used to occur during the morning and evening peak hours have been substantially reduced. Equally, all our major future developments have been designed to propose innovative and eco-­‐friendly solutions participating to the responsible urbanization of the city.
