Pfizer Corporation Austria UN Global Compact Communication on Progress UN Global Compact Communication On Progress Company Name Pfizer Corporation Austria Gesellschaft m.b.H. Address Floridsdorfer Hauptstrasse 1, 1210 Wien Country Austria Membership date 2009/04/14 Number of employees 250 Contact name Robin Rumler Contact Position CEO Sector Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology Date 2014/07/17 Brief description of nature of business Pfizer Corporation Austria is the Austrian branch of Pfizer Inc., one of the world’s leading supplier of innovative medicines in the field of human medicine. The Pfizer branch in Vienna was opened in 1956. Pfizer Austria has been able to steadily expand its market position in recent years and, since 2003, has occupied a leading position in the prescription pharmacy market. More than 100 Pfizer products are available on the Austrian market. Our portfolio includes medicines and vaccines as well as many of the world‘s bestknown consumer health care products. In January 2009 Robin Rumler took over the management of Pfizer Austria. He is also Director of the Business Unit “Global Innovative Pharma”. There are currently 250 employees working for Pfizer Austria. Since the beginning of 2005, Pfizer Austria has been domiciled at Floridotower, in the 21st district of Vienna. Statement of support Ladies and Gentlemen, We have made it our responsibility to make a significant contribution to a healthier world with our business activities. We accomplish this by conducting intensive research with the goal of developing new, innovative therapies for illnesses such as rheumatism, cancer and pain. But we also act responsibly and take accountability to our stakeholders, such as our employees, customers and business partners very seriously. Not only on a global level, but also here in Austria our actions and activities are governed by the principles of UN Global Compact, with Pfizer Inc. being a founding member and with Pfizer Austria having become a member of its own in 2009. With that we commit ourselves to implement the principles and objectives of the UN Global Compact in our business strategies and day-to-day operations on a long-term basis and to report on our progress. It fills me with pride to see what we have already accomplished in recent years. For instance, we have been honored as a family-friendly employer since 2008 and have been able to steadily increase our company‘s social investment. We have created more transparency by publishing our donations to patient organizations and were able to promote discussions of healthy and active aging. At the same time, our employees are committed to social activities. On a local basis, we have established long-term partnerships with Caritas and the Austrian Youth Red Cross. But we also contribute to a livable environment: for instance, we have significantly reduced the CO2 emissions of our corporate fleet and promote the use of public transportation with targeted subsidies. I am personally convinced that what makes us successful as a company is exactly this in the end: The combination of innovative strength and responsible actions. Therefore, I assure you that we will continue to pursue this direction in the future. We have already set ourselves ambitious goals for the near future. For instance the relocation of our central drug warehouse from Germany to Austria in order to shorten transport routes. Or the reinforcement of compliance and transparency through disclosures according to the Pharmig Code of Conduct. In July 2014 we published the third Pfizer Austria sustainability report based on the recognized guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative. With that we are one of the pioneers in the pharmaceutical industry in respect to CSR-reporting in Austria. The following pages are an excerpt of the report and all pages mentioned in this COP relate to the report. Sincerely yours, Prof. Dr. Robin Rumler Executive Director Pfizer Austria Vienna 2014 The 10 Principles – Our Progress The UN Global Compact was agreed in 2000 and obliges its member organizations to act in a socially responsible way within their area of influence. It is based on 10 ethical principles that deal with the topics of human rights, working standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption. Members are obliged to publish an annual progress report (Communication on Progress – COP) concerning the implementation of the ethical principles. You can find further information about the UN Global Compact at www.unglobalcompact.org. Pfizer Austria signed the UN Global Compact in April 2009. The following Communication on Progress table highlights the systems and measures that Pfizer Austria is using to integrate the 10 principles into its business activity.
