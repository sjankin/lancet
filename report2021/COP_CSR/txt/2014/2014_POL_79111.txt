Responsible Energy 7 Introduction Letter from the President of the Management Board Ladies and Gentlemen, On behalf of the Management Board of Polskie Górnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo, I am pleased to welcome you to our 2012 Corporate Social Responsibility Report. While we aim to always deliver sound financial performance, we are equally committed to pursuing the objectives of our Sustainable Development and R e s p o n s i b l e B u s i n e s s S t r a t e g y. I p a r t i c u l a r l y e n c o u r a g e you to read the sections of this Report which look at our dialogue with local communities on the issue of shale gas. Recent months have shown with renewed clarity how important this is, and how much attention is being paid to it by all parties concerned, including the government, public authorities and licence holders. Compared with the EU average, in Poland there is PGNiG has approached the task of engaging in dialogue significant room for growth in demand for electricwith its local communities (from communication to ity and for greater use of natural gas as power education to cooperation) in a truly responsible and generation fuel, particularly in high-efficiency t h o r o u g h w a y, s e t t i n g u p a d e d i c a t e d t e a m t o h a n d l e co-generation. So with a view to diversifying our the task with a wide array of tools, as described in future revenue sources, in 2012 we were active detail further in the Report. in adding electricity to our product portfolio. Our move into the power generation segment and involvement in the construction of new CCGT projects in Poland will enable the Group to attain that goal, and meet the expected market demand. In 2012, we again reviewed and assessed the Despite the downturn caused by the global crisis, PGNiG’s own generation capacity will also facilitate objectives set out in the Company’s strategy for the prospects for natural gas remain bright. We see its entry into the electricity trading market with 2011–2015.

Group’s production potential. 8 PGNiG Faced with the ever-changing environment of the energy and gas markets, impending market deregulation and the growing burden of new regulatory requirements (including the legal obligation to sell gas through the commodity exchange), there is still much for the Group to do to continue as a competitive player in the marketplace. These changes will affect management of both the wholesale gas portfolio and the retail sales structure. But we will strive to further expand our offering for the customers and to enhance our sales resources by leveraging the economies of scale inherent in our operations, the existing customer relationships, and the new opportunities offered by the power generation segment. We are very satisfied with the results of this past In 2012, we also embarked on the reorganisayear.

The existence of such demand was indicated not only by the results of surveys carried out among the workshop participants, but also by the experience of the PGNiG representatives working in the local information points which the Company opened as early as in June and July in selected communes of the Gdańsk Province (including in Krokowa, Gniewino, and Liniewo). PGNiG will be organising the next series of workshops and open meetings with residents of the areas where exploration work is being or will be conducted. The workshop participants also received information brochures. 46 PGNiG PGNiG in 12 Blue Gas Programme projects As the Leader of the Polish Technologies for Shale Gas Consortium, Polskie Górnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA submitted to the National Centre for Research and Development 12 applications as part of the Blue Gas Programme competition, for a total budget amount of approximately PLN 219m.

PGNiG Group companies draw water from their own groundwater intake points, or directly from the mains. This water is used for social needs and for industrial processes. Changes in water consumption that are observable from year to year are explainable primarily by the amount of process water used (i.e. the number of exploration and investment projects executed). In 2012, mains water consumption decreased from 508.14 thousand cubic metres to 331.51 thousand cubic metres, while water intake from the company wells slightly increased (see Figure 6).

Lacking a transplant ward, the pre-war building with its narrow halls and overall poor condition, hardly offers a safe environment for little patients whose natural immunity has been significantly impaired due to illness and treatment. For that reason, the Foundation has devoted the last two years to helping the Wrocław Medical University build a new oncology clinic, the ‘Cape of Hope’, which will provide comprehensive world-class diagnostics and treatment, substantially improving the children’s chances of making a full and speedy recovery. All year round, the Division develops financial solutions for the Foundation and supports all initiatives aimed at helping the Foundation. 64 PGNiG ‘Pre-schooler’s Safety Academy’ project – Greater Poland Trading Division The main purpose of the Pre-schooler’s Safety Academy is to educate pre-school children about road safety and other related issues.

Local community members are mostly interested in the impact of the investments on their everyday life. Inhabitants want to know when and where the operations will be carried out, what nuisance they will experience, whether they will be expropriated, whether the price offered for their land will be attractive, and most of all whether Commune Consultation Councils Support for local initiatives the investment is safe for the environment.

The Commune Consultation Councils will serve as an official platform for continuous dialogue between local communities and PGNiG, making it possible to consult important issues relating to exploration for gas from unconventional sources. The purpose of such councils is to communicate reliably the concerns, needs and expectations of the local community to PGNiG, creatively and proactively seek constructive solutions For our most recent shale gas that are satisfactory to all parties, and to provide developments see reliable reports on the Company’s activities. polishshalegas.pl Responsible Energy 73 GRI indicators 74 PGNiG PGNiG’s ‘Responsible Energy 2012’ report was prepared primarily on the basis of the reporting indicators of the Global Reporting Initiative.
